			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Survey of Cardiff Bay and the Barrage (7): Catching the world's eye - Marketing: A campaign that may run for 20 years THE MARKETING of the Cardiff Bay development project is not simply about letting people know that it exists. It is also about trying to form connections with potential investors from across the world and about informing them precisely what the development has to offer. Michael Boyce, chief executive of the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation (CBDC), is reluctant to discuss precisely how much has been spent on marketing the project, but the corporation's former advertising agency, Travis Dale, says that the account was worth Pounds 500,000 in 1992. Once parliamentary approval has been obtained, the project will shift gear and the marketing effort will increase substantially. A gala occasion at the Mermaid Theatre, in London, on May 18 - originally planned to co-incide with the much-delayed securing of Parliamentary approval - is reputed to have cost Pounds 200,000, and was designed to support the second stage message that Cardiff Bay is now 'open for business'. Held in the presence of Princess Diana, the event featured music from Verdi, Bizet, and Gershwin, sung by stars from Welsh National Opera, and a new orchestral piece, the Cardiff Bay Overture, specially commissioned from Welsh composer Gareth Wood - set against an audio-visual backdrop of Cardiff and the bay area. The hard sell came in the form of speeches from Michael Boyce himself, Sir Geoffrey Inkin, chairman of the CBDC, and the then Welsh Secretary, David Hunt; the soft sell in the form of on-screen messages from former prime minister, Lord Callaghan of Cardiff, who represented the area now covered by the scheme in the House of Commons for more than 40 years, and Oscar-winning Welsh actor, Sir Anthony Hopkins who trained in the city. The Mermaid Theatre gala was not, however, just a cultural event, addressing itself to London's political and opinion-forming classes - and, it has to be said, to a good number of visitors from the Principality itself. Cardiff Bay's marketing people, Edelman PR Worldwide in London and Quadrant Public Relations in Cardiff, had made sure that representatives from 14 countries in Europe, north America and the Far East not only attended but were given a precisely documented list of business possibilities which the bay can offer. Duncan Syme, Cardiff Bay's commercial and marketing director says: 'We can't sell Cardiff Bay in isolation. We have had to try to lift the awareness of Cardiff in the property and business world generally. The first three years of our marketing activity have sought to generate that awareness, promoting the big idea of the transformation of dereliction into a range of development sites. We are now moving into more specific marketing campaigns to get inward investment but it is a campaign which will run over 15 to 20 years.' Peter Miller, of the consultancy, Business Development Group, which has been responsible for the marketing strategy for the project, says that the problem has always been how to market something that has not previously existed. 'The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation has a much broader remit than simple property development. In the UK the majority of development projects are about refurbishment but Cardiff Bay is not about rescuing derelict buildings. It is about the re-orientation of a city, bringing Cardiff into the first division of international cities. The city, which currently faces inward, will be turned around so that it has a waterfront.' The initial phase of the marketing campaign has been constrained in two ways, says Miller. 'The essential infrastructure work has had to be done first. There has been a very lengthy period of land acquisition, and public consultation. The other constraint has been that the scheme involved the building of a barrage, which in turn needed a parliamentary bill. That also has taken time. While those two constraints were with us, the marketing was stuck in a warm-up phase. We now feel we are at a watershed, ready to move into a new phase. We have moved from an awareness campaign to one which says we are now open for business.' The corporation ran an 18-month advertising campaign from 1991, and another has just started, using a set of 'visionaries from the past' (such as Pythagoras) to comment on the project. These ads will run in the press, particularly business publications. 'As the campaign evolves you will see more closely-targeted advertising, aimed at the industrial, property, leisure and tourism markets,' says Miller. Michael Boyce says that one of the most important aspects of the project is its international marketing, which will attempt to make the world understand that the project matches any other of the same kind. 'We are re-developing a sixth of the city, and we will never know when it is finished. It will be a continuing process, but there will be milestones along the way.' To draw that international attention, Boyce is looking ahead over the next three years. 'We have had a link, for almost a decade now, with the metropolitan area of Baltimore - on the east coast of the US - which was the inspiration and model for Cardiff Bay. The local county councils, universities, and chambers of commerce, on both sides of the Atlantic have built links to help each other's developments, not least by pointing business people in each other's directions. That is much more effective, we think, than trying to target the whole of north America, where we have no chance at all of making an impact.' Boyce is planning to develop the same kind of links with Sydney, Australia - in New South Wales, named by its discoverers after the old south Wales because of the similarity in shape fo the coastline. 'Cardiff, with the bay development, will be part of a newer South Wales, so there is an immediate historical and emotional link. We will be trying to persuade the Australians, who might normally think of investing in the Pacific region, to consider Cardiff Bay.' Norway also has longstanding maritime links with Cardiff, evident in the newly-retored Norwegian church recently moved to a new site in the docks area. Roald Dahl, the author, was brought up in the city, his Norwegian father having established a ship-broking business there, while another brother went to La Rochelle. As a result, Norway too is on Boyce's list. 'Like the US and the Far East, what a nonsense it would be if we sought to market ourselves to the whole of Europe. In each of the areas we select, we will, of course, target particularly relevant industries. That is our thrust for the next three years.'</p>

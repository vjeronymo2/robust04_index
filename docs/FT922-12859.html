			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Monaco (1): Royal legacy lingers on - Although the grand old days when Europe's aristocracy whiled away their summers at the Hotel de Paris are over, Monaco is still one of the most expensive and exclusive resorts, says Alice Rawsthorn who wrote this survey. The principality must now face the challenges of a unified European market after 1992 IT was back in the mid-19th century that the seeds of modern Monaco were sown. The French riviera was flourishing as the wealthy citizens of Paris and Lyons tumbled off trains into the sunny towns of Nice and Cannes, but Monaco was still a poverty-stricken principality of straggling orchards and olive groves. That was before Prince Charles III, heir to the throne, realised that gambling, then illegal in France, could coax visitors away from Nice and Cannes to Monaco. He was right. By the end of the 19th century his principality was prospering and Monte-Carlo, an old olive grove hastily renamed in his honour, had become the smartest spot on the Mediterranean as the old and new wealth of Europe congregated in its luxury hotels - and, of course, the casino. From a modern perspective, the legacy of Prince Charles has been both a boon and a bane to Monaco - a boon because of the prosperity he created and a bane because of the sleazy aura of that early era of legalised gambling. His successors, and their subjects, have since been struggling to strike a balance between the two. This conflict has come to a head most poignantly under the present sovereign, Prince Rainier, who since 1946 has been responsible for the government of Monaco and for forging placable relations with its powerful neighbour, France. It has been said so often that Prince Rainier has saved Monaco that it almost seems a cliche to repeat it, but any analysis of the principality's post-war development suggests that it is true. When Rainier took the throne at the age of 26 in 1949, Monaco was little more than a playboy's playground for the seedier sort of sybarites that converged on the Cote D'Azur each summer. Worse still, it was in dire danger of falling prey to the darker elements of the Mediterranean underworld from Nice and Marseilles. A glance at the latterday front pages of Nice-Matin, which covers the adventures and misadventures of neighbouring Provence, spells out the risks. Day after day the paper is packed with horror stories of heroin hauls, cocaine busts and particularly messy Mafia-style murders. Somehow Prince Rainier had to spruce up Monaco's image to attract respectably wealthy residents and visitors, thereby creating long-term employment and business opportunities for the indigenous Monegasques to prevent them emigrating to the US and Europe. For the most part he has succeeded. Monaco, with its pretty villas and belle epoque apartment blocks, is the home of a number of prominent expatriates - among them Mr Karl Lagerfeld, the pony-tailed fashion designer behind Chanel, Mr Bob Beckman, who made his millions predicting doom and gloom on the world stock markets, and Mr Boris Becker, the Teutonic tennis star. Although the grand old days when Europe's aristocracy whiled away their summers at the Hotel de Paris are over, Monaco is still one of the most expensive and exclusive resorts on the Mediterranean. Moreover, the Monegasques have stayed. Monaco has been spared the same waves of emigration of other tiny European states such as San Marino which, until recently, has seen its indigenous population drift off to look for jobs in other countries. The Monegasques represent nearly 4,500 of the principality's 27,000 or so inhabitants. They tend to stay in Monaco for secondary education but leave for France to go to college or university. They almost always return to work in their native state. The Monegasques are entitled to have special housing subsidies, although this does not fully compensate for the difficulty of finding affordable apartments in a property market where prices are inflated by the influx of wealthy expatriates. Similarly, although the price of a Hermes bag or a Chanel suit is the same in Monte Carlo as in Cannes or Genova, the cost of everyday items such as food and household goods is extremely high. The basse and moyenne corniches out of Monaco are crammed with the cars of the Monegasques, and even of the rich residents, on their weekly shopping trips to cheaper supermarkets over the borders into both France and Italy. Prince Rainier has also insisted on preferential employment for the indigenous population. They have guaranteed jobs in government service. All Monaco companies have to offer jobs first to the Monegasques, then to local residents, and then to the inhabitants of the four neighbouring French communes before looking further afield. Local employers complain that these privileges have pampered the Monegasques, making them lazy and complacent. But the Monegasques are a charming people. Their friendly demeanour and laid-back ways undoubtedly add to Monaco's appeal, giving it a special ambience that stops it becoming yet another glitzy tourist resort. But Prince Rainier's biggest achievement has been to stimulate the local economy by creating two thriving industries in banking and tourism. The principality's banks have prospered by using its tax advantages (for everyone except French citizens) to turn Monaco into a deposit centre for wealthy private clients. For the past five years, since the French government abolished exchange controls, the banking industry has boomed. There are now nearly 40 banks in the principality, double the number of 10 years ago. The value of deposits lodged in their vaults rose by 20 to 25 per cent a year in the late 1980s and even increased by a little less than 20 per cent to around Dollars 10bn in 1991, a grim year for most areas of international banking. There are some clouds on the horizon. As the local banks are well aware, the same light level of regulation that attracts their rich depositors also runs the risk of bringing in less salubrious customers whose activities, if they attracted the attention of the French or Monegasque authorities, could herald more rigorous regulation. The collapse of Banque Industrielle de Monaco (BIM) in 1990, accompanied by the suicide of one executive and the arrest of another, fulfilled their worst fears. The authorities are now reforming some aspects of banking regulation although there have been no serious scandals since the BIM debacle. The local tourist industry is buoyant too. For years, Monaco basked in the allure of the fairytale romance between Prince Rainier and his wife, Grace Kelly, the Hitchcock blonde and Hollywood star. Since Princess Grace's death in 1982, the gossip columnists have turned their attention to her children - Caroline, Albert and the wayward Stephanie  - whom they pursue with equal enthusiasm, ensuring that the Monegasque royal family is never far from the headlines. Monaco, with its sunny climate and the luxury yachts glistening in its harbour, now attracts 3.5m visitors a year. Most are day trippers who come to admire the Garnier grandeur of the casino, to check on their deposits at the local banks, or to watch the changing of the guard at Prince Rainier's pink palace. But the principality still attracts about 240,000 overnight visitors and is now expanding its conference and exhibition activities to enhance its appeal to the burgeoning business travel market. Prince Rainier has endeavoured to broaden the base of the local economy, notably with the Fontvieille development of 22 hectares of reclaimed land to the west of the old town, which is now a centre for light industry and low-cost housing. This initiative will continue, according to Mr Jean Pastorelli, government counsellor for finance, with new land reclamation and development projects to further expand the economy into the next century. In the meantime, Monaco faces the more immediate challenge of the implications of the unified market in Europe after 1992. The most pressing issue is the forthcoming reduction in the rate of value-added tax in France, probably from an average of 18.6 to 17.5 per cent. Monaco will be forced to follow suit - given that its rates are linked to those of France - creating a shortfall in state revenue. Mr Pastorelli is confident that this will be countered by a corresponding increase in consumer spending. The unified market would only pose a serious threat to Monaco if, in the longer term, it affected its fiscal status. The biggest problem would be if Monaco lost its tax advantages over other European Community countries, so that their citizens, like the French, could no longer avoid paying tax on deposits in the principality. If that happened there would be a run on the banks, foreign residents would flee, property prices - and the local economy  - would collapse. Such an apocalyptic prospect seems remote, at best. For the foreseeable future, Monaco seems set to carry on basking in the sunshine and to tussle with the legacy of Charles III, its visionary prince.</p>

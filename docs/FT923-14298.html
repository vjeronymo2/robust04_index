			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on tube link to Docklands AN ALL-PARTY group of MPs voiced its anxiety yesterday that the government may be close to abandoning the planned extension of the Jubilee underground rail line to London's Docklands. Their concern - set out in a Commons early day motion - came as ministers reacted positively but cautiously to the suggestion that the government might buy outright one of the buildings at the Canary Wharf development. The government has told the administrators of Canary Wharf that it is ready to study a scheme under which it would buy one of office blocks at the Docklands site. The money would then be repaid by the administrators to the Treasury as the private-sector contribution to the Jubilee Line extension, which was agreed before the development's owners - the Canadian company Olympia &amp; York - went into administration at the end of May. It is understood that the administrators have told the government that they would need to raise Pounds 170m from an outright sale - a figure that equates to the present-day value of the phased Pounds 400m payment promised by Olympia &amp; York for the rail link. Such a deal would have a number of attractions, but some ministers believe that, on a realistic calculation of property values in the area, the government would have to secure up to 800,000 sq ft of space to justify paying Pounds 170m. That represents twice the amount of space the government would need for its proposed transfer to Docklands of civil servants from the Department of the Environment and some other Whitehall departments. The signatories of yesterday's motion, who include Mr Paul Channon, the former transport secretary, said that the Jubilee Line extension was 'vitally important to the competitiveness of London' and 'critical' to the success of Docklands. London's RiverBus, the Thames passenger service recently given a three-month reprieve from closure, is to make an additional stop at Greenland Pier in Surrey Docks on weekdays in response to passenger demand.</p>

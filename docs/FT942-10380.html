			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Stoy Hayward faces two probes Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm, yesterday said it was to be the subject of two high-profile professional investigations for its roles as auditor to both Astra Holdings and Polly Peck International, Andrew Jack writes. The details came after a day of confusion in which the joint disciplinary scheme, the accountancy profession's senior regulatory body, delayed making an official announcement. Polly Peck, the conglomerate which entered administration in October 1990, was controlled by Mr Asil Nadir, who fled to northern Cyprus while facing charges of false accounting and theft involving Pounds 34m. Astra Holdings, which was the subject of a highly critical and long-delayed Department of Trade and Industry inspectors' report published last June, was a munitions company connected to the Iraqi supergun affair. It is now in receivership. Stoy Hayward was the principal auditor to both companies, although Polly Peck's Cyprus subsidiaries were audited by Erdal &amp; Co, a local firm, and other accounting services to the group and Mr Nadir were provided by Coopers &amp; Lybrand. A joint disciplinary scheme inquiry may focus on any chartered accountants or accountancy firms associated with the companies under investigation, including board members. Stoy said it had been informed that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales had referred both cases to the scheme. The scheme said it was delaying an announcement as a result of 'representations' after publicity concerning the Polly Peck investigation. Mr Adrian Martin, Stoy's managing partner, said his firm had made no such representations and he welcomed an independent review. He added: 'For a regulatory system to be fair, it has to be open, consistently applied and timely. This has not been the case.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Bazyl Lipszyc: "Aleksander Kwasniewski's </F> Conference; This Is Not a Problem of Kawalec"]    [Text] The Thursday [3 February] meeting with Aleksander  Kwasniewski has attracted the greatest number of journalists  (and deputies) in many months. The leader of the Democratic  Left Alliance [SLD] said that the problem does not mainly  concern all personnel issues, but the understanding of the  government's activities, the method of administering the  country, and discussion over the concept of the economy. "It is  serious," admitted Kwasniewski and indirectly confirmed that  Marek Borowski discussed the possibility of handing in his  resignation ("he is an obstinate man"). However, he was of the  opinion that he would be able to get everything cleared up  during his "meeting of three" with Waldemar Pawlak and Marek  Borowski, scheduled for Thursday [3 February] evening.    "The entire affair is unfortunate, and it was done in the  wrong manner, but today conclusions must be drawn from it," said  the SLD leader. "It is not a problem of resignation, which only  expedited the difficult talks within the coalition, but a  problem of the continuation of the economic policy, which is put  under question by statements such as those made by Minister  Podkanski on the agreement with General Motors." Kwasniewski  refused to answer the question of what he would do if he did not  manage to reach agreement. He merely added that Borowski is a  very competent and valuable politician and that the main problem  of the coalition should be the budget (which should take the  economic realities into account) and not disputes over the  cadres. Asked about the resignation of Under Secretary Miroslaw  Stec from the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], he said  that the SLD expects URM to submit a concept for the state  administration and that this will also be discussed in the talks  with the prime minister.    "It is a difficult coalition, and I have never concealed  this; however, there is no alternative to it. Therefore, we  must act in such a way as to allow the government to act  efficiently," said Aleksander Kwasniewski.    Deputies of the Polish Peasant Party (such as Tadeusz Sytek  and Piotr Chojnacki) believe that the prime minister did what he  should have done and that he does not have to explain his  decision to anyone. Jerzy Pistelok told us that this issue is  not of very great importance; it had been discussed in the  Presidium of the government before, and Minister Borowski should  have demanded that resignation himself. Becaise he did not do  this, the prime minister had the right to recall the deputy  minister because he had made too many mistakes. "We are  absolutely sure that the prime minister's decision was correct,  and so are many colleagues in the SLD," said Pistelok.    Jozef Oleksy and Aleksander Kwasniewski denied that there  were such discussions because this issue was not important  enough to discuss in the coalition.    "I believe that Prime Minister Pawlak feels good when he  makes cadre changes," we learned from former Prime Minister  Hanna Suchocka, of the Democratic Union [UD]. "He probably  thinks that this is how his power is expressed. The prime  minister may recall a deputy minister without the consent of the  minister, but only when he asks that the deputy minister be  recalled and the minister does not want to do that. This  coalition has the will to survive, and this is why it will not  present the PSL with the bill."    "The SLD will not present the bill to the PSL for fear of  the  coalition's integrity; however, it will show that something  important has happened," says UD's Grazyna Staniszewska. "The  reason the prime minister has acted this way is that the PSL has  an SLD complex; another reason was the pressure on Waldemar  Pawlak, exerted at various levels, to prepare posts for people  who are already waiting for them."    "This is a family quarrel, and we will not meddle in it,"  said Wojciech Borowik, of Union of Labor. "If a bill is  presented, it will not be very large because both parties want  the coalition to survive."</p>

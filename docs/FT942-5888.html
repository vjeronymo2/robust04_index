			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Zurich Insurance joins the direct sales movement Zurich Insurance, one of Europe's largest insurance companies, is to launch a telephone-based direct sales operation next month in preparation for the imminent deregulation of the European insurance market. The new service, called Zuritel, will be launched in Switzerland and then extended. Mr Rolf Huppi, president and chief executive, expects competition to increase as a result of liberalisation, especially in motor, home and life insurance. 'The opening of the market will mean an enormous pressure on business costs. This is one of the reasons why we are introducing low-cost distribution systems.' EU member states must implement the so-called framework directives by July 1. These will abolish the system of minimum prices, and insurers will no longer need approval from local regulators for new policies or changes in policy wording. One of Zurich's German subsidiaries, Deutsche Allgemeine, already sells some insurance direct to the public through 42 shops. But the market for personal lines insurance in Germany, Switzerland and some other EU states is still dominated by networks of agents selling exclusively for one company. Mr Huppi believes this pattern is likely to change and predicts telephone-based direct writers will win a market share of up to 50 per cent of the private motor insurance market in some countries, citing recent developments in the UK, the US and the Netherlands. Zuritel, to be based near Zurich airport, will reach its customers through a combination of mass media advertising and telephone sales, as do direct writers in the UK and elsewhere. Sales personnel will underwrite policies with the help of sophisticated computer software. Winterthur, another large Swiss company, has been one of the pioneers of direct writing through its UK subsidiary Churchill. It has also recently launched a direct writer in the Danish insurance market. Zurich also announced the launch of a new life insurance policy, with premiums invested in equities and property as well as bonds. The policy will resemble the 'unit linked' variety popular in the UK.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 1 (XINHUA) -- People in Beijing are  widely interested in the broad spectrum of reforms which the  government is instituting this year.    People are trying to learn details of the reforms from all  aspects which will influence almost everyone's interests and  daily life.    Some of the reforms are already in full operation, such as  the overhaul of the taxation system and unification of the  two-tiered exchange rates. Other reforms are still in the  blueprint stage, or just in the process of being carried out,  like the overall wages increase for government employees.    The influence of the reforms can be felt in street chats and  in marketplaces all over the city.    In the Dongdan Vegetable Market in east Beijing, Wang Lin, a  30- year-old man working in a government institute, said that  his monthly wage has gone up by one-third after his work unit  carried out a payment reform in January.    "I can spend more now," he said. "But I am concerned that if  all government employees receive wage rises, prices will go up  and bite into the raised incomes."    Though many people have the same concern as Wang, Beijing  City government's surveys show that the purchasing power of the  citizens is on a steady increase, while the city's retail market  has been booming since January 1.    The city government is planning to raise by 30 percent the  pensions of retired workers, who will benefit the least from the  wages reform.    Yun Fengqi, a car driver in his 50s, said that his standard  of life is better than a decade ago. "We have many more choices  on the shelves in stores now than in the late 1970s," he said.    He cited the example of his own family, who were able to  afford a color TV set now costing several thousand yuan, but had  to hesitate when they spent several hundred yuan to buy a  nine-inch black-and- white TV set in 1979.    "We cannot be like some rich people who buy extremely  expensive things, but we live a rather comfortable life," Yun  said.    According to a survey by the Beijing Psychological Research  Institute, over 90 percent of citizens believe that prices rise  fast. But in the meantime, they support the economic reform  because it means better opportunities to make more money. The  widely held belief is that people have to rely on themselves to  earn a higher income.    Entrepreneurs from all sectors are keenly interested in the  reforms of exchange rates and taxation.    Li Wuquan, general manager of the state-run Beijing  Machinery  Import and Export Corporation, said that the unification of  exchange rates is good for Chinese enterprises to enter  international markets. He said that the adoption of a single  exchange rate facilitates his company's operations by  accelerating circulation of funds.    "In the past, we had to wait one or two months before we  could sell foreign exchange at the swap market for renminbi  currency needed to purchase export goods. But now we can get  the money back immediately from bank," he said.    But Li said that since China abandoned the government-set  exchange rate and adopted a higher market rate of around 8.7  yuan for one dollar, machinery companies can no longer buy  foreign exchange from the state bank at the former rate of 5.7  yuan. It has put the cost up and cut the edge of sophisticated  products over other products in exports, he said.    China has aimed the reforms to benefit the majority of the  people. But of course, not everyone benefits simultaneously  from the present reforms.    Sun Jian, owner of a private photocopy workshop in  Zhongguancun, in northwest Beijing, complained that his profits  suffered as a new system of receipts hampered his business with  large state-run institutes.    A manager of a publicly-owned technological joint venture  said that the tax reforms have put all enterprises on the same  footing for competition -- more opportunities, more risk and  more challenge. He pointed out that the rise in wages for  employees in government institutes had narrowed the salary  advantages offered by non-government-run enterprises,  intensifying the competition for skills and talents between  enterprises.    But the manager said that he is fully confident of the  future, because the reforms conform with the principle of equal  competition.    Chen Dehua, professor of economics at Beijing University,  described this year's reforms as "drastic".    The most prominent point of the reforms is that they get rid  of the egalitarianism still remaining in people's minds. But  the preparation work for the reforms is inadequate, enabling  some people to take the chance to raise prices, he said.</p>

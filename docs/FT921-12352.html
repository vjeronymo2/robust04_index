			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / EC customs brokers plan action over job cut fears THE MOVEMENT of freight across European borders could be seriously disrupted today when customs brokers in all but three EC countries plan to take industrial action. The brokers - private enterprises which prepare documentation and smooth the way through cross-border tax and customs formalities - are worried about inevitable job losses when internal EC barriers to free trade come down at the start of 1993. During the one-day go-slow, customs and value added tax paperwork at many borders will not be completed by the brokers. 'It's not a strike,' said Mr Jean-Marie Parasie, director of Clecat, the brokers' Brussels-based trade association. 'In most countries, offices will be open, agents will be there but there will be no customs clearance.' When the EC's physical frontier controls are swept away at the end of this year, between 50m and 60m documents - the annual detritus of intra-Community trade - should also disappear. Customs brokers employ the 85,000 people who fill out most of those forms, and they are afraid that after New Year's Eve, 1992, they will be redundant. The brokers hope to persuade national governments and the European Commission to come up with an economic support plan for the sector, which includes small family-run companies and subsidiaries of international trading groups. Only UK, Danish and Irish brokers are resisting the go-slow call. Mr Georges Boulanger, managing director of one of Belgium's largest customs brokers, said the cost of laying off his 175 broking staff would be prohibitive. 'There's a real lack of information coming from the authorities,' he added. Brussels has already commissioned a study of the business, but says the real responsibility lies with national governments.</p>

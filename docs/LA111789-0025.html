			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLIPPERS HIT SEASON LOW IN LOSS TO ROCKETS;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: SPIRITS LIFTED BY TRADE AND SIGNING EARLIER IN THE DAY ARE LOWERED  BY COLD SHOOTING THAT PRODUCES 82 POINTS.  </P> <P> They came, they saw, they traded, they signed, they lost. Not your ordinary  Clipper day, except for the ending.  </P> <P> "We seem to have gotten into a pattern," Coach Don Casey said. "We play a great  game, have a light practice the next day, and then it's like the guys are  meeting each other for the first time."  </P> <P> Fine and good in the week ahead, but newcomer-to-be Ron Harper and newly-signed  Benoit Benjamin were nowhere near as the Clippers lost at the Summit for the  seventh consecutive time, 94-82, to a Houston Rocket team that got 27 points  from Otis Thorpe and 18 points and 16 rebounds from Akeem Olajuwon.  </P> <P> The 82 points is a season-low for the Clippers (2-4), and betters (worsens?)  any point total from last season. It was also the fewest points the Rockets  have allowed since Feb. 21, 1987.  </P> <P> Coming off an emotional home win over Denver, the Clippers slipped back into  their road uniforms and wore them like a suit of armor. They had, after all,  beaten the Rockets by 14 in the season opener Nov. 3 at the Sports Arena.  </P> <P> But here? They received scoring from the backcourt -- Gary Grant with 21 points  and Tom Garrick keeping Harper's spot at shooting guard very warm with 16  points on six-of-nine shooting -- but nothing else. No one had more than nine  rebounds.  </P> <P> "They had more confidence at home," Rocket Coach Don Chaney said. "But we also  helped them out there with turnovers. I thought the biggest thing was we took  care of the basketball, not so much what they did and did not do."  </P> <P> The Clippers trailed only 70-67 entering the fourth quarter, but Houston opened  the lead to 10 with 5:52 remaining. The Clippers were outscored, 24-15, in the  final 12 minutes.  </P> <P> Olajuwon, playing with a jammed thumb and forefinger on his left hand that made  it difficult to catch or grip the ball, had 12 points and seven rebounds in the  second half.  </P> <P> Clipper Notes  </P> <P> When the Benoit Benjamin signing is approved by the league today, the Clippers  will most likely have to make a cut, unless they discover someone suddenly has  a previously-unknown injury. . . . More trade fall-out: Reggie Williams returns  to the Sports Arena Dec. 7, when the Clippers play host to Cleveland, and he  said Thursday he can already imagine being pumped up a little more than normal.  "I probably will be," he said. "But I won't go overboard. I'll be excited to  play in every one with them (Cleveland)." . . . Don Casey's reaction on never  getting to coach Danny Ferry: "He don't know what he missed."  </P></p>

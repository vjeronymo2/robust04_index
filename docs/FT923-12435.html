			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / The Property Market: Why Basildon Man turned blue - The changing complexion of a political bellwether of the housing market BASILDON in Essex is Britain's new political bellwether. All the figures - 10 per cent unemployment, a high level of house repossessions and a population weighted towards C2s, the upwardly mobile working class that is being hammered by the recession - pointed to a Labour party victory in the last UK general election. Instead, Basildon Man and Essex Woman returned the sitting Conservative MP, David Amess, with a comfortable majority and then voted out the local Labour council. The results may have flown in the face of economic indicators, but Basildon, some 25 miles east of London, is all about aspirations. A former new town, it is where east Londoners traditionally go to better themselves. 'A lot of people were frightened that if Labour got in they would not be able to buy their house, or even have their houses taken away from them,' says Robin Burton, who sells gold jewellery in Basildon's open-air market. 'I know staunch Labour party members who rushed out to buy.' His family moved into Basildon in 1963 and he bought his first house in 1971 - for Pounds 5,750. Now he lives outside the town. 'It's great as a stepping stone, people are able to move on.' From Romford and Ilford, the town is a short hop over the M25, a planned sprawl of low-rise housing surrounded by Essex's green belt. In the 1890s Basildon attracted Eastenders who dreamed of owning a plot in the country; in the 1990s it caters to first-time home buyers. The area, originally a group of agricultural hamlets, was opened up by the new railway linking Fenchurch Street in the City to Southend. Speculators snapped up the large farms along the line, auctioning off small plots to the upwardly-mobile workers of east London. Badly housed and overcrowded in the capital, east Londoners escaped to their plots on weekends and holidays, building huts and occasionally more substantial shelters. By the mid-1940s 'plotland' had become a rural slum, lacking proper roads, sewage or water supply. Short of resources, Essex County Council and the district petitioned for a new town. Their application was supported by Newham in East London, which was struggling with a serious housing shortage after the war. In 1949 Basildon - then a village - was designated a new town; the first house was completed two years later. Today, thanks to sell-offs and private building, about 60 per cent of properties are owner-occupied. According to the Halifax Building Society, Basildon's typical terraced house was selling for nearly Pounds 67,700 five years ago; now it is more like Pounds 47,000. 'The market has been going down gradually in the last two to three years,' says Mark Reardon, the area manager of agents Bairstow Eves. Sandra Gurton's experience is typical. A big fan of Basildon ('I love Basildon; there are a lot of really nice people and things to do'), she bought her first house last June. A former council property which had been repossessed, it cost Pounds 37,000. Today it is worth Pounds 32,000. However, she has not been hit as badly as those who bought at the peak. 'There is a lot of people who are very unhappy. They paid a huge amount and are now stuck.' However, according to Mark Reardon, the housing market has improved since the election. 'The number of repossessed houses coming on to the market has slowed,' he says. 'Prices are not going up in any shape or form, but we are certainly selling more houses. At Woolwich Property Services, Ian Storey also notes a pick up. 'Six months ago it was mainly first-time buyers moving into empty properties. Now there are fewer repossessions, more chains coming together.' Prices are a factor in this recovery. Basildon property is 'cheap', or as the agents say, 'very, very affordable'. This is particularly true for first-time buyers, who tend to make up the bulk of the market in Basildon. The other options - Billericay and Brentwood - are much more expensive. 'The market there is completely different; for the same house you would pay Pounds 65,000,' says Mark Reardon. This price difference reflects what he calls 'snob value'; Basildon has not shaken off its image as an ex-council town. And indeed, Basildon provides a potted history of post-war public sector building styles. Older neighbourhoods reflect the Garden City approach: low density, short brick terraces and semi-detached houses with generous gardens. The 1960s and '70s brought timber boxes and the low-rise, yellow brick estate locally nicknamed Alcatraz, while the 1980s gave way to privately developed enclaves of ersatz Tudor or Georgian brick houses. The popular areas of town are Lee Chapel, north and south, and Kingswood, which skirts Basildon's golf course. Both are within walking distance of the town centre and the railway station. About half of Basildon works locally - Ford and GEC are major employers - but with the rail journey only 35 minutes, the town also has its fair share of City commuters. To move up-market in Basildon requires a literal climb, to Langdon Hills, the second highest spot in Essex, a leafy neighbourhood of quiet cul-de-sacs and crisply-kept gardens. The typical Langdon Hills house costs Pounds 130,000 to Pounds 150,000. And there are less expensive options: a three bedroom terraced house on Nightingales, built five years ago by Countryside Properties, is on the market via Woolwich Property Services at Pounds 73,500. After Langdon Hills, the only move is out, to the countryside around Basildon. There are new developments on the fringes, such as Great Brook Mead, a 300-house complex built by Countryside Properties. Here a brick two-bedroom cottage costs Pounds 66,950, while four-bedroom houses are on offer for Pounds 159,950.</p>

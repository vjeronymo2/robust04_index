			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> G'DAY AUSTRALIA  </P> <P> As an Australian, "G'bye California, G'day Australia" (by Sean Mitchell, June  25) made me painfully aware of a few of the things I love and miss about  Australia: fresh air, intense colors, unurbanized beaches, the slower,  easy-going pace and the unique spirit of the land.  </P> <P> However, I also love the United States, and California in particular, for some  of the very things that Australia seems to have less of -- energy,  entrepreneurial vision and tumultuous variety. Here is a country that seems to  encompass everything. After about four and a half years here, it seems  pointless to try to decide which is the better country to live in. Like any  place, each country lacks something simply by having something different to  offer.  </P> <P> For me, the important aspect of living outside Australia is trying to transcend  the petty side of nationalism and patriotism and opening up to the subtleties  of different cultures.  </P> <P> MEREDITH TAIT  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

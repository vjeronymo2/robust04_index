			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORAN, SUSPENDED FOR RIDING INTOXICATED, LOSES APPEAL  </P> <P> Speedway motorcyclist Shawn Moran of Huntington Beach, the leading rider in the  British Speedway League, had his appeal for suspension denied Friday by a  three-man jury representing the American Motorcycle Assn. Moran was suspended  for the remainder of the season for racing with an excessive blood-alcohol  content last month in Denmark.  </P> <P> Moran was given two Breathalyzer tests by officials of the governing Federation  of International Motorcyclists (FIM) and tested well above the allowable levels  set by the FIM after competing in two heat races in a World Long Track  qualifying round May 14 at Korskro, Denmark.  </P> <P> Moran was disqualified from the race by FIM officials and then suspended from  all world championship events for the 1989 season by the AMA. Moran also was  banned from competing in the World Best Pairs, World Team Cup and World Final  events.  </P> <P> Moran appealed the suspension and was allowed to compete in the American Final  June 3 at Long Beach Veterans Stadium. The race was the first of three  qualifying rounds for American riders that leads to the world championship.  </P> <P> Moran tied Sam Ermolenko and Ronnie Correy for first place at Long Beach with  19 points, but lost a runoff to Ermolenko and finished second. Moran will be  replaced in the next round by reserve Rick Miller.  </P> <P> "Shawn never denied the incident, he just felt the punishment didn't fit the  crime, so he made the appeal," said Harry Oxley, International Speedway  promoter. "He told the jury exactly what happened and we tried to convince them  that suspending Shawn from all Long Track meetings for the year would be more  appropriate."  </P> <P> The jury's decision is final, according to Bill Boyce, competition director for  the AMA.  </P></p>

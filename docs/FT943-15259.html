			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Caracas reopens exchange Limited foreign exchange transactions will recommence in Venezuela today after being suspended by government order for over two weeks, administration officials said at the weekend. President Rafael Caldera announced foreign exchange controls on June 27, but the government and the central bank were unable to agree on final details of a control scheme until Saturday. Normal foreign exchange transactions at banks and exchange houses have not been carried out in Venezuela since June 23, causing problems for importers, travellers and companies with external debt payments that have come due. Officials stressed that under the new exchange control scheme, funds would be available for servicing public and private sector external debt, and for foreign companies repatriating profits and royalties. The presidential decree that defines the terms for approving and disbursing foreign exchange states that private sector external debt will be covered by the programme. High priority will also be assigned to imports of raw materials for industry. There were also press reports that the government intended to fine any local news media that reported black market exchange rates, although it was unclear whether this measure would be implemented. Venezuela's new foreign exchange scheme requires that foreign currency entering the country, with a few exceptions, should be sold to the central bank. Commercial banks will handle applications for foreign currency, and will provide funds to companies and the public. The government will set a Dollars 500 monthly limit for those who wish to travel overseas for pleasure, and a Dollars 250 daily limit for business travel.</p>

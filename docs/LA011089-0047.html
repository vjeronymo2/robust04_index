			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY ROUNDUP: AME STOCK PLAN ACCEPTS NEW OFFER FOR SHARES  </P> <P> AME said its employee stock ownership plan reached a tentative agreement to  tender part of its shares to a group led by AME founder and chairman Andrew M.  McIntyre, which has offered $37 million to buy the 55% of AME that McIntyre  does not already own.  </P> <P> The employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) owns 1.2 million, or 25%, of AME, a  Burbank provider of videotape services to the movie and television industries.  AME last month accepted McIntyre's sweetened offer of $13.75 a share; initially  he offered $11.50 a share.  </P> <P> McIntyre said in a telephone interview that the ESOP has tentatively agreed to  tender 35% to 40% of its shares for cash. The remaining shares would be  exchanged for stock in AOAG, the company McIntyre's group formed to make the  acquisition.  </P></p>

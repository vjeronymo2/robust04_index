			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> People who use chewing tobacco and snuff appear to get as much nicotine as  cigarette smokers, and the practice may also increase their risk for heart  disease and various forms of cancer, researchers reported. A new study by  researchers at UC San Francisco, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine,  found men who used "smokeless tobacco" were exposed to about as much nicotine  as cigarette smokers. The study also found that like cigarette smoking,  smokeless tobacco use also increased the heart rate and blood pressure, and  chewing tobacco appeared to expose users to potentially cancer-causing  chemicals. An estimated 16 million Americans use smokeless tobacco. Its use has  been linked to an increased risk of developing oral cancer and gum disease.  </P></p>

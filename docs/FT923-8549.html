			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Fujitsu now faces up to harsh economic realities - Japan's recession has weakened demand in the computer sector JAPAN'S full-line computer manufacturers - which make every size of computer from notebooks to mainframes - are discovering they are no longer immune to the harsh commercial realities which have hit their western competitors over the past two years. Fujitsu, second only to International Business Machines (IBM) of the US among global information technology (IT) companies, is warning it will incur pre-tax losses of about Y10bn (Dollars 78.7m) in the first half to September. It will not be the only Japanese electronics company to downgrade its forecasts, as their domestic market continues in the doldrums. IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, made pre-tax losses last year of Dollars 2.8bn, chiefly as a result of stagnant mainframe sales and heavy restructuring charges. It will have shed up to 80,000 people by the end of this year. A Japanese computer specialist, asked to describe the difference between the plight of IBM and Fujitsu, said: 'They both have the same serious problems, but Fujitsu is in a worse position because Japanese companies cannot sack their workers.' Fujitsu broke with that tradition last week by sacking 260 workers at one of its two US semiconductor plants. It has yet to trim its domestic workforce, however, and has only just begun to prune loss-making products. In common with other Japanese manufacturers, Fujitsu had not made cuts in the hope that domestic economic recovery would come this summer. It is now clear, however, that Japan's economy will remain stagnant at least until early next year. This will have serious consequences for the full-line computer companies. Western manufacturers have been suffering for two years from a combination of stagnant demand, rapidly rising research and development costs and fierce price competition. They have also been hit by moves among customers to standard or 'open' systems which have contributed to declining prices. Japanese manufacturers have been comparatively immune to these factors because of buoyant domestic demand for mainframe computers, especially from the banks. Open systems, moreover, have yet to have much influence on the Japanese market. The Japanese recession, however, has damped demand significantly. Studies such as a recent report from the Japanese economic planning agency indicate that the financial sector intends to reduce capital spending by about 28 per cent in the second half of 1992, after a 7 per cent reduction in the first half. Full-line companies make most of their profits from mainframe sales where the gross profit margin can be more than 60 per cent. Fujitsu may suffer more than the other Japanese full-line makers because, as the spearhead of Japan's challenge to the west in computers, it makes only computers, semiconductors and telecommunications products. On the other hand Hitachi, another Japanese full-line producer, also manufactures heavy electrical equipment, and will benefit from Japan's supplementary budget this year which is likely to fund new power plants and roads. Fujitsu said the heady days of the late 1980s blurred its perspective on longer-term demand. Japanese personal computer output rose 69 per cent in 1989, while that of all industrial electronic equipment rose 21 per cent in 1988, partly in response to increasing demand from securities companies and banks, which expanded rapidly during the easy-money era. Fujitsu's profits rose as dramatically as the Nikkei stock market average during those years. Parent pre-tax profit rose from Y22.6bn in the year to end-March 1987 to Y60.4bn in 1988, Y106.4bn in 1989 and Y127bn for the period to March 1990. Securities houses are now cutting their investments in computers and, in some cases, cancelling contracts, while Japan's manufacturing industry is expected to reduce capital spending by about 2.8 per cent in the second half of this year. 'If you look at business on a short-term basis, there is over-capacity now. Maybe the timing of our expansion in the late 1980s was not very good. However, our markets are still growing in the longer-term,' Fujitsu said. The company is predicting overall pre-tax profits of about Y40bn this year. A side-effect of the increased spending on plant was a heavy depreciation burden. Consolidated depreciation charges rose by 17 per cent last year. The company is hoping to slow that growth by cutting plant expenditure by 30 per cent this year. It is attempting to cut costs in other areas. It has decided to withdraw from the US fax market, merged two of its software subsidiaries, and is to reduce its graduate intake next year to 1,250, about 100 fewer than this year. Fujitsu also said it is attempting to 'shift the emphasis from hardware to software' to improve profitability. But it is resisting pressure to lay off workers in Japan: 'We don't have any plan to cut workers here. We have cut the pay of executives and limited managers' pay rises. These are difficult decisions,' it said. It will not withdraw from the loss-making memory chip business, though it said 'we have to be more selective about memory chips', which account for about 30 per cent of its total chip production. Last month, Fujitsu committed itself to a joint venture to develop flash memory chips with Advanced Micro Devices of the US. Fujitsu's global family of IT companies, including ICL of the UK in which it holds an 80 per cent stake, seem unlikely to be affected by its financial difficulties. ICL made pre-tax profits last year and expects to repeat the performance in 1992. There are no plans to interrupt the timetable for flotation agreed two years ago when Fujitsu took its stake in the company. Up to 49 per cent of ICL will be floated in London by 1995 at a minimum price of 225p a share.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Letter: EC must take lead on packaging Sir, Europe's chemical distribution industry applauds your leader, 'Packaging Mess' (June 16). The recent annual congress of FECC - the organisation representing distributors throughout Europe - expressed identical concerns and passed a resolution calling on the EC to take the lead on the issue through its draft directive. The consequences of the EC's failure to act could result in packaging regulations thoughout member states with differing objectives, timescales, sanctions and compliance costs. At the very time so much energy and political will is being focused on the single market, it seems ironic this issue is not receiving the attention it deserves.

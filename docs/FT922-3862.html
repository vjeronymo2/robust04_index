			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UN backs relief plan for Sarajevo airport THE Security Council unanimously approved early this morning a plan to send 1,100 UN troops to take control of Sarajevo airport and enable relief supplies to reach the besieged Bosnian capital, as Serb irregulars continued their shelling of the city. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali the UN secretary-general, had proposed the plan to enlarge the 14,000-member peacekeeping force in Yugoslavia. It requires him to obtain further Council authorisation to send in the bulk of the troops, once all conditions for the mission have been fulfilled, including the existence of an effective and durable ceasefire. But the UN chief is authorised to dispatch, at his discretion, 60 military observers to ensure that anti-aircraft systems and heavy weapons are withdrawn from within range of the airport, at present controlled by Serb forces. The blockade of the airport and the main road links into Sarajevo has prevented any food and medical supplies from reaching the 300,000 inhabitants of the city. Heavy explosions ripped through the heart of the capital yesterday and thick columns of black smoke rose from burning buildings across the city, where some 300,000 residents are trapped. Moslem and Croat defenders hit back hard for the first time in days. More than 30 people were killed and 120 wounded over the weekend in some of the worst fighting in a European capital since the Second World War. Hospital officials said at least eight people had been killed yesterday. Bosnian territorial defence units launched an unexpected counter-attack against the heavily-armed Serb forces near an area where 40,000 Serb, Croat and Moslem residents are trapped. The territorial units include troops drawn from Sarajevo's close-knit ethnic communities, including Moslems, Croats and Serbs.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Bank of France council chosen The six lay members of the monetary policy council of the newly independent Bank of France were chosen last night after a brief disagreement between Socialist president Francois Mitterrand and the conservative government, Reuter reports from Paris. The conservative prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, initially resisted Mr Mitterrand's nomination of the former Socialist finance minister, Mr Michel Sapin, but finally agreed. Two other nominees formally accepted were named as Mr Michel Albert, chairman of the state-owned Assurances Generales de France, and Mr Jean Boissonnat, a leading economics commentator. Officials said three other candidates, whom they did not identify, had been more or less agreed. The six will join the Bank of France governor, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, and his two deputies on the council. The central bank was due to have become autonomous on January 1, but the delay in naming the council has meant that it does not yet have formal independent control of interest rates.</p>

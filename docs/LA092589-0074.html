			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEWS' FEELINGS NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD, GLEMP SAYS  </P> <P> Cardinal Jozef Glemp said in an interview that neither he nor the Polish  Catholic Church he leads had adequately understood the significance of the  Auschwitz death camp as a symbol for Jewish people.  </P> <P> "Yes, there were some mistakes committed by the church. . . . We actually were  not aware that there would be such deep feelings on the part of Jews toward  this place. We actually did not understand the Shoah (Holocaust) doctrine,"  Glemp said at his Warsaw residence.  </P> <P> Remarks by Glemp last month resisting the relocation of a Catholic convent away  from Auschwitz offended many Jews and pushed Polish-Jewish relations to a  crisis point. About 2.5 million of the 4 million people who were killed by the  Nazis at Auschwitz during World War II were Jews, and many Jews have objected  to the convent's presence as an intrusion into what they say should be a Jewish  memorial.  </P> <P> In the interview Saturday, Glemp confirmed that he now favors moving the  convent and reaffirmed the validity of a 1987 agreement between the Catholic  church and Jewish organizations to relocate the convent building. He said that  the Carmelite nuns would be moved away from the camp, although he said he could  not name the date.  </P> <P> He added that the Jewish people also must understand the importance that  Auschwitz has for Poles.  </P> <P> "We know that Jews went through the Holocaust and they sacrificed so many  lives, but we also would like them to know that Poles also went through  exterminations at Oswiecim (Auschwitz)," Glemp said.  </P> <P> In statements last month, the Polish church leader had sought to annul the 1987  agreement to move the convent, calling the accord unacceptable and declaring  that it would have to be renegotiated. Glemp said at the time that Jewish  insistence that the church honor its agreement was an affront to Polish  sovereignty. He also said that moving the nuns would be too expensive.  </P> <P> The primate's attempt at conciliation in Saturday's interview followed a  statement by the Vatican last week, which supported the 1987 agreement and  offered to help pay for a new convent to be built some distance from Auschwitz.  </P> <P> Glemp said the Carmelite nuns had settled at Auschwitz in 1984 "with good  intentions" and that it was not easy for Polish Catholics to understand why the  convent's presence is offensive to Jews. He said it would require work in every  Catholic parish to explain the Jewish view that the only fitting memorial at a  site where so many Jews were gassed and burned is emptiness and silence.  </P></p>

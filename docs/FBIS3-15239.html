They  will be airlifted there as soon as the corresponding decision is  adopted by the country's top authorities, a source in the  Russian paratroopers' headquarters told ITAR-TASS on Friday.    The source added that Russian paratroopers had been  surprised  by a statement of French General Jean Cot that only American,  British or French servicemen are capable to operate rapidly and  professionally in Bosnia.    He reminded that a very high training level had been  demostrated by Russian paratroopers during their last month rush  from Croatia to Bosnia to guarantee the withdrawal of the Serb  big guns. The operation was a success despite limited time and  extreme weather conditions.    "It is a pity that the French general failed to notice this  though he could watch Russian paratroopers in action with his  own eyes", the source said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["sz"-signed report: "Large Projects Were Discussed in </F> China"]    [Text] Shanghai, 28 Apr -- After the projects in India,  the Mercedes-Benz AG is now planning several large projects in  China. Basically, the construction of a diesel engine factory,  together with the First Automotive Corporation, in Changchun in  northern China is involved. The construction of buses is also  under discussion. In southern China, Mercedes-Benz wants to  build large limousines in two production facilities. The  concern is competing with the U.S. Chrysler Corporation here.    This was announced in an interview for HANDELSBLATT by  Eberhard Herzog, former member and adviser of the Mercedes-Benz  board of directors. Herzog accompanied Baden-Wuerttemberg  Minister President Erwin Teufel on his tour of China.    The diesel engine factory is to produce four- and  six-cylinder engines of medium weight. A Japanese company  (Hino) is also competing for this project. The construction of  at least 100,000 diesel engines for trucks and busses is under  consideration. The engine represents an ultramodern new  development. It is also to be installed in Mercedes commercial  vehicles in Germany and worldwide. The project involves over 500  million German marks.    At two production facilities in Guangdong Province in  southern China and in Hainan Island (a special economic  province), a large limousine is to be produced together with the  Nanfang Corporation. The Chrysler Corporation is likely to  receive the order if U.S. President Clinton in June should  extend China's most-favored-nation status by another year.  Clinton and Chancellor Kohl have asked the Chinese leadership  to place orders with the companies of their countries. As a  result of regional vanities, however, production is to be split  between two sites, which will not make the manufacture easier.    Negotiations with the Shanghai Automotive Industrial  Corporation on the construction of Mercedes-Benz luxury busses  on the basis of the mechanical assembly technique with low  Chinese participation in the manufacture at the beginning are  also under way. The production of 1,000 luxury busses is  planned. Two more bus producers are negotiating the development  of a simpler long-distance intercity bus with Mercedes-Benz.  Numerous state-owned concerns from other towns and provinces  that specialize in the construction of commercial vehicles and  cars are offering the Stuttgart company their cooperation. One  such concern is the delivery truck factory in Shenyang in  northern China where production takes place in old Toyota  manufacturing plants. The governor of the province has submitted  cooperation proposals to Mercedes-Benz. Through cooperation  with the provinces, Japanese auto producers have practically  avoided the State Council and are in this way trying to obtain  production facilities in China. In northern China,  Mercedes-Benz is producing commercial vehicles together with a  company that belongs to the Defense Ministry.    According to Herzog, Mercedes-Benz will be forced to  concentrate on a few major projects in China. The production of  passenger cars is not under consideration. Currently, the  Machine-Building Ministry does not grant any permits for such  projects, with the exception of the Nanfang project.</p>

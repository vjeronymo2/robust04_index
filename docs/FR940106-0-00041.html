			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 371 of the NAFTA Implementation Act simply adds a new subparagraph (G) to 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2) extending domestic treatment to costs to the manufacturer attributable to value added in Mexico, according to an explicit phase-in schedule. The statutory change does not alter the current treatment of costs to the manufacturer attributable to value added in the United States or Canada. Pursuant to clause (iii) in new subparagraph (G), the Secretary of Transportation is to prescribe reasonable procedures for manufacturers to make elections for the phase-in schedules described in today's regulations, and the EPA Administrator may prescribe rules for carrying out subparagraph (G). Today, EPA is amending its regulations governing the determination of domestic production to include the provisions of new subparagraph (G) in 15 U.S.C. 2003(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Environmental Effects and Economic Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the NAFTA Implementation Act does not give EPA discretion as to the content of these regulations and because Congress required the regulations to become effective less than a month after enactment of this Act, the Agency has not conducted detailed analyses of the environmental and economic impacts separate from the analyses that were done on the North American Free Trade Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Public Participation and Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Agency is not using notice and comment rulemaking procedures to promulgate this rule because the Agency has found that notice is unnecessary and impracticable. Comment is unnecessary because the rule issued today merely conforms pre-existing regulations as required by the NAFTA Implementation Act and does not involve an exercise of discretion by the Administrator. Furthermore, comment is impracticable because the NAFTA Implementation Act allowed the Administrator less than one month between the date of enactment and the date by which the regulations must be effective. It is impracticable to have notice-and-comment rulemaking completed in such a short time. This short time period is consistent with EPA's view that it is performing a ministerial act that is not subject to notice and comment rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule is being made effective sooner than 30 days after publication or service. This is permitted by section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act when the Agency finds good cause and publishes it with the rule. The Agency finds that there is good cause. The regulation needs to be effective on January 1, 1994, to avoid having the statute (which goes into effect on January 1, 1994) differ from the implementing regulations. In addition, the statutory provision itself will go into effect less than 30 days after it was enacted, which precludes EPA from providing 30 days between publication or service and the effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency does not believe that notice-and-comment rulemaking is required and does not expect this change to be controversial, as it directly incorporates the explicit provisions of the statutory amendment into the current regulations. Nonetheless, EPA will accept comments on these regulatory changes and will consider making changes if justified by the comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

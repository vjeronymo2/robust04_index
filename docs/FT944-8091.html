			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Carpet dealer owes suppliers Pounds 2m A Liverpool carpet wholesaler in business since 1926 has been forced into receivership because UK consumer confidence has still not revived, a KPMG Peat Marwick insolvency practitioner said yesterday. D. Huglin (London) - which in spite of its name operates from Speke, Liverpool - has debts of Pounds 2m, almost all owed to suppliers. The main creditor is the Beaulieu carpet manufacturing group in Belgium. Huglin is in the medium-price market, selling carpets wholesale and through mail order in the UK and Ireland. Mr Tim Beer of KPMG, who has been appointed joint administrative receiver with Mr Philip Ramsbottom, said: 'This is symptomatic of what is going on in the general economy. Recovery is not as strong as some people hope. 'Neither the housing market - which drives many carpet sales - nor consumer confidence has revived. People are not spending, or borrowing to spend, on such items. Anyone ultimately dependent on the strength of retail markets is suffering from seriously eroded margins because of intense price competition.' Weak pricing and poor volumes saw Huglin's turnover collapse to only Pounds 8m last year from Pounds 10m in 1992. Mr Beer is hoping to sell the company and has kept on 26 of 42 staff.</p>

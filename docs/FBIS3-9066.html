The talks focused on the  cooperation and port facilities that Albania may offer to  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  on the transport of goods from the Adriatic shores to Macedonia.    We are predisposed to help Macedonia, Kopliku said at this  meeting. Moreover, we are related to Macedonia by the fact that  about 40 percent of its inhabitants are of Albanian nationality.    The talks mainly focused on two main directions of the  demands by the Macedonian side: to ensure the use of Durres  port for transport as well as the use of one of the fuel stores  in Vlore.    Assessing the help that Albania would give to Macedonia,  Macedonian Deputy Prime Minister Andonov asked that 30 percent  of goods destined for Macedonia should pass through Albania,  with advantageous conditions regarding customs expenses.  Kopliku declared the readiness of the Albanian Government to  reach an understanding.    The Macedonian side confirmed its readiness to include  Albania in the project to construct a gas pipeline from Russia  to Skopje, and from there to Albania.</p>

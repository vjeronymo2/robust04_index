			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys arrived  for a one-day official visit in the Slovak Republic today. This  morning he met with his departmental counterpart, Pavel Kanis.  Our correspondent Miroslav Minar reports:    [Minar] The Czech defense minister's visit is taking place  in  connection with the first unofficial working meeting between  Minister Baudys and former Slovak Defense Minister [Imrich]  Andrejcak at Vranov nad Dyji.    The special military plane from Prague landed at Milan  Rastislav Stefanik airport at 0930, and, shortly after that, the  Czech guest was welcomed on Slovak territory by Defense Minister  Pavel Kanis.    The talks, which took place after the welcoming ceremony,  were attended by experts from both sides and contained, above  all, a proposal of the agreement between the defense ministries  of the Slovak Republic and the Czech Republic on mutual  cooperation. The two sides will exchange information to the  extent of the powers entrusted to them and stipulated by Slovak  and Czech legal regulations and will cooperate on the basis of  reciprocity and mutual advantage.    The first glance at the text of the agreement shows that the  extent of cooperation is broad and that the individual spheres  concern all parts of the military. For example, in the coming  period, the parties to the agreement should cooperate in  building their armies and mobilization systems in conditions of  peace, technical development, military training and science,  personnel work, social and health security, culture, and sport.  [passage omitted]    During the joint events, the official languages of the two  states that are parties to the agreement will be used.    Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys and Slovak Defense  Minister Pavel Kanis signed the text of the agreement on mutual  cooperation shortly before 1200. A news conference is under way  at this time.</p>

The Ministry of Defence has warned Downing Street that the  crisis over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes is  threatening to force Japan to abandon its non-nuclear stance.  The risks are detailed in a paper to the Joint Intelligence  Committee, Whitehall's main security body, which advises the  cabinet and the prime minister.    The report, sent last month, reveals that Japan has key  bomb-making components, including plutonium and electronic  triggers, and has the expertise to "go nuclear" very quickly.    One expert who has seen the report said: "They (the  Japanese)  could have acquired all the expertise for imploding a weapon  without breaking safeguards. All they would need to do is  select adequate amounts of plutonium for the core."    American intelligence officials said President Bill Clinton  has given up hope of stopping North Korea getting nuclear  weapons, a setback which is likely to spark a regional arms  race. The Pyongyang government still refuses to allow full  inspections of two disputed nuclear sites.    Tension increased last week when America announced it would  deploy the Patriot antimissile system in South Korea. North  Korea described the move as an "unpardonable grave military  challenge."    The Patriots are supposed to help reassure South Korea and  Japan by providing a first-line defence. But they will not  prevent Japan developing a nuclear deterrent if it fears a  surprise attack, intelligence sources said.    The turning point would come if North Korea improves the  accuracy and range of its Nodong missile. The weapon, a version  of the Iraqi Scud, can carry a nuclear or chemical payload; last  May it landed a test flight in the Sea of Japan.    The Whitehall report emphasises there is no evidence yet  that  Japan has taken the decision to proceed with a nuclear bomb  programme, or that it has strayed from its commitments to the  international Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.    Japan has its own reprocessing plant for producing plutonium  and has also contracted Britain and France to supply several  tonnes of plutonium from Japanese spent reactor fuel. It also  has sophisticated rockets for launching space satellites that  could be converted to intermediate or long-range missiles.    Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, recently  confirmed  that he was "very strongly concerned" by North Korea's growing  military strength. "The missile North Korea is developing has a  range of 1,000 km and could hit much of Japan eight minutes  after it is launched," he said. "How to develop a defence  against that is a matter of great concern to Japan."    North Korea is growing increasingly unstable as food  shortages and electricity blackouts blight the bankrupt nation.  Kim Il-song, the 81-year-old dictator, warned in a new year  address that any effort to pressure his country into reforms  "may invite catastrophe."    The Central Intelligence Agency last week repeated its  warning that North Korea probably had enough plutonium for one  or two nuclear bombs. It also warned of its "heightened state  of military readiness" and the deployment of rocket launchers  and artillery close to the demilitarized zone.    America has threatened economic sanctions if North Korea  fails to agree by February 22 to allow inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency. North Korea replied it  would suspend the armistice on the Korean Peninsula if Clinton  pushed for sanctions.</p>

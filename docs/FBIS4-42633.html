			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt by </F> Bernhard Blohm and Romanus Otte in Berlin; date not given: "Tax  Reduction Is the Most Important Task of Economic Policy"]    [Text] [WELT AM SONNTAG] Must the Free Democratic Party of  Germany [FDP] show a greater difference to the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU] in economic policy?    [Rexrodt] Yes. In the CDU there are strong movements that  urge restraint. Many people there still think as they did in  the 1970's and 1980's. Scharping's Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] is not at all able to break up old structures.  This year the revolutionary approach comes from the  conservative camp, and in the coalition the liberals are the  catalyst.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Where can one see the revolutionary  approach of the liberals?    [Rexrodt] The reforms in the social field must be credited  to the FDP. The monopoly of the Federal Employment Office for  labor exchange has been abolished. I did that. We are making  sure that in the future the laender and communities examine  whether activities cannot be better accomplished by private  institutions. We have made planning and investments in housing  construction easier. We have struggled for the amendment to the  genetic engineering law and for the railroad reform. In the  postreform era it is we who are pushing -- against the  visionless alliance of the SPD in the laender and the trade  union functionaries. We are also the ones who maintain the  pressure: We must not limit those who perform most by means of  a plundering tax system and excessive regulations.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Nevertheless, the bureaucracy is becoming  denser and denser and taxes have never been as high as they are  now.    [Rexrodt] The fact that the taxes are so high is due to the  costs of reunification. But the liberals are those who say  today that the government's June tax plan must declare that the  solidarity surcharge will be abolished.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] The CDU rejects this. Is this an  important topic for you with a view to a new coalition.    [Rexrodt] Lower taxes are the priority issue for me. They  are the main thrust of what must be accomplished in economic and  financial policy. A tax reduction must be implemented.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] When?    [Rexrodt] In 1996 or 1997. Then the taxes must be reduced.  Thus, we must reduce the solidarity surcharge before that. We  must make use of any freedom to reduce taxes as quickly as  possible. I do not say this as a fashionable demand before the  elections. I am firmly convinced of it.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] What are the other basic issues that the  tax plan should also encompass?    [Rexrodt] Trade capital tax and property tax for companies  must be abolished in 1996. Trade income tax must be reduced.  Our state is ailing from excessive taxes.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] This ailment has reasons: The state has  never before had such high revenues, it represents more than  half of the GNP. Is Germany still a market economy?    [Rexrodt] This is a justified question. However, I ask tell  in fairness: German unification was and still is a titanic  task. Nevertheless, we must not get used to this state quota.  It must be reduced.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Where should the state save money?    [Rexrodt] In the next legislative period we must make  further corrections in the social services. I am for preserving  the social state. However, there are individual developments  that are unacceptable.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Which ones?    [Rexrodt] I am in favor of strengthening individual  responsibility again. If the greedy mentality continues -- I am  not thinking only of accusations in connection with artificial  heart valves [doctors have been accused of taking bribes from  pharmaceutical companies] -- our social net will be strained to  the breaking point soon. The result: It will be ruined.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] You wanted to abolish the discount law.  Now it is just being restructured.    [Rexrodt] Article 1 of the new law says that the discount  law will be abolished.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Instead, there are new restrictions.    [Rexrodt] For a developed society it should be a matter of  course that discounts are freely negotiable. However, some  business sectors are pursuing a bitter defense battle. I can  live with the compromise.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] The law will come before the elections?    [Rexrodt] Before the elections.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] You did not manage this with the shopping  hours law.    [Rexrodt] Abolishing the law on shopping hours was never a  fixed goal for this legislative period but only an additional  wish of mine. Then businesses began to attack this plan. In  the next legislative period we will see. Something must be done  about the shopping hours.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] This is what Ludwig Erhard said, too, in  his time.    [Rexrodt] But we will accomplish it.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] A compromise on the discount law, the law  on shopping hours postponed -- who is hindering liberal reforms?    [Rexrodt] These are functionaries of associations who want  to show their reason for existence by doing that. Their choice  of words concerning shopping hours and the discount law is no  longer acceptable. I have never seen such aggressive attacks by  lobbyists and clumsy references to the election behavior of  retail businessmen.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Let us come to Eko Stahl. Did you rely  on the wrong company when you relied on the Italian Riva  corporation?    [Rexrodt] No, there was no alternative. The Trust Agency's  choice was made under the precondition that an integrated steel  mill is to be built in Eisenhuettenstadt. The Thyssen plan did  not include this; the Hamburg Steel Mills plans were dubious for  other reasons. However, today we would do a few things  differently regarding the situation at Eko Stahl.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Like what?    [Rexrodt] Before an investor takeover, the personnel  situation would be settled better.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] What is going to happen now?    [Rexrodt] We are working on finding a prospect for Eko Stahl  that leads to an integrated steel mill. There are signs that  this is not completely unlikely.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Where do they come from?    [Rexrodt] Thyssen is willing to hold talks on cooperation.  If it is possible to find an international consortium, there is  the chance that a new technology can be established in  Eisenhuettenstadt.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Can such a consortium fulfill the  conditions posed by Brussels?    [Rexrodt] At the moment I do not think so. This is the big  problem. We have to hold new negotiations in Brussels.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] The recession seems to be overcome. What  do you want to do so that the labor market benefits from it?    [Rexrodt] We must continue flexibilization also if the  economic development eases the strain. The danger is that then  the need will abate and resistance will grow.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Which goal are you striving for?    [Rexrodt] We need a completely new world of work. People  must be able to choose more freely whether they want to work 20,  30, 40, or 50 hours per week. They should also be able to  distribute their annual work time and their life work time more  freely. This may mean that, on average, less is worked but by  far more people than today. Many would also work more. Of  course, the details are the problems -- from operational  processes to social insurance. But we must ask the classical  question about full employment in a new way. We need more  creativity and more courage in politics and in the companies.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] And we need new jobs. Where are they  supposed to develop?    [Rexrodt] In the families, for instance. Today paid work in  a household is mainly done by moonlighting. We must turn these  jobs into proper jobs by making the expenditures for them  deductible from taxes.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Where else could jobs be created?    [Rexrodt] The demand is enormous. Just think of nursing,  care, supervision, and simple work, such as in trade. I do not  want the American system, but some elements are good. It is  nice if you get the goods that you buy delivered. Now I already  hear the SPD: Rexrodt wants the unemployed to carry bags. Why  not, if useful services create jobs and make our lives more  pleasant? This is only one piece of a mosaic. And with  everything I said I quickly get 1 million jobs.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] How do you want to win the chancellor for  privatizing the savings banks?    [Rexrodt] This is probably not feasible. The chancellor and  his friend, Horst Koehler (the president of the savings banks --  the editor), are against that. But we need not start with the  savings banks. What I want is to overcome this mentality in the  communities, where everywhere the same small circle of people  sit together in the political bodies and public companies and  confirm to each other that privatization is not feasible.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] You complain about the tangle?    [Rexrodt] I would never use this term, but we must break up  what others call tangle.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] The privatization of waste disposal  benefits primarily large corporations.    [Rexrodt] I watch the development in the waste sector with  great concern. It is impossible that those who issue orders are  identical to those who get the orders in the long run, or that  large electricity companies also have the say in waste disposal.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] What can you do?    [Rexrodt] Just wait. I am clearly showing the instruments  of torture. This means the antitrust law. The Antitrust Office  is extremely vigilant. Now we must show the yellow card.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Was it your idea to call the FDP the  "party of high-wage earners?"    [Rexrodt] No. But you must see this in connection with the  discrimination of high-wage earners by Mr. Scharping, who  includes even people who earn average wages in this category.  We want to express our solidarity with those who perform most.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Has the quarrel hurt the FDP?    [Rexrodt] The zig-zag course was not fortunate. But the  discussion has shown where we stand. This is the main thing.    [WELT AM SONNTAG] Will this help the FDP to cross the  5-percent threshold in October?    [Rexrodt] I am convinced that the FDP will achieve a good  result. This begins at 7 percent. We will be clearly above  that. You mark my words.</p>

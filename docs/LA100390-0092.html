			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TORRES ASKS MORE CITY JOBS FOR LATINOS;  </P> <P> EMPLOYMENT: STATE SENATOR CALLS FOR REFORMS TO INCREASE HIRINGS AND PROMOTIONS.  HE SAYS COMMUNITY WON'T STAND FOR 'BLATANT INEQUITY.'  </P> <P> State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) complained to the Los Angeles City  Council Tuesday that Latinos are "severely under-represented" in city  government jobs and demanded a more aggressive affirmative action program.  </P> <P> Torres said he was "dismayed" by recent figures that show that Latinos make up  37% of the county's population but only 19.5% of the city's work force.  </P> <P> "The Latino community will no longer stand for this blatant inequity and  injustice," Torres said.  </P> <P> Over the last decade, Torres added, the city has made little progress in the  hiring and promotion of Latinos.  </P> <P> John J. Driscoll, general manager of the city's personnel department,  acknowledged that the underrepresentation of Latinos is "greater than any other  minority group in the city."  </P> <P> Driscoll attributed the continuing imbalance to a variety of causes, including  the tremendous Latino population increase in Southern California. "Every  employer's always slipping a little bit behind," he said.  </P> <P> Torres called on Mayor Tom Bradley and the City Council to enact a range of  reforms intended to boost Latino hiring and promotions. The first step, he  said, should be to establish an independent monitor to oversee all hirings,  promotions and transfers. The monitor would have the authority to demand an  explanation if future positions are not filled by Latinos, he said.  </P> <P> In a written statement Tuesday, Bradley called Torres' remarks "a positive  challenge" and said the city has an aggressive affirmative action program. But  the city's demographics are changing, he said, and the program may need to be  expanded. Bradley asked for a report from the city's personnel department  within 30 days.  </P> <P> Torres said he began to look into the city's hiring record after similar  problems emerged in August with in county government.  </P> <P> The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission accused the county of  discriminating against Latinos in hiring and promotions at its huge public  hospital system.  </P> <P> The figures announced Tuesday by Torres were obtained from the city, according  to an aide. They show that Latinos fared best in service and maintenance jobs,  where they make up 29.2% of the work force, still below their percentage in the  general population.  </P> <P> The problem exists throughout city departments, Torres said. Latinos make up  only 17.68% of the city attorney's 724 employees, 9% of the city controller's  employees and 19.3% of the employees of the mayor's office.  </P> <P> Driscoll said Tuesday the city has taken a number of steps in recent years to  step up recruitment and promotion of Latinos and members of other minority  groups.  </P> <P> He said the council created an affirmative action recruiting unit within the  personnel department and the city has instituted student worker and outreach  programs.  </P> <P> Driscoll said the city's civil service system includes rules that make climbing  the bureaucratic ladder a slow enterprise.  </P> <P> Further, 30% of the city's professional employees are engineers, but there are  few Latinos -- as well as blacks and women -- who graduate from college with  engineering degrees, he said.  </P></p>

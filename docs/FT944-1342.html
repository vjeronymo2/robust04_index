			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Madrid rocked by jailing Prime minister Felipe Gonzalez's government was embarrassed yesterday by the decision of one of Spain's top investigative magistrates, to imprison a former senior member of the interior ministry on counts of attempted murder, kidnapping and misuse of public funds. The development fuelled market nervousness in Spain where attention is already centred on investigations of Mr Mario Conde, who was dismissed by the Bank of Spain as chairman of Banesto a year ago. Mr Conde was questioned for the second consecutive day yesterday over alleged fraud in connection with the collapse of Banesto. Judge Baltasar Garzon jailed Mr Julian Sancristobal, director general of state security between 1984 and 1986, in connection with the activities of a group called GAL, Anti-terrorist Liberation Group, that claimed 23 fatal victims in a shooting and bombing campaign against suspected ETA Basque separatists in south west France 10 years ago. Included in the indictment are the former head of the anti-terrorist unit in the Basque city of Bilbao, who was jailed along with Mr Sancristobal, who was arrested yesterday at Barcelona airport when he was allegedly trying to leave Spain.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / MPs told of threat to police fight on laundering The ability of police to react efficiently to information on money laundering is being hampered by lack of resources, Mr Albert Pacey, director-general of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, told the Commons home affairs committee yesterday, Jimmy Burns writes. He said police had been 'inundated' with requests for information about money laundering following recent legislation aimed at curbing the growth of organised crime. Mr Pacey told the cross-party committee that the police would like to help more in tackling money laundering but did not have the staff to deal with the workload. Under the new legislation police and other enforcement agencies have increased powers to investigate bank accounts and businesses suspected of generating or transacting money as a result of criminal or terrorist activities.</p>

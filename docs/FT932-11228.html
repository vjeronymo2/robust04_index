			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Observer board backs sale to Guardian THE BOARD of The Observer, which includes independent directors, yesterday gave its unanimous backing to a sale of the Sunday title to The Guardian and Manchester Evening News. A statement issued last night said: 'The Observer board agreed unanimously that negotiations should proceed towards early finalisation of a contractual agreement with The Guardian.' Neither Observer directors nor Guardian management would comment further. The deal agreed in principle, however, is believed to value The Observer at about Pounds 27m - a sum that would be paid to Lonrho, owner of The Observer, over two years. Any transfer of ownership to GMEN would require the permission of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, under the provisions of the Fair Trading Act relating to newspaper mergers. A reference to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission is automatic unless Mr Heseltine is satisfied the paper was not economic as a going concern and that the case is urgent. The Observer is a loss-making paper but Mr Heseltine has made it clear to parliament that he could not reach a view until he can study the terms of any application.</p>

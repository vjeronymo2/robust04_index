			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's dilemma NORMAN LAMONT bears the scars of fruitless efforts to persuade the Bundesbank to do what it did voluntarily on Thursday. With the German discount rate at 5.75 per cent, which puts it below UK base rate for the first time for more than a year, his successor has reason to smile. A cut in interest rates has become easier to contemplate. Such a cut could sugar a bitter fiscal pill. By bringing forward a recovery in the continent, these lower interest rates should also help the British recovery. Their importance should not be exaggerated, however. Real short-term interest rates remain high in most continental countries, which suggests that recovery is likely to be long in coming and weak when it does come. The importance of continental recovery to the UK can also be exaggerated, even though continental markets take nearly two-thirds of the UK's exports. It is possible for the UK economy to grow when the continent is in recession. It has done so, for example, over the year to the third quarter of 1993, which saw a real increase of 2 per cent in UK gross domestic product. But high continental interest rates and recession mean that such growth must come at the price of lower interest rates and a lower exchange rate than would otherwise be required. This is not just unpopular abroad. It is also inflationary at home. In any case, the economy needs all the help it can get. Yesterday's preliminary statistics on third-quarter GDP show that the economy has been in recovery for at least five quarters. But output in the third quarter of 1993 was still 1.3 per cent below the level in the second quarter of 1990, while the economy has regained only two-thirds of the output it lost in the first two years of recession. How fast might it continue to recover? This week's report from the Treasury's panel of independent forecasters is guardedly optimistic. These worthies forecast growth of real GDP at between 1.6 and 3.3 per cent in 1994, between 2.4 and 3.4 per cent in 1995, and between 2.2 and 3.3 per cent in 1996. But note the range of disagreement. Note also that even under the most optimistic forecasts UK economic growth would average only around 1 1/2 per cent between 1990 and 1996. Mixed evidence As is to be expected at what remains a relatively early stage of the recovery, evidence on performance is mixed. But the retail sales data for September were encouraging, with a year-on-year increase of 3.5 per cent and a monthly rise of 0.5 per cent. The latest numbers for the money supply suggest that domestic demand may continue to pick up. Over the 12 months to September narrow money (M0) rose by 5.3 per cent and broad money (M4) by only 3.9 per cent. But over the latest three months the annualised rates of growth have risen to 6.9 and 4.7 per cent, respectively. These figures suggest recovery is in progress. The most disturbing counter-evidence is that for exports outside the European Community. The jump in the trade deficit to Pounds 1.1bn in September, from Pounds 0.7bn in August, may not mean that much. But it is depressing that the volume of exports outside the EC (excluding oil and erratics) was up only 1 per cent in the latest quarter over the three months ending June 1993, while import volume was up 1 1/2 per cent. Hoped-for bounce The devaluation has failed to give British exports the hoped-for bounce. This is not that surprising when British exporters have increased the unit value of their exports (excluding oil) by 5 1/2 per cent between the last two quarters, while the unit value of UK imports has risen not at all. The chancellor presides over an economy that is enjoying a modest recovery led by domestic demand. What is not obvious is that he presides over an economy which needs a further vigorous push, though some easing may be justified. The main question he faces is how to combine such easing with the need to rein in the fiscal deficit. The Green Budget from the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Goldman Sachs argues, for example, that even under modestly optimistic growth assumptions, the public sector borrowing requirement would still be 3.6 per cent of GDP in 1997-98. Politics demand that the chancellor announce most of the painful medicine now. Economics suggest that a sustainable fiscal position must be offered if inflationary expectations are to remain as subdued as they seem. The solution would be to announce tax increases that the chancellor would want to make in any case, but implement some of them in future years. The required adjustment would be at least 1 per cent of GDP, or Pounds 6bn. If the economy were to do better than now feared, reductions in taxes could be introduced to offset these pre-announced increases. In addition, there is always the possibility of lower base rates. The Bundesbank should cut again in coming months, which will give Mr Clarke still more room for manoeuvre. The rebalancing of fiscal and monetary policy has begun. The budget is likely to see the process continue.</p>

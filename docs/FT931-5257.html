			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Britannia's guaranteed return - At a Glance Britannia Building Society has launched a new guaranteed account which has a three year period, shorter than most other guaranteed products. However, the method of calculating the investor's gain is quite different; rather than the rise in the FT-SE 100 over the years, the investor's gain is 112.5 per cent of the difference between the average of the FT-SE's level one, two and three years hence, and the original level. So if FT-SE starts at 3,000 and reaches 3,200, 3,400 and 3,600 in successive years, the gain will be around 15 per cent. The gain is net of basic rate tax; non-taxpayers can reclaim the excess.</p>

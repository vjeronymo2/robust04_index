Goswami, 54, of Long Beach was ordered by Municipal Judge Suzanne  Person to surrender next Thursday to begin serving the house arrest in a room  at the four-story, 197-unit residential hotel at 626 S. Alvarado St.  </P> <P> "Goswami has virtually ignored his legal responsibilities to maintain this  hotel for over a year and half, and now the time has come for him to begin  paying the price for that neglect and indifference," City Atty. James K. Hahn  said.  </P></p>

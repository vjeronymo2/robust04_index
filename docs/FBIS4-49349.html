			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [XINHUA "News Analysis" by Xia Haitao and Liu Shun: "Chances </F> of Palestinian Self-Rule"]    [Text] Cairo, May 4 (XINHUA) -- Overlooked by two  background statues of a young girl holding a peace dove,  Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin today put seal to the Gaza-Jericho self-rule  agreement which aims to bring peace to the two antagonistic  peoples.    The historic scene, witnessed by more than 2,000 dignitaries  and guests at the Cairo International Conference Center, marks a  "new dawn" to the people in Gaza and Jericho, as chief PLO  negotiator Nabil Shaath put it. It opens a new page in the  Palestinian annals which up till now have been soaked in blood  and tears.    For the Palestinians in the occupied land, what the  self-rule  agreement means most is that it gives them sovereignty symbols  -- the power of legislation, their own passports, postage stamps  and area code, their own airline, radio and TV stations, the  right to fish freely in their own territorial seas and above  all, they will see their own armed policemen patrolling the  streets instead of facing the black barrels of Israeli guns.    To run the self-rule regions, the PLO Executive Committee  has  named a 25-member National Authority Council. It will be headed  by 'Arafat, who is expected to enter into Gaza and Jericho in  early June, and made up of 12 people from the occupied  territories and the diaspora respectively, assuring a political  leadership at long last to the Palestinians in the occupied  territories.    Poor and neglected as it is in the occupied land, economic  development occupies a top priority for the Palestinian autonomy  government, and it has its chances.    Of the several joint PLO-Israeli coordination committees,  the  economic coordination committee has reaped good results in their  negotiations. They signed an economic pact in Paris on April  29. The self-rule authority will establish a monetary mechanism,  manage foreign currency reserves, conduct its own direct tax  policy and run its own import and export business.    Long sufferings of the Palestinians have drawn world-wide  sympathy. More than 40 countries have offered to supply 2  billion U.S. dollars to aid the self-rule which also provides  good investment opportunities for the successful Palestinian  financers and entrepreneurs in the diaspora.    With a level of self-controlled economic institutions at  home  and assistance offers worldwide, the self-rule authority could  do something to the occupation-shattered economy.    From being occupied to self-rule is a drastic turn that  unavoidably invites post-occupation frictions and uncertainties.  Besides the continuing joint committees on liaison, security and  civil affairs, two dispute committees and a trilateral  cooperation and coordination mechanism set up by the self-rule  agreement are meant to this rescue.    As 'Arafat put it Monday [2 May], the Gaza-Jericho self-rule  agreement is an initial step toward the establishment of a  Palestinian state and Israeli withdrawal from all occupied lands  including Jerusalem. The more difficult negotiations on the  final status of the occupied territories lie ahead and there is  a long way to go to achieve a complete resolution of the  Palestinian issue.    This initial step, which leads to partial Israeli withdrawal  from the occupied land, will have political and psychological  effects on the Palestinians and Arabs. It will enable the Arab  parties concerned, Israel and world powers to focus their  efforts on other tracks of Arab-Israeli negotiations,  particularly the Syrian-Israeli track.    In two weeks time, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher  will begin another diplomatic shuttle in the Middle East region.  He said he would mainly push forward the Syrian-Israeli talks.  The impetus the agreement on the implementation of the  self-rule in Gaza and Jericho gave to the whole Middle East  peace process is obviously felt.</p>

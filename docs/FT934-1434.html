			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Finance and the Family: Your starters for '94 - Philip Coggan asks stockbrokers for their trust predictions Stockbrokers can be right after all. Last year, the Weekend FT asked four private client brokers to select three unit or investment trusts for 1993. All picked portfolios which outperformed the All-Share index, even allowing for dividend income, and three beat the sector average for investment trusts. It was a very good year for owners of investment trust shares. The FT-A investment trust index has risen 39.2 per cent to date, benefiting from a narrowing discount and the strong performance of overseas stock markets. Even so, our experts, who produced returns ranging from 26.8 to 58.1 per cent, did extremely well. Thus encouraged, we asked them to repeat the exercise for 1994. Paul Killik, of Killik &amp; Co, was the top performer for 1993. He says: 'Having focused on the UK market for 1993, I am introducing a stronger international flavour for 1994. With higher income trusts looking expensive, I have given income a lower priority. 'Once again, I am leading with Law Debenture. The trust offers an attractive combination of a yield only slightly below the market, a broad international spread of investments with 37 per cent overseas, and a first class record of asset growth. The published premium to asset value is misleading as it places no value on the company's fiduciary business. The trust, managed by Henderson Touche Remnant, is Pep-qualifying. 'Pantheon International Participations would be classed as a higher risk holding because it involves investment in unquoted companies. However, as the trust invests in other venture capital funds, rather than directly into the companies themselves, the assets are very broadly spread. With 47 per cent in the UK and 45 per cent in the US, I consider Pantheon an attractive vehicle in which to participate in the recovery of smaller unquoted businesses. 'The ordinary shares of TR Technology are a more speculative investment as they are considerably geared. The trust invests in international high technology companies and has 47 per cent in the UK and 43 per cent in the US. It is due to be wound up in 1998, and zero and stepped preference shares have first call on the assets, at a cost of Pounds 258m. The whole trust is valued at about Pounds 265m and the excess is available on wind-up to the 36m ordinaries' (ie around 20p per share at present). The selections of Edwin Lilley, of Bell Lawrie White, have produced a return of 52 per cent. Lilley says: 'I have a curious sense of deja vu as I look forward to 1994. 'Most of our hopes for 1993 have yet to be fulfilled - Japan and large tracts of Europe are in recession, while the improvement in the US and UK has been sluggish at best, and real interest rates are still too high. Against this background the selections for last year could still do well in 1994. 'However, my selections start with Monks Investment Trust. It is difficult to ignore the large generalists and Monks remains among my favourites. Baillie Gifford comes across as a fairly conservative house but it is prepared to take big bets within Monks, both at the stock and country level. Intelligent use of gearing has also consistently enhanced the growth in assets and has helped on the revenue side. A sound core holding. 'The emphasis in Murray Smaller Markets has been switched back to smaller and less accessible markets, with exposure to Japan and the US now almost negligible. The smaller markets in Asia and Latin America now account for nearly half of the portfolio. It almost falls into the emerging markets category, but the manager has the freedom to move back into larger markets if circumstances dictate. This flexibility gives the trust a distinct advantage over the emerging market specialists. 'Fleming Far Eastern provides exposure to the Far East, including Japan. It invests, therefore, in some of the most dynamic regions in the World. Japan is a problem area, but one cannot discount the possibility that the authorities will take further measures to stimulate the economy. Fleming has an established reputation for investment in this area.' Brian Tora, of Greig Middleton, whose selections rose 45.1 per cent, feels inclined 'to play the geographic game, backed with management I feel I can rely on.' Tora says: 'If Europe does come out of recession next year, then the continental bourses may have further to go, so I would plump for Fidelity European Values. In Anthony Bolton, it has one of the most respected European fund managers. The fund has large concentrations in the more familiar markets of France, Holland and Germany but is also invested in peripheral areas, such as southern Europe, and has a heavy weighting in Scandinavia. 'The recently issued Fleming Chinese Fund could also be added to a portfolio, providing the investor has either banked some of the gains achieved last year or is able to sit out the short-term fluctuations that might arise. If like me, you believe the capitalist revolution in China is unstoppable, then this has to be an integral part of any long term growth portfolio. 'Finally, for those with a nose for special situations, the Sphere Investment Trust income shares look interesting at their price of 41p. The trust yields 9.5 per cent, so at least it should pay its way. If the stock market continues its upward path, there could be a useful gain from the gearing element. Of particular interest, however, is the fact that the trust has only 18 months left to run. Already, we are seeing an increasing number of restructurings as fund managers seek to retain the money they have been managing. It would not surprise me if something similar happened to Sphere. ' The first pick of Nigel Sidebottom, of Gerrard Vivian Gray (who managed 26.8 per cent from his 1993 picks), is a Lloyd's vehicle, Premium Trust, which was launched in December in parallel with its sister company, Premium Underwriting. Sidebottom says: 'Premium Trust raised Pounds 19.8m but benefits from a Pounds 12.2m free loan from Premium Underwriting. In return for the loan, PT's capital is pledged to Lloyd's to enable PU to increase its underwriting capacity. 'The attraction of this arrangement for PT is the benefit of the interest free loan. The effective cost of the loan is the risk that the capital will be called to cover Lloyd's losses incurred by PU. However, shareholders in PT can be comforted by the fact that PU will reserve a third of underwriting profits against future losses. 'PT will be managed by Martin Currie, which will pursue a similar investment strategy to that adopted for Securities Trust of Scotland - namely, an international portfolio providing an above average income. PT is trading on a wider discount than Securities Trust. 'The market is, therefore, putting no value on the interest free loan, despite the yield enhancement of around 3-5 per cent and the gearing effect if assets rise. In my view, the shares should trade at a premium to asset value.' For his second choice, Sidebottom picks the zeros of Gartmore Shared Equity. 'With interest rates still falling, net returns from cash deposits and gilts hold little attraction. Zero dividend preference shares are still a must for taxpayers who are not making full use of their annual CGT allowance, and are wary of committing too much money to the equity market. 'The Gartmore zeros redeem on April 30 2002 at a price of 198.8p, and the final redemption value is already covered over 1.2 times. If held to redemption, the shares will provide an annual compound growth of 7.9 per cent. The trust's underlying portfolio would have to fall by 17 per cent between now and April 2002 before the return from the zeros would be diminished. 'Emerging market funds had an excellent run in 1993 but still have plenty to offer. With individual markets highly volatile, one should select a well managed global fund such as Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets. 'At the year-end, the trust had 37 per cent in the Far East with the largest holdings being in Malaysia, South Korea and Hong Kong, the latter being used primarily as a means of gaining exposure to China. Around 36 per cent of the portfolio was in Latin America, with the largest holdings in Mexico and Argentina. 'The shares trade at a premium to asset value but alternatives, such as Templeton Emerging Markets, are on even greater premiums.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                Paul Killik's 1994 selections  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Trust                        Price (p)    Yield (%)    Discount*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Law Debenture                745          3.1          -15.0 Pantheon International       191          0.3          10.2 TR Technology Ord            131          1.7          **  --------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993 selections Trust                                                  % gain????

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures moved ahead strongly, with the premium to the cash market widening dramatically once the December contract had expired at 10.30am, writes Jeffrey Brown. The FT-SE 100 March contract was at 3,043 at the close of pit trading, up 49 points. The premium to cash equities was 30 points, or 12 points above the middle range of brokers' estimates of fair value. To some extent the future was bouncing off the uncertainty created by the expiry of the December counter, but activity was low.</p>

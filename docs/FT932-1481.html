			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fox goes back to the future THE LONDON Futures and Options Exchange is celebrating its return to the black by killing off the much ridiculed acronym of London Fox with which it has been saddled for the last six years. Next week Mr Robin Woodhead, Fox chief executive, will announce 'a small surplus' after five years of operating losses. 'We have been successful at turning the unpleasant loss-making tide,' says Mr Woodhead, who took up his post in October last year. The exchange will revert to being called the London Commodity Exchange from July 1. But there will be no Pounds 30,000 daytime firework display to herald the name change, as there was in June 1987. Then the exchange was using US-style razzamatazz in a bid to attract attention and win business away from the booming US exchanges. Ironically, one of the main reasons the name is being changed again is that few people in the US know what London Fox is. Mr Woodhead and Mr Michael Jenkins, chairman of Fox and former chief executive of the London International Financial Futures Exchange, are determined to leave Fox's unhappy history behind. The exchange, which has had to close several contracts including raw sugar, last year made a loss of Pounds 691,000 on revenue of Pounds 10m, mainly because of exceptional costs of nearly Pounds 1m following the debacle over its property futures contract in September 1991. First steps towards setting the exchange on a new course have included cutting staff to 83 from 120 and operating costs to Pounds 6.3m from Pounds 10m two years ago. Mr Woodhead says the exchange now needs to trade 9,600 lots a day to cover costs, compared with nearly 21,000 in 1991-92 and the present average of about 11,500. In the longer term the exchange aims to concentrate on its core contracts of cocoa, coffee and white sugar, plus their traded options. Mr Woodhead says it will work to improve its image and to make sure its trading practices are impeccable. A review of the contracts that came with the take-over of the Baltic Futures Exchange - including grain and freight rate futures - will be discussed by the board in August. The exchange is keen to attract more of the Dollars 25bn trade controlled by managed futures funds. 'The US funds have primarily been interested in the US markets - but many are looking to diversify internationally,' says Mr Jenkins.</p>

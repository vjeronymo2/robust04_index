			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> .. . AND HIS CLEAN-AIR PLAN  </P> <P> Mayor Tom Bradley's list of 63 steps toward cleaner air for the city of Los  Angeles is a recent example of the way he is blending good politics and good  government these days.  </P> <P> The list was put together under duress in an effort to satisfy the federal  Environmental Protection Agency that Los Angeles is serious about fighting  smog, but that fact does not detract from the basic good sense of the list  itself.  </P> <P> To begin with, many of the proposals deal with eliminating a need for travel  between work and home -- something that also would eliminate smog. One step  toward that goal would be to require developers of office space to build  housing at the same time and in the same general neighborhood as the office  space.  </P> <P> Another transportation proposal would eliminate most free parking in the city,  including spaces at big shopping malls, except for car and van pools and for  cars that park so that drivers and passengers can transfer to public transit.  The concept is that high parking charges discourage commuters from traveling  alone, thus getting more efficient use of every lane of highway and freeway.  </P> <P> New construction would be concentrated along the route of Metro Rail and in  busy bus corridors, again allowing growth in floor space without a need for  growth in transportation.  </P> <P> But perhaps the best thing about the list is that it makes it easier to see on  a smaller scale than the entire four-county air basin how little people will  have to change the way they live in order to get cleaner air. As with the rest  of City Hall's new look, the list is just a collection of ideas. Translating  them into law is the job by which the mayor will be judged in the future.  </P></p>

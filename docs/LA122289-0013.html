			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> PINING FOR AN OLD-FASHIONED TREE  </P> <P> One of the more visible and pleasant signs of the holiday season is the  Christmas tree. Most public places and office buildings, including the lobby of  The Times, display one.  </P> <P> And because of the generosity of one company, 230 Santa Ana schoolchildren with  fine attendance records have received a tree as a gift this year. The 6- to  7-foot firs were given to the children by the school district and J.M. Peters  Co., a Newport Beach developer. Children from needy families were singled out.  Had they not been rewarded with the gift, the children might not have had a  tree this year.  </P> <P> Their trees will not be exactly like the 17-foot specimen in the lobby of  Orange County Edition of The Times in Costa Mesa. That tree is perfectly  shaped, right up to its top branches. It is a dark, healthy-looking green.  </P> <P> Upon closer inspection, however, one can see that Mother Nature was given a  little help: where the tall fir was a little sparse, branches had been nailed  to its trunk to fill in, held up with wires. The tree came with instructions:  "Paint green and flock ends." We are surprised they didn't add: "Spray with  pine scent daily."  </P> <P> Somehow all this takes some of the mystique away. It's a little like plastic  surgery: more fun if no one knows about it. And it's something like gazing at a  beautiful sunset and saying, "Now, if it just had a little more red right  there. . . ."  </P> <P> No matter the perfection of a tree, it brings a certain happy feeling to the  holiday season. We're glad that the Santa Ana schoolchildren will get to share  that, too.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Our correspondent has met at Boryspil airport with  a Ukrainian parliamentary delegation headed by Oleksandr  Tkachenko, first deputy chairman of the Supreme Council. The  Ukrainian parliamentarians returned today after participating in  a session of the Black Sea Parliamentary Assembly in Bucharest.  Among those who met the delegation at the airport was Romanian  Ambassador to Ukraine Ion Bistreanu. Now, let us listen to an  interview with Oleksandr Mykolayovych Tkachenko, conducted  immediately after the delegation's arrival.    [Begin Tkachenko recording] The assembly of nine European  and Asian states aims at uniting their efforts after the Council  for Mutual Economic Assistance ceased to exist. We believe that  Ukraine has made a correct step by joining the Black Sea  Assembly. The topics discussed at this session, and it was  already the third one, primarily concerned economic issues, as  well as the role and place of Ukraine among other states [words  indistinct]. The third topic discussed concerned cultural and  social ties among our states. In addition to these nine states,  Bulgaria and Greece were invited to participate in the Black  Sea Assembly session as observers, and we believe that they will  join this organization in the near future.    We believe that the Ukrainian delegation accomplished its  mission, because we defended our position, which envisions that  the next assembly session will be chaired by Supreme Council  Chairman Oleksandr Moroz. [Words indistinct] Ukraine will be  chairing the assembly during this period. [end recording]</p>

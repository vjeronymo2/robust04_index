			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> FOG SHROUDS ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> A thick blanket of fog covered most of Orange County's coastal communities  early this morning, prompting partial closure of John Wayne Airport and  snarling rush-hour traffic along the San Diego Freeway, authorities said.  </P> <P> "Visibility here is zero," Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Joe Davies  said at 8:30 a.m. from the John Wayne Airport tower.  </P> <P> Davies said all early morning commercial flights, which normally begin at 7  a.m., were either canceled or delayed. Flights resumed about 9 a.m., but the  changes in flight schedules forced air commuters to make last-minute  adjustments to their plans.  </P> <P> "We sat in the plane for about an hour, then were told to wait," said Greg  Paydock, one of dozens of businessmen scrambling to banks of phone booths.  "That was frustrating."  </P> <P> Other passengers sat in the airport coffee shops and bars or browsed in the  gift shops to pass the time. Some even caught a quick nap.  </P> <P> "You can hang him from a meat hook, and he'll fall asleep," said Irvine  businessman Pat Diamond about his partner, Phil McCarty, as the latter slouched  in a chair, lost in sleep.  </P> <P> Rick Dittman, a meteorologist for WeatherData, based in Wichita, Kan, said the  fog caused problems in many parts of the state.  </P> <P> "The fog is pretty much widespread up and down the coast," he said, adding that  the fog was created by a storm front in the Gulf of Alaska.  </P> <P> Law-enforcement authorities reported numerous rush-hour traffic collisions as  motorists tried to get to work in visibility as low as 25 feet.  </P></p>

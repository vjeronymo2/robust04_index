			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Incentives drive Ford back to US top spot FORD Motor yesterday claimed a significant symbolic victory over Japan when its Taurus mid-sized car narrowly beat the Honda Accord to be the top-selling car in the US in 1992. The Accord has held the number one position since 1989. Ford's recapture of the top spot will be taken as a further sign of the renewed competitiveness of the US motor industry against Japanese rivals, which was indicated yesterday by 1992 sales figures for the US vehicle industry as a whole. Ford saw its car and light truck sales rise 11.2 per cent to 3,233,502 units. Troubled General Motors saw a 1.8 per cent increase to 4,449,878. Among the major Japanese manufacturers, Toyota increased its sales 1 per cent to 1,023,641. Nissan was virtually unchanged at 578,844, while Honda sales dipped 4 per cent to 768,845. According to Ford's estimates, the total US car and light truck market rose 4 per cent over 1991 to 13.1m units. The Ford Taurus, relaunched in late 1991, sold 409,751 units, up from 299,700, while the Honda Accord dipped from 399,297 to 393,477. However, Ford's victory was only achieved through offering big discounts and cheap lease finance to customers. The drive began in August and reached a peak last month as the company scrambled to close the gap with Honda. Ford offered even more lavish incentives, including rebates to dealers willing to put additional Tauruses into their demonstration fleets. Honda replied with cheap financial packages of its own. Ford was also helped both by its far greater number of dealer outlets across the US - some 4,300 to Honda's 1,000 - and the fact that while Honda's sales go mainly to retail customers, a large proportion of Tauruses go to fleet buyers, such as rental companies. Nevertheless, Ford will use the victory as an important marketing tool and plans a major television advertising campaign. Dr David Cole, an automobile expert at the University of Michigan, said that yesterday's figures were an indication that the US was 'at the threshold of building a very powerful industry. The Japanese are scared to death.' However, other analysts said the Japanese were holding their fire in the battle for market share, lest they be accused of causing further job losses at ailing General Motors.</p>

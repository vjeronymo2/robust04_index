			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Standard bearers - Writing the norms for products and services is moving centre-stage Creating standards for industry is the essential but humdrum task of an army of committees. Now, however, a rumbling controversy about one particular UK standard, BS 5750, regulating quality assurance systems, has focused attention on the standards and the organisations which write and police them. Small firms have complained that BS5750 is unduly bureaucratic and is being foisted on them by their large customers. Others say the standard has been widely misunderstood as guaranteeing product or service quality, whereas it really only guarantees consistency in the way systems are operated. At the same time, the establishment of the single European market and the prospect of the enlargement of the European Community have increased pressure on the committee draughtsmen to produce a pan-European library of standards so that products and services can cross borders more easily. This spotlight on the traditionally low-key world of standard-writing has revealed the intensely commercial nature of the standards industry. Creating, monitoring and testing standards can be big business for the organisations involved and can produce lucrative spin-offs for the consultants who help companies meet the criteria set. In a broader context, nations can gain a crucial competitive advantage by ensuring that their standards are the ones which determine international norms. Britain, France and Germany have each been responsible for drawing up more than 20 per cent of international standards. The Japanese, for all their well-earned reputation for manufacturing quality, have contributed only about 2 per cent but are showing an increasing interest. US standards organisations, meanwhile, are fragmented and lack a coherent voice in international standard-setting. Despite the importance of standards to industry, the process by which standards are created and the organisations involved in the task are a mystery to most outsiders. The picture is made no clearer by the range of overlapping national, European and international bodies involved and the pea-soup of acronyms used to label the organisations and the standards they produce. In Britain, for example, the British Standards Institution, co-ordinates - but does not control - the writing of new standards. At the European level, most standards are set by CEN, the European Committee for Standardisation, but electrical products and telecommunications have their own organisations. International standards, in turn, are set by the Geneva-based International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO). Once again, however, electrical standards are created by a different organisation. The result is that the same standard can appear in many different guises. BS5750, the British quality assurance standard, pops up in continental Europe as EN29000 and on the international stage as ISO9000. BSI is unique among world standards organisations in having responsibility for overseeing the writing of standards as well as the capacity to test products to see they meet the standard and to certify companies. Its counterparts in Germany, DIN, and France, AFNOR, restrict themselves to standards writing. The breadth of BSI's activities, and its status as an 'institution' incorporated by Royal Charter, provide the organisation with a considerable marketing advantage. In fact, testing and certification are intensely competitive and there are no fewer than 26 organisations which have been accredited to certify products and companies. Some are small, newly created consultancies, while others are large, long-established companies such as SGS Yarsley, Lloyd's Register Quality Assurance and Bureau Veritas. 'BSI does nothing to reduce the impression (that it has a special status) but we compete by being more efficient, offering a better service and on price,' says Ian Williams, UK chief executive of SGS Yarsley. 'We aim to give our client more than just a certificate on his wall.' Just who can issue certificates is also a subject of some complexity. In theory anyone can set up in business to check that companies meet a particular standard. In practice the certification companies must themselves be accredited. In the UK this is controlled by the National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies but accreditation is catching on around the world. The council does not give blanket approval to a certification organisation but accredits them by industry. BSI is accredited for 900 of the 1,000 or so standard industrial classifications. SGS Yarsley has made a speciality of the health care and software sectors. Despite the move to creating more European standards, certification and testing are still carried out on a national basis and seals of approval and certificates are not always acceptable to customers in other countries. It was to overcome this problem that the European Organisation for Testing and Certification was set up, after a two-year trial, last January. The aim is to persuade testing laboratories and certification bodies to recognise each other's work and agreement has already been reached in the information technology and electrical sectors. The UK already has some 11,000 standards covering everything from the dimensions of twist drills, through the lower explosion limits of coating powders and methods of testing cereals, to the fungal resistance of wood panels. In addition, there are about 2,500 European standards, though many overlap. Despite these impressive numbers there is no slackening of demand both for new standards and the updating of old ones. 'There is always more demand than we can meet, and the single market and new technologies mean it will go on increasing,' says Michael Sanderson, BSI chief executive. Requests for standards come from government departments - the Treasury has put in a request for a credit management standard - from individual companies and from trade associations. When a request comes in, BSI's standards-making division puts together a drafting committee made up, where appropriate, of manufacturers, purchasers, local authorities, government departments, trade associations and consumers. Representatives give their time free and do not claim expenses. No fewer than 35 organisations sat on the committee which last year drew up BS7750, specifying environmental management systems. 'It can be a thankless task, trying to bring together mutually antagonistic forces,' comments Sanderson, 'But we have been doing it for 90 years and we have got quite good at it.' Once a draft has been agreed, it is made available for public comment for a three-month period. It is often difficult to achieve agreement at a national level, but a further complication is added if, as frequently happens, the standard has international implications. BSI will then send a representative to CEN or ISO to steer the standard through the European or the international discussions. From gleam in the eye to published document takes, on average, two years in the UK, four years in Europe and more than six years at international level, says Sanderson. He claims that Britain has a better record than many other countries for piloting European and international standards through the committee maze on time and close to the original specification. Once a standard has been written, companies may buy a copy and then apply its criteria to their products or services or their entire operation. If they can meet the standard's specifications, they may then attach the appropriate seal, often in the UK the BSI's Kitemark. Regular testing and inspections continue for as long as the company continues to comply with the standard. In theory, companies could falsely claim compliance but competitors will be quick to point this out. Customers also provide an important control mechanism and local authority trading standards officers keep a close watch. Despite their importance to industry, standards have been very much a back-room activity, largely because each one is specific to a particular industry sector. But, as more and more 'horizontal' standards are created, covering areas such as quality assurance and environmental management and applicable to companies across a broad swathe of industry, they will move to centre stage.</p>

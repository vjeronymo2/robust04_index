			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 12 Jan (PL) -- A top Communist Party of Cuba  (PCC) official asserted today that, although difficulties will  continue in 1994, the country will have greater chances of  advancing in its attempts to resolve the adverse economic  situation.    I see a very solid and strong future for the revolution,  considering the support of the great majority of our people and  the great deal of optimism that exists, to continue to confront  difficulties, PCC Central Committee member Jorge Lezcano told  PRENSA LATINA.    Lezcano, first secretary of the PCC in Havana, explained  that  although the same basic economic factors that created conditions  in 1993 will continue this year, the country will have a few  more advantages and opportunities.    According to Lezcano, we have the experience of having  confronted and overcome a year as difficult as 1993, we know  what to do to confront the problems that arise, and we have  become better organized in facing the special period. I believe  all of this will work in our favor, he underlined.    The Special Period in Times of Peace is the name given to  the  measures Cuba has had to adopt to confront the consequences  prompted by the collapse of socialism in Eastern Europe and the  former Soviet Union -- nations with which Cuba sustained 85  percent of its trade.    In addition to the abrupt loss of its main trading partners,  the island has had to confront the hardening of the U.S.  blockade, which has been in effect for more than 30 years.    Meanwhile, Lezcano said, there are other factors that will  differentiate the situation between both 12-month periods, and  he recalled that the prolonged electricity cuts and the  paralysis of the factories in the capital city and the rest of  the country had started in 1993.    We have started January 1994 with all factories operating,  albeit with limitations, but nevertheless operating and with  less stringent electricity cuts scheduled than in 1993, he noted.    According to Lezcano, this year should also yield the  expected positive results, especially in terms of savings and  the optimal use of resources because of the new system of state  land cultivation called Basic Cooperative Production Units  (UBPC).    The new system establishes that plots are given to the  associates in usufruct for an indefinite amount of time. They  also receive soft loans to acquire working equipment and are the  owners of the crops they produce. It is estimated that those  measures will propitiate a food production increase, he added.    The UBPC's started operating last October and currently  exist  in almost all the former state farms.    The party leader also pointed out that one of the positive  factors expected for this year is an improved sugarcane harvest.  Last year, the harvest yielded 4.2 million tons of sugar -- the  lowest since 1963.    Lezcano pointed to favorable elements in the international  sphere and, among others, he mentioned the considerable decrease  in oil prices, which will help the country because it imports  almost all the fuel it uses.    For these reasons, among others, he maintained, we assert  that, although there will be difficulties and problems, the work  perspectives for our people and for the revolution are somewhat  better than they were in 1993. This leeway allows us more  possibilities to get ahead.</p>

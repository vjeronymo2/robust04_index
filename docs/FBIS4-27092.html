			<p>BFN     [Text] The Asia-Pacific Conference on East Timor [APCET]  will go ahead. The Supreme Court has removed the legal  obstacles to the holding of the conference after nullifying the  order earlier issued by Judge Marciano Bacalla of the Quezon  City Regional Trial Court which prevents the holding of the  conference.    The Supreme Court ordered Bacalla to desist from  implementing the restraining order which prevented the  organizers of APCET from holding the conference inside the  University of the Philippines [UP].    A few minutes after hearing the Supreme Court's decision,  the  APCET organizers said the conference will go ahead, starting at  0700.    Meanwhile, Judge Bacalla said that he will abide by the  Supreme Court decision annulling his order.    The Supreme Court, however, supports Ramos' order banning  foreigners attending the conference.    In the meantime, APCET organizers have already started the  registration of delegates to the conference, scheduled to start  at 0700 at the Malcolm Hall of UP-Diliman.    As of the time of publication, 20 foreign delegates have  registered. The organizers explained that it is still not final  as to where the conference will be held. Aside from UP-Diliman,  other venues are being considered like the San Jose Seminary and  UP-Manila.    According to a report, 40 more foreign delegates are  expected  to arrive today. Among the expected delegates is a Japanese who  is a member of the Diet, identified as Assemblyman (Gona). Gona  is scheduled to arrive tonight.    Immigration personnel are still on alert at the Ninoy Aquino  International Airport [NAIA] to implement the ban on foreign  delegates attending the conference.    In this regard, two delegates are currently being  investigated at the immigration office in NAIA. Those being  questioned are Timorese Zacarias Dakosta of the Timorese  Democratic Union and Harold Nuncio, who holds an Australian  passport.</p>

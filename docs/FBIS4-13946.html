			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, planning and </F> development minister, leader of the General People's Congress,  and former north Yemeni prime minister and foreign minister, by  Majdi al-Daqqaq in Cairo "a few days ago"]    [Text] [Al-Daqqaq] It appears that the situation in Yemen  now has exceeded all expectations and the crisis has produced a  new situation. How do you see it?    [Al-Iryani] Yes. A crisis of this kind can only bring  something new. Let me say first that the Pledge and Accord  Document did not introduce new ideas regarding the principles of  the state structure. Much of what was contained in it was  derived from the proposed constitutional amendments that were  agreed upon between the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] and the  General People's Congress [GPC] and then among the government  coalition parties. The amendments we agreed upon, particularly  regarding local government, went further than what we had agreed  upon in the Pledge and Accord Document. The concerns that the  parties had regarding laying the foundations for the single  Yemeni state were considered during the interim period.  Therefore, they were not the result of the crisis itself.    The purpose of initiating the crisis was not to achieve what  was contained in the document, because it was clear that the  Pledge and Accord Document does not mean the end for the YSP.  It had other designs, particularly regarding the issue of the  single Yemeni state.    During the dialogue, the federalism balloon was released,  and  the party began exercising the powers of a separate government  in what was known as the south. It became clear that federalism  meant clearly the federalism of the (former) north and south.    It is certain that the YSP was not thinking about anything  that applies to the new unified Yemen. Its views were based on  the old division. Therefore, the Pledge and Accord Document did  not fulfill the purpose of the party. As far as it was  concerned, the document was not the end. Had the party viewed  it as its ultimate objective, it would have ended the crisis.  Therefore, I think that the party wants to impose its way of  managing this crisis on the Yemeni people in order to achieve a  result satisfactory to the party first and foremost.    [Al-Daqqaq] Is the focus of the discussion now the return of  the army to the positions that it held before 22 May 1990?    [Al-Iryani] Yes. What we are actually seeing is an attempt  for a total split.    [Al-Daqqaq] Therefore, are we about to witness an imminent  extensive clash?    [Al-Iryani] The brothers in the YSP have clearly declared  that they will not submit to the numerical majority, and  constitutional legitimacy is based on the numerical majority.  That was the rocket with which they destroyed all the  legislative and executive institutions on the pretext that the  party will not accept submission to majority rule. In that  case, there was nothing we could do but to treat the party as a  rebellious group that does not accept constitutional rules.  This, of course, would lead to conflict. The YPC's strategy  has always been to avoid involving the Yemenis in fighting.    We have assumed, rightly or wrongly, that the imposition of  constitutional legitimacy is bound to involve the use of force.  Therefore, we waived the right to impose constitutional  legitimacy in order not to resort to force. The YSP exploited  this emotional weakness of the YPC and its leaders and their  lack of desire to shed Yemeni blood. In my opinion, had the  executive and legislative authorities used their constitutional  right, the party would have been the first to use force.    [Al-Daqqaq] How long will that situation continue? Do you  not agree with me that the whole of Yemen is in a real  predicament?    [Al-Iryani] Let us go back to the Pledge and Accord Document  which--despite what the YSP says about it is the criterion by  which we should be bound, now that the people's control over  their constitutional institutions is held up by the YSP's will.    The document has become binding for the party at the local,  Arab, and world levels. The party could have ruined everything  before the document was signed. It is hard for it now to  discredit the document.    The document has a provision to prevent the use of force in  case of a political dispute. It also has a provision that  prevents the introduction of any change in the military setup as  well as on building a simple, rather than complex, Yemeni state,  as the party puts it.    If this military aspect of the document is implemented, I  believe that we can start to emerge from the crisis, not by  coercing the YSP, but by knowing where its road ends.  Personally, I cannot know the end of the party's road. That is  unless it ends up "drawing power from the military" rather than  from the majority. The party imposes that kind of power,  because it draws power from the military rather than from the  majority, which is the modern and civilized democratic principle.    [Al-Daqqaq] Have Arab mediation efforts succeeded in  steering  the crisis toward a solution?    [Al-Iryani] Mediators talk about ways out of the crisis.  Serious mediation was based on a united Yemeni state. No  mediator has requested anything different.    [Al-Daqqaq] It was said that some mediators have raised the  idea of withdrawing troops to the positions they held before  unity.    [Al-Iryani] I think that this request seeks to impose  partition.    [Al-Daqqaq] What was the GPC response to that request?    [Al-Iryani] Absolute rejection of the principle. I have the  honor to announce that I was one of the reasons behind stalling  the "Salalah" meeting, because I rejected the request for  withdrawing troops. We disagreed on what we would tell the  people after the president's and vice president's meeting.  President Salih had told the vice president ('Ali Salim al-Bid)  that the withdrawal of the northern troops from the south and  the southern troops from the north was rejected and that if we  wanted to reassure the people about the military situation we  would have to implement the provisions of the Pledge and Accord  Document. When we got together to phrase the statement, Brother  Yasin Sa'id Nu'man presented the picture indirectly to give the  impression that we had consented to the principle of withdrawing  the troops. I refused to issue an unclear statement.    The GPC' position is to reject the troops' return to the  pre-22 May situation. Unity was established upon a certain  agreement and withdrawing the troops is a violation of that  agreement, which approved the retention of northern troops in  the south and southern troops in the north as a safety valve for  this unity. Withdrawing the troops would be an annulment of  unity.    [Al-Daqqad] Does the YSP insist on that request?    [Al-Iryani] Yes. We view this as completely backing down on  the unity agreement. It is the first true backing down on that  agreement.    [Al-Daqqaq] How true are reports that the GPC has  reservations on the Egyptian-United Arab Emirates [USE]  mediation and holding a Yemeni meeting in Cairo?    [Al-Iryani] This is totally untrue. I attended the meeting  between President Salih, Egyptian Minister Safwat al-Sharif, and  UAE Minister al-Nu'aymi. I believe that mediation is proceeding  along a good course based on the implementation of the Pledge  and Accord Document, particularly its military aspects. The  Congress cannot have any reservations about a mediation that  pursues that course.    As for the tour of Ambassador Badr Hammam [Mubarak's special  envoy to Yemen], he has received the demands of the YSP,  basically the withdrawal of troops. We rejected that request.  Therefore, it was wise of Egypt to quit discussing such  requests. The new joint mediation is suitable and pursues a  different course. It did not put forward specific ideas. The  main question and all efforts revolve around finding a way out  of the crisis.    [Al-Daqqaq] Could there be a peaceful way out of the crisis?    [Al-Iryani] Yes. It starts with taking the teeth out of the  militarized people in the YSP. The YSP accuses the north and the  GPC of being a militarized society. I can confirm that the YSP  is handling the crisis through the military and views it from a  purely military perspective, not from a comprehensive awareness  of the interests of the Yemeni people.    [Al-Daqqaq] Why does the YSP insist on the withdrawal of the  troops?    [Al-Iryani] I have already stated that withdrawing the  troops  means a return to partition. I do not like or intend to analyze  ill will. It is enough for me to see ill will, and the YSP is  handling the crisis with ill will.    [Al-Daqqaq] Do you believe that the crisis has become too  complicated for anybody to keep up with it and that calls for  separation and partition have started to be heard here and there?    [Al-Iryani] We now hear calls within the YSP that are  totally  alien to the concept of the "oneness" of the Yemeni society.  Within the YSP, you hear people saying that the Yemeni society  is made up of a northern society and a southern society. If  they talk about the absence of oneness within the Yemeni  society, it naturally follows that the northerners will be  northerners and the southerners will be southerners and this is  a fact that the YSP must deal with and bear its consequences  [sentence as published].    [Al-Daqqaq] You keep talking about the YSP in the south.  What about the GPC in the north?    [Al-Iryani] This is not the case at all in the south. The  southerners in the GPC fully believe in the wholeness of Yemeni  society. As for the YSP, the issue is no longer that of the  unity of the homeland, which is something that the YSP has gone  beyond. It now talks about the duality of the society, which is  a serious matter.    [Al-Daqqaq] Do you agree with me that there is Arab and  international sympathy with the YSP's stands and views?    [Al-Iryani] That was at the beginning, but things have  become  clearer now. Their sympathy was based on exterior signs without  getting to know the ulterior motivations. When the exterior and  ulterior motivations became one, the international community  discovered that the YSP's goal is not dialogue or the Pledge and  Agreement Document. The world community started to discover the  YSP's real intentions. But I am afraid that exposing the YSP's  ulterior motives will result in a bloody struggle equal to that  of the al-Khawarij [early Islamic sect].    [Al-Daqqaq] What is the truth concerning reports about  Sanaa's purchase of chemical weapons and cluster bombs?    [Al-Iryani] These are false allegations that do not warrant  a  response. But let me tell you that our brothers in the YSP are  newcomers to the world of capitalist brokers. They fell easy  prey to these brokers. Someone came and said to them: We have  sold cluster bombs to Sanaa and we are willing to sell them to  you. They were so naive and shallow-minded that they believed  the broker. I think that they bought, or were about to buy.  They later said that the north had bought prohibited weapons.  This is not true. Cluster bombs are not "children's toys" sold  on the market. We know what they are, who produces them, and  the restrictions imposed on selling and buying them. If  anything, such talk reflects irresponsibility, not only at the  national, but also at the international level. How can they  talk so simply about a matter that serious?    Let me ask; if the fighting is among the Yemenis, which  Yemeni deserves a cluster bomb?    If the fight is with the YSP and its military, it is  unacceptable to think that they deserve a cluster bomb. Do our  brothers in the YSP think that we alone deserve these bombs?    [Al-Daqqaq] What about terrorism?    [Al-Iryani] Let me explain things to you. At the last  cabinet meeting in Ta'izz, it was agreed to develop a security  plan covering all cases of terrorism. The interior minister put  it forward; it was prepared with the YSP's full participation.  We were surprised to find that the plan covered nine terrorist  cases only, although the YSP had said that they lost 154  martyrs. I was the first to object to the report, which was  incomplete. The party claims to have had 154 martyrs and  accuses a partner in the ruling process (the Congress) of being  behind the matter. How then could they approve the report and a  security plan that covers nine cases only?    The surprise was that the interior minister announced before  everybody that the plan, the report, and the list of cases were  worked out in coordination with the YSP. It became clear that  many of the cases were criminally rather than politically  motivated. How could the party claim that it was up against a  terrorist campaign when all it cited were nine cases?    [Al-Daqqaq] This is on the domestic level. But what about  the existence of terrorist camps used by the Afghan Arabs?    [Al-Iryani] The only camp that the YSP has mentioned is the  one in the [al-Maraqishah] area. The party announced that it  took control of this camp and arrested 85 terrorists. So far  the YSP has not brought any one of them to trial. The talk  about terrorism is designed to defame Yemen and to prove that  there are international terrorist forces in Yemen working to  cause harm to others.    [Al-Daqqaq] The conflict is now taking an economic form.  What do the military movements toward the oil and gas regions  mean?    [Al-Iryani] There are no economic interests. The YSP is  seeking its own interest and trying to find justifications to  maintain the crisis.    [Al-Daqqaq] Have the differences between the YPC and the  Reform Party [hizb al-islah], the third partner in the  government, ended?    [Al-Iryani] Differences of opinion usually take place, but  they are not continuous. I wish the crisis with the YSP were  like that--agree and disagree. But the YSP is managing the  crisis on the basis of the principle of reaching disagreement  and not agreement, particularly with us, the YPC. The party's  plan in managing the crisis is to close the doors to agreement  and carry the crisis to the end.    [Al-Daqqaq] What can now be done to contain the crisis?    [Al-Iryani] There is nothing that can be done except to  implement the Pledge and Accord Document and deploy the forces  in a way that would prevent secession and fighting. This is the  only solution. The forces are deployed in a way that would not  prevent fighting and could lead to secession. What is needed is  to redeploy them to prevent fighting and prevent one party from  seceding. This is what the YPC can offer.    [Al-Daqqaq] And politically?    [Al-Iryani] President 'Abdallah Salih has often told all  mediators: "Ask the YSP what its demands are in a united Yemen  and under a pluralistic system." We in the YPC think that we  have made big political concessions to satisfy the YSP. But the  YSP is not satisfied. It took the premiership and nine  ministerial portfolios. It also has a seat in the presidential  council. Even on the basis of population, the party has taken  more seats in the House of Representatives than proportionally  it deserves. We made all these concessions for the sake of  unity. We accept them. But we refuse to make concessions for  the sake of secession.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Election 92: Balanced Budget 'may be delayed' THE Conservatives' objective of a return to a balanced Budget over the economic cycle might take longer than the lifetime of a full parliament, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, acknowledged yesterday. Defending the Pounds 28bn borrowing requirement announced in last week's Budget, Mr Lamont insisted that he was 'pretty sure' about the prospect of making progress towards a 20p basic rate of income tax over the next five years. Interviewed on BBC television's On the Record, however, he declined to give specific target dates either for the elimination of the borrowing requirement or for the Conservatives' income tax target. Referring to the 20p basic rate, Mr Lamont said: 'We have a medium-term objective and I have very clearly stated that it may take longer than one parliament, very probably take more than one parliament.' However, he then added: 'I'm pretty sure and hope that we can take some steps towards it. There is every reason to believe that we can.' The introduction of the 20p income tax rate band gave the government additional flexibility because it allowed the chancellor to move in smaller steps towards the end objective. Mr Lamont said there was no inconsistency between the aim of balancing the Budget and cutting income taxes. But pressed repeatedly on when the deficit would be eliminated he refused to be be specific. He said: 'Cycles vary in their length. The Red Book accompanying the Budget sets out a series of assumptions and and path for borrowing. It shows borrowing at a very low level at the end of a five - six-year period'. The chancellor added that the tax cuts in the Budget amounted to only 0.25 per cent of national income and therefore posed no threat the budget targets, although it might take 'some time' to get back to a very low level of borrowing.</p>

			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Spring in step - Ballot Box Dick Spring, the leader of the Irish Labour Party, has been drafted to rally the Irish vote for Neil Kinnock's hopefuls in some of London's marginal seats. The British Labour party reckons that around 1m Irish have emigrated to Britain in the past 10 years, of whom around 50 per cent are Labour-leaning. The party has identified 23 marginal constituencies where the Irish vote could be decisive, about half of them in London. Spring will spend Wednesday to Friday campaigning from Hornsey to Highgate, emphasising the British Labour Party's policies of Irish unification by consent, its rejection of the Unionist 'veto' and the repeal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act. He will accompanied by Kevin McNamara, the British Labour Party spokesman on Northern Ireland, and the local candidates including the actress, Glenda Jackson, in Hampstead and Highgate.</p>

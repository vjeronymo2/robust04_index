			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Shalnev report: "CIA Continues To Catch Moscow </F> Agents"]    [Text] Another whole series of major scandals involving  the exposure of Americans who had worked for the intelligence  services of the USSR, Russia, and other countries of the former  Soviet bloc is in prospect. This was stated by CIA Director  James Woolsey.    Judging from Woolsey's statements, it is not a question of  ordinary Americans, but of staffers at various government  departments. Journalists are assuming that these departments  include the State Department, Congress, the Pentagon, and the  White House, where, according to U.S. sources, there was a  Soviet "mole" throughout the James Carter presidency. The CIA  director added that both retired and active government officials  are under investigation.    Some people believe that most of the pointers may have come  from Germany -- as a result of access to the archives of the  former East German intelligence. It is not ruled out that CIA  and FBI investigators were also able to make Ames talk -- he is  currently doing a deal with the authorities in an attempt to  reduce the sentence facing his wife, who is also charged with  espionage.    Although, on the other hand, Ames could hardly have had  access to information about who else among his colleagues might  have been recruited by intelligence services behind the Iron  Curtain. This is partly confirmed by the CIA director, who  stated that Ames did not play a decisive role in exposing other  spies in different government departments.    The most important catch so far has been an as-yet-unnamed  staffer from the Carter White House. Under Carter U.S.  intelligence organs -- and particularly the CIA -- were  demoralized as a result of the decision by the then president  and the the CIA director to considerably cut back the  intelligence apparatus. As can be imagined, this situation  could not fail to make it easier to recruit people from the  intelligence organs themselves and from government structures  directly involved in or monitoring intelligence work.</p>

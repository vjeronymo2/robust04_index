			<p>BFN     [Text] Gdansk, 13 May--Having returned from the meeting  with defense ministers of Denmark and Germany on the island of  Ruegen, National Defense Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk, speaking  at Gdansk-Rebiechowo airport today, expressed his satisfaction  at the course and outcome of these talks, as far as both  military and political subjects were concerned.    He said that, after Poland submitted its highly esteemed  presentation document for the Partnership for Peace scheme, the  case of our integration with the West took on a completely new  dimension.    Minister Kolodziejczyk said that, during discussions on  European political matters, the issue of Russia, whose policies  are largely opaque and keep changing from day to day, was on  top. In such a situation, it was decided to withhold all of the  diagnoses and comments on this subject until the 25 May meeting  in Brussels, one day after Russian Defense Minister Grachev's  presentation of Russian military doctrine and Russian attitude  toward the Partnership for Peace scheme.    The meeting participants have taken a completely unanimous  stand, saying that Russian participation in the Partnership for  Peace scheme can only take place on identical for all,  partnerlike terms, Kolodziejczyk said.    Speaking about military aspects of our participation in the  Partnership for Peace scheme, Kolodziejczyk said that discussion  concerned mainly the question about what could be done this year  and next, so that the new status of Poland could be implemented  as soon as possible. The conclusion was that we should move  over from cooperation at a tactical level to cooperation at the  operational level as soon as possible.    Before the end of this year, we will have participated in 18  joint exercises with NATO armed forces on Polish territory and  in Western countries. Joint command and staff exercises will be  held next year.    Kolodziejczyk stressed that the opening of NATO countries to  cooperation in the operational art and technology sphere was a  great step forward and a chance for the modernization of our  armed forces.    During the meeting, the Danish side came out with an  initiative that, as part of the Partnership for Peace scheme,  cooperation with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia be strengthened.  It was decided that, at the first stage, Sweden and Finland  should take appropriate actions, and then Germany and Poland  would join in.    Minister Kolodziejczyk also mentioned other actions aimed at  the military integration with the West and about the  Polish-German-French meeting, scheduled for July, as well as an  agreement with Sweden concerning military technology.    "The pace of these actions is great, but I do not feel I am  out of breath. One would like all other politicians to catch up  with this pace because this is really a great opportunity for  Poland," Kolodziejczyk said.</p>

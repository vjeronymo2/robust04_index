			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Observer: Home-grown Spare a thought for Sir Norman Fowler as he contemplates returning to front-line politics as the new chairman of the Conservative party. When he resigned after 10 years in Mrs Thatcher's cabinet he said he was determined to spend more time with his wife and young family. Two years later, it may not be quite so easy to explain why he now wants to spend more time with his party. No doubt as an old Times hand - he was the paper's home affairs correspondent in the 1960s - he shouldn't have too much difficulty coming up with an elegant account for his volte-face. Indeed, he is said to be working on a draft even now.</p>

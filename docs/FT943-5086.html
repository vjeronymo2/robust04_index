			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / The British Association: Contraceptives research urged An urgent scientific programme to develop safe and effective new contraceptives is needed to support other initiatives to limit the world population, Dr Anne McLaren, president of the British Association, said yesterday. Speaking at the association meeting, which coincides with the international population conference in Cairo, Dr McLaren said 'all the present approaches were developed a long time ago and they all present problems, even for women in developed countries. 'There are all sorts of new approaches now, which are not being fully exploited today because there is not enough money for research,' she said. Drug companies were doing 'very little' research and development in this area, said Dr McLaren, a distinguished geneticist who recently chaired a World Health Organisation scientific committee on new contraceptives. 'One can understand that because they are interested in recovering the costs of very expensive R&amp;D and making profits - and they are not going to get all that much money back from contraceptives designed for the Third World,' she said. Promising approaches, according to Dr McLaren, include contraceptive vaccines which prevent the newly fertilised embryo implanting in the womb, and male contraceptives which reduce sperm counts to zero without affecting sexual desire or potency.</p>

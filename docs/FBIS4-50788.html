			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Xu Furui (6079 4395 3843) and Wu Ping (0702 </F> 1627)]    [Excerpt] Copenhagen, 16 May (XINHUA) -- Business circles  attended a luncheon on 16 May here in honor of Li Ruihuan,  chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC].    Li Ruihuan first briefed them on the achievements China has  scored in implementing the policy of reform and opening up to  the outside world. He said: The sustained and rapid growth of  the Chinese economy has opened up broad prospects for economic  cooperation and trade with foreign countries. It is estimated  that the total volume of China's imports in the remaining seven  years of this century will top $1 trillion U.S., thus providing  an excellent opportunity for all countries, business circles of  Denmark included, to carry out economic cooperation and trade  with China. He said that Danish businesses are welcome to take  part in China's economic development and he wished them greater  successes in the Chinese market.    Officials of close to 10 noted Danish businesses gave  briefings on their experience in economic cooperation and trade  with China. They spoke highly of the tremendous economic  progress China has made in recent years and noted that they  would work to expand cooperation and promote economic relations  and trade between the two nations.    In the afternoon, Li Ruihuan toured the noted Kasper [name  as  received] Brewery on invitation. Accompanied by the group's  general manager Michael Yir, Li Ruihuan viewed the brewery's  beer production and bottling facilities and heard a briefing on  the brewery. [passage omitted].</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Stock market confounds optimists with 2.7% fall Sao Paulo's main stock market index fell 2.7 per cent at the close yesterday, in spite of the financial markets' optimism at the election success of Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Many analysts said a Cardoso victory had already been priced into the market, which has nearly doubled in dollar terms this year, and is up by about 65 per cent since July 1. However, they also expect a period of post-election profit-taking, particularly by foreign investors, which could mean a flat or downwards market in the short term. According to Mr Roberto Serweczak, head of trading at stockbroker Baring Securities in Sao Paulo, the market will be looking for news about how far and how quickly Mr Cardoso is prepared to go in economic reforms and privatisation. Although some foreign investors in equities will be taking profits, there is likely to be a substantial increase in overall foreign portfolio investment over the coming months. Mr Marcelo Cabral, an international equities vice president at Morgan Stanley in New York, said: 'Global investors are significantly underbought in Brazil and it will become very hard to stay out of the country if Cardoso implements economic reforms.' But progress will be gradual, says equities analyst Ms Monalisa Guarda: 'Changes will not be as dramatic as in Argentina. I expect a slower but coherent programme, and a gradual increase in foreign investment.' However, the government could try to restrict overseas investment in equities if there is an extremely large dollar inflow. Since its July 1 launch the new currency, the Real, has appreciated by 15 per cent against the dollar. The government is worried that a big inflow of foreign exchange will put more pressure on the exchange rate, forcing the central bank to compromise money supply targets by buying dollars and issuing Reals. But most analysts believe the government would only target overseas investment as a last resort, partly because the government will need foreign investors for its privatisation programme. Prices of Brazilian overseas debt securities were stable yesterday morning, said traders, although prices had moved up in the days preceding the election and are up by about a quarter since May. Analysts say future prices will depend on the confidence of foreign investors in Mr Cardoso's reforms as well as the success of a fund, approved by the government last month, which allows Brazilians to invest in sovereign debt. The Real was trading half a cent up yesterday morning, at Dollars 1.18.</p>

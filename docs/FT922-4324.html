			<p>920605 FT  05 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: HK extends settlement period to two days THE HONG KONG government has approved a lengthening of the settlement period on the colony's stock market to two days after a trade from the current one-day period to cope with huge turnover, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Mr Robert Nottle, the chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission, told a news conference that the change would be announced officially this weekend. Daily turnover has soared during recent weeks, occasionally rising above HKDollars 6bn (Dollars 775m). Mr Nottle noted that the number of transactions has totalled 50,000 or more a day recently, compared with about 20,000 usually. He said the change should not increase the risks of trading in Hong Kong.</p>

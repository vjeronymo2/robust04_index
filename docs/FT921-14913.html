			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Court hearings resume on tobacco product liability US SUPREME Court hearings resumed yesterday in the long-running tobacco product liability case, Cipollone versus Liggett, with Judge Clarence Thomas, the newest appointee to the court, hearing the matter for the first time. Essentially, the court must decide whether federally mandated health warnings on cigarette packaging pre-empt remedies under state product liability laws. The case is seen as one of the most important business-related issues which the Supreme Court will consider during the current term, with implications spreading beyond the tobacco industry. In all arguments yesterday, the plaintiff's lawyers claimed that Congress had never intended to give companies 'a cast-iron guarantee' against all state tort action. The defendants, by contrast, claim that the tobacco legislation was designed specifically to fall outside the normal US pattern of federal law supplemented by state regulation. Some observers have argued that a ruling in favour of pre-emption could effectively end litigation against US tobacco companies, while others have claimed that a ruling the other way will prompt a flood of new smokers' law suits. This, it is claimed, could expose tobacco companies to more than Dollars 100bn (Pounds 56bn) in liabilities.</p>

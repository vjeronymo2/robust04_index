			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Allied tumbles Drinks group Allied Lyons was marked back as old fears surfaced that a rights issue would accompany its results next week. Other factors also conspired to undermine the stock, including both the devaluation of the Spanish peseta and dull European results from Grand Metropolitan. However, Mr David Thompson at Kleinwort Benson said that the devaluation would be beneficial to Allied and the rights issue story carried little credence. More cautious analysts argued that the Grand Met results - and those of other brewing groups this week - favoured a continuation of an underweight stance across the sector. Cazenove was one broker said to have reiterated its bearish stance yesterday. Shares in Allied tumbled 13 to 545p on turnover of 3.6m. Grand Met declined 7 to 415p, Bass 9 to 525p, Scottish &amp; Newcastle 5 to 458p and Whitbread 6 1/2 to 481p. After its much-publicised results on Thursday, British Telecom climbed 10 1/2 to 414 1/2 p in turnover of 13m. Dealers put the rise down to positive comment, together with improving sentiment ahead of the BT III campaign to sell the government's remaining stake in the company this month. The shares have also underperformed on adverse news over US competition. High street retailer Next continued to advance, the shares adding 3 to 167 1/2 p. While a number of brokers have turned positive recently on the back of the consumer recovery, there have also been rumours that Next has been eyeing potential targets. Austin Reed, steady at 233p, was one name mentioned. Hanson, which is set to announce flat first half profits of between Pounds 483m and Pounds 506m for the first half on Tuesday, lifted 2 to 240 1/2 p. Further recovery in badly hit copper prices helped RTZ, the world's biggest mining group to bounce 6 to 642p. Analysts added that the strike price for RTZ's recent enhanced scrip dividend had been met, and marketmakers were short. The aggressive buying of Shell Transport which has surrounded the group's well-received first quarter figures on Thursday, finally abated and the shares eased 1 1/2 to 611p. Zeneca, the soon to be independent bioscience arm of ICI continued friendless and the unofficial 'grey' market price was marked down 12 to 636p on thin turnover. Existing ICI shares fell 16 to 1263p. National Westminster, which is to restructure its operations in France and has announced that over the next 12 months it will pull out of retail banking there altogether, gained 7 to 469p. Condom manufacturer London International was weak on news that the Stock Exchange had censured the group for not giving the market a revised profits forecast which it revealed to selected analysts and institutional shareholders. The shares, 10 lower the previous day, were a further penny off at 185p. Carlton Communications rose 8 to 727p following a buy recommendation based on a trade press article which played down worries that pay-per-view cable television would hit Carlton's home video market. There was further support from SG Warburg which recommends the stock, arguing that the shares deserve to hit 830p within the next three months. Finally, it was announced that the Norwich Union had increased its stake to 4.04 per cent. The Telegraph newspaper added 4 at 370p as it announced a first quarter profits up to Pounds 9.1m from Pounds 5m. Increasingly media-biased conglomerate Pearson rose 9 to 448p as the group, which owns the Financial Times, gave a positive AGM statement. Osprey Communications jumped 6 1/2 to 32 1/2 p on news of a radical re-organisation of its business and a Pounds 1.3m one-for-three rights issue. Publisher Euromoney lifted 35 to 1023p, following strong results on Thursday. However, more than 70 per cent of the shares are held by the Daily Mail General Trust and the price moves sharply on small turnover. GKN fell 6 to 434p, after Hoare Govett downgraded its current-year profits forecast. Citing continued weakness in the group's European markets, Hoare cut by Pounds 16m to Pounds 124m. The broker also reiterated its cautious stance on Lucas Industries, 4 lighter at 139p. Laird Group fell 13 to 280p after the chairman warned that operating profits would be lower than last year. News earlier in the week that VSEL Consortium had won a contract to build a carrier for the British Navy continued to drive the shares forward and they put on another 22 to 760p. British Airways were wanted ahead of figures on Tuesday, though talk of a rights issue lingered. The shares put on 4 1/2 to 303 1/2 p, in trade of 4.3m.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Check Out This Art Auction: A plan to sell off part of Czechoslovakia's state  art collections through Christie's auction house has provoked concern that the  nation's cultural legacy may be liquidated for badly needed hard currency. The  controversial sale, which Christie's hopes to hold at its London sales rooms  next fall, came to light in a recent issue of the Communist Party cultural  weekly Kmen. Six museums, including the National Gallery and the State Jewish  Museum, are drawing up as yet undisclosed lists of items for auction after  Christie's proposed the sale, to be managed through an official Czechoslovak  body known as Art Centrum. However, the Prague Museum of Applied Arts,  containing valuable pieces of Bohemian glassware and furniture, has refused to  take part, deeming the proposal "wrong in its very essence." According to a  draft agreement with Christie's, Art Centrum has suggested selling "excess  items and damaged exhibits" so museums could obtain currency to fill in gaps in  existing collections or to improve security and storage facilities.

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Chemicals' Pounds 11m pleases City SHARES IN Yorkshire Chemicals, the dyes and specialist chemicals group, rose 34p to a record 644p yesterday after the company announced a rise in profits and said sales in 1991 ended 'very strongly'. Pre-tax profits improved to Pounds 11m (Pounds 10.8m), at the top end of City forecasts, on turnover of Pounds 92.8m (Pounds 81.6m). Mr Phillip Lowe, chair-man and managing director, said: 'We've come through two years of very difficult trading conditions, and we are confident we will improve in fundamentals again this year.' Yorkshire Colours, the largest division, reported a slight fall in operating profits to Pounds 8.3m as capacity constraints affected margins. Yorkshire Americas was affected by recession in the US and by expansion costs. But Yorkshire Specialty Products and Yorkshire Australia both increased turnover and operating profits, partly due to acquisitions. Interest charges increased to Pounds 1.1m, reflecting borrow-ings taken on to fund an expansion programme. Gearing, based on net borrowings of about Pounds 2m, remained under 5 per cent. Earnings per share improved to 40.1p (37.8p). A recommended final dividend of 9.75p makes a total for the year of 14.5p (13p). A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed. COMMENT The market's enthusiasm for Yorkshire's results was more a response to despondency with the rest of the sector. While the outlook for chemical groups remains gloomy, Yorkshire is being rewarded for maintaining sales in niche markets. Whether the shares can go much higher at this stage is more difficult, especially given their almost vertical ascent since late 1990. Analysts' upgraded forecasts for 1992 of Pounds 12m-Pounds 12.5m put the shares on a prospective multiple of 14 which may not be excessive. But capacity constraints at Yorkshire Colours will remain a problem for most of this year. New facilities will not be commissioned until the second half and will not come fully into play before 1993, presumably in time for a cyclical upturn. Exchange rates are the other intangible, especially for a company which now derives 92 per cent of sales outside the UK. The risks have decreased since sterling's entry into the ERM, but more than 40 per cent of sales are sensitive to the dollar, either directly through the US or indirectly through Asia. After Yorkshire's Pounds 1m loss on exchange movements in 1990, investors need to be be sure movements this time are more friendly.</p>

			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Commission warns on double taxation agreements: Brussels opts for modest, more consultative stance on corporation tax levels EC governments yesterday were warned not to enter into double taxation agreements with countries outside the EC as some treaties could be potentially discriminatory. Mrs Christiane Scrivener, the commissioner responsible for fiscal matters, confirmed that the European Commission was studying bilateral double taxation treaties to establish whether they disadvantaged companies based in other EC countries. The most recent and important example of such a treaty is that between Germany and the US. But the Commission is unlikely to act precipitately against potentially discriminatory agreements. Instead, Mrs Scrivener yesterday outlined a softly-softly approach on corporate tax. The Commission's modest proposals on corporate tax are likely to relieve EC governments - notoriously sensitive about tax matters - at the same time as they may disappoint tax hardliners. They follow the report of an expert committee - chaired by Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch finance minister - submitted in March. The Ruding report called for radical harmonisation of EC corporate tax rates at between 30 and 40 per cent, and rapid action to eliminate differences in national corporate. But Mrs Scrivener said many of the committee's suggestions went 'beyond what is absolutely necessary in the Community in the initial phase.' The Commission has rejected the idea of a maximum corporation tax rate, and believes that, although a minimum rate is 'worth examining thoroughly,' 30 per cent would be too high. Mrs Scrivener's concerns are more practical than ideological. Tax matters have to receive unanimous approval of member states, and, as the commissioner said yesterday: 'I would like to avoid a situation where we make proposals which spend 17 years gathering dust.' That was roughly how long it took to motivate member states' discussions on earlier company tax proposals aimed at easing the fiscal situation for multinationals which have subsidiaries in several EC countries. The plans outlined yesterday are likely to be transformed into legislation by the end of the year and should nudge forward the process. First, the Commission is keen to make sure existing plans are adopted and implemented. It is urging member states to ratify a 1990 convention on the double taxation of cross-border asset transfers. So far only two member states have approved it. Two more parent-subsidiary directives also need to be adopted. Brussels is also suggesting specific action on some of the Ruding committee's recommendations, most of which it believes could be enacted through consultation and agreement, rather than legislation. The main aim is the elimination of outstanding double taxation problems. Directives will be produced extending the parent-subsidiary directives to all companies. A consultation procedure will be set up to pre-empt tax disputes over cross-border asset transfers. The Commission would also like to start talks with EC governments on the treatment of dividends from 'foreign' companies and dividends from domestic groups. Some member states tax foreign-source dividends more heavily. Mrs Scrivener believes such measures would go some way towards eliminating tax disadvantages of cross borders collaboration, but with the Commission under fire for its alleged tendencies towards centralisation, she is reluctant to push member states too far.</p>

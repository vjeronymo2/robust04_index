			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REMEMBERING BETTE DAVIS  </P> <P> My acquaintance with her started almost 50 years ago, on her stopover in  Chicago while en route from Hollywood to New York. As a young press agent in my  20s, working for Warner Bros. Pictures, I introduced her to the Chicago press  and theater owners. An exciting day it was, for even at that early stage of her  career, she was an outstanding actress, a brilliant conversationalist who  enchanted those who met her.  </P> <P> My association with her continued at Warner Bros. studios after World War II on  such outstanding pictures as "Watch On the Rhine," "Mr. Skeffington," "The Corn  Is Green," "Deception" and others. At that time I was in charge of the photo  department. What particularly stands out in my memory over the years is that  the working crew of whatever picture she was making always held her in awe and  regarded her as the "queen."  </P> <P> Bette Davis has departed from this earth and is now a bright star among the  brightest of stars.  </P> <P> MONROE RUBINGER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

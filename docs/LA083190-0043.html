			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S MOVE TO SHARE BUILDUP COSTS MIRRORS U.S. SHIFT IN MILITARY ROLE;  </P> <P> DEPLOYMENT: NATION NO LONGER SEES ITSELF AS THE 'ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY.'  ANALYSTS POINT TO A POSSIBLE RESURGENCE OF ISOLATIONISM.  </P> <P> President Bush's plea to U.S. allies to share in the financial burden of the  Middle East crisis reflects a major change since the Vietnam War in America's  view of its military role in the world.  </P> <P> Throughout most of the 20th Century, the United States has seen itself as the  "arsenal of democracy" and a principal financier in times of war. But over the  past decade, Americans have become increasingly less willing to assume the  burden for defending the Western world.  </P> <P> Some analysts, such as Sen. Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.), a member of the Senate  Armed Services Committee, see this shift as a resurgence of isolationism in the  United States that began after the nation's long and costly military adventure  in Vietnam.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of people in the United States who believe that we shouldn't  be the world's policeman," Shelby said.  </P> <P> But others think this new attitude is rooted primarily in global economics.  Americans no longer feel it is fair for the deficit-ridden United States to  shoulder most of the burden for the defense of nations such as Japan and West  Germany, which are currently cash-rich.  </P> <P> "We once were the economic and military leaders of the world," said Ronald J.  Bartek, a House Armed Services Committee expert on allied burden-sharing. "We  still have the world's best military, but we no longer have the world's leading  economy."  </P> <P> Whatever the reason, this change in American attitudes was something that Bush  could not ignore as he geared up for what may be a long commitment that so far  has cost U.S. taxpayers an extra $46 million a day.  </P> <P> At a meeting with Bush earlier this week, members of Congress told the  President bluntly that the U.S. military deployment in the Middle East would  quickly lose popular support across the nation unless Japan, West Germany and  other allies, as well as the the Arab nations, carry more of the financial  burden. The issue is expected to be debated at length when Congress reconvenes  next week.  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Dixon (D-Ill.), the Senate's most outspoken critic of the role that  U.S. allies play in their own defense, said Americans are demanding to know why  the United States has assumed the major burden in opposing Iraqi aggression  when the Japanese are more dependent on Middle East oil and the oil-rich Arab  nations have more at stake in this confrontation.  </P> <P> "Everywhere I go, people are saying, 'These other countries have to help us,' "  Dixon said. "American taxpayers think: 'Uncle Sam always pays, and in the end  that is me.' "  </P> <P> Modern history is filled with examples of America's role as financier of wars.  </P> <P> Even before the United States entered World War I, it loaned huge sums of money  to the Allies at standard interest rates. And ultimately, while more than  100,000 Americans died in that war, perhaps the most significant American  contribution was in financing and producing weapons for the Allied victory.  </P> <P> In World War II, U.S. involvement began with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's  "lend-lease" program, under which he loaned equipment to the democratic enemies  of Hitler's Nazi Germany. After Pearl Harbor in 1941, the United States became  the chief Allied military force and later poured billions of dollars of aid  into Europe under the Marshall Plan.  </P> <P> And during the Korean War, which -- like the Iraqi blockade -- was regarded as  a United Nations action, the United States received only limited allied  support.  </P> <P> It was not until the United States' agonizing defeat in Vietnam that Americans  began to complain that their country could not always be "the world's  policeman." And since the end of that war, there has been a residual reluctance  to get involved in Third World conflicts.  </P> <P> Over the past decade, a swelling chorus of members of Congress has been  demanding an increased financial commitment from NATO allies for the defense of  Europe and a greater Japanese role in the security of the Pacific region. This  led to some U.S. troop reductions in Europe and the Pacific as well as cuts in  military construction outside the United States.  </P> <P> In addition, there now appears to be growing congressional sentiment for a cut  in U.S. troops in Korea, another nation whose economy has soared in recent  years.  </P> <P> In Congress, it is clear that the economic realities of the 1980s have overcome  whatever lingering sentiment there was from the post-World War II era that  Germany and Japan should never again be allowed to pose a military threat to  other nations.  </P> <P> "I don't think that it's an accident that our burden-sharing controversy  reached its peak in the 1980s as our deficit mounted and as Americans felt  themselves coming under greater economic pressure from our allies in the global  markets," said Ted Carpenter, director of foreign policy studies at the CATO  Institute, a libertarian think tank.  </P> <P> Rep. Pat Schroeder (D-Colo.), who headed a special House panel that explored  the issue of military burden-sharing two years ago, said Americans are furious  that Japan and West Germany are heavily dependent on the United States for  their defense while they appear to be beating the U.S. in the world  marketplace.  </P> <P> She said the NATO imbalance is particularly frustrating for Americans now that  the Soviet threat to Europe appears to have diminished and Germany is on the  verge of reunification. It is estimated that 60% of the U.S. defense budget is  aimed at defending Europe.  </P> <P> As Schroeder puts it, "Everybody on Main Street is saying, 'You mean we've got  300,000 Americans over there to protect West Germany against East Germany, and  all of the East Germans are shopping at the malls in West Germany? You mean  we're keeping the Pacific safe so that the Japanese can ship us Subarus?' "  </P> <P> Times staff writer Stanley Meisler contributed to this report.  </P></p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Bank may relax rules to help Russia THE World Bank is about to change one of its fundamental regulations governing its lending policies in an attempt to raise the desperately low level of investment in the former communist states, especially Russia. The Bank's board, which met last week, is now leaning towards waiving its 'negative pledge' rule for the financing of projects in the former communist and a few other states. The rule, binding on the states which join the Bank and participate in a Bank programme, lays down that the state, or state enterprises, cannot give equal or more favourable terms to other investors than they have to the Bank. This means, in practice, that a state cannot pledge the future income from a project, such as an oil well, to other banks where such a pledge has already been given to the Bank. It has inhibited other lenders, especially the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, from advancing credits particularly in the energy sector where much of its lending is concentrated. Mr Sergei Konichev, chairman of the Russian Development and Project Finance Bank, said this was 'a very important and positive policy step' in relations between foreign banks and Russian companies. 'Nothing much has happened in the field of investment in Russia for the past three years, and this could help a lot,' he said. Mr Anthony Toft, a World Bank official, said they were still working out the details of how to modify the policy. 'There are many factors to be considered when banks or companies are considering making investment in the former Soviet Union - but the people there themselves think that they need to be able to offer some sort of security now or investment will not come, even if everything else was thought to be right.' The Bank's policy has been put to the test most of all in the former communist states - defined as 'economies in transition' - because almost all enterprises are effectively state owned, and thus all are covered by negative pledge. However, the Bank is determined to retain the rule in the case of existing assets - applying a waiver only where investment can be shown to produce a new or increased stream of income from which repayments could be made. Because of the scale of the Bank's operations and borrowing needs, negative pledge has been required to reassure its creditors of the ability of its debtors to repay large loans.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANA UNIFIED HAS 2 TEACHERS OF YEAR  </P> <P> Two teachers from the Santa Ana Unified School District have been chosen as  Orange County Teachers of the Year for 1990-91, Supt. Rudy Castruita announced  Tuesday.  </P> <P> This is the first time in the history of the competition that two teachers from  the same district have been selected by the Orange County Department of  Education, officials said.  </P> <P> Dee Gomez, an English-as-a-second-language teacher at Santa Ana High School,  and Lynn Maher, an English teacher at MacArthur Fundamental Intermediate  School, were the winners, Castruita announced at a school board meeting.  </P> <P> "I think it's a real feather in our teacher corps' caps," Castruita said.  </P> <P> Gomez, who was in the audience, said she was "overwhelmed" by the honor. Being  a good teacher means "total commitment," she said.  </P> <P> "You can't look at a kid just when he's in your classroom. You also need to  look at him when he's outside your classroom," she said. "It's the whole  student."  </P> <P> Gomez and Maher will now compete for California Teacher of the Year, which will  be selected by the state Department of Education.  </P></p>

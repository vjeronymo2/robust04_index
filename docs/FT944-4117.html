			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Foreigners lift Wall Street blues - Bankers are thankful for overseas IPOs With the market for initial public offerings of stock (IPOs) in the US suffering a sharp drop in activity this year because of rising interest rates and a slumping stock market, Wall Street investment bankers have been thankful for one thing: sustained interest from foreign companies in seeking US listings for their shares. Although US companies raised only Dollars 25.8bn in the first 11 months of this year - well down on 1993's record total of Dollars 40.8bn - the volume of flotations by foreign companies is up on a year ago, albeit only slightly. Foreign issuers - many of them newly-privatised companies of Latin America and Europe - have already raised Dollars 5.8bn this year, and are on target to just exceed 1993's record 12-month volume of Dollars 6.3bn. Apart from the international side, however, the IPO market remains disheartened, mostly because the secondary market is in such a sorry state. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped 6 per cent since approaching its year high in late October, and investors are fearful that the Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening of monetary policy this year will undermine economic growth and corporate profitability. In expectation of further rate increases and lower earnings, some investors have begun to switch funds out of stocks and into fixed-income investments, where yields are higher. To Wall Street underwriters, this is worrying: mutual funds have been big buyers of IPOs in recent years. Mr Ernesto Cruz, head of equity capital markets for North and South America at CS First Boston, says: 'The material that fuels the IPO mutual fund buyer is cash inflows, and they are slowing down as individual investors become cautious about putting further money to work in the stock market.' Against this background, selling new paper is likely to be difficult. Although contraction in US economic and earnings growth will not affect the performance of foreign equities, the market's sourness may reduce demand for non-US IPOs. Increasingly wary investors are likely to adopt a safety-first approach - and among US institutions and individuals, foreign stocks do not top the list of low-risk investment vehicles. However, many investment bankers on Wall Street believe that US investors' interest in foreign stocks is less fickle than it was. Although investors have been looking overseas because returns there have looked more promising than at home, growing demand for non-US issues has reflected their eagerness for diversification. Mr Tom Davies, head of equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch, the world's busiest underwriter, says: 'There is a pretty strong desire on the part of US institutional and retail investors to increase their asset allocation to non-US equities - it's a portfolio rebalancing.' Such a trend is not easily reversed by a temporary deterioration in investor sentiment, say analysts. There are other reasons why non-US IPOs have continued to find willing buyers. Ms Kathleen Smith, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, a Connecticut-based consultancy which advises institutional investors on the IPO market, believes the quality of foreign issuers lately has tended to be higher. She says that, while there are still plenty of attractive foreign IPOs in the pipeline, domestic IPO issuance is at a more mature stage and most of the high-quality issues have come and gone. 'Coming up on the calendar before the year-end, our favourites are all international companies,' she says, singling out two deals: the Dollars 1.37bn IPO for the British Sky Broadcasting satellite television venture (a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, owns 17.5 per cent) which was priced and sold earlier this week, and yesterday's Dollars 467m IPO for SGS-Thomson, Europe's top semiconductor company. Mr Tom Davis, head of equity capital markets at Merrill Lynch, says December is shaping up to be a tricky month for issuers and underwriters. 'From now to the end of the year, you will have a highly selective and highly price-sensitive market. It has not been a great year for most portfolio managers from a performance standpoint, so you have a very cautious institutional investor environment right now.' Recent declines in share prices, and evidence that money is flowing out of equity funds, have created a more hostile investment environment for new stock issues. A clearer picture of investor sentiment should emerge by mid-December, says Mr Cruz of CS First Boston. Four large IPOs - BSkyB, Thomson, Guident (a spin-off from the US pharmaceuticals group Eli Lilly) and Crown Pacific Partners, a US timber group - are due to be priced by then, and the progress of each issue is being closely watched for any signs of a deterioration in demand. Yet, in spite of anxiety about the December calendar, bankers say the IPO market is in better shape than during the summer, when activity fell sharply because of concern about rising interest rates and falling share prices. 'There was an awful lot of offerings downsized, downpriced, postponed, and withdrawn,' says Mr Davis. One banker estimates that whereas between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of IPOs in the summer were priced below their range, only 20 per cent to 30 per cent of deals in October and November were similarly under-priced. Moreover, bankers can be sanguine because a good part of the slowdown in issuance activity is attributable to cyclical forces. As Mr Davis explains: '1994 is the fourth year of the equity financing boom in the US, and there's been an awful lot done. Much of the business in the early part of the decade was driven by deleveraging. That's behind us now. A lot was done by cyclical companies, whose stocks were rising ahead of earnings and cash flow. Now that earnings and cashflow is coming through, there is a less pressing need for equity.' Over the longer term, the outlook for the IPO market remains uncertain. The head of equity capital markets syndication at a prominent Wall Street firm says the calendar for the first quarter of 1995 is pretty full, but warns that if the current difficult environment carries through into next year, many companies will be forced to compromise on both the price and size of their issues.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Dehua (0491 1795 5478), affiliated with the </F> Tongling Municipal People's Government in Anhui Province:  "Reform Practice and Thoughts on the Leased Operation of  Tongling City's Medium-sized and Small Enterprises"]    [Text] Tongling City is one of the eight comprehensive,  economic-system, related-reform experiments throughout China.  To run state enterprises well, Tongling has seized "the bull  by the horns" in enterprise property-rights system-reform,  focusing on reform of midsize and small state enterprises. As  part of my work, I have been fortunate enough to participate in  and learn about this city's reform of medium-sized and small  enterprises. I am reporting here all that I saw and learned, as  thoughts on and a case study in converting the operating forces  of large state enterprises.  <H8>  I </H8>   Tongling City, located along the lower Chang Jiang [Yangtze  River], is one of Anhui Province's subordinate cities that  produces mostly mineral resources. As it was rich in copper, it  was named the Tongling "SEZ" in the 1950s, to practice a uniform  ownership form and a highly centralized planned-management  model. Since China's urban economic reform, it had carried out  enterprise reforms, such as streamlining administration and  devolving authority to lower levels, introducing the contract  system, and merging superior enterprises with inferior ones.  While these reforms had all generally had a certain positive  impact in invigorating enterprises, none of them had touched on  the property-rights system. While the dominant profit  mechanisms of a market economy had not yet been established,  with enterprise operating efficiency still poor, other  simultaneously-developing enterprise-ownership forms, such as  the three kinds of foreign trade enterprises, and private and  household operations, were as dynamic as wildfire. By the end  of 1992, the city had 356 independently accounted state  industrial enterprises at the township level and above, of which  88, or 24.8 percent, were reporting book losses, with this  percentage reaching 42 percent of enterprises throughout the  city when including potential and hidden losses. Once the new  financial system went into effect, the real percentage would be  even larger, with one-half of these enterprises in particular  trouble, being nothing but "empty shells." If this continued,  state enterprises would have had ever-narrowing prospects  with, in contrast to the private economy, equivalent input not  bringing commensurate output, and real advantages not being  brought into full play. So how could these state enterprises  have played their dominant role?    After the 14th CPC Congress, Tongling City investigated and  analyzed the status quo of its state enterprises, finding that  the apparent causes of its large-scale enterprise losses were a  heavy historical burden (debt and [over]staffing), the great  inertia of the old system, and the independent decisionmaking  power provided by the regulations on converting enterprise  [operating] forces not only not implemented, but impossible to  implement. The substantive problems were that government  administration had not been separated from business management,  the conversion of government functions was lagging, and  responsible government departments were holding enterprises on a  tight string in areas such as organizational structure,  investment decisionmaking, labor employment, and personnel  distribution, making it hard for enterprises to escape their  subordinate status. On the other hand, enterprises were beset  with difficulties, so needed government "protection." While they  might take a half-step outward, they would finally be forced to  retreat and ask for government help, making it truly a case of  "while the cord was not yet cut, things remained in chaos." So  we were forced to ask: While collective land ownership remained  unchanged, how had the contract system been able to stimulate  peasant initiaive to develop the agricultural productive forces?  And in the same economic climate, how had private and so many  township enterprises grown so prosperous? The crux of the  matter was the establishment of an ownership form suited to  productive-forces development, to find an optimum model  combining the workforce with capital goods. The property-rights  system was the "intermediary point" of this combination. The  in-depth connotation of ownership form was that the legal  ownership rights to socialist state enterprises belonged to the  state. The rights to the economic benefits of state ownership  were realized through market-economy subjects--enterprises  managing their assets. Enterprises, as an aggregate of their  quantitative employees, represented the state in protecting and  increasing the value of state assets, while representing their  employees in ensuring steadily higher incomes. As market  subjects, enterprises needed to be commodity producers and  managers independent of government. As our traditional  state-enterprise, state-run system evolved under a planned  economy, its historical burden was great. The current need to  convert enterprise operating forces to become market oriented  was also inseparable from government help and promotion.  During the conversion of losing enterprises to shareholding,  who would subscribe to the shares? If they were offered for  sale, how many would be able or willing to buy? It was very hard  for enterprises themslves to acquire such motivation. The issue  was what and how the government should help. Government  assistance could only create the "initial promotional factor"  for market access, merely helping to get started and clear  obstacles. While it could deliver a part, it could not deliver  over the long term. This is what produced the idea of leased  operation of medium-sized and small state enterprises.  <H8>  II </H8>   In July 1992, the first leased operation began with the  municipal silk factory. This plant had been in operation for  82 years, having over 1,100 employees, fixed assets worth 9.8  million yuan, and by the end of 1991, accumulated losses of more  than 13 million yuan, leaving the enterprise in a state of less  assets than liabilities, and over 90 percent of its employees  drawing welfare benefits to get by. So in July 1992, the  municipal party committee and government decided to begin leased  operation of this factory. In just four months of leased  operation, efficiency improved and, by year's end, profits and  taxes had reached 193,700 yuan, with the enterprise beginning to  revive.    By the time the silk-factory experiment had begun to  succeed,  the municipal party committee and government had learned an  important lesson: that in order for its many medium-sized and  small losing enterprises to escape their plight, the adoption of  the leasing form, with full corporate authority for management  and operation, was probably a good way to convert [operating]  forces and effectively reverse losses. Without changing  ownership form, this attracted the maximum vital forces of the  private economy, gradually establishing enterprise operating  subjects suited to a market economy. In early 1993, the  municipal party committee and government drew up the pertinent  provisions and implementation regulations, which began the  widespread reform throughout the city of leased operation  targeted at medium-sized and small industrial and commercial  enterprises. By September, this city had 40 leased-operation  enterprises (including sub-factories and shops), leasing 51.39  million yuan of state assets and 19.44 million yuan of  collective assets, distributed in the 11 industries and systems  of silk, textiles, nonferrous [metals], industrial chemicals,  power, machinery, coal, light industry, commerce, supply and  marketing, and grain, and involving 6,212 employees, of whom  4,711 were working in leased-operation enterprises, with the  other 1,501 under the responsibility of the labor sector for  management, training, and reemployment. While the experimental  enterprises had been practicing this reform for only a few  months, they were all beginning to show vigorous and exuberant  vitality, with a great change in the spirits and appearance of  lessees and employees, an improvement in enterprise operating  state, and generally better efficiency. The first 24  experimental enterprises averaged 30 percent better labor  productivity, with clearly higher employee incomes and, in  addition to payments to the state for leasing contracts,  realized profits and taxes of more than 1.3 million yuan.    The basic operating practices of Tongling City's  leased-operation reform were:    -- Evaluation of assets, inventory of resources, and setting  forth of leasing terms. Based on the operating state of the  various enterprises, the municipal government leased the assets  of midsize and small, state and collective, industrial and  commercial enterprises to individual operation in a compensated  form. The leases could be of an enterprise's whole assets, or  of part of them, such as a shop or a production line. Before  leasing enterprises, the lessors evaluated enterprise assets  according to pertinent state provisions and market criteria,  setting forth the leasing terms. Based on the principle of  protecting and increasing the value of state assets, the leasing  fee rates were set based on the reference standards of  prevailing bank interest rates and the fixed-assets profit rate  for the trade, or the average fixed-assets profit rate for  interrelated industries, combined with enterprise realities,  making them more scientific and fair, to avoid the arbitrary  "one-on-one" negotiations of the contract system.    -- Public solicitation, and competitive selection of  lessees.  Open solicitation of prospective lessees, through inspection of  bidders' leasing terms and qualifications, selected the best  leasing operators. Leasing contracts signed by lessors and  lessees became valid upon notarization by the notary public  sector. Leasing terms were generally three-10 years, with  lessees having to pay lessors leasing fees of 5-10 percent of  assets, and venture guarantees of 1-10 percent of assets.    -- Employee arrangements. Once enterprises began leased  operations, the former enterprise employee status, cadre  ranking, grade wages, state-set labor insurance welfare, and  pertinent wage adjustmnets and subsidies all remained unchanged,  recorded in employee personnel files, as grounds for determining  wage grades and transfer and retirement treatment once leasing  terms expired. Operators had the authority to reorganize former  employees, signing set-term job contracts. From the day on  which employees began jobs, operators paid their wages and  determined their incomes on their own. Pensions of employees  retiring during leased-operation terms operated according to the  overall regulations on social old-age insurance, with  overall insurance payments being the responsibility of  lessees. Employees leaving or waiting for jobs were paid  unemployment insurance, with the labor sector helping lessors in  their management, training, reemployment, and job choice.    -- Bonded debt and tax policy. While the former enterprise  bonded debt was the liability in principle of the lessors, it  could also be entrusted to the lessees. New bonded debt  incurred during the leasing term was the liability of the  lessees. Once enterprises became privately run, their tax  system, rates, and burdens, and all other rates, were dealt with  as private enterprises. All collected leasing-fee,  depreciation-charge, and legal tax-exemption income was used to  pay debts, or treated as reproduction-development income.    -- Profit distribution. Leased-operation enterprise  distribution was based on the contract principle of "adequate  payments to both the state and enterprises, with all of the rest  belonging to operators and employees."    -- Financial system. In order to ensure that  leased-operation  enterprises had real cost accounting, rational assets liquidity,  and accurate financial statements, lessors assigned personnel to  factories. But while these personnel carried out oversight,  examination, and verification, they did not interfere in any  enterprise decisionmaking or operating activities, with their  wages and all remuneration being the responsibility of the  assigning units.    -- Operating rights. As to the 14 operating rights provided  to enterprises in the regulations, except for assets-disposal  rights (which needed the consent of the lessors), all others  were transferred to lessees, as well as given legal protection,  with no department, unit, or individual allowed to infringe upon  them.    -- Jurisdiction over newly added assets. The jurisdiction  over newly added assets was set according to the principle of  the investor being the owner and beneficiary. As to assets  bought with personal income out of aftertax profits, as well as  with other self-owned lessee funds, the property rights and  their disposal belonged to the lessees.    -- Party and mass organizations. Party, CYL, and labor union  organizations in leased enterprises had to be sound. While  they were elected according to their respective charters,  whether such organizational personnel were full- or part-time  was decided by lessees.  <H8>  III. </H8>   The reform practice of Tongling City in the leased-operation  model for medium-size and small industrial and commercial  enterprises was of farreaching significance in improving  enterprise operating conditions, raising state-enterprise  economic efficiency, reversing state-enterprise losses,  converting enterprise operating forces, promoting and perfecing  the socialist-public-ownership property rights system, speeding  up the conversion of government functions, and fostering  enterprise subjects suited to socialist markets.    1. It clarified property rights relations, resolving the  issue of the lack of ownership-rights status in public  ownership. Through leasing contracts, the state-assets  representative, the state, through government or  government-entrusted lessors, was made the representative agency  for public assets, exercising ownership rights. These owners  leased assets in compensated form to individual operation,  acquiring corresponding ownership benefits, while lessees, upon  fulfilling leasing promises, enjoyed full leased-assets  possession, control, and use rights. In order to ensure the  protection and increase in value of assets, and the operators'  own interests, lessees managed public assets as if they were  their private assets. In other words, as to operating form, this  showed the subjectivization of operating activities. In our  traditional property rights relations, in which the state was  both owner and manager, everyone owned assets, while being  unable to possess them, with all being the enterprise owners,  but noone being liable for enterprise operating consequences.  Governments knew only the number of enterprises, but were  unclear about the amount of assets. So the leased operation and  inventorying of resources subjectivized the representatives  and managers of public assets, to overcome the  enterprise-subject sham.    2. It remolded the "four independent" market-access  subjects.  Operators not only acquired from contracts widespread operating  autonomy, but also broke free from the administrative  subordinate relations between enterprises and government,  leaving only profit-contract relations tied to property rights.  Operator job advertisements were not divided by grade. While  Tongling's 40 leasing operators had been divided into  office-level, department-level, and ordinary workers and cadres,  they were now all operating on the same level, facing the same  markets. As to what, how much, and how they would produce, they  looked only to markets, not to the government. On the other  hand, the contracts clearly delimited government behavior,  clarifying what government should and should not do, and  converting the relations between government and enterprises from  the former one of the leaders and the led to one of the servers  and the served, thus speeding up the conversion of government  functions. The government assumed liabilities, such as  pre-leased enterprise bonded debt, and post-leased training and  reemployment of those who lost or were waiting for jobs, thus  sending enterprises into the fray with lightened packs. The  "four independents" of market subjects, independent operations,  independent liabiliy for profits and losses, and independent  self-development and -restraint forces, became a geunine  possibility. The contract system had pluralized enterprise  targets, often making sweeping assessments of enterprise  personnel, distribution, hiring, and even employment, education,  and sanitation, making government behavior more businesslike,  while leaving enterprises with no autonomy, not having to be  liable for operating consequences.    3. It combined effective growth and restraint forces,  overcoming the contract system's "shortsighted behavior." With  enterprise behavior marketized and enterprise operations  subjectivized, the prime responsibility of operators was to  preserve and add to the value of managed assets. Tongling City's  leasing contracts provided that lessees pay 1-10 percent of  leased assets as venture guarantee funds, 10 percent of leased  assets as leasing funds, and 10 percent of aftertax profits as  assets-guaranty funds, as well as setting aside depreciation  fund per provision. This sharply increased the contractors'  sense of urgency and pressure, while giving operators 20-50  percent of aftertax profits as operating returns. This  genuinely consolidated operators' duties, rights, and interests.  With rigorous accounting and auditing systems, leased  enterprises could no longer become "empty shells." Meanwhile,  sharp market competition and profit-incentive forces generally  kept lessees from "shortsighted behavior" that divided and ate  everything up. Tongling City generally set contract terms at  seven to 10 years. With lessor consent, 80 percent of operators  upgraded their leased assets, adding related equipment to expand  production. The earliest experiments, the Jinxing and Jinshan  silk factories, invested 170,000 yuan and 200,000 yuan  respectively in new fixed assets, as well as setting aside  development funds per provision. Employee incomes all  conscientiously adhered to the distribution principle of being  lower than both labor productivity and profit growth.    4. This perfection and development of leasing was a turning  point in China's socialist ownership, enterprise structural  adjustment, and property rights reform. As a market economy is  a free economy, legal and free operations and assumption of  liability are features of market-economy subjects--enterprises.  "Market economy development creates a nonpublic economy, whose  growth in turn speeds up market-economy growth, giving natural  ties between the market economy and the non-public economy" (in  the Seventh NPC work report by the industrial and commercial  alliance). The ownership structure that evolved under China's  planned economy, eliminating the level-by-level upgrading of  individual and private ownership, was very unsuited to the needs  of a socialist market economy. Meanwhile, as most medium-sized  and small state enterprise operations are linked to daily lives  in light industry and textile products, being small in scale,  diversified in category, widespread in distribution, and subject  to sharp change, leasing is more suited to these features, which  is a key mission of China's ownership and enterprise structural  adjustment. Leasing avoids the erosion of public assets, while  assimilating the maximum private-economy advantages. Tongling  City also provided that after leasing, lessees could use 5  percent of their aftertax income for enterprise shareholding,  with 20-50 percent of employee afterincome-tax profits converted  to shares for investment in enterprises. In this way, these  enterprises will gradually become jointly owned by the state,  the operators, and individuals, converting to shareholding or  shareholding-cooperative systems. Based on their conditions,  the state (government) can then either take out its shares or  increase its investment, while responsible departments or  industrial departments can gradually be converted to  state-assets operating companies, ultimately better suiting  China's industrial structure, ownership system, and property  rights system to market economy development needs.    While Tongling City's leasing reform of medium-sized and  small enterprises has just begun, with many issues not yet  having fully shown up, it is undoubtedly a valuable and bold  attempt to speed up the conversion of public-enterprise  operating forces. As to its initial operation, it is still  subject to certain problems that need solved, such as:    -- How to set scientific and fair lease-fund percentages.    -- The matter of the inequity between lessee-assumed risk  and  state-assets loss risk.    -- The fund shortage, with lessees having great difficulties  resolving working capital shortages on their own.    -- The relations of enterprise party, labor union, and CYL  organizational establishment and activity to private operators.    Another problem is that concepts do not convert easily.  While enterprise losses brought hard times, this was considered  an unavoidable matter, with no use in placing blame. While  leased enterprises have turned losses into profits, so that  times are better, there are invariably hangups and  misunderstandings about converting public enterprises to the  lessee's profitmaking mindset, leaving lessees with concern  about possible disturbances. Losses left an easy conscience,  while profits cause uneasiness, which is also a conflict.</p>

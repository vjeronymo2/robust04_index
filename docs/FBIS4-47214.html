			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N.D.: "Republic National Bank To Be Outside the </F> Framework of All Branches of Power"]    [Text] On 15 June, the Supreme Council confirmed Daulet  Sembayev as chairman of the National Bank. The National Bank is  assigned a special role in the banking and financial reform  program proclaimed by the president. Plans call for the National  Bank to be outside the framework of all branches of power. It is  seen theoretically as an analogue of the American reserve  financial system, a distinctive counterweight subject to the  lobbyist influence of ministries and committees of the Supreme  Council. On the eve of his confirmation to the position of  chairman, Daulet Sembayev was removed from the Cabinet of  Ministers, and thereby from the system of vertical subordination  to the prime minister. In the words of President Nazarbayev, the  National Bank will be responsible to us only for the state of  the tenge. Characterizing Daulet Sembayev during his speech to  the parliament, the president stated: "This is an honest man,  without question. I am absolutely convinced of his decency. Also  of no small importance is the fact that he is surrounded by  young, talented economists." At the same time, the president  noted that Sembayev "participated in drawing up and implementing  all the previous programs. This too must be noted." It is  expected that the National Bank, having received confirmation of  its authority, will undertake energetic efforts to reduce  monetary emission and, in the final analysis, to stabilize the  tenge, if this is supported by the political will of the  president and parliament. The appointment of Sembayev is the  first personnel matter decided jointly by the president and new  Supreme Council. The next candidacy to be presented for  examination by the session will be that of Mikhail Malakhov,  recently recommended by the president for the position of  chairman of the Supreme Court.</p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Observer: First abroad Hope Steven Astaire, 42, the fast-talking amateur jockey who runs the family stockbroking firm, Astaire &amp; Partners, has more success with his latest business venture than he does with his gee-gees. Astaire, who has only won six of his 150 races, has scoured the world and decided to open his first overseas office in . . .Israel. Tel Aviv is not the most obvious first port of call for brokers intent on international expansion. Its stock market does not even rank in the major emerging stock market indices. But Israel is politically stable, under-broked and has lots of wealthy citizens. Throw in the Middle East 'peace dividend', and it's worth a gamble. Astaire, whose uncle Edgar runs a rival firm in London's West End, says he is the first British broker to open in Israel and only the second foreign firm to have a presence. Fear of upsetting Arab clients may have been one reason why the big US firms have shied away in the past. But Lehman Brothers is on its way, so it may not be long before Steven Astaire's aim of making handsome profits in one of the world's last under-broked financial centres turns into a pipe dream.</p>

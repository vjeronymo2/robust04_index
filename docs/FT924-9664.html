			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Cautious trading as US goes to the polls Wall Street US SHARE prices weakened slightly in busy yet cautious trading yesterday as voters went to the polls to elect a new President, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 9.73 off at 3,252.48. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 2.83 to 419.92 and the Nasdaq composite shed 2.99 to 604.58. Turnover amounted to 208m shares. Analysts attributed some of the early selling to profit-taking following Monday's advance. News of a 0.3 per cent decline in September's leading economic indicators also contributed, suggesting that the economy remains trapped in a weak growth phase. Overall, however, sentiment was positive about the likely outcome of the presidential vote. Some observers said the market was in a 'no-lose' situation. If Mr Bill Clinton wins, the market would be pleased because its expectations would have been met and because a Democrat president would immediately stimulate economic activity with an aggressive fiscal package. On the other hand, if President George Bush earns a stunning victory, analysts said the market would celebrate because, ultimately, equity investors will always favour a Republican over a Democrat. The big corporate story remained General Motors, following the shake-up on Monday of its senior management. The stock added Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 32 1/4 in turnover of 5.8m as investors welcomed the appointment of Mr John Smale as chairman and Mr Jack Smith as chief executive, and the introduction of new, younger managers to run a company burdened by high costs and a shrinking market share. Oil issues were broadly lower, Chevron losing Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 68 1/2 and Texaco Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 . Berlitz International dropped Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 19 5/8 in busy trading after the Japanese publisher planning to buy the company announced that he wanted to renegotiate the terms of the acquisition in the wake of the sharp fall in Berlitz's third-quarter operating income. On the Nasdaq market, Coventry retreated Dollars 1 to Dollars 19 after reporting third-quarter net profits of 29 cents a share, up from the 20 cents earned a year ago but slightly below analysts' forecasts. Canada TORONTO finished lower after heavy trading, with bank stocks coming under pressure after Royal Bank of Canada raised loan loss provisions by CDollars 900,000. The TSE 300 index receded 17.4 to 3,361.6 and falls led rises by 310 to 249. Volume expanded to 34.8m shares and included a block trade of 1m shares in TransCanada PipeLines. The financial services index tumbled 2.3 per cent after Royal Bank, down CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 24, announced that its loan loss provisions would rise to about CDollars 2.05bn for fiscal 1992.</p>

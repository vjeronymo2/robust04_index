			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / International Company News: Paul Reichmann quits CIBC MR Paul Reichmann, co-owner and chief strategist of Olympia &amp; York, the financially-strapped property developer, has quietly resigned from the board of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the company's main banker and largest creditor. An official spokesman for CIBC, Canada's second biggest financial institution, had no comment yesterday on Mr Reichmann's position. But another source said Mr Reichmann submitted his resignation several months ago, before a liquidity crisis forced O&amp;Y to ask its creditors to restructure its USDollars 20bn debt. Canadian banks traditionally invite representatives of their most valued customers to sit on their boards. CIBC has refused to comment in any way on its relationship with O&amp;Y. But Canadian banking analysts have estimated CIBC's exposure at about CDollars 1bn. CIBC, meanwhile, has named Mr Al Flood as its next chairman and chief executive. Mr Flood, aged 56 and head of CIBC's corporate banking unit, will succeed Mr Donald Fullerton who is retiring after seven years in the top job. The appointment takes effect on June 7. Mr Flood has had responsibility for the bank's negotiations with O&amp;Y. He is unlikely to make any large changes in the short-term, beyond overseeing an expansion into insurance and fiduciary services when regulatory barriers are lifted on June 1.</p>

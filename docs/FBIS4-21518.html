			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of the Environment: </F> "Grants To Find Replacement For Cadmium Plating"]    [Text] Environment Minister Lord Arran today announced a  grant offer of 390,000 pounds, under the Environmental  Technology Innovation Scheme [ETIS], to the National Centre of  Tribology, within AEA Technology, Risley. The project will  investigate new technologies to replace cadmium plating in  corrosion protection and in bearing materials. The grant offer  covers up to 40 percent of the eligible project costs.    The Centre will undertake the project along with a  consortium  of twenty or more companies which are either current users of  cadmium surface treatments, or suppliers of potential  replacement treatment technologies.    Announcing the project, Lord Arran said: "I am very pleased  to announce this latest project which my Department has been  able to support under the Environmental Technology Innovation  Scheme [ETIS]. In its own interests, and for the benefit of all  of us, industry must research ways of making its products more  environmentally friendly by replacing harmful substances  wherever possible. This project is a contribution to the drive  to identify alternatives to cadmium plating. This is an  important objective and I wish the participants every success."  <H5>  Notes to Editors </H5>   ETIS was launched in October 1990 with the aim of helping  companies to undertake research into new environmental  technology. It is run jointly by the Departments of Environment  and Trade and Industry.    The period for submission of applications under ETIS has now  ended. The grant offer announced today is the last which will be  made under the Scheme.    In December 1993, the President of the Board of Trade  announced a new environmental technology best practice programme  operated jointly by DTI [Department of Trade and Industry] and  DOE [Department of Energy]. This programme will build on  experience of previous environmental technology schemes but with  emphasis on provision and delivery of information rather than  grant assistance to firms. The programme, which is due to be  launched later in 1994, will aim to make good environmental  technology and techniques more widely known to potential users  and suppliers. The Departments have allocated 16 million pounds  to the programme to be spent over five years. The programme will  operate within a set of priority areas to be selected by the  Departments in consultation with industry.    Cadmium is a toxic metal which may enter the environment  through many routes as a result of processes including metal  plating. It can be taken up by humans in several ways,  including through food. At high levels it can damage kidneys and  other organs and tissues. A European Directive, 83/513/EEC, lays  down limit values for the discharge of cadmium from various  industrial processes and also quality objectives and monitoring  procedures. The project announced today targets uses of cadmium  which are currently exempt from the controls of the Directive.

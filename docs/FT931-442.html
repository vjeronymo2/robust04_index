			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Observer: Royal chair If Coutts &amp; Co, royal bankers for centuries, had changed chairmen last year it might have detracted from the firm's tercentenary celebrations. However, Sir Ewen Fergusson, Britain's former ambassador in Paris, has now been lined up for the most diplomatic job in banking - looking after the accounts of the British establishment. Sir Ewen, who takes over from Sir David Money-Coutts in September, is not an Old Etonian - but he is a Scot and comes with glowing references. His job is not as easy as it might sound. Despite its great name and connections, Coutts has not been firing on all cylinders. The UK end of the business lost money in 1991 and although it is back in the black it could do better. NatWest, Coutts' clearing bank parent, has been surprisingly reluctant to interfere. However, it did put one of its own men in as managing director just over a year ago, and it would be surprising if Sir Ewen were given as free a hand as his predecessor, the great great great great grandson of Coutts' founder. Will he be given a seat on the NatWest board like previous Coutts bosses?</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Labour widens opinion poll lead THE GOVERNMENT last night ended a dismal parliamentary year with the news that Labour has extended its lead in the opinion polls to 22.5 percentage points, Philip Stephens writes. The Gallup poll, published in today's issue of The Daily Telegraph, showed the Conservatives trailing third behind the Liberal Democrats. It puts Labour's support at 46.5 per cent, up two points from late September. The Liberal Democrats stood at 25.5 per cent, down 1.5 points, while the Conservatives moved up 1 point to 24 per cent. Mr Major saw a small rise in his personal popularity rating from 16.7 per cent to 19.1 per cent. It still marks him out as the least popular post-war prime minister.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Prime Minister Josef Moravcik by </F> Andrzej Niewiadowski on 31 March; place not given: "We Must  Depart From Confrontation"]    [Text] [Niewiadowski] Mr. Prime Minister, you are head of  the new coalition government in the Slovak Republic; this  government has "replaced" the much-criticized cabinet of  Vladimir Meciar. How would you characterize the program of the  governing coalition, and what guarantees can you see that this  government will be more democratic?    [Moravcik] We have only six months at our disposal. We will  have new elections in October, which is earlier than originally  scheduled. Until that time, we want to change the style of  governing. We must depart from the policy of confrontation that  was pursued by Mr. Meciar. We want to establish conditions for  cooperation among all interested political entities, and we are  declaring this desire in our international relations as well.    [Niewiadowski] However, is it possible to reach a political  consensus despite all of the programmatic differences in the new  coalition, which is made up of both the Christian-Democratic  Party, led by Jan Czarnogurski, the "center orientation," which  is represented by yourself, and, finally, by the Democratic Left  Party [SDL], chaired by Peter Weiss?    [Moravcik] We want to underscore whatever links the new  coalition, not the differences. I do not agree with the opinion  that the main reason for recalling the previous government was  so- called anti-Meciarism. We simply had a different concept of  governing.    [Niewiadowski] What exactly was this concept?    [Moravcik] The Meciar government was a government of  improvisation, which we will try to avoid. In parliament on 12  April, I will submit a long-term program for overcoming the  crisis in the country.    [Niewiadowski] Could you reveal the most basic points of  this program?    [Moravcik] The most important thing will be the  transformation of the Slovak economy. We must fairly rigorously  adhere to the schedule in our contacts with international  establishments. The point is to attract foreign capital. We  must establish a system of guarantees that would make investment  in Slovakia profitable; on the other hand, we must liberate the  initiative of our own citizens.    [Niewiadowski] Are you also thinking about the privatization  of the national wealth?    [Moravcik] Yes, we are. We want to return to the old  federative concept of coupon privatization implemented, with  small technical changes, in the Czech Republic. We want our  citizens to have as much of the national wealth as possible.    [Niewiadowski] In the daily commentaries of the pro-Meciar  daily RESPUBLIKA, the opposition accuses you of acting against  the legislature because you have annulled the privatization  contracts that have been signed so far. Can the law be  retroactive? What is your response to this allegation?    [Moravcik] I cannot agree with it. We reviewed the  privatization contracts that have recently been forced by the  Meciar cabinet. We did this because we received information  that, during the privatization process, party interests took  precedence over the interests of the state. The people who were  privatizing the national wealth were selected in line with the  priorities of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS].  Whenever we came across a contract that--I want to stress  this--was not in conformity with the binding legal norms, we had  to annul it. Incidentally, it was not very difficult to find  such contracts. The government of Mr. Meciar was in an awful  hurry in its last days and committed legislative errors.    [Niewiadowski] Will the new Cabinet avoid such errors?    [Moravcik] The process of privatization will be accompanied  by permanent control; the coupon privatization will make it  possible for citizens to control the national wealth.    [Niewiadowski] Still, you are being severely criticized by  Meciar, who has even formed a "shadow cabinet" made up of former  ministers of his government. Do you not fear that the  preelection campaign may reach the streets and that Meciar, as  we already witnessed during a demonstration in front of  parliament, will accuse you of destroying the state and will  bring about a wave of nationalistic demonstrations?    [Moravcik] I would not overestimate the strength of Mr.  Meciar. When Meciar was recalled for the first time in 1991,  before the government of Jan Carnogursky was formed, tens of  thousands of people gathered in the Slovak National Uprising  square. There were far fewer this time. They were mostly  fanatic supporters of Mr. Meciar. One cannot feel the need for  confrontation in Slovakia. What seems to be wanted is the  creation of the atmosphere of peace and awaiting the moves of  the new government.    [Niewiadowski] These moves will also be of an international  nature. What do you consider to be the priority in the  relations with your closest neighbors? Let us start with the  Czech Republic.    [Moravcik] We must resolve the open questions of the  division of the federative national wealth and the issue of  frontier rigor. We are interested in maintaining the customs  union. These are the issues of paramount importance.    [Niewiadowski] What about your relations with Hungary?    [Moravcik] We must intensively seek a platform of agreement  so as not to allow nationalistic trends to increase. From this  point of view, cooperation with representatives of the Hungarian  national minority, which is represented in the Slovak parliament  by "Egyuttels" and the Hungarian Christian-Democratic Party,  will be very important.    [Niewiadowski] What stand is Slovakia going to take on the  increasingly more active foreign policy of Russia? Will it be  similar in any way to Polish foreign policy?    [Moravcik] I believe that the basic directions of the  foreign policies of both states are the same. Just like Poland,  Slovakia would like the political situation in Russian to  develop in the direction of democratic transformations. We can  say the same about Ukraine.    We need a stable Ukraine very much because it is our  neighbor, so it is our desire that the political and economic  situation in this country be based on solid foundations. The  maintenance of democracy in Russia and Ukraine is the best  guarantee of our security.    [Niewiadowski] Is the orientation of Slovak foreign policy  defined clearly and unequivocally?    [Moravcik] The new government will support the idea of  Slovakia's integration into the structures of Western Europe as  soon as possible. This is our principal strategic goal. What  we want is to join both the Western European Union and NATO. I  believe that the fundamental directions of the political  strategy of Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland  are very similar in this area. Thus, we can cooperate quite well  within the Visegrad Group, because it would be a pity not to  take advantage of the idea of this agreement. It is too bad  that the concept of establishing a joint security system within  this group has been put aside.    [Niewiadowski] Are you also for the institutionalization of  the structures of this agreement?    [Moravcik] No, I do not think this is necessary. I believe  that a system of regular consultations on the ministerial level  would be sufficient.    [Niewiadowski] A lot has recently been said about economic  cooperation between our states. On both sides of the border,  considerable pressure can be felt to establish the "Tatra  Region." Do you envision any concrete decisions on this issue  within the next six months?    [Moravcik] I believe that there are no serious reasons that  the "Tatra Region" should not be established and that it should  not function properly. The government will discuss the  materials left over by the cabinet of Mr. Meciar, and, with  certain amendments, the entire project may be accepted by the  Slovak party.    [Niewiadowski] What about over a dozen interministerial  agreements that were supposed to be signed this year?    [Moravcik] We are ready to make a considerable step in this  area to pass from purely verbal declarations to specifics. So  far, a lot has been said about cooperation; in practice,  however, it has looked different.    [Niewiadowski] After the 1993 elections, a leftist cabinet  was formed in Poland. Do you think the left may win the Slovak  elections as well?    [Moravcik] Most probably the left will not obtain such a  number of votes as to be able to form a government that would  have the support of a majority of parliament. The optimum  solution for Slovakia would be to maintain the agreement of the  present coalition, which has the character of a social consensus.    [Niewiadowski] Do you think Peter Weiss's SDL may run in the  elections along with Vladimir Meciar's HZDS?    [Moravcik] This would be a tremendous failure for me. I  believe that the SDL will be strong enough to transform itself  into a modern party of a social democratic character.    [Niewiadowski] You are the representative of the "center  orientation" and support the program of "democratic liberalism."  However, the "center orientation" includes other parties as  well: Milan Kniazko's "Association of Democrats" and Ludovit  Cernak's National-Democratic Party, which considers itself to be  the only heir to the Slovak national traditions and which is not  concealing its conservative ambitions. Do you think it is  possible for the entire "center orientation" to unite? Now, if  the center is divided, Meciar will certainly gain more undecided  voters....    [Moravcik] There exists such a danger. However, we must not  forget the political reality. It is quite possible to unite the  center partially--that is, agreement may be reached by the  "Alternative of the Political Realism" and the "Association of  Democrats." Both groupings will soon form the "Democratic Union  of Slovakia." Yesterday (that is, on 30 March--editor's note)  we decided to establish it. The "Union" will have a  "liberal-democratic" character. The supporters of Cernak are  further "to the right." All of the other "center" parties,  however, will form a joint preelection front; there is already  an agreement on that.    [Niewiadowski] If the coalition won the elections and you  were once again asked to form a new government, would you accept  such an offer?    [Moravcik] I have already said twice that I would not accept  the post offered to me--first in March of last year, when I  became foreign affairs minister in the Meciar government, and  second, in March of this year, when President Michal Kovac said  I should head this Cabinet. Well, if I were forced to change my  opinion once again...</p>

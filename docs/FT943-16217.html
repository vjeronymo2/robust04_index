			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Sweden counts cost of financial uncertainty The recent rise in interest rates, driven partly by concern over the rapid growth in state debt, will cut Sweden's projected GNP growth by up to a third next year and add SKr10bn (Pounds 847m) to the budget deficit, Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, admitted yesterday. At a special meeting on the dramatic developments in the Swedish financial markets over the past few days, Mrs Wibble told Mr Goran Persson, economy spokesman for the opposition Social Democratic party, that GNP growth this year would only be marginally reduced by the interest rate rises. The economy is set to grow by 2.7 per cent after three years of contraction. But Mrs Wibble said the knock-on effects of higher interest levels could cut growth in 1995 - previously forecast to reach 3 per cent - by up to 1 per cent of GNP. She added that the extra interest costs to the government would swell the budget deficit to SKr160bn in the current 1994-95 budget year from SKr150bn previously forecast. This will still be well below the deficit of SKr193bn, or almost 13 per cent of GNP, reached in the just-completed budget year. However, it is likely also to increase the borrowing requirement, previously set at SKr195bn. The news helped induce another bout of nervousness in local markets. Heavy over-subscription to a SKr6.5bn issue of government bonds, despite the announcement of a bond boycott by the insurance company Skandia, had steadied the stock market and the Swedish krona and eased interest rates on Monday. But yields on five-year bonds rose above 10 per cent again yesterday, the stock market fell by more than 1 per cent and the krona slipped against the main world currencies. Mr Persson described the picture given him by Mrs Wibble as serious and said it contrasted sharply with the optimistic prognosis for the economy routinely given by Mr Carl Bildt, the conservative prime minister. He said the Social Democrats would give more details on their plans to tackle the budget deficit before the general election on September 18. Underlining the continued weakness of the Swedish economy were figures showing unemployment had risen sharply in June. Although the rise was expected because of the influx of school-leavers and students on to the market, the total of 14.8 per cent of the workforce unemployed or in government training schemes is some three times the level before the recession. Graham Bowley adds from London: The Swedish government bond market fell back from its highs yesterday after a short-lived rally caused by follow-through buying after the success of Monday's auction. 'Underlying sentiment (in the bond market) remains very fragile,' said Mr Jouni Kokko, international economist at SG Warburg. 'It is clear that Monday's auction went well only because the currency was extremely low and yields were so high, which attracted opportunistic money looking to take profits,' he said. Analysts said the comments by Mrs Wibble that the 1994-95 budget deficit had been revised upwards and that the forecast for economic growth had been revised downwards had unnerved the market. 'It was read as a negative factor,' said Mr Kokko.</p>

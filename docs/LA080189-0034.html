			<p><P> August 1, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: A POLITICAL LOVE AFFAIR UNREQUITED  </P> <P> By my count, Peter Ueberroth has now spent seven months in his strange  courtship with California. Each time the fanfare about his possible run for the  governor's office begins to fade, Ueberroth does whatever necessary to revive  the frenzy and then coyly backs away. It has all taken on a ritual quality.  </P> <P> The most recent episode occurred last week in Los Angeles when Ueberroth agreed  to receive the attentions of Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and an entourage of  Democratic assemblymen. This crowd flew down from Sacramento with the mission  of luring Ueberroth into abandoning his Republican roots and entering the race  as a Democrat. As before, Ueberroth uttered encouraging code phrases to the  supplicants, saying he wanted to "serve the public," but committed himself to  nothing. Then he flew off to Colorado.  </P> <P> And so the churning started again. News of the meeting was passed on to  reporters, who duly wrote their stories and speculated whether Ueberroth's hour  had finally come. Sen. Pete Wilson, with a virtual lock on the Republican  nomination, was sufficiently threatened by the news to arrange a hurried-up  endorsement from President Bush. Meanwhile, the man at the center of the  churning said nothing.  </P> <P> This cycle has repeated about four times now. Peter Ueberroth, savior of the  XXIII Olympiad, seems to be toying with California. It is a curious,  Hamlet-like performance, full of ambivalence and arrogance at the same time.  And yet California seems to have a vulnerability to this man. We seem to need  him in spite of everything.  </P> <P> One of the more remarkable signs of this need is the widespread belief,  apparently shared by some political leaders, that Ueberroth could still win the  election in spite of the extraordinary barriers that now stand in his way. On  the Republican side, for example, the major players have long pledged  themselves to Wilson and are not likely to renege, given Wilson's position as a  U.S. senator.  </P> <P> And to run as a Democrat, Ueberroth would be forced to overcome a legal  challenge. State election regulations require that a candidate declare his  political party a full year before the primary, which will take place next  March. Ueberroth is still registered as a Republican.  </P> <P> Add to all this the fact that Ueberroth, as far anyone knows, has not raised a  nickel while the other main candidates -- Wilson, Atty. Gen. John K. Van de  Kamp and former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein -- now have millions in  the bank.  </P> <P> Willie Brown and friends knew about these problems when they came to Los  Angeles last week. And yet they came anyway. Perhaps, as some have suggested,  the visit was a warning to Van de Kamp, who has repeatedly bungled his campaign  and managed to offend his Democratic friends at the same time.  </P> <P> Perhaps, but I think there was something more behind the Brown flirtation, and  all the others that went before. California has slipped into an era where the  political landscape is a bleak as the moon's, and the party leaders know it.  Their candidates all seem to come from that same fraternity of C-minus, and  voters are so weary of it they hardly bother going to the polls. Ueberroth is  so valuable because he just might be that rare commodity, a leader; he might be  all the things that Van de Kamp, Wilson and Feinstein are not.  </P> <P> And there's something else. This state, in the midst of one of its greatest  booms, is simultaneously paralyzed by decay. The schools don't teach, the air  has turned the color of Coca-Cola, the cities jump to the sound of gunfire, and  half of the state legislators have a rap sheet. In the last decade no one has  risen out of the muck in Sacramento to deal with any of this. Peter Ueberroth  brings with him the persona of the fixer, a man who makes things work, and if  he succeeds in California he could just possibly take his party to the White  House.  </P> <P> Of course, the history of politics is strewn with the bodies of candidates who  looked perfect until their first campaign. And Ueberroth, a well-known control  freak, might find the messy world of the governor's race an intolerable  environment. He might unravel, he might just be boring, and no one will know  until he tries.  </P> <P> Still, the reasons for wanting Ueberroth on your side are not bad ones, as  Willie Brown and others have signified. So it is likely the courtship will go  on. The creaky political apparatus of California needs and wants Ueberroth.  What's not so clear is whether Ueberroth wants California.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Su Jingxiang (1372 2529 4382) and Meng Danmei </F> (1322 0030 2734): "Talks on China's Resumption of GATT Status  Enter New Stage"]    [Text] The talks on China's resumption of GATT status are  a major issue, about which people at home and abroad are  concerned. When the GATT was established in 1947, China was one  of the founders. After the founding of New China, China was  excluded from the GATT. In July 1986 China formally submitted  an application for the restoration of its signatory status.  Whether or not China can restore its GATT status at an early  date will affect China's political and economic structural  reform and economic development. Apart from this, it also will  have an important bearing on the final establishment of a new  international trade order.  <H5>  Reviewing the Process </H5>   According to GATT provisions, China should go through seven  stages in resuming its GATT status: 1) Submitting a letter of  intent to resume its GATT status; 2) Examination and  ratification by the GATT Council; 3) Submission of a memorandum  on trade structure; 4) Examination by a work group comprising  the representatives of the GATT Council member-nations; 5)  Submission of a draft agreement on resuming its GATT status and  the conduct of separate consultations with two-thirds of  member-nations; 6) Signing an agreement on resuming its GATT  status; and 7) Formally resuming its signatory status.    The first and second stages have proceeded very smoothly.  China formally submitted an application to GATT in July 1986  and the GATT Council readily and unanimously ratified it. China  submitted a memorandum on its trade structure in February 1987.  As the GATT Council varied in its views on whether or not China  fell into the category of "resuming GATT status," it did not  form a working party until May 1987 -- a date that indicated the  beginning of the formal talks on China's resumption of GATT  status. At the 10th GATT working party meeting in February  1992, the talks on China's resumption of GATT status completed  the work for the fourth stage. At the 11th GATT working party  meeting in October 1992, "essential" talks were held on the  agreement, and the talks are still under way so far.  <H5>  The Cause of Obstacles </H5>   Oksenberg, famous U.S. expert on the China problem, pointed  out in 1990 that the talks on the agreement would be the most  difficult job in the course of China's resumption of GATT  status. Facts have proved that the talks in this stage have  been more difficult and complicated than Oksenberg expected.  There are many reasons.    First, GATT has never been a "pure" trade organization. Big  powers usually decide their "tricks" in GATT according to the  international situation and their diplomatic strategies. Facing  the tremendous changes in the international situation in recent  years, the United States, Japan, and the EC -- all occupying a  dominant position in GATT -- have adjusted their China policies  and thus reconsidered China's resumption of GATT status.    Second, in recent years some developed nations have  constantly created trouble for China, such as disputes between  China and the United States over China's most-favored nation  status, the Yinhe incident, and arms proliferation; stalemate in  Sino-British talks on the Hong Kong issue; French arms sales to  Taiwan; U.S.-European joint action to impose pressure on China  concerning the human rights issue; and so on and so forth.  These large and small frictions have indirectly affected the  talks on China's resumption of GATT status.    Third, the draft agreement on China's resumption of GATT  status is based on the final document of the Uruguay Round of  talks. Because the Uruguay Round of talks was postponed time and  again, this directly caused a delay in the process of China's  resumption of GATT status.  <H5>  Speeding Up the Pace </H5>   At the beginning of this year, China stepped up its efforts  at the talks on resuming its GATT status. On 21 January, U.S.  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen visited China,and the Sino-U.S.  Joint Economic Committee formally resumed its work after a  seven-year suspension. On 20 February, deputy U.S. trade  representative Dawkins led a delegation to China to hold the  eighth round of consultations between the two countries on  China's resumption of GATT status. On 28 February, Brittan, EC  chief representative to GATT talks, visited China. The GATT  working party on China will hold its 16th meeting [as published]  in Geneva in April, and China will send a delegation to Morocco  in mid-April to sign the final document of the Uruguay Round of  talks. Viewing the initial results of the consultations  between the Chinese, U.S., and EC representatives and the  arrangements for future talks, we have reason to believe that  the talks on China's resumption of GATT status have entered a  new stage, and that it is absolutely possible for China to  resume its status as a GATT "founder nation" before the  Multilateral Trade Organization [MTO] established by the Uruguay  Round of talks comes into effect.  <H5>  Favorable Conditions </H5>   On China's part, it is equipped with the conditions to  resume  its GATT status. 1) In 1993 China continued to deepen its  reform and made major progress in this respect. The Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee decided the  overall structure of the Chinese market economy and ratified a  series of reform measures for the financial, monetary, taxation,  foreign trade, and enterprise structures. In 1993 alone, the  National People's Congress ratified 13 economic laws and  regulations, including the Company Law and the Law Against  Improper Competition, clarifying the main composition of the  market, standardizing market behavior, and laying the foundation  for entry into the market economy. 2) To cope with the  difficulties created by the U.S. Government, China -- bearing in  mind the country's interests and economic development -- took a  correct attitude and worked hard to improve its relations with  the United States. In January 1992, China and the United  States, abiding by the GATT blueprint, signed a memorandum of  understanding on protecting intellectual property rights; in  August and October, the two countries signed a memorandum on  prison-made products and market admission; and in January 1994,  the two countries reached an agreement on textile products. 3)  In 1992 and 1993, China maintained rapid economic growth and  registered rapid foreign trade development. Thanks to the  marked improvement in its overall national economic strength,  China has the ability to perform GATT duties and also has  strengthened its confidence in conducting consultations with  other GATT signatory nations on some "sensitive issues."    On the part of the Western countries, China's resumption of  GATT status will help boost their interests. In such cases, the  obstacles to China's resumption of GATT status will diminish.  1) China displayed its huge market potential in 1993. In the  first nine months of 1993, China's trade with Germany, Italy,  and Denmark increased by 90 percent, 83 percent, and 154  percent, respectively, over the same period of 1992. In 1993,  Japan's exports to China increased by 44.6 percent over 1992.  In 1993, China absorbed one- tenth of the direct investment  from around the world, thus becoming the second largest direct  foreign investment recipient after the the United States. At a  U.S. Congress hearing on 24 February this year, deputy U.S.  trade representative Balshevsky said that the Chinese market had  provided a "historic opportunity" for U.S. enterprises. She  added that China will import $40 to $100 billion worth of power  equipment in the coming 25 years, $40 billion worth of planes in  the coming 20 years, $30 billion worth of telecommunications  equipment in the coming five years, and $29 billion worth of  automobile parts in the coming three years. As a "huge market"  is appearing in China, many GATT member-nations indicated the  urgency of allowing China into the GATT. 2) China has regarded  the date for the MTO to come into force (July 1995) as the  "final time limit" for its re- entry into GATT. If China cannot  reenter GATT by that time, China will adopt a "bilateral" trade  talk strategy in international trade. In this case, many  countries are worried that there will be much trouble in  entering the huge Chinese market.  <H5>  Final Stage </H5>   The talks on China's resumption of GATT status have entered  a  crucial stage of "bargaining." In February, China and the  United States conducted initial consultations on a "special  protective clause." This means that the United States is  worried that after China re-enters GATT, its exports to the  United States will increase by a wide margin and create market  confusion. It therefore demanded the establishment of a  protective mechanism. The Chinese side expressed its readiness  to accept this clause conditionally (meaning there must be a  time limit). At the 16th [as published] GATT working party  meeting on China from 15 to 18 March, the majority of  representatives explicitly expressed their hope for an early  conclusion of the talks on China's resumption of GATT status, so  that when it resumes its GATT status, China will become a  founder-nation of the MTO, which will be established early next  year.</p>

For confirmation, as is appropriate in such a case, we  sought information from a medical source. We asked the director  of Niamey National Hospital for the facts:    [Begin unidentified doctor recording] What I can tell you is  that we effectively admitted a student who was in a coma  resulting from a head injury. He died around 0500 this morning.  [end recording]    So one dead and three wounded. That is the result of the  violent clashes that took place between students and police  forces. At the origin of the incidents was the demand by  students for the payment of six months of scholarship arrears.  This morning, our reporter Sadou Moussi held a telephone  conversation with Issa Boubacar, secretary general of the Niger  Students Union:    [Begin Boubacar recording] Yesterday evening, while Niamey  University students were exercising a constitutional right,  namely the right to demonstrate to demand the payment of their  scholarship arrears, the ruling power sent antiriot police  forces to crush the demonstration. Their savage repression  resulted in the death of one of our comrades, Tahirou Harouna, a  first year student at the Philosophy Department. Several others  were wounded. The incidents took place yesterday around 1700.  [passage omitted] [end recording]    Our reporter Boureima Noumou Maiga also asked Niamey Prefect  Souleimana Barry for his side of the story:    [Begin Barry recording] We were informed yesterday morning  that students were blocking the bridge with burning tires. We  know what happened last time when they burned private cars and  people were wounded. The demonstration was not very big so we  tried to contain the situation and to open the bridge to traffic  to enable people living near the bridge to go about their normal  business. It did not take long for things to be brought under  control. The bridge was open to traffic and I believe the  students returned to campus. As there were sporadic clashes on  campus, the police remained there. They withdrew at around 2000.  We were informed that one student was injured and that three  policemen were also wounded.    What is surprising in all this is that there were no  fistfights between the police and the students, according to  what the police told us. In regard to the wounds the student  died of, we are still awaiting the results of the autopsy and  the ongoing investigation. If there were no fistfights, one  wonders how a person could have been killed. [end recording]</p>

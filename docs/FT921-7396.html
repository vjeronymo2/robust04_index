			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Hidden costs that can make life policies so expensive - Figures of crucial importance for policyholders LIFE IS an expensive business. The figures below show, in detail never before exposed, the expenses with-profits life offices incur for each new policy that is started, calculated as a proportion of the first year's premiums. The statistics are derived from returns filed with the Department of Trade and Industry by the life companies themselves. As ever with the labyrinthine world of life insurance, the figures are not as simple as they seem. Not all of these costs are passed directly to the policyholder. But these figures give consumers crucial information on their policies. They cannot know what the investment return will be - but costs can, and should, be grounds for judging an investment. At the moment, sales of endowments, which often are tied to mortgages, seem to be driven by commissions. These commissions might damage the sales of life products, if they were known, publicised and understood. What do these figures mean? The Initial Expense Ratio expresses, as a proportion of the first year's premiums, the amount an office spends on starting-up a policy. One actuary described this as the 'price tag' of an endowment policy. In general, commission payments to intermediaries take the biggest chunk. This might explain why the one company listed in the DTI returns which pays no commission whatever - Equitable Life  - also has easily the lowest expenses. The cost of administration is the other factor in play. Some selling operations are more costly than others. TSB Life, which attempts to sell only to customers of the TSB bank and restricts itself to a narrow product range, is unlikely to incur the same costs as a larger company with a hungry sales force roaming the country in search of clients. The renewal ratio is a measure of the running costs of the policy compared with the annual premiums. How are these charges passed on to you? This varies according to the ownership of the life company. Some are 'proprietorial,' which means they have a single proprietor, usually a publicly-quoted company. Costs can be borne by the shareholders as well as by both new and exisitng policyholders. 'Mutual' offices are owned by the with-profits policyholders. So, theoretically, policyholders share in all the profits made and all the costs incurred by the office. If expenses are particularly high in one year, they can be absorbed by the life fund's reserves. They might not eat directly into the initial expenses of that year's policyholders. But they drag on overall returns and the practice, cannot continue indefinitely. Roman Cizdyn, analyst at Smith New Court, points out the bottom line: 'The lower the ratio, the better the value for the customers, the shareholders, and future generations of policyholders.' Which policies are covered by these figures? Only with-profits offices are included. Companies offering only unit-linked contracts, are not included. The impact of costs differs between unit-linked and with-profits policies. As Icki Iqbal, chief actuary at Royal Life, says: 'On the unit-linked side, we price charges assuming a certain level of sales.' 'On the with-profits side, the policyholders are co-owners of the business. They get 90 per cent of the profits or 90 per cent of the loss.' What do the companies say? Iqbal explained the sharp increase in Royal's expense ratio by saying that the company had made hefty new investment to cope with the Financial Services Act. Because sales had not come up to predictions, the company had embarked on swingeing cuts of Pounds 25m in expenses. These were already two-thirds complete, he said. John Turton, a spokesman for Provident Life, which emerged with one of the highest expense ratios, accepted the figures but said that the company's high costs would not be borne by policyholders. Costs were high because the company was in the process of an expensive reorganisation, he said. Its parent, Winterthur, is funding expansion, which has involved buying new offices and investing around Pounds 8m in computers. The figures are ironic as around half of Provident Life's business comes from a non-commission paying arm, which aims to distribute via fee-charging advisers. The company has lobbied hard for stricter disclosure rules which, in Turton's opinion, should be in cash terms or 'as close to cash terms as possible.' Shaun Kinnis, Equitable Life's marketing director, said that the office's expenses were reduced further last year, probably against the trend. He added: 'One reason is we do not pay commissions. It's also a question of productivity.' Equitable's 300 salesmen last year brought in Pounds 1.1bn in new premium business - an average of Pounds 3.3m per representative. The equivalent figure for the Prudential, which uses a direct sales force, is Pounds 123,000. What are the dangers of cashing in a policy early? These figures are the more alarming because it is plain that many policyholders surrender their endowments early, so bearing the full brunt of the charges but gaining no benefit from any long-term growth. A study by the Securities and Investments Board - released in December  - showed that, overall, a quarter to a third of policies were cancelled within two years. This injected extra fuel to the debate over disclosure which SIB had initiated already with its retail review of regulation. While several life offices claimed the figures were flawed (although they were defended by SIB), nobody has come forward with a comprehensive alternative. Early lapse rates put high initial charges in a worse light. Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumers' Association, attacked the combination of high initial expenses and early-lapse rates because consumers do not know what their charges will be. 'It allows companies to do what they like and hide behind an industry-wide figure which is not in cash terms and which consumers do not understand, anyway,' she said. 'It is shocking that they are so secretive. I think the high expenses and the secretiveness are absolutely interlinked.' Many people would make a further link between high commissions, central to high charges, and high levels of bad advice. In its annual report for the year to the end-June 1991, Lautro, the life assurance regulator, recorded a 77 per cent increase in the number of complaints, the majority of which relate to over-selling and the sale of unsuitable products. What should we be told? The Consumers' Association wants company-specific disclosure of costs in cash terms at the point of sale. This is one of the stronger points of view in the debate, but Eaglesham admitted that consumer research is necessary to find out exactly which method of disclosure is understood best. The present method, Reduction In Yield (RIY), shows how many percentage points office expenses would deduct from a projected investment yield of 7 per cent. Thus 4 per cent, a seemingly small figure, means that expenses would eat away more than half of your return. Companies make a performance projection using an RIY based on industry averages, rather than their own costs. An actuary on a Lautro committee admits: 'At the moment, I shouldn't think the consumer has a clue what he's buying.' Others point out that illustrations in cash terms, or projecting deductions from premiums, could in themselves be misleading. Many in the industry are nervous about broader disclosure, because this could deter customers. Others believe that greater openness is vital. A few points are definite. The early penal surrender values are not understood (the SIB data and Lautro complaints admit of no other interpretation) and must be made clearer. The proposal to show early surrender values next to the total premiums which would have been paid is sensible and must go ahead. Recent articles in the Weekend FT have shown that other forms of savings, such as unit trust savings schemes and personal equity plans, have outperformed endowments in the long term. These figures do not prove that your life company gives you poor value for your policy. But they should give you ammunition to ask some pertinent questions.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        LIFE OFFICE EXPENSES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Initial         Renewal                          Expense Ratio    Expense Ratio COMPANY                  1990     1989    1990     1989 1.

Sedov, NIKIMT Scientific </F> Production Association; UDC 621.791:620.9:62-519]    [Abstract] The specific features of nuclear power industry  installations and the resulting requirements imposed on the  welding practices, structures, and operating rules, particularly  the harmful impact of the installation environment on the  operating personnel and equipment, prompted the development of  remote controlled welding facilities and processes which are  more stable and informative. For illustration, the SA-296  automatic welding machine for gas-shielded consumable and  nonconsumable electrode welding of annular butt joints is  considered and its components are outlined. A family of welding  machines developed on the basis of these components is  described. The design of the automatic welding arc length  control device (ARND) which is crucial for use in the nuclear  industry is discussed. An analysis of the welding process and  equipment requirements for routine maintenance and repair  operations in nuclear power plants and the development and  operating experience accumulated in this field make it possible  to recommend that emphasis be placed on raising the automation  level by using welding adaptation systems.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The agreement signed by Carlos Menem and Raul  Alfonsin to amend the Constitution has prompted different  reactions among political leaders. Alvaro Alsogaray said that  the "prospects are good" and expressed confidence that there  will be no economic course change. Aldo Rico took a negative  stance: "I refuse to be an accomplice in a process whose  objective is to perpetuate the power of an entire family: the  Menem brothers." Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez also fired his  missiles. "The way politics is done in this country leaves a  very bitter taste: the secrecy, the lies, the doubletalk," said  the deputy representing the Great Front.    The agreement between Carlos Menem and Raul Alfonsin  continued to make waves yesterday. For example, Liberal Alvaro  Alsogaray expressed confidence that the pact for the partial  reform of the Constitution will not change the course of the  government's economic program. "The president's decision is  apparently irrevocable," stated Alsogaray, adding that "the  prospects are good if the reform is carried out" because "we  need to undergo a transformation from a socialist and centrally  planned system to a free-market economy with monetary stability."    From a different perspective, Aldo Rico, leader of the  Dignity and Independence Movement (Modin), gave a different  opinion. Rico did not mince words in expressing opposition to  the Menem-Alfonsin pact: "As an elected deputy, I refuse to be  an accomplice in a process whose sole objective is to perpetuate  the power of an entire family: the Menem brothers."    Deputy Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez of the Great Front stated  that  the pact leaves "a very bitter taste about how politics is done  in this country: the secrecy, the lies, the doubletalk." Alvarez  said that the accord "is a political deal for Menem and  Alfonsin, but many people are left out in the cold, for example,  those who voted for the opposition thinking they were preventing  the reelection of Menem. I think Menem and Alfonsin are cut from  the same cloth; they have the same tendencies toward personalism  and political hegemonism."    But at the center left, there are discordant voices. Santa  Fe  Deputy Guillermo Estevez Boero, a Popular Socialist, says, "The  dialogue between Menem and Alfonsin is positive, because it  establishes a methodology that can overcome conflicts and  political disagreements."    In any case, Estevez Boero warned that his party will not be  left out. "The legitimacy of this procedure," he declared, "will  depend on going beyond the limited, two-party perspective."    In New York, where he is attending a seminar, Peronist  Senator Jose Octavio Bordon indicated that the reform agreement  "is on the right track for the consensus that I have always  called for. We have moved a step forward." Despite the pressure,  Bordon opposed the government's plan to amend the Constitution,  which has now been tabled in the wake of the Olivas summit.    "I am much more in favor," he added, "because I also think  that the text will be much more limited, will inspire more  confidence, and will better serve Argentines."    There were other opinions as well:     -  Party of Liberation: "We urge the people to reject the  Menem-Alfonsin conspiracy, which will pave the way for Menem's  reelection, and thus for the continuation of this economic  policy."    -  Movement Toward Socialism: "The Menem-Alfonsin pact,  signed behind the workers' backs, is designed to strengthen the  institutions of this pro-business regime. They are scheming to  continue applying the hunger plan."    -  Order and Justice Party: "A  serious attack on legality has been perpetrated by the two top  leaders of the Radical and Peronist parties. The agreement to  reform the Constitution is equivalent to a white coup  d'etat."    -  Workers Party: "The pact between Menem and Alfonsin is  antidemocratic. Its sole purpose is to boost the reelection of  the current privatist clique, in response to the demands of  international creditors and big business in this country."</p>

			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / BZW to give advice on 'incorporated Name' BARCLAYS de Zoete Wedd yesterday announced that it is to advise Sedgwick Group, the insurance broker, on the formation of a Pounds 200m to Pounds 300m investment company. The company could be the first 'incorporated Name' at Lloyd's. At the same time, Lloyd's published a consultative document providing more information on how new corporate investors will participate at the insurance market. BZW, the securities house, will work on the project with CLM, a Sedgwick subsidiary formed earlier this year, and aims to launch the investment company in the autumn in time to participate at the market next year. The new company will participate in Lloyd's through a group of subsidiaries, each of which would function as an incorporated Name, backing a number of underwriting syndicates. BZW will market the company among both institutions and individual investors and the company intends to seek a listing on the London stock exchange. The announcement of BZW's backing for the project represents an important fillip for Lloyd's which yesterday announced that it was confident many of the regulatory hurdles preventing the entry of corporate capital to the market would be overcome. Lloyd's announced in its business plan that it intended to persuade corporate investors to join the market in April, following the erosion of its capital base in recent years. The new document provides details not included in the business plan. For example, Lloyd's aims to limit the amount that an incorporated Name can invest on any one syndicate to 20 per cent of the syndicate's capacity (the amount of premium it is allowed to underwrite), while in the aggregate, incorporated Names will be allowed to provide no more than half of a syndicate's overall capacity. However, there are indications that Lloyd's, which last week posted a record loss of Pounds 2.91bn for 1990, has some way to go before it can convince existing Names to fully support its plans. Many Names believe they are being discriminated against in favour of corporate investors. Ms Marie Louise Burrows, chairman of the Lime Street Action Group, which represents a group of badly hit Names, said: 'There is an awful lot of scepticism about corporate capital.' There are indications that publicity, linked to the mounting legal disputes involving Names, has been hampering the efforts of financiers working on corporate capital schemes. Although bankers involved in a number of corporate capital schemes are bullish about the prospects for profits as a result of rising insurance rates, they say that some possible investors have been put off by adverse publicity linked to the legal actions.</p>

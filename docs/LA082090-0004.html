			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIN TAXES  </P> <P> It seems we are always looking for something new to tax.  </P> <P> We have the cigarette tax, the gas tax and the 5 cents a drink tax on alcohol  coming soon. These taxes are tolerated because they are punishment for doing  something bad.  </P> <P> I have an idea for a tax that will pass the burden to another sinful segment.  It is the dessert eaters. Let's tax every helping of dessert 25 cents. We might  even tax desserts with raspberries a little more. I don't care much for  raspberries.  </P> <P> DON CALFEE  </P> <P> Highland  </P></p>

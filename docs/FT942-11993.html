			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Women turn away from careers in management Women are opting out of management careers in increasing numbers, according to a report published today which shows that the trend towards their greater representation in management has been reversed in the past year. The findings of the Institute of Management report, based on research among Britain's leading employers, shows that the percentage of women at almost all levels of management has fallen. Mr Roger Young, the Institute's general manager, said he was disappointed with the findings. He said: 'For years we have been delighted to record women's increasing progress at all levels of management, but now they have suffered a setback.' One reason suggested is that more women are turning their backs on corporate careers because of some of the tougher and more stressful demands of modern management regimes. Mr Young said: 'Some women could be reacting against the non-family-friendly policies of larger companies and opting to leave the stresses of corporate life for the buzz of being in control of their own companies. 'In 1993, women were twice as likely to resign as men.' The institute's National Management Salary Survey shows that women managers and directors in the UK's largest organisations has fallen from last year's peak of 10.2 per cent to 9.5 per cent. It is the first time for 21 years that the proportion of women managers has fallen. The percentage of women managers had grown steadily from just 1.8 per cent in 1974, to 3.3 per cent in 1983, 8.6 per cent in 1992 and 10.2 per cent last year. The report also shows that although women managers had higher salary increases than their male colleagues, women executives continue to be paid less than men. The average woman manager now earns Pounds 27,862 a year, while the average male manager earns Pounds 32,303. At director level the average female earns Pounds 56,040, while her male colleague earns Pounds 74,987. Women also get poorer deals in other respects. The survey found they are less likely than men to get company cars, and when aged over 50 are more likely than their male counterparts to be made redundant. The most popular jobs for women, said the report, were personnel and marketing and the least popular were research, development, manufacturing and production. The survey is the largest of its kind, covering more than 20,000 individuals in 339 organisations.

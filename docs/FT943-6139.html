			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Canadians consider launching offer for HunterPrint Quebecor, the Canadian publishing and forestry group, is considering making an offer for HunterPrint, the lossmaking UK printer. The move follows almost two years of talks between the debt-burdened British company and the Montreal-based newspaper publisher, North America's second largest commercial printing business. Mr Charles Cavell, president of Quebecor, said the group was keen to expand its presence in Europe, but warned that a bid could be derailed by problems at HunterPrint. 'There are a number of issues which are unacceptable to us. It's up to HunterPrint to find a solution.' The Corby-based company admitted that several pre-conditions had to be resolved and warned that any offer could be at a discount to last Friday's 9p closing share price - equivalent to a market capitalisation of Pounds 5.22m. The shares, which shed a further 1 1/2 p to close at 7 1/2 p yesterday, have halved in value since February when the group's auditors expressed 'fundamental uncertainty' over its prospects as a going concern. Net borrowings, meanwhile, have reached Pounds 19.4m against shareholders' funds of Pounds 11.8m. City analysts, who expect pre-tax losses to fall from Pounds 3.2m to about Pounds 2m this year, blamed the group's problems on onerous contracts with publishers such as Associated Newspapers and Mirror Group Newspapers. In an attempt to reduce its debt burden, the company earlier this month sold Hardy Printers, its only active subsidiary, to a manage-ment buy-out team for Pounds 1.85m. At the time, the company said that even after the disposal the group would 'only have sufficient working capital for its current requirements through the continued support of its existing bankers'.</p>

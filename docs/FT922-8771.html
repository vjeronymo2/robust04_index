			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Tajiks agree coalition rule TAJIK government and opposition leaders agreed yesterday to form a coalition administration to pull their country back from the brink of civil war, a senior Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) army officer said, Reuter reports from Dushanbe. 'A final document has been signed calling for disarmament operations to begin and for a cabinet of national unity to be formed to settle all disputed issues,' said Colonel Vyacheslav Zabolotny, garrison commander in Dushanbe, the capital. The agreement, still to be confirmed by both sides, followed talks on Sunday night between President Rakhmon Nabiyev, opposition leaders and the country's senior Moslem cleric, Qazi Akbar Turazhondzade. Col Zabolotny, who presided over the meeting at the city's army barracks, said he had brought the two sides together to prevent further bloodshed. He said 108 people had been killed in six weeks of conflict in the impoverished former Soviet republic, which borders on China and Afghanistan. Talks between government and opposition leaders continued yesterday and the president's position was expected to be discussed. Col Zabolotny said the new coalition government would have 24 members. Eight key positions would go to opposition representatives, including those of defence minister and security police chief. Yesterday's agreement called for both sides to disarm and for a permanent rally by thousands of Moslem and democratic opposition supporters in central Dushanbe, in its 47th day, to disperse. The president's position now appeared to be the only issue that could derail a definitive settlement to the conflict that led to the collapse of the country's conservative government last Thursday. A refinery fire in Nizhny Novgorod, east of Moscow, has destroyed a hydraulic oil production plant, causing problems for Russia's aviation and other industries, Itar-Tass news agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from Moscow. No details of the refinery's output were available, and the cause of the fire was unknown. The blaze destroyed 300 tonnes of oil and 100 tonnes of paraffin, Tass said.</p>

			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Murdoch's Pearson stake slips News Corporation's stake in Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has now dropped below 3 per cent, which is the lowest point for more than six years. In February 1988 Mr Rupert Murdoch held a 20.5 per cent stake in the publishing group, but reduced the cost of the holding by issuing Pounds 147m worth of preference shares convertible into Pearson shares. The stake has fallen ever since. By November 1993 it was down to 4.9 per cent, and by February 21 the Murdoch stake had fallen to 3.35 per cent. The Stock Exchange was notified yesterday as the News Corp interest fell below 3 per cent mainly, Pearson believes, through the continuing process of conversion and redemption of shares.</p>

Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For various reasons, such as state and federal regulations, many institutions may write call options only on a covered basis in a cash account. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Many of these institutions, however, are legally restrained from having deposits of cash or securities at a brokerage firm. Accordingly, in lieu of such a deposit, a bank may issue to the broker an escrow receipt on behalf of their mutual customer, in order to meet the margin requirements for any short options the customer may have written. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In the context of a short call position, an options writer is covered if he owns the securities underlying the options he has written. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Regulation T of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Federal Reserve Board''), in a cash account, an escrow agreement may be used in lieu of margin for a short call option position if a bank holds the underlying security for the customer writing the option.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  12 CFR 220.8(a)(4)(i) (1990). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because it is difficult to apply the traditional concept of ``cover'' to broad-based, cash-settled index options, <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  the Commission approved in 1984 an Amex proposal to allow index options writers to enter into escrow agreements without requiring them to collateralize the agreements with all the securities underlying the index. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  The original MIOER program permitted the use of escrow receipts for short call positions if, among other things, a bank or trust company held for the customer a ``basket'' of at least ten qualified equity securities. Due to inadequate recordkeeping procedures, settlement delays and financial disincentives, many market participants found this program to be impracticable and uneconomic, particularly in comparison to similar products traded on commodities exchanges. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Existing options on broad-based stock indexes overlie from 20 to over 2,000 securities. As a result, it can be impracticable for an index options writer to be ``covered'' by having appropriate positions in each component security. In addition, because index options are cash-settled, the securities underlying an index option are never delivered upon assignment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release No. 20732 (March 7, 1984), 49 FR 9665 (March 14, 1994) (File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;84&hyph;05).

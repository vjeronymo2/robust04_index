			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Keating ready to reshuffle cabinet A wider-than-expected ministerial reshuffle in Australia's federal government was in prospect yesterday amid speculation that Senator Graham Richardson, one of the most senior figures in the Australian Labor Party, was about to resign from the health portfolio. Prime Minister Paul Keating is due to announce a new ministerial line-up later today. This is in response the recent departures of Ms Ros Kelly, the former minister for sport, environment and territories, and Mr Alan Griffiths, the previous industry minister. Some elements of their portfolios have already been re-allocated on a permanent basis, but a number of ministerial responsibilities have been 'warehoused' (put on hold). This is partly in expectation of the arrival of the former Western Australian premier, Ms Carmen Lawrence, in Canberra. She won a federal seat in a recent by-election and entered parliament this week. Ms Lawrence had been widely-tipped to take over the environment portfolio, although talk of her receiving Senator Richardson's health responsibilities had also been mooted before the latest resignation rumours surfaced. Relations between Mr Keating and Senator Richardson have been strained lately, following a public dispute over whether the Medicare levy should be raised significantly to fund new programmes. If Senator Richardson does depart, he will be the fourth senior government minister to step down in as many months. Mr John Dawkins, the former treasurer, left politics altogether just before Christmas. Mr Griffiths resigned in January, amid allegations that party funds had been used in the 'Above the Line' sandwich shop, a private business venture. Ms Ros Kelly departed after it was claimed a sports grant programme favoured marginal Labor electorates. Both Ms Kelly and Mr Griffiths maintained that they had done nothing wrong.</p>

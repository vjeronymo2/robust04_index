			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian National Alliance leader Gianfranco </F> Fini by Antonio Padellaro; place and date not given: "No Need  To Worry, Fini Will Win in the End" -- first paragraph is  L'ESPRESSO introduction]    [Text] It is still difficult to say whether Italian  democracy can really trust Gianfranco Fini's ex-fascist  movement. Shortly after his election success, the leader of  National Alliance referred to Benito Mussolini as "the greatest  statesman this century has seen," to the horror of the  international press. And even within the composite Pole for  Freedom, Umberto Bossi has not changed his mind: "Fini is the  head of a reactionary right wing." Nevertheless, even Berlusconi  would do well to keep an eye on this young partner of his. At  25, he was a modest editor on the obscure SECOLO D'ITALIA, the  organ of the untouchable MSI [Italian Social Movement]. At 44,  he is at the head of the third-largest force (105 deputies and  43 senators) in the 12th republican parliament, and the fulcrum  for any government majority. What is more, they say he is  already working on eventually becoming the leader of an Italy  brought once more under the yoke of the Right.    What is Fini like in person? Polite, moderate, controlled;  cold as only those who have a lot of scores to settle can be.  What is he hiding under his double-breasted jacket? In an  attempt to find out, L'ESPRESSO subjected him to a long third  degree.    [Padellaro] Berlusconi's greatest quality?    [Fini] Spontaneity, enthusiasm.    [Padellaro] His worst drawback?    [Fini] Inexperience, a total lack of political experience.    [Padellaro] How long can a Berlusconi government last?    [Fini] It can go full term, just as it may not even see the  light of day.    [Padellaro] What is it about Bossi that astounds you?    [Fini] His absolute unpredictability. He spends his time  giving the lie to himself without ever suffering the  consequences.    [Padellaro] What is it that you cannot stand in him?    [Fini] He is really coarse. He is more propaganda than  policy, more rallying than reasoning.    [Padellaro] And how does Fini assess himself?    [Fini] Persevering, more obstinate, I think, than anyone in  the world.    [Padellaro] Faults?    [Fini] Too methodical and mentally organized, so tending to  be unimaginative.    [Padellaro] What use would you have for imagination?    [Fini] For keeping my opponents off balance.    [Padellaro] A definition for Francesco Cossiga?    [Fini] The Unfinished.    [Padellaro] Why unfinished?    [Fini] He was fantastic when he realized that the system was  collapsing, when, as president of the republic, he broached the  issue of renewal by taking a pick to it. However, when it was  time to rebuild, he disappeared.    [Padellaro] And what associations does Giovanni Spadolini  bring to mind?    [Fini] Well, beatific tranquillity. No false notes, and no  screeching.    [Padellaro] Which members of the old nomenclature are worth  saving in your opinion?    [Fini] Very few, or rather none.    [Padellaro] And President Scalfaro?    [Fini] He acquitted himself very well during the election  campaign. He was impartial and, when necessary, he defended  national unity.    [Padellaro] So he can stay on at the Quirinale.    [Fini] Scalfaro is the last president of the old republic.  If the new one is born, it is inevitable that he must step down.    [Padellaro] So all power will be vested in the Pole for  Freedom?    [Fini] Of the three of us, I have been the only one to say  that the lower house and senate speakers can be elected with a  wider majority, as they are institutional appointments.    [Padellaro] Which features of fascism do you think ought to  live on in Italy today?    [Fini] The attempt that fascism made to give our populace  dignity. The ability to get things done that transformed little  agricultural Italy, as it was in 1919, into a socially advanced  nation.    [Padellaro] A quality in which you would like to take after  Mussolini?    [Fini] Oh my God....    [Padellaro] His autocratic style? The magnetism that he  exerted so skillfully?    [Fini] No, no. I think that the one thing a secretary of  National Alliance has to avoid is being compared with Mussolini.    [Padellaro] Oh come on, do not overdo it. There must be  something you admire in him.    [Fini] Yes, the concordat, the reconciliation between state  and church. Not for nothing the pope called him a man of  providence.    [Padellaro] And your other great mentor, Giorgio Almirante?  Did he ever have the feeling that there was no room for the  Right any more?    [Fini] The split in '76 had very grave consequences for the  party.    [Padellaro] Did Almirante ever imagine the MSI in  government?    [Fini] I remember that he told some of us in '78 or '79: "My  generation will never see our ideas get into government, but  yours will."    [Padellaro] Have you ever beaten a communist up?    [Fini] I have given as good as I got, but I have never been  a  prize fighter in my life.  <H5>  D'Alema Is More Dangerous </H5>   [Padellaro] How did you get on with communist students when  you were at university?    [Fini] With some you could reason, talk about things,  perhaps  as you would in a drawing room with friends who have different  ideas. Then there were those who said that killing a fascist  was not a crime.    [Padellaro] And in parliament?    [Fini] I have known PCI [Italian Communist Party], then PDS  [Democratic Party of the Left] deputies of great substance and  great ability. And I have met some who were real animals.    [Padellaro] Name names.    [Fini] I prefer not to talk about the animals. A left-winger  that I respect is Farniano Crucianelli of Communist Renewal, a  highly civilized person with whom I have peaceful discussions  and play soccer.    [Padellaro] Do you see anything in the communist ideology  worth saving?    [Fini] Nothing whatsoever. Communism has not been defeated  in a world war; it collapsed by itself because it no longer  responded to the needs of the peoples concerned.    [Padellaro] Berlusconi continues to identify the PDS  disparagingly with the old PCI. Do you think this is right?    [Fini] No, I call them PDS members or postcommunists. What I  mean is that I accept that they no longer call themselves  communists.    [Padellaro] What has the PDS taken over from the old style  of  communism?    [Fini] Illiberality. For example, for the Left of a certain  type, an opponent has to be criminalized as soon as he proves  dangerous.    [Padellaro] Do you feel criminalized by the Left?    [Fini] The Left has assumed a schizophrenic attitude to me.  I was criminalized from 21 November to 5 December 1993, which  was when I might have become mayor of Rome. Then I was a  fascist. Afterwards, when Rutelli had won, I became a fair,  correct opponent.    [Padellaro] Nevertheless, the progressives did not treat you  too badly during the recent election campaign.    [Fini] While I disagreed with Berlusconi, they told him:  "You cannot form an alliance with the fascists, otherwise you  will become the black knight. Then, when the alliance was  formed, they turned to me and said: `Are you crazy? Someone  like you with a certain social element forming an alliance with  the capitalist, an enemy of the workers.'"    [Padellaro] Is the fair play that the PDS has largely shown  you merely tactical?    [Fini] No, I do not think so. When Occhetto and D'Alema say  that there must be a European Right in Italy, I believe they  mean it, if only because a European Left needs a European Right  in a two-party system.    [Padellaro] Which is better: Occhetto or D'Alema?    [Fini] They are two very different people.    [Padellaro] How do they differ?    [Fini] D'Alema is much colder, more methodical, more lucid,  more determined, a real product of the party school. Occhetto  has a penchant for witty remarks. On a human level, I like him  better, but politically speaking, D'Alema is much more dangerous.    [Padellaro] Once you are in government, will your party  reopen the issue of autonomy for the Alto Adige region?    [Fini] We feel the time has come to open a sort of second  package to give the Italians equality with the Germans.    [Padellaro] And Istria must become Italian again?    [Fini] First of all, the Italian character of the area must  be protected under a bilateral treaty. However, the frontier  question remains an open one.    [Padellaro] How can your nationalism be reconciled with the  League's federalism?    [Fini] I would describe myself as patriotic rather than  nationalist.    [Padellaro] Is Bossi patriotic?    [Fini] Not in my view, indeed I do not even know if he is  aware of the distinction between native country and nation.    [Padellaro] But what brand of federalism can AN [National  Alliance] accept?    [Fini] Our brand of federalism is compatible solely with the  presidential republic, like the United States. The League's  macroregions run the risk of shattering what little we have left  in terms of national identity and state.    [Padellaro] Are you in favor of the Europe that emerges from  the Treaty of Maastricht?    [Fini] It is an unequal match for Italy. It is as if the  Solbiatese [minor soccer team] were to challenge Milan.  Something has to be changed.    [Padellaro] And what must Italy call for at the forthcoming  G-7 summit in Naples?    [Fini] That Europe pay strategic attention to the  Mediterranean basin and the Middle East. The new trading  markets are to the south, particularly now that peace may well  break out between the Israelis and the Palestinians.    [Padellaro] Talking of Arabs and Jews, which side does your  heart beat on?    [Fini] The trouble is that both sides are right. However, my  sympathy was with Israel during the `67 war. I admired their  military organization, the structure of their state. But I was  15 years old at the time.    [Padellaro] The death penalty. Are you [plural] still in  favor?    [Fini] It is not a matter of current priority, and we have  never called for the reintroduction of capital punishment.    [Padellaro] And what do you call for?    [Fini] We demand that the sentences laid down in the penal  code be served right to the end. I believe that 30 years in  jail means civil death for a man, but they must be 30 years in  jail and not 10 that then become eight with concessions and may  even be reduced to six.  <H5>  Craxi? Off To Work in a Factory! </H5>   [Padellaro] Is it time to bring the kickback city  investigations to an end?    [Fini] To bring them to a proper end, those found guilty  must  give back their ill-gotten gains.    [Padellaro] Do you want to see Bettino Craxi in jail?    [Fini] I want to see Craxi get up at half past six every  morning, catch a bus, go to the factory, clock on, and find 1.5  million lire in his pay packet at the end of the month. It  seems to me a fitting punishment for a symbol of corruption  under 60 years of age. Let us have those over 60, on the other  hand, live on the welfare pension, which is undoubtedly the  harshest sentence.    [Padellaro] The RAI [Italian Radio and Television].    [Fini] It must remain public, but under completely new  management. This leveling of debts must cease.    [Padellaro] And what about the media?    [Fini] We call for true pluralism, guaranteed by the  professionalism of the journalists.    [Padellaro] The name of a television journalist that you  cannot stand?    [Fini] Look, journalists with a political bias do not bother  me, provided they do the job well. Santoro is factious in the  extreme, but he is certainly no fool. What I cannot stand is a  factious fool.    [Padellaro] So Santoro can go on presenting "Il Rosso e Il  Nero" [The Red and the Black]?    [Fini] I would have nothing against leaving him there. It is  the Santoro clones who are unbearable.    [Padellaro] For example?    [Fini] For example, there is a journalist who reads the TG3  [Channel 3 news] press survey in the evening, a woman who even  gets her accents wrong, who cannot even read Italian. I should  like to know how she got where she is. She will undoubtedly be  carrying the right party card.    [Padellaro] And which of the Fininvest newscasters is  better,  Fede or Mentana?    [Fini] From the professional point of view, Mentana.    [Padellaro] And your top favorite television journalist?    [Fini] Gad Lerner. And Giuliano Ferrara as well.    [Padellaro] Are there a lot of people wanting to jump on  your  bandwagon now?    [Fini] I have been noticing in the last few days that the  national sport is not soccer but the running jump onto the  winners' car. We have the world champions at this sport, as I  think Berlusconi is noticing as well.    [Padellaro] How about naming a few specialists?    [Fini] Mainly top civil servants and managers with  state-held  corporations, the RAI, and the banks, figures that would not  even have given me the time of day a few days ago but are now  calling me obsequiously: My dear fellow, how are you.... No,  we shall not let ourselves be corrupted by those who have  undergone last-minute conversions.    [Padellaro] Whey did you decide not to be a member of the  government?    [Fini] Along with a small number of friends, I had the  winning idea of National Alliance, which is now the  third-largest party in the country. Now I want to devote my  energies entirely to pursuing a strategy that sets out to  achieve right-wing government.    [Padellaro] The Right on its own?    [Fini] Not even the DC [Christian Democratic Party] managed  to govern Italy on its own. Let us say the Right in a  constantly consolidated position.    [Padellaro] Abortion. Will you call for the law to be  amended?    [Fini] The right to life must be guaranteed. The right to  abortion as a last resort must be guaranteed only in cases of  rape or when the mother's life is at risk. I reject the view of  abortion as basically a method of contraception.    [Padellaro] Convincing Pannella will be no easy matter if  you  go into government with him.    [Fini] There is no doubt about that. But he will definitely  not convince us.    [Padellaro] Drugs?    [Fini] The referendum abolishing the principle whereby drug  abuse is an illegal deed that should be punished was madness,  and it must be remedied. We also call for a more determined  defense of family values.    [Padellaro] How?    [Fini] For instance, giving homosexual unions legal  recognition would be a violation of principle.  <H5>  The Flame Remains </H5>   [Padellaro] Racial intolerance?    [Fini] It must be stamped out with the utmost severity, but  the Martelli Act [on immigration] needs rewriting. There is a  limit beyond which integration is not possible, if we do not  want an outbreak of xenophobic tension and agitation.    [Padellaro] Your comrade Buontempo is crusading against  prostitution and the transvestites. Are you in favor of  bringing back brothels?    [Fini] I am not very up on this issue. However, I would tend  to be skeptical about legalization.    [Padellaro] Has any book been of fundamental significance to  you?    [Fini] Giuseppe Prezzolini's Il Manifesto dei  Conservatori [The Conservatives' Manifesto]. Until I read  the book, I had always been convinced that conservative was a  pejorative term.    [Padellaro] What was it that persuaded you to join the  Right?    [Fini] My aversion for the arrogance and barbarism of a  certain type of left wing. And a movie.    [Padellaro] Which movie?    [Fini] The John Wayne movie, "The Green Berets," the one  about American intervention in Vietnam. I was 17, and a Lotta  Continua [Continuous Struggle] picket wanted to stop me going  into the cinema. The day after, there was a placard at school  saying "Fini, you fascist, you're first on the list." So I  said, hell, you just want to go a movie and you end up  pilloried. The only ones who took my side were the guys from  Giovane Italia [Young Italy].    [Padellaro] Do you think that the preconceived hostility to  fascism has died out now?    [Fini] Antifascism served to legitimize the old communist  party in Italy. Perhaps it no longer serves any purpose now,  but if it did, it would be revived, make no mistake about that.    [Padellaro] A lot of right-wing youths were seen giving the  Roman salute during your election victory celebrations.    [Fini] This is ritualistic behavior, and it has no political  significance. Those youths just want to express a need for  identity. Nevertheless, I hope that our young people will make  their presence felt in a different manner.    [Padellaro] Is it true that the base from which the  tricolored flame issues in the MSI's emblem represents the  coffin of the Duce?    [Fini] That belongs to the realm of mythology, to the tales  told around the right-wing fireside. I asked Almirante, and he  replied that he had heard of it, just as they used to say after  the war that MSI meant "Mussolini is forever immortal." Really,  the flame symbolizes boldness, and the object under it is a  trapezium.    [Padellaro] Will the flame symbol survive?    [Fini] Yes.</p>

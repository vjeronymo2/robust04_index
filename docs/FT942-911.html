			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Hiding their light under a bushel ahead of review - RECs Seven of the 12 regional electricity companies will be trying to show how different they are from each other when they report their results this week. Most will have only limited success. Their problem is that they will not want to increase their profits by a percentage that is much larger than the rest of the pack. To do so would attract unwelcome attention from consumers and the regulator just ahead of the most important review of prices they are likely to face. Later this summer Professor Stephen Littlechild, industry regulator, will announce the results of the review which will determine how much the 12 companies, together with Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric, can charge customers for distributing their electricity for the five years from next April. The companies that have reported so far have announced fairly modest increases, mostly in the 15 to 20 per cent range; some have been helped in keeping the total down by making some pretty hefty provisions for restructuring. This week's seven are expected to follow suit. Dividend rises are likely to be around the 15 per cent mark. Norweb and Seeboard report today. Norweb is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 175m, against Pounds 157m, and a dividend of about 22.5p, up from 20p, whereas Seeboard is predicted to announce Pounds 125m (Pounds 113m) pre-tax and an 11.6p (10p) dividend. Tomorrow Midlands is forecast at about Pounds 200m (Pounds 167m) and 23p (20p) respectively. On Wednesday Northern should announce about Pounds 125m (Pounds 111m) and 24.6p (21.4p) and Eastern about Pounds 220m (Pounds 183m) and 22p (19.2p). Sweb on Thursday should achieve Pounds 115m (Pounds 101m) and 23.3p (20p). Yorkshire will bring the show to a close on Friday with about Pounds 175m (Pounds 156m) and 23.5p (20.4p).</p>

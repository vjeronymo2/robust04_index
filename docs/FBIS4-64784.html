			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Deputy Chairman Oskar Lafontaine by </F> Einar Koch; place and date not given: "Lafontaine -- Lower Taxes  for Average Earners"]    [Text] [Koch] Solar tax, taxes levied on people without  children -- everyone in the Social Democratic Party [SPD] wants  something different. What can we expect from an SPD government?    [Lafontaine] Everything is clear for us now: There will be  no tax increases with the SPD! This has been settled. On the  contrary: We will lower the tax burden for average earners.  Solar pfennig or taxes on childless couples -- no such things  will take place with Rudolf Scharping and me.    I am, however, calling upon [Finance Minister] Theo Waigel:  Stop the Omerta! The Sicilian law of silence must no longer be  applied to the planned tax increases by the Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union and the Free Democratic Party of  Germany.    [Koch] What are the coalition's plans on tax increases?    [Lafontaine] There is increasing evidence that the Federal  Government is planning a whole package of tax increases  following the Bundestag elections. The government coalition has  prepared specific plans for increasing the value-added tax,  property tax, and the mineral oil tax. In addition, motorists  will be burdened with tolls.    [Koch] Have you forgotten that the SPD wants to introduce a  10-percent supplementary charge?    [Lafontaine] The Federal Government's 7.5-percent solidarity  surcharge will also hit small and medium earners. We will  abolish that immediately. Our supplementary charge will  completely relieve 80 percent of all taxpayers of this  solidarity surcharge. This will be a major tax cut for the  great majority.    For the remaining 20 percent -- that is, married couples  earning gross annual incomes of 120,000 German marks [DM] and  singles at DM60,000 marks -- we will increase the government's  7.5-percent surcharge by a mere 2.5 percent. Since the little  people have been the only ones that have had to pay in the past,  this will be a justifiable sacrifice for German unity.    [Koch] The SPD is losing in opinion polls; is the "comrade  trend" shaking?    [Lafontaine] All polls indicate that the SPD is ahead, and  the Kohl government does not have a majority.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 6 KYODO -- Ichiro Ozawa, a main  strategist for the coalition government, suggested his readiness  Sunday [6 February] to make all-out concessions to the Social  Democratic Party (SDP) over the issue of creating a new tax to  make up for revenue shortfalls from planned large-scale income  and residential tax cuts. Commenting on Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa's proposal to introduce a 7 percent indirect tax, Ozawa  said on a television show that he accepts the idea of setting up  a new tax as a special purpose levy on condition that the public  will approve.    In a predawn news conference Thursday, Hosokawa announced  the  plan to impose the 7 percent "national welfare tax" on almost  all goods and services from April 1997. It would replace the  current 3 percent consumption tax, whose revenues go into the  nation's general account budget.    In protest against the new tax, the SDP, the largest force  in  the seven-party coalition government, has threatened to withdraw  its six ministers from the cabinet and quit the government,  saying the new tax would amount to a de facto doubling of the  current consumption tax.    The SDP has demanded that any increase in revenue from the  new tax be specifically allocated for welfare purposes and that  a forum be set up within the coalition to discuss when the tax  should be raised and by how much.    Leaders of the government and coalition parties will meet  again Monday to seek a compromise on the matter.    Differences within the coalition parties and the government  over the issue have forced the government to delay announcing a  much-awaited massive economic stimulus package, including 5.3  trillion yen in income and residential tax cuts.</p>

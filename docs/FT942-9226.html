			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Part-time move for AA insurance staff AA Insurance Services, one of the UK's biggest motor and home insurance retailers, is to switch many of its 5,100 staff to more flexible labour contracts in response to the growth of telephone insurance companies such as Direct Line. This will mean further part-time working for the mainly female labour force as the company seeks to reduce costs and increase the efficiency and flexibility of its network of 250 shops. More details will come next month when the company, which is in talks with unions about the changes, announces an overhaul of its operations. Like other chains of insurance shops, the AA has lost business over the past three years to Direct Line and other 'direct writers', insurers which sell by telephone directly to the public, bypassing the industry's traditional middlemen. Recent price competition in motor insurance has also put extra pressure on margins. Shops which typically obtain a commission from insurers of between 10 and 15 per cent on business sold have seen their income squeezed by recent falls in premium rates. 'There is a fundamental change in the amount of margin available as a reward for distributing insurance products,' said Mr Mark Wood, who became AA Insurance Services managing director earlier this year. The AA expects the amount of commissions on motor insurance available to the country's brokers and intermediaries to fall from Pounds 700m in 1992 to Pounds 435m in 1995. Mr Wood said the competitive pressures faced by chains of insurance shops from the 'direct writers' were similar to those faced by supermarkets from discount warehouses. The number of AA Insurance part-time staff has increased from 420 in 1988 to more than 1,400 and seems likely to rise further as greater flexibility is introduced to shop opening hours, with evening and Saturday afternoon opening. 'Frequently insurance brokers tend to say: 'Let's open our offices when everyone is at work'. We need to turn that on its head,' said Mr Wood. 'The industry is very confused about the retailing proposition. There is a traditional view of us being a service like an accountant or a solicitor.' The AA recognised that more consumers were prepared to buy insurance over the telephone, but Mr Wood insisted that the group's network of shops made it ideally placed to offer follow-up on claims and alterations to policies which customers frequently preferred to handle on a face-to-face basis. Recent moves by companies such as Burton and Sock Shop indicate a growing trend towards part-time employment in retailing.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Unit in profit despite engineering loss Unit Group, the USM-quoted maker of timber pallets and precision engineering components, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 138,971 for the year to March 31 compared with losses of Pounds 236,649 previously. However, although the pallet division achieved profits of Pounds 474,610 pre-tax, engineering activities incurred losses of Pounds 335,639 and that division has been closed. Mr John Adams, the chairman, said the diversification into engineering at the end of the eighties had 'proved to be a costly failure'. Paramount was sold to its management in January 1992 and Green Pennant was closed in June 1992. Mr Adams said all costs of withdrawing from engineering had been taken as an extraordinary Pounds 1.55m charge and there would be no costs in the current year. However, as those costs were greater than anticipated there is again no dividend. Turnover fell to Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 28.6m) with pallets contributing Pounds 20.4m. Earnings per share emerged at 0.8p (2.9p losses).</p>

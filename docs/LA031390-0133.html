			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Marilyn Monroe's Estate: A judge in New York ruled that a fourth of the  proceeds and royalties from Marilyn Monroe's estate, which still generates $1  million a year, will go to a psychiatric center in England and not the widow of  her acting coach, Lee Strasberg.  </P> <P> Monroe willed 75% of the proceeds to Strasberg, and his wife, Anna Strasberg,  was named administrator of the estate after he died. Monroe willed the rest to  her psychiatrist, the late Dr. Marilyn Kris, who gave it to the center for the  study of troubled children. Anna Strasberg contended that bequests were limited  to Kris' lifetime but was overruled. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

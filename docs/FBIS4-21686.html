			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 28 KYODO -- Japan voiced tacit support  Monday [29 March] for China's proposal for a soft nonbinding  statement at the U.N. Security Council urging North Korea to  accept full nuclear inspections.    Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a news conference,  "not a single country believes it's appropriate to take measures  that could escalate things rapidly to a high stage (of urgency)."    Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States last  week conferred privately over a draft resolution.    The U.S. has proposed a resolution urging North Korea to  agree to follow-up inspections of its nuclear facilities within  one month. The resolution does not call for sanctions but leaves  room for "further action if necessary."    China, which is eager to keep open the door for dialogue  with  North Korea, says it is too early for such a step.    China suggested Friday that the Security Council issue a  nonbinding statement in the name of its president, Jean-Bernard  Merimee of France, which unlike a resolution could be adopted by  consensus rather than by vote.    Saito said Tokyo expects the 15-member Security Council to  take measures "most suitable at this point, as many members have  the same awareness of the problem as we do."    Noting that "the aim is to make North Korea change its  policy  and not to take punitive action," Saito said Tokyo does not  "object" to the dialogue approach.    As a permanent member China holds the power of veto, which  it  is likely to use if the council calls for tougher action such as  economic sanctions against its longtime ally North Korea.    South Korea's Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said Sunday  before adopting resolutions China's proposal "may be effective."    Concerning direct talks between Japan and North Korea, Saito  said Tokyo would positively respond if Pyongyang signaled  interest in such talks, which "it does not seem to have."</p>

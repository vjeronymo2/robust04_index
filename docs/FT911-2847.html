			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Guinness Mahon Guinness Mahon must be grateful that the Bank of Yokohama's pockets are as deep as its corporate strategy appears opaque. Otherwise, Guinness Mahon would presumably be put up for sale or simply wound down. Its pre-rights net assets of Pounds 44m could not support a future in banking. Adding Pounds 49m of rights proceeds by way of a Pounds 30m bridging loan will prolong the agony. Nevertheless, it will be something of a one-off if Guinness Mahon emerges in a few years as a successful merchant bank. The need for so much new capital only emphasises the extent of the Bank of Yokohama's gamble when it bought the bank in 1989. It is standing by its subsidiary on the grounds that having gone this far, it is worth keeping a toehold provided that losses and management are better controlled. How it will feel a year from now is another matter. As part of the rescue, Guinness Mahon will curtail its lending activity in favour of corporate finance and fee income from asset management and securities trading. This raises the question of why it needs much capital at all. The latter activities contributed Pounds 2.2m profit in the last full year and made up only a small part of this week's Pounds 35m interim losses. Given the volatility of securities trading income in particular, any return to dividend payment is likely to be a distant event. The bank has few minority shareholders. As the Bank of Yokohama doubtless foresees, they have little incentive to take up their rights.</p>

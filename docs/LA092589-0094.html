			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Bank Suspends Executives in U.S.: Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, at the  center of a storm over $3 billion in unauthorized loans to Iraq, has suspended  nine U.S.-based executives and obtained emergency funding, bank officials said.  State-owned BNL, Italy's largest bank, has said responsibility for the Iraqi  loans, which were not sanctioned by BNL senior management, rested entirely with  its Atlanta branch, which arranged them. On Friday it announced that nine of  the 20 executives at the branch had been suspended until inquiries were  completed.  </P></p>

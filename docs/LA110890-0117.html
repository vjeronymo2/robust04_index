			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> HOW TO: DONATE NON-CASH RESOURCES TO NONPROFIT AGENCIES  </P> <P> In recent years corporations have come under public pressure to become more  socially responsible. Voluntarism gives corporations the opportunity to  actively reach out into the community by donating resources beyond the  traditional cash and grants. Two options are to donate volunteers or non-cash  resources to one of the 1,200 nonprofit organizations in Orange County.  </P> <P> "Local businesses give valuables that nonprofits simply can't afford. Wells  Fargo donates desks, chairs and couches, acquired from redecorating," said  Vicky Woods, director of the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County. "Ours  is the only ongoing program in the country that provides quality office  furniture to nonprofits."  </P> <P> One of the most successful mergers of workers and companies to aid nonprofits  is the Corporate Combined Volunteer Project. Last May, nearly 700 volunteers  representing 30 local businesses pitched in for a day of repainting the  Discovery Museum and renovating the 90-year-old water tower that was moved to  the site in 1982. For Mary Ann Barngrover, public affairs manager at Chevron  Corp.'s La Habra office, the Corporate Combined Project met her company's  needs.  </P> <P> "Everyone had their company T-shirt on and worked together. The teams feel  pride in themselves and in their company's presence in the project," Barngrover  said. "This project envelops the major positive aspect of corporate  volunteerism . . . corporations and individuals working together to help others  in the community."  </P> <P> </P> <P> How Corporations Can Put Voluntarism Into Practice:  </P> <P> * In-Kind Services. Companies or small businesses print flyers and brochures,  donate lumber and renovation materials, or offer their own services to  nonprofit agencies.  </P> <P> * Loaned Executives. Corporate staff members are loaned to nonprofits during  company time, bringing accounting, managerial and other skills to the  organization.  </P> <P> * Non-cash Donations. Businesses donate office furniture, office supplies and  similar business-related items that can be used at nonprofit offices and homes.  </P> <P> * Workplace Volunteers: Employees are recruited to work in volunteer programs.  They work within all facets of the nonprofit organizations, from designing  brochures to heading up major fund drives.  </P> <P> * Corporate Combined Volunteer Project. Corporate volunteers form teams that  spend a day renovating a nonprofit building.  </P> <P> The Volunteer Center helps corporations set up in-house volunteer programs. "We  expose them to what everyone else is doing in corporate volunteering and help  the company choose the right program for their size and needs," Woods said.  "Last year, we recruited and placed 16,000 volunteers, and recycled hundreds of  thousands of dollars worth of office furniture."  </P> <P> </P> <P> How Individuals Can Become Volunteers:  </P> <P> * Contact the community services department within your company. Some companies  (Irvine's Fluor Corp., for example) have set up corporate community involvement  teams.  </P> <P> * Contact the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County. There are three  offices, each serving a portion of the county.  </P> <P> NORTH OFFICE  </P> <P> 2550 Youth Way,  </P> <P> Fullerton  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAIN OFFICE  </P> <P> (714) 953-5757  </P> <P> 1000 E. Santa Ana Blvd.,  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P> <P> </P> <P> SOUTH OFFICE  </P> <P> 23421 South Pointe Drive,  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P> <P> Interviews may be held in person or over the telephone. Be ready to identify  your interests, skills, hours available for volunteering and causes (elderly,  abused children). After a review of needy agencies, and based on your  responses, the Volunteer Center will recommend two or three organizations for  you to contact.  </P> <P> </P> <P> How To Donate Office Goods To Nonprofit Agencies:  </P> <P> * Contact the Volunteer Center Warehouse at (714) 836-6534. Donations are  screened before they are picked up. They do not accept any type of office  machine. To save expenses, the Volunteer Center prefers that companies deliver  goods to the warehouse, 515 N. Fairview St., Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Source: Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County APRIL JACKSON  </P></p>

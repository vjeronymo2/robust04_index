			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, Israeli </F> Knesset member and leader of the Arab Democratic Party, in  Jerusalem, by Fawzi al-Jundi, in Cairo, on 14 April, from the  "Dialogue From Afar" Program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Let us begin with yesterday's fedayeen  operation carried out by the Hamas and al-Jihad movements and  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statements that he will  not let the perpetrators wreck the Israeli-Palestinian peace  efforts. Let us begin with a glance at current incidents in the  occupied territories and their link with Israel's slowness in  implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord.    [Darawshah] The recent incidents that claimed the lives of  innocent Palestinian and Israeli people are regrettable and  painful. The criminal acts carried out by the settlers in the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron and other regrettable incidents  that followed and led to the fall of martyrs from our  Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza have escalated the  situation. This took place against a background of tangible  slowness in implementing the Gaza-Jericho accord and the Oslo  accord, responsibility for which lies with the Israeli  Government, particularly the prime minister.    In general, we can say that these incidents carried out by  Israeli or Palestinian extremists aim to undermine the peace  process. Acts carried out by Jewish settlers or the Israeli  army are reciprocated with retaliatory measures by Palestinian  elements. What links the Israeli and Palestinian extremists is  their desire to end the peace process and preclude any progress.  The Palestinian elements say the Oslo accord is not enough and  do not want it implemented, while the Israeli extremists  consider the Oslo accord a betrayal of Jews in Israel and do not  want to give up an inch of occupied Arab land. Hence, they do  their utmost to undermine this accord. I believe the Israeli  Government and the PLO, the Israeli and Palestinian peoples, and  the entire region's nations have a mutual interest in stopping  the massacres, repressive measures, hostile acts against  civilians, advancing the peace process, and implementing the  accord. This is the real test of Rabin's government now.    [Al-Jundi] Yesterday's fedayeen operation was supposed to  coincide with the completion of the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho on 13 April. It came in light of Israeli  statements, especially by the first man in the Israeli  Government--I mean Yitzhaq Rabin--that the withdrawal dates are  not sacred. Does this mean a direct answer to the Israeli  slowness and continuing evasion of commitments?    [Darawshah] We want the Israeli Government to adhere to the  accord and the Israeli Army to withdraw immediately from Gaza  and Jericho and from all the occupied Arab territories. This is  our principled stance. Those who commit such acts aim to  destroy the entire peace process. They do not want to encourage  the Israeli Government to implement the accord but want to end  the peace process.    We strongly condemned the massacre at the al-Ibrahimi  Mosque and the painful incidents against Israeli civilians in  'Afula and Hadera. These acts harm relations between the two  peoples, hurt the peace process, and intensify the old enmity in  the region. We must work to curb these acts and advance the  peace process to achieve Arab rights. Only through a peace  agreement can the Palestinian people achieve their national  legitimate rights. The main solution is a peace agreement  ensuring an end to the occupation and recognition of the  Palestinian people's right to self-determination. When we say  an end to occupation, we mean the removal of Israel's occupation  of all the Arab territories in the West Bank, Gaza, the Golan,  south Lebanon, and the occupied Jordanian territory.    Israel must know that the Palestinians are a struggling  people, eager for their freedom and independence, and cannot  accept the continuation of occupation. The Israeli Government  must realize that as long as the occupation continues, violence  and resistance will continue and innocent victims from both  peoples will continue to fall. The key is in the hand of the  Israeli Government. I hope this government and the Israeli  public will wake up and realize that continuing occupation means  continuing bloodshed on both sides. One side cannot keep  everything it wants and continue the occupation without  expecting resistance from the other, the Palestinians.    [Al-Jundi] The Israeli Knesset, of which you are a member,  can put pressure on the Israeli Government, although the ruling  Labor Party enjoys a majority in the Knesset. How can the  Knesset and the Israeli public pressure Yitzhaq Rabin and his  government?    [Darawshah] Regrettably, the recent painful incidents in  both  'Afula and Hadera in the past few days in which innocent people  were killed and scores were injured boosted the rightist forces  on the Israeli street. The Israelis reacted negatively to these  incidents. This puts great pressure on the Israeli Government  concerning the peace process. Even in the Knesset, the  right-wing trend has gained ground. Although the government  retains the majority in the Knesset, the rightists, primarily  the Likud Party, have intensified their attack against the  government, accusing it of adopting a weak position toward the  Palestinians and of encouraging terrorism. These acts backfire  on the Palestinian people and on the peace process. I do not  believe that the killing of more citizens, Arabs or Jews, will  resolve the conflict in the region. The solution must be  peaceful and the Israeli Government must work to withdraw  immediately from Gaza and Jericho and allow the PLO to assume  Palestinian sovereignty on Palestinian territory there.  Agreement on the permanent solution, not only the interim one,  must also be accelerated.    [Al-Jundi] Thank you.    [Darawshah] You are welcome.</p>

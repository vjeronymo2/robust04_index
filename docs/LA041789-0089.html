			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CUSTOMERS PULL $60 MILLION OUT OF LINCOLN S&amp;L;  </P> <P> CONFUSION ON PARENT'S BANKRUPTCY STATUS CITED BY REGULATORS  </P> <P> Customers withdrew $60 million from Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan  Assn. within 48 hours of its seizure Friday, apparently due to confusion over  bankruptcy plans of its parent corporation, federal regulators said Sunday.  </P> <P> Some depositors closed certificate accounts before maturity and paid the early  withdrawal penalty because of confusion about the status of the thrift, said M.  Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.  </P> <P> Wall announced Sunday that Lincoln, with 29 branches, will reimburse any early  withdrawal penalties to customers who elect to reinstate their certificate  accounts withdrawn since last Friday, April 14.  </P> <P> Wall, who heads the agency that put Lincoln into a conservatorship Friday, said  the policy will continue "until further notice."  </P> <P> "Now that depositors can see Lincoln is continuing to operate as usual under  strong new management, we are extending the opportunity for them to reinstate  their accounts and have the early withdrawal penalty reversed," Wall said.  </P> <P> Federal regulators took control of Lincoln on Friday after the parent company,  American Continental Corp. of Phoenix, declared bankruptcy Thursday. Wall said  the confusion stemmed from the bankruptcy filing, which did not include  Lincoln. Lincoln has a new chief executive officer and advisory board and is  operating under the control of federal regulators.  </P> <P> A Bank Board spokeswoman said the $60 million in withdrawals is significant but  not an overwhelming amount for Lincoln.  </P> <P> "It's a huge institution, and that number looks a lot bigger than when you  consider how big the institution is. It has over $5.4 billion in assets,"  Martha Gravlee said.  </P> <P> Wall insisted that depositors "have no reason to withdraw their funds."  </P> <P> Funds are insured by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. and the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is being brought in as conservator, Wall said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Misunderstanding'  </P> <P> "The concern that we have is that some people have confused or misunderstood  the relationship between American Continental . . . and the savings and loan  that they own in California that is not part of the bankruptcy," Wall said.  </P> <P> Wall would not characterize the money loss as a run on the S&amp;L but  described Saturday's activity as "heavy withdrawals," with particularly great  activity at a limited number of branches.  </P> <P> Part of the confusion apparently stems from the fact that many Lincoln Savings  customers were aware that its parent was seeking bankruptcy protection because  they had invested in bonds issued by American Continental, Wall said.  </P> <P> Some of those bonds were sold at Lincoln Savings branches but the bonds were  not insured because they weren't deposits.  </P> <P> Wall speculated that those branches with the greatest withdrawal activity may  have been where greater numbers of bonds were sold.  </P> <P> All of Lincoln Savings' branches are in Southern California. As of mid-1988 it  was ranked as the state's 18th-largest thrift.  </P> <P> The Bank Board said upon seizing Lincoln that its troubles began when American  Continental bought it in 1984.  </P> <P> The board said management had abandoned its traditional operations to pursue "a  rapid growth strategy based on soliciting brokered deposits to purchase real  estate and to fund high-risk acquisition, development and construction loans,  equity securities and junk bonds."  </P> <P> The Associated Press contributed to this story.  </P></p>

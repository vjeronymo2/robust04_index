			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn, April 11 (XINHUA) -- NATO Secretary General  Manfred Woerner today said the western alliance will do its best  to avoid involvement in a bigger conflict with the Bosnian Serbs.    In an interview with the No. 2 German television station  ZDF,  Woerner said that NATO does not intend to send ground troops to  the region.    The NATO chief said the western alliance favors negotiations  backed with "limited military actions" in hopes of giving a push  to the negotiating process.    His statement came after NATO launched its second air raid  earlier in the day on Serb positions around the U.N.-designated  safe area of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia.    NATO bombed on Sunday and Monday Serb positions around the  Muslim enclave in order to halt the Serb advance and protect  U.N. personnel there from the Serb attackers.    U.N. special envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi, who  authorized the two air strikes in less than 24 hours, warned  Serbs of more air raids if they continue attacking Gorazde.    Woerner hoped the air strikes would produce "expected  results" as was the case in Sarajevo,    Earlier this year, NATO succeeded in making Serbs withdraw  their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo and lift the siege of  the Bosnian capital by threatening air strikes against Serbs.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: The Israeli leaders are trying to group  contradictory things together. They also believe they can  convince the world that they are saying and doing the right  things. These leaders are carrying out flagrantly savage  attacks on Lebanon and destroying homes over the very heads of  their peaceful civilian inhabitants. At the same time, they  allege that these attacks are not directed against the peace  process and will not affect it.    The Israelis are also carrying out acts of piracy and  abduction and encroaching upon the sovereignty of a UN member  state. Moreover, they daily threaten Lebanon with an open war.  In their statements, however, the Israelis are trying to  convince the world that all this does not mean they have  abandoned the peace process or the objective of obtaining peace.  But how can a reasonable man be convinced that the large  military buildup in the occupied part of southern Lebanon as  well as the threats, the continued shelling of southern Lebanese  villages and towns, and the beating of war drums can be in  harmony with the atmosphere of peace?    It is impossible to put summer and winter together. Israel's  contradictions and allegations will convince anyone. If the  Israelis believe they can mislead the world and portray their  savage attacks as a defense of Israeli security, they are  undoubtedly deluded. This is because the actions of the  Lebanese national resistance are a result, and not a cause, of  occupation. Thus, as long as the occupation continues, the  resistance will continue because it is the Lebanese people's  right, as acknowledged by all international laws and norms.    If Israel is working to achieve its security, as it claims,  all it has to do is to comply with UN resolutions, particularly  Resolution 425 which calls on Israel to unconditionally withdraw  its forces from southern Lebanon. It has become well known that  Israeli security has never been threatened and that the opposite  is actually true. In other words, Arab security is currently  threatened, and for more than half a century the Arabs have been  subjected to Israeli aggression. Moreover, the Arab territories  are still under occupation at a time when Israeli aircraft,  artillery, tanks, and warships bombard and destroy Arab  villages, towns, and houses in Lebanon and other Arab  territories and kill Arabs. So, it is not the opposite that is  taking place.    For those who want further confirmation and information on  who is the aggressor and who is the victim, and who is the  executioner and who is the victim, the records of the United  Nations, specifically the UN Security Council, are replete with  resolutions condemning Israel for its aggressions against the  Arabs    From this premise, the security excuse is not convincing.  Israel is trying to use this card to cover up its real stand  and reason for escalating its aggression against Lebanon. On  one hand, Israel wants to bring the utmost pressure to bear on  Lebanon to confuse it and force it to submit to its conditions  which Lebanon rejected at the negotiation table. Israel wants  to separate Lebanon from Syria and to end coordination between  them as part of its policy of dealing with the Arab parties one  after the other, thus making it easier for it to impose its  conditions and will on them and to drag them into partial  agreements and separate deals that would secure its hegemony and  control over the land it occupies.    What is more important is that by carrying out aggression  and  threatening to wage an open war against Lebanon, Israel would  thus resort to the most effective means for torpedoing the peace  process because a just and comprehensive peace limits its moves,  checks its designs for expansion, and demarcates its borders  which, as yet, have been demarcated only on the basis of the  well-known Zionist concept of the borders from the Euphrates to  the Nile.    By igniting the situation in Lebanon, Israel brings the  region to the brink of war and makes it move far from the peace  which the entire world seeks to establish in this region whose  people have been afflicted with wars and destruction since  Israel's establishment.    It goes without saying that the absence of a deterring  punishment of the agressor, the adoption of two yardsticks, and  the failure to adopt a firm stand toward the recurrent Israeli  attacks against the Arabs, encourage Israeli leaders to continue  threatening the opportunities for peace, and push the region to  the brink of war.    Had the international community been as firm and as decisive  as it was in other areas in confronting the aggressor and  forcing it to implement UN resolutions, Israel would not have  continued its defiance of the international community, and peace  in the region would have been closer than at any other time.    Israel is exposing peace and security in the region to  unfathomable dangers. The international community, specifically  the sponsors of the peace process, should take the initiative  before the opportunity is lost and peace is endangered.</p>

			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Winners and losers Not many of the 103 world leaders who sat down at the Earth Summit managed to leave Rio with all they hoped for. For some, the Earth Summit was a dismal failure, with disappointingly few achievements and all its decisions falling well short of the original goals. But in other ways, it was a success - the first convocation of world leaders since the end of the cold war and a forum for rigorous debate on policies which had never been examined before. Among the winners and losers: DETROIT: The US insistence on weakening the treaty to curb 'greenhouse gases' takes pressure off gas-guzzling industries. Although attempts were made to debate a carbon tax, this got lost in the wash. But Opec still objects to measures in Agenda 21 intended to clean up the atmosphere. WHITE HOUSE: the disastrous US handling of the summit cast it as the villain from day one and led to Greenpeace denouncing President Bush as an 'environmental degenerate'. Which was a pity because the US's comments on the issues showed it had thought many of them through much further than the platitudinous majority of countries. BRAZIL: The conference may have cost Brazil Dollars 37m (Pounds 20.3m) to mount, but its virtually trouble-free organisation earned the host country high praise, and as much as Dollars 100m in revenues from the 30,000 people who attended. EUROPEAN COMMISSION: Ripa di Meana's dramatic refusal to attend was quickly forgotten, and Jacques Delors had to cancel both his speech and a press conference to cadge a ride home on Concorde with President Mitterrand. A supposed EC aid initiative of Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) was derided as an accounting trick, showing Brussels still has no role to play at inter-governmental conferences. JAPAN: astute diplomacy made it a pacesetter on environmental issues, though the new aid it put on the table of around Dollars 2.5bn was less than expected. The only setback came when prime minister Miyazawa was unable to attend, and was refused permission to address the summit by satellite link. FORESTS: No binding measures at all to preserve tropical forests emerged from the summit, even though this is one issue most people care about. The Third World refused to cede its right to cut down trees for its livelihood, and the industrial countries' threat to withhold aid money cut no ice. WORLD BANK: was confirmed as the main channel for environmental finance for the Third World, beating a rival bid by G77 countries to create a new Green Fund. The Global Environment Facility, jointly administered by the Bank and the UN, will be more than doubled in size (but see also Third World). THIRD WORLD: The stinginess of aid pledges by the rich countries fell below the most pessimistic forecasts. Even the UN summit organisers, who advocated increased aid, conceded that poor countries would have to finance four fifths of their environmental work themselves. TELERJ: The Rio de Janeiro telephone company which hired out thousands of portable telephones and thereby held the sprawling conference together, cleaning up millions in the process. NGOs: non-governmental organisations were supposed to be deeply involved in the conference, providing technical support and influencing debate. But they were shut out by the politicians, and spent most of their time at their Global Forum 50km away, where they ran out of money and had their electricity cut off.</p>

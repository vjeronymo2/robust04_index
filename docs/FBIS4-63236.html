			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gennadiy Klyuchikov: "Number of Officers </F> Decreases, Whereas That of Officers' Unions -- Increases"]    [Text] Information has flashed through Russian media about  a congress of the Officers' Union [SO], held under heightened  secrecy somewhere in a Moscow suburban area. The main issue on  the congress agenda was the creation of a network of military  political structures in the system of power ministries both in  Russia and other former USSR republics. It addition, it was  envisioned that this structure would be under the rigid control  of Moscow.    Congress participants, who represented analogous  organizations in their countries, including Ukraine and the  Crimea, expressed their wish to transform themselves into  republican branches of the SO and actively work for the  restoration of Soviet power in all the Republics of the  "disintegrated, but not annihilated, USSR."    It is known that the SO has a fairly strong position in the  central apparatus of the Defense Ministries of Russia, Ukraine,  and Belarus. SO leaders did not hide that they have pertinent  information from these ministries on what is going on in the  higher echelons of power, including top-secret documents.    The leadership of the Ukraine Officers' Union firmly denies  any participation by its delegates in this congress. Does this  mean that another, virtually unknown, officers' union is  operating in Ukraine's Armed Forces?    Our Defense Ministry has seemingly not heard of either the  SO  congress or of the participation of Ukrainian Army  representatives in it. Defense Ministry leadership will have to  find out who consented to the Ukrainian servicemen's  participation in the Moscow congress. However, some conclusions  can be drawn right now. The main conclusion is quite clear:  The Army is not a place for any unions, since it always tends  to be politicized and struggling for power, inevitably splitting  servicemen into "good guys" and "bad guys."</p>

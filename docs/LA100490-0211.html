			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 STATIONS LIFT BANS ON POLITICAL ADS IN NEWSCASTS;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: CHANNELS 2, 4 AND 5 JOIN OTHERS IN BOWING TO ECONOMIC FACTORS. SOME  FEAR THAT ADS MAY BE MISCONSTRUED AS NEWS.  </P> <P> Despite previous concerns over the dangers of broadcasting paid political  advertising within their newscasts, KCBS Channel 2, KNBC Channel 4 and KTLA  Channel 5 have recently lifted their longtime policy prohibiting such ads in  order to keep up economically with other local television stations.  </P> <P> The other four major Los Angeles stations have all been accepting political ads  during their newscasts for some time now, ignoring concerns that such ads might  be misconstrued by some viewers as news. Both KABC Channel 7 and KCOP Channel  13 have sold political time during news for more than two years. KTTV Channel  11 has accepted those ads during news since last February. A spokeswoman at  KCAL Channel 9 could only say that her station has been doing so for some time.  </P> <P> KCBS began accepting such ads in August "on a trial basis," a station  spokeswoman said, "in order to make more time available to the candidates."  </P> <P> Bill Emerson, KNBC's manager of broadcast standards, said that the station  decided just two weeks ago to sell time to candidates during newscasts because  the time available outside of news was severely limited and therefore the cost  for spots was higher. "This way we are able to give more access to political  candidates at cheaper rates," he said.  </P> <P> But the primary reason for the change in policy is economics. Many political  candidates prefer to buy time in newscasts because such programs are perceived  as credible and objective, and because news viewers are thought to be likely  voters. So a station that turns down such advertising is simply directing  revenue toward its rivals.  </P> <P> "You have to remain competitive," Emerson said.  </P> <P> KTLA spokesman Ed Harrison said that, until a week ago, the station had refused  paid political ads during news because it did not want to be perceived as  biased toward one side or the other. After KCBS and KNBC flip-flopped on this  issue, however, KTLA went along with the crowd.  </P> <P> When asked if the station changed the policy because it would lose ad revenue  if it adhered to its previous position, Harrison said, "Let's just say that you  have to remain competitive."  </P> <P> "It's clearly an economic issue," said Dan Gingold, assistant professor of  journalism at USC and a onetime executive producer of news at Channel 2.  "Business being what it is, with stations seeing their profits shrinking, they  have to get revenue wherever they can. When these candidates come in with cash  in hand, stations are willing to push the envelope and compromise a little."  </P> <P> Gingold contended that it is "dangerous" to mix the "unilateral assault" of  paid political ads with an objective, balanced newscast. He said, for example,  that if a station presents a political package on the governor's race, complete  with excerpts from interviews conducted with both Pete Wilson and Dianne  Feinstein, for example, and then an ad for Wilson pops up after the report that  denounces Feinstein, Wilson would appear to get in the last word.  </P> <P> Emerson said that station policy dictates that all political commercials during  KNBC's newscasts be sandwiched between other types of commercials so that the  paid political spot does not bump directly against the newscast.  </P> <P> KTTV tries to avoid this problem by accepting such ads only during the  feature-heavy last half-hour of its hourlong newscast.  </P> <P> Rick Feldman, KCOP's station manager, said that he believes viewers can tell  the difference between news and advertising.  </P> <P> "I have always thought that news is a natural environment for such ads," he  said. "I think it helps the political process. It's productive for people who  are interested in the campaign to see the unbiased news reports on the race and  then compare how the candidates are presenting themselves in their  commercials."  </P> <P> Feldman said that his station reviews each commercial on an individual basis  for inaccuracies or misrepresentations.  </P></p>

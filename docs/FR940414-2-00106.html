			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13. The mortality risk arises, in large part, from ITT Hartford's obligation: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) To make monthly annuity payments, regardless of how long an annuitant may live, and regardless of how long annuitants as a group may live; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) To pay the minimum death benefit under a Contract. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. The expense risk is that administrative fees assessed by ITT Hartford will fail to meet the actual expenses incurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. The Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge will not increase. If the charge is insufficient to cover actual costs, the loss will fall on ITT Hartford. Conversely, if the charge proves more than sufficient to meet actual experience, the excess will be a profit to ITT Hartford and will become part of its general account surplus. ITT Hartford expects to realize a profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conclusions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Applicants request an exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to the extent relief is necessary to permit the deduction of a mortality and expense risk charge from the assets of the Separate Account which serves as a funding medium for the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2), as herein pertinent, prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor thereof or underwriter therefor from selling periodic payment certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (other than sales load) are deposited with a qualified bank as trustee or custodian and held under arrangements which prohibit any payment to the depositor or principal underwriter except a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amounts as the Commission may prescribe, for performing bookkeeping and other administrative services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is reasonable in relation to the risks assumed by ITT Hartford under the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Applicants represent that the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable variable annuity contracts. This representation is based upon Hartford Life's survey of comparable contracts issued by a large number of other insurance companies. Hartford Life will undertake to maintain and make available to the Commission upon request a memorandum outlining the methodology underlying this representation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Applicants represent that it is likely that the proceeds from sales loads will be insufficient to cover the expected costs of distributing the contracts. Any shortfall will be covered from the assets of the general account, which may include profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. Therefore, ITT Hartford has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Separate Account's distribution financing arrangement will benefit the Separate Account and Contract owners, and that it will maintain and make available to the Commission, upon request, a memorandum setting forth the basis for this representation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Applicants represent that the Separate Account will invest only in open-end management companies which, if they should adopt any distribution financing plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 under the 1940 Act, will have a board of directors, a majority of whom are not interested persons of the open-end management company. Such board of directors must formulate and approve any such distribution plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Applicants assert that for the reasons set forth above, the requested exemptions from sections 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act to deduct a mortality and expense risk charge under the Contracts meet the standards in section 6(c) of the 1940 Act. The Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Cambodian guerrillas attack town UP TO 500 Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked the strategic town of Siem Reap in northern Cambodia yesterday, pushing civilians ahead of them as human shields, according to United Nations peacekeepers, Reuter reports. It was the biggest attack on a town since Cambodia's four warring factions signed a UN-sponsored peace pact in 1991 that the Khmer Rouge has since abandoned. The guerrillas attacked before dawn but one UN military observer said the assault was disorganised. The Khmer Rouge has threatened to use violence to disrupt elections scheduled for May 23-27.</p>

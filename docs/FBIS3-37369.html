"The government is patently weak: It  gives promises by the hour but does not realize that one can  only give promises when each promise is realistically  substantiated. The cabinet was reorganizing itself for a month,  while ever fresh corrections of the budget were taking place,"  Mr. Fedorov stated. He also noted that while the Finance  Ministry assessed real budget revenue at 80 to 90 trillion  rubles a month ago, today it assesses it at 130 trillion  although no new receipts have been registered. According to Mr.  Fedorov, this is yet another attempt at window dressing.  Correcting budget figures in this manner cannot result in  stabilizing finances and, in Mr. Fedorov's view, is only  applicable "in a bid to receive the next $1.5 billion from the  IMF and to prove that reforms in Russia are continuing." The  budget deficit, he declared, would amount under the present  draft budget to 100 trillion rather than 40-50 trillion as was  projected earlier, which would result in a collapse of the  financial system and an explosion of hyperinflation three or so  months after.    As a result of "the government's flailing around," Mr.  Fedorov believes, "the Pandora box has been opened: Production  workers are threatening strikes, and numerous lobbyists are  demanding money." However, he said, now many members of the  current cabinet (including both Mr. Soskovets and Mr. Grachev)  "are now ready to agree with me. Zaveryukha's greedy appetites  are too immense."    Boris Fedorov said that very soon the committee on budget,  taxes, and prices is going to organize Duma hearings on the  government's monetary policy, and he would like to hope that  "these hearings will be different than the hearings on economic  policy." Boris Fedorov, who last week was elected chairman of  the Duma subcommittee on control over the Central Bank's  activities, is obviously expecting Viktor Gerashchenko's report  with interest. "I am prepared to embrace Mr. Gerashchenko," he  declared, "I only still would like the Central Bank chairman to  submit for Duma consideration not simply a one-page report as  was the case in 1992, but to include in it a balance sheet of  the bank's financial activities."</p>

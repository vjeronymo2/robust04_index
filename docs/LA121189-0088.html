			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FREE ELECTION PROMISED IN BULGARIA;  </P> <P> EAST EUROPE: PARTY LEADER ANNOUNCES END TO COMMUNISTS' AUTOMATIC RIGHT TO RULE.  </P> <P> Bulgarian leader Petar Mladenov today promised free elections by June and an  end to the Communist Party's automatic right to rule.  </P> <P> "We propose that the National Assembly organize new, free democratic elections  by the end of May," Mladenov told a meeting of the party's decision-making  Central Committee.  </P> <P> He also said the party's guaranteed leading role in society is being scrapped.  "The leading role of the party cannot be declared administratively but must  come from the trust of the people."  </P> <P> A Communist Party spokesman told a news conference that the party is proposing  to the National Assembly that the article of the constitution guaranteeing the  party's monopoly on power should be scrapped and a new constitution drawn up by  the end of 1990.  </P> <P> Mladenov's announcement at a session of the party's leadership followed similar  moves by the East German and Czechoslovak parties to surrender their absolute  grip on power.  </P> <P> It followed a four-week whirlwind of political change in this Balkan country of  9 million, culminating in a pro-democracy rally Sunday in Sofia that drew tens  of thousands of people to the streets.  </P> <P> Mladenov, a former foreign minister who took over from veteran hard-liner Todor  Zhivkov last month, also proposed a dialogue "with all powers of society that  work on the basis of socialism and patriotism."  </P> <P> But it was not immediately clear whether this dialogue would involve opposition  groups that have demanded round-table talks on the future of the country.  </P> <P> Mladenov, whose speech to the policy-making Central Committee was carried by  Bulgarian radio, said the party will also hold an extraordinary congress of  grass-roots party members next March. This seemed likely to vote in a more  reformist Central Committee.  </P> <P> Mladenov also proposed that the Parliament on Thursday vote to set up a  commission to investigate allegations of corruption during the 35-year rule of  the now disgraced Zhivkov.  </P> <P> While the party Central Committee met to hear Mladenov, a Sofia court  registered Eco-Glasnost, an ecological group, as Bulgaria's first independent  organization.  </P> <P> Early elections in Bulgaria, which up until a few weeks ago was a fortress of  Stalinism, are likely to favor the Communists; the growing number of  still-unregistered political, religious and ecological groups were banned until  recently and have had little time to establish themselves.  </P> <P> As the Central Committee plenary meeting continued in closed session, about  12,000 Bulgarians massed in freezing darkness near party headquarters to hold a  silent candlelight vigil in support of opposition demands for further political  change.  </P></p>

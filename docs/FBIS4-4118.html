			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RENMIN RIBAO 26 April editorial: "Make Conscientious </F> Efforts To Improve Efficiency -- on Intensively Launching  `China's Deep-Going March Toward Economic Efficiency'"]    [Text] Beijing, 25 Apr (XINHUA) -- "China's Deep-Going  March Toward Economic Efficiency" -- an activity launched by  some theoretical, propaganda, and operational departments under  the leadership and with the support of the central authorities  -- has been going on for a year. Although it has attracted  widespread attention, it has yet to command adequate notice.  This editorial, which is being issued specifically to help  launch this massive activity of investigation, study, and  propaganda in a more vivid and thorough manner, briefly states  some of our viewpoints for the purpose of discussion with our  readers.    As early as some 10 years ago, our country proposed the  principle of "taking the improvement of economic efficiency as  the central task" with regard to economic work. We can say that  we have achieved considerable results in this regard, having  enjoyed sustained national economic development for many years  in a row. Enterprises are the basic units that create wealth in  modern society. It is none other than the improvement of  overall efficiency in enterprises that has helped our country  gain and rapidly accumulate massive social wealth. This fact is  obvious and palpable to everybody. Take as an example  state-owned enterprises which constitute the most-discussed  topic. We cannot simply characterize them with the phrase "poor  economic efficiency." It would not be objective and fair if we  did not adequately affirm the tremendous contributions made by  state-owned enterprises, large and medium ones in particular, by  overlooking their pivotal role in stabilizing and promoting the  overall situation, their status as the main source of the  country's financial revenue, and the many additional social  functions they perform.    Nevertheless, we must note that the economic efficiency of  our country's enterprises, especially state-owned enterprises,  is still not very ideal. Their input-output ratios remain low  in many aspects, with some showing a downward trend. Some of  them have failed to attain record levels in terms of the ratio  between investment and productive capacity resulting from such  investment, the profit rate on capital, labor productivity, and  the index of efficiency in materials consumption. The total  amount of losses in state-owned enterprises has increased.  Efficiency has become a prominent issue that determines whether  our country's economy can develop in a sustained, rapid, and  healthy manner.    In evaluating the general efficiency of our country's  economy  and enterprises, we must, therefore, conduct an extensive,  objective, and concrete analysis against the backdrop of reform  and development to avoid generalizing our conclusion. This is  the first viewpoint we want to state.    Perhaps people will ask: Why are our results consistently  not ideal despite many years of calling for and working toward  better economic efficiency? This question is not easy to answer  because the factors affecting our efforts to improve efficiency  are very complicated and cover a wide range of areas. Perhaps  the answer lies here: Economic efficiency is difficult to  improve because it is the result, as well as the general  reflection, of many facets of the way the national economy  functions.    As our country's economy is making the transition from  planning to a socialist market economy, this structural change  has basically hampered economic efficiency. For example, the  old investment structure shows considerable resistance to  change, the "credit-inflated" development model has not been  changed completely, and investors do not assume corresponding  responsibility for economic efficiency. Consequently, the  chronic disease of "investment starvation" is still hard to cure  while the stubborn ailment of duplicating construction projects  and feverishly launching new ones strikes frequently. This has  predestined a sizable number of enterprises to incur losses even  before they were formally established. Also, the experiment to  establish a modern enterprise system has just started, and  state-owned enterprises have yet to change their operating  mechanisms effectively. Consequently, it is still difficult  basically to halt the phenomena of "assuming responsibility for  profits only but not for losses," of losing state-owned assets,  and of shifting the economic efficiency of enterprises in other  directions.    Our country's economic structure also has hampered economic  efficiency. Slow growth in peasants' incomes has inevitably  affected the development of rural markets, curbed the sale of  industrial goods, and left many of the products needed by  peasants stranded in enterprises' warehouses. Naturally, it  would be difficult to improve enterprises' efficiency.  "Bottleneck" sectors such as communications and transportation  also have prevented enterprises from bringing in raw materials  and shipping their products to other places, thus affecting  their economic efficiency.    Enterprises' "internal functions" have directly hampered  their efficiency. Even if enterprises have changed their  operating mechanisms and are capable of "operating independently  and assuming sole responsibility for their own profits and  losses," there are still the questions of how to "operate  independently" and whether to "assume responsibility for profits  or losses." Whether enterprises can ultimately improve their  economic efficiency depends on how they reform themselves  internally, how they upgrade their technological levels, how  they manage themselves, and how they perform in terms of  quality, operations, and marketing. The truth that we emphasize  about enterprises improving their "internal functions" is  readily apparent if we look at the disparity between different  enterprises operating under more or less similar conditions, and  if we analyze the "good" and "bad" fortunes of a given  enterprise during different periods.    After analyzing the many factors that hamper economic  efficiency, we understand that improving economic efficiency is  a pressing task of the moment, as well as a long-term strategic  task. We should vigorously carry it out over the long term by  improving the macroeconomic environment while enlisting the  efforts of individual enterprises. This task is the economic  objective of our reform and development, as well as an important  lever with which to advance reform and development. This is the  second viewpoint we want to make.    How should we improve economic efficiency? General Secretary  Jiang Zemin has called for "hatching new ideas for development."  New ideas are also needed for improving economic efficiency. We  should explore new ways while maintaining the original effective  methods. It can be said that the 14th National CPC Congress and  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee have  basically provided such new ideas, the former by setting the  goal of building a socialist market economy and the latter by  adopting a corresponding "decision."    A fundamental way to improve enterprises' efficiency is to  bring enterprises onto the market and turn them into the main  competitors there. This will allow the fittest to survive, let  new enterprises emerge from among the old, and ensure continuous  progress. People have raised the issue of how to organically  combine the efforts to "invigorate state-owned assets" and  "improve state-owned enterprises" on the basis of none other  than the theory regarding market mechanisms playing their  fundamental role in allocating resources. The course of action  taken by the Beijing No. 1 Light Industrial Group, whose story  appeared in this newspaper, is a case in point. People seem to  have suddenly found the key to unlock the door of economic  efficiency. We should continue to explore on the basis of this  idea.    The practice in 1993 has given people a newer, deeper, and  more correct understanding of macroeconomic regulation and  control. As a matter of fact, the market economy requires a  closer integration of microeconomics and macroeconomics.  Microeconomics is the foundation of macroeconomics, whereas  macroeconomics serves as the environment for microeconomic  activities. A great many enterprises have long understood quite  well that this is the inherent meaning of market economics.  Accordingly, they have always given consideration to both  macroeconomics and microeconomics in their quest for economic  efficiency. They not only study current market conditions but  also forecast future trends. Rather than interpreting the  state's macroeconomic regulation and control as an adverse  restrictive factor, they take it as an important guide to their  actions. Consequently, they are likely to achieve fairly good  and steady economic efficiency while constantly coordinating the  relations between microeconomics and macroeconomics. The Handan  Iron and Steel Works, whose story appeared in the news media, is  a case in point.    To improve economic efficiency, we should make "investments  in both tangible and intangible aspects." Some enterprises have  taken the lead in correcting their past mistake of paying  attention to "tangible aspects" to the neglect of "intangible  aspects." And they have achieved considerable economic  efficiency. Besides input in science and technology and better  management -- something frequently stressed in the past -- the  so-called "investment in intangible aspects" should also include  the exercise of intellectual property rights and the study and  implementation of enterprise strategies for development,  products, operations, and marketing. The experience of some  foreign enterprises in applying the law of the market economy,  as well as regular operational strategy, is also worth emulating.    It can be said that many ways and means for achieving  economic efficiency in accordance with the law of the market  economy are there for us to uncover, study, explore, and apply.  This is the third point that we want to make.    Economic efficiency is a matter of paramount importance, as  well as a very complicated issue. Nevertheless, we can improve  economic efficiency in a step-by-step manner so long as we grasp  the essentials. In carrying out "China's Deep-Going March  Toward Economic Efficiency," we must henceforth conduct more  thorough activities of investigation, study, and propaganda. We  should raise issues as well as analyze causes. More important,  we should sum up and publicize some new ideas and good methods  for solving problems.    We believe that China's economy during the 21st century is  bound to be a dynamic one that is structurally sound, rapidly  expanding, and fairly efficient.    Let us work together toward achieving this goal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] There have been some political upheavals in Burkina  Faso. The country's leader, Captain Blaise Compaore, has  dissolved the government and the prime minister, Youssouf  Ouedraogo, has resigned. The prime minister has been on the job  since June 1992, but it seems he might have been giving jobs to  people that ruling party militants did not approve of. On the  line to Ouagadougou, Dan Isaacs asked our correspondent, Pierre  Kazoni, if any reasons have been given for the prime minister's  resignation:    [Begin recording] [Kazoni] Well, no official reasons have  been given, but according to the general public it is said that  the pressure put on him to resign came from the militants of the  majority party, the ODP-MT [Organization for Popular  Democracy-Labor Movement], which is also President Compaore's  party. He is also accused of not being [word indistinct] with  conviction, and that he does not appoint the militants of the  ODP to top positions. Well, these are the unofficial reasons,  according to the people here, that have motivated his  resignation.    [Isaacs] So is it simply that the prime minister has been  appointing ministers who are not from the majority party, the  ODP- MT, he has been giving posts to other people?    [Kazoni] Yes. I think the ODP-MT, which is the majority  party, they want everything for themselves. It was said clearly  during the National Assembly, in the National Assembly's session  here that the majority in the government should rule and those  who are not in the government should oppose. This was said  clearly by a member of parliament who is a militant of the  ODP-MT. But this is not the vision that Youssouf Ouedraogo has.  He is a technocrat and he believes in the right man on the  right job.    [Isaacs] From what you are saying the prime minister, Mr.  Ouedraogo, sounds less like a technocrat and more like somebody  who really is his own man and wanted good men in good positions.  Was he a popular prime minister?    [Kazoni] You may say that he was popular in a sense, in a  sense that he achieved something during his during his term of  office, and the World Bank and the IMF have openly declared  their satisfaction with the way Mr. Ouedraogo handles the SAP,  the Structural Adjustment Program.    [Isaacs] So will the new government, when it has been  announced, be totally dominated by dominated by the majority  party, the ODP-MT? Is that what we can look forward to now?    [Kazoni] Very much, because since it is the outcry of the  majority. I think Compaore may probably listen to them. But it  does not really rule out completely that Compaore will put in  somebody who is not probably a member of the majority party.  This is possible. We can always expect something like that.

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EXPERIMENT'S WATER PURITY TESTS OUT;  </P> <P> HYACINTHS PLUS TREATMENT KILL UP TO 99% OF VIRUSES AT PLANT  </P> <P> Initial results of a study suggest that recycled waste water produced by the  city of San Diego's unique experimental waste-water treatment plant in Mission  Valley contains the same low level of microorganisms as untreated drinking  water stored in nearby reservoirs.  </P> <P> Scientists from the Berkeley-based Western Consortium for Public Health have  determined that the first two treatment steps at the plant, which uses water  hyacinths to eliminate pollutants, removes 90% to 99% of viruses from waste  water, or as much as standard biological treatment methods.  </P> <P> Remaining microorganisms are removed by additional -- but more traditional --  treatment steps, according to the report that was released Tuesday in Austin,  Tex., during the American Society of Civil Engineers' annual Environmental  Engineering Meeting.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Water Quality Important  </P> <P> The quality of reclaimed waste water is of growing importance in San Diego  because of a recent City Council proposal that calls for the use of 120-million  gallons daily of reclaimed waste water for irrigation.  </P> <P> That proposal calls for the city to build six water reclamation plants to  provide treated water for use in areas such as Otay Mesa, the Interstate 15  corridor and North City. However, those proposed treatment plants would use  proven treatment methods rather than the experimental methods being used at the  Mission Valley plant.  </P> <P> Although the initial findings are promising, scientists associated with the  program cautioned that the study is far from complete.  </P> <P> "There are about six different phases of this study, and only one part of the  microbiology (section) has been completed," according to Richard Danielson, a  microbiologist with the consortium.  </P> <P> The consortium's scientific staff will continue to monitor the plant's ability  to eliminate chemical pollutants and toxic wastes including metals, organic  solvents and pesticides. The consortium will also monitor the reliability of  the Mission Valley plant as well as the probable reliability of a much larger  water reclamation plant that has been proposed in the San Pasquale Valley.  </P> <P> When research is completed in 1990, scientists will spend a year preparing a  final report for the city. The city would use the final report to determine if  the expected benefits of recycling waste water into potable water outweigh the  risks.  </P> <P> Danielson said the $2.5-million study wasn't designed to determine if San Diego  should be turning waste water into drinking water. "We're strictly involved in  a data-collection and analysis kind of thing," Danielson said. "We're here to  provide . . . technical information." Whether San Diego uses the plant for  potable water or not is up to it, Danielson said.  </P> <P> The Mission Valley plant provides secondary treatment for 300,000 gallons of  waste water a day. About 50,000 gallons receive advanced water treatment and  are used to irrigate state-owned lands bordering nearby highways.  </P> <P> The proposed aquaculture plant in the San Pasquale Valley would treat about a  million gallons of waste water a day. Half of that water would receive advanced  treatment. The treated water would be used by industry to irrigate land or  would be reinjected into natural aquifers underneath the Earth's surface,  according to Ken Thompson, the city's project manager for aquaculture  facilities.  </P></p>

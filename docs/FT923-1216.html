			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Ecuador halted by general strike A NATIONAL general strike yesterday brought Ecuador's economy to a standstill, closed schools and led to violent street demonstrations, after nearly three weeks of protests against the new government's economic austerity measures. The one-day strike, called by the United Workers' Front (FUT) to protest against big price rises for basic goods and services, is the latest in a series of obstacles to the economic reforms of the six-week-old administration of President Sixto Duran Ballen. Cities throughout Ecuador have experienced unrest as the protests rose. In Guayaquil, the main port and the largest city, demonstrators looted shops, burnt buses and battled police in the streets. In the capital, Quito, workers rioted in front of the presidential palace as their leaders were refused access to officials. The government's attempt to shrink the public sector has also run into resistance. State-employed doctors and nurses last week closed hospital doors in protest at the government's reforms, paralysing medical services in cities and leaving hundreds of patients on the streets. On Monday, the judicial system was halted as court employees closed tribunals in response to government initiatives on curbing corruption and inefficiency. The government lacks political support for its economic reforms. The National Assembly, where it has no majority, rejected the bill to require civil servants to retire at the age of 65. It also refused the proposal for a salary bonus intended to compensate workers for recent price rises. Responding to the protests, Mr Duran on Friday announced that the price of bottled gas, used in most Ecuadorean households, would be reduced by 20 per cent. Mr Fabian Zurita, FUT director, rejected the reduction as a political manoeuvre.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Liquefied Gas There can be little doubt that the MMC inquiry has helped British Gas focus its attention on where growth opportunities lie. Since its UK business is a mature one in a heavily regulated market, there is a case for diversification into the expanding markets of the developing world. These may carry higher risk, but they also offer higher returns. In the context of diversification, it makes little sense to hold on to Consumers Gas of Canada which is also a mature business in a heavily regulated market. There is also the disadvantage that by limiting the UK company's stake to 85 per cent, the Canadian authorities ensured that Consumers' cash flow could not be freely redeployed to any other part of the group. That said, by selling Consumers, British Gas has made a quantum leap away from critical mass in the global gas business. In sterling terms, Gas claims to have earned an internal return of some 16 per cent from its investment in the Canadian company. Though the figure is boosted by exchange rate gains and perhaps also by a relatively attractive disposal price, the test will be to see how easily Gas can invest the proceeds at a higher return. Gas argues that there is no shortage of opportunities, but that only makes it more important to pick the right ones. Its gearing is on an upward path: using the company's preferred measure of debt as a percentage of total assets the figure reached 31 per cent in September. So it can even less afford to make a mistake. Until the MMC came along, it could claim a particular strength in its expertise from production to domestic supply. Breaking up the UK business may harm its global ambitions.</p>

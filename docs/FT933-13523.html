			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Survey of Corporate Finance (2): Bottom-fishing for bargains  -Europe THE market for merger and acquisitions may be quiet in London, but according to some of the biggest corporate finance houses in the UK, European cross-border activity has been picking up over the past six months. Mr Steve Mullins, managing editor of Mergers &amp; Acquisitions International, believes the past six months have confirmed a trend of the past year: 'The days of big takeover deals are now over. And it is questionable whether they will return. But cross-border joint ventures, alliances and mergers are back.' The spotlight over the past few years has shifted to the Continent. Goldman Sachs, which cornered the market in defending targeted companies, says that in 1992 around two-thirds of the European bids were based on the Continent, with a third in the UK. In 1987, the reverse was true. Some of the biggest banks based in London, such as J Henry Schroder Wagg and Morgan Grenfell, now devote a far bigger share of their resources and staff to work on Continental deals. Lazard Houses, involved in the merger between Kingfisher in the UK and Darty of France earlier in the year, attributes the growth in cross-border activity to the fact that European companies are too small to consolidate in their own country. Mr Ali Wambold, head of Lazard Brothers international work and a partner of Lazard Freres in New York, says: 'Most European companies are now too small for much consolidation within their own backyard. They can either grow through organic growth or through diversification. Since the latter is out of fashion more companies are seeking to expand through cross-border merger or acquisitions.' Mr David Challen, head of corporate finance at Schroders, says European cross-border mergers and acquisitions account for half of all of the investment banks' public activities - a very different picture from five years ago. 'We decided to develop a serious capability in Europe which has coincided with far more of this activity. US businesses also increasingly believe that they need to be established within this growing market.' Mr Derek Higgs, managing director of SG Warburg, expects a continuing amount of special cross-border activity. 'Most of the business will be sorting out things that need sorting.' A typical example is the decision of the South African Rupert family, through their Zurich-based vehicle Richemont, to reshuffle their assets into two defined vehicles. A new company, Vendome, was established to take care of the Carter and Dunhill operations while the tobacco interests of Alfred Dunhill were brought under the roof of a smaller Rothmans International. Mr Guy Dawson, head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell, is confident that the rise of cross-border business should pick up as the year goes on. 'As the recession really bites, businesses are going to have to come to terms with the fact that they must rationalise. The conditions of activity are there even if they are not always being turned into transactions.' Mr David Jarvis, co-head of European Investment banking at Salomon Brothers, is encouraged by the increase in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. Yet the pick-up in activity appears to be at odds with what is happening on the Continent, with many countries going deeper into recession. However, some advisers believe the recession on the Continent offers opportunities as well as problems. Mr Wambold says that two years ago most German companies were not for sale and even those that were, were 'scooped out under our nose' by another German company. The recession, in Germany's case the first since the second world war, has driven companies in need of capital to contemplate mergers or acquisitions for the first time. Those sentiments are echoed by Mr Challen. 'Recession in continental Europe creates opportunities. Some companies may find there is no option but to do something.' He has not yet experienced a significant increase in activity from privately-owned German companies, but believes the recession might be the factor that forces some of them into contemplating the sale of their business. However, as yet they are not showing any signs of going on a purchasing spree. Mr Wambold still sees the US as the best bet for such activity. 'Many companies having beaten back the alligators over the past three years and are now looking to expand themselves.' While much of that expansion is still happening in the US, which is big enough to accommodate much of the consolidation that many European companies cannot complete in their own country, Mr Wambold believes US companies will increasingly see the opportunities that exist in Europe. Nonetheless, a problem that still exists for prospective buyers is the expense of the possible targets. The stock markets and multiples remain high. Mainly for this reason Mr Erik Linnes, director at Kleinwort Benson, warns against over-optimism in the cross-border market. While the Continent is in recession many buyers are going to sit on their feet. 'It's still a brave time for any public company to put its head above the parapet and make an acquisition.' However, Mr Linnes says some buyers are 'bottom fishing for bargains'. He attributes the busier cross-border activity to the fact that a number of companies have decided to 'swim against the tide'. Those companies which are sellers also know that it is not the best time to dispose of their business and will be waiting for signs of an upturn in the economy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                TOP ADVISERS ON COMPLETED EUROPEAN DEALS*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Adviser                         Value      Rank    Mkt share     No of                           (Dollars m)                  (%)       deals  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lazard Houses               2,310.3         1        19.2         10 Credit Lyonnais             1,506.3         2        12.5          1 SG Warburg Group          1,069.1         3         8.9          7 Morgan Grenfell               715.2         4         5.9         10 UBS Phillips &amp; Drew/UBS       629.1         5         5.2          1 Pierson, Heldring &amp; Pierson   612.3         6         5.1          2 Swiss Bank                    534.1         7         4.4          1 Lehman Bros                   482.2         8         4.0          5 Kleinwort, Benson             455.8         9         3.8          5 Wertheim/Schroder Group       401.1        10         3.3          8 Societe de Banque Occidentale 390.0        11         3.2          1 Goldman, Sachs                362.0        12         3.0          6 BZW/Barclays                  231.7        13         1.9          4 Wasserstein, Perella          207.9        14         1.7          1 Citicorp                      154.0        15         1.3          1 Industry totals            12,021.0                 100.0        698  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Between January 1 and March 31, 1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Securities Data Co  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                 TOP ADVISERS ON COMPLETED GLOBAL DEALS*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Adviser                            Value     Rank    Mkt share    No of                                 (Dollars m)             (%)       deals  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Goldman, Sachs                   11,127.4      1       22.9         25 Morgan Stanley                    9,566.8      2       19.7         16 Lehman Bros                       5,467.4      3       11.3         25 Merrill Lynch                     4,339.2      4        8.9         17 Dillon, Read                      4,237.0      5        8.7          4 First Boston/CSFB/CS              4,059.8      6        8.4         16 Lazard Houses                     3,029.8      7        6.2         18 Salomon Brothers                  1,627.4      8        3.4         20 Bankers Trust                     1,579.5      9        3.3          5 Wertheim/Schroder Group           1,537.3     10        3.2         17 Credit Lyonnais                   1,506.3     11        3.1          1 Wasserstein, Perella              1,446.6     12        3.0          8 Morgan Grenfell                   1,371.5     13        2.8         15 SG Warburg Group                1,334.7     14        2.7         11 Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette      1,286.4     15        2.6          7 Industry totals                  48,561.1             100.0      1,765  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Between January 1 and March 31, 1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Securities Data Co  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

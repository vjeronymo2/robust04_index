			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COURT REFUSES TO REINSTATE HIALEAH LICENSE  </P> <P> A state appeals court today refused to reinstate Hialeah Park's pari-mutuel  license, which was suspended after the track changed its racing schedule  without permission.  </P> <P> The 1st District Court of Appeal declined to lift the suspension ordered by the  Department of Business Regulation. That means the track will be closed until at  least Jan. 3, when a full state hearing is scheduled.  </P> <P> "They are shut down," said Pete Butler, spokesman for DBR. "If they open up,  it's a criminal misdemeanor."  </P> <P> Last week, the financially troubled South Florida thoroughbred track announced  it would operate three days a week rather than the six days a week required  under its license.  </P> <P> The change was an attempt to alleviate losses averaging $68,000 a day since the  track began its season Nov. 18.  </P> <P> Butler said the DBR's Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering requires tracks to  adhere to the schedules they set at the beginning of the year. If tracks were  allowed to change at will, the result would be regulatory chaos, he said.  </P> <P> A state administrative officer in Miami will consider whether Hialeah can make  the change after the January hearing, Butler said.  </P></p>

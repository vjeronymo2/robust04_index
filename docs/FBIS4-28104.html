			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japanese direct investment  overseas rose for the first time in four years in fiscal 1993  ended in March, climbing 5.5 percent to 36,025 million dollars,  the Finance Ministry said Friday [3 June].    Such investment was encouraged by the appreciation of the  yen  against foreign currencies, higher costs of manpower in Japan  and the growth potential of other countries, a ministry official  said.    The figure was the fifth largest annual total on record.  Direct overseas investment hit a record in fiscal 1989 but has  since been declining, totaling 34,138 million dollars in fiscal  1992.    Japanese manufacturers invested strongly in the Asian  region,  with investment rising 17.9 percent to 3,659 million dollars.    Machinery makers stepped up investment in Asia by 103.8  percent to 434 million dollars, while food manufacturers raised  theirs by 95.8 percent to 139 million dollars.    Other manufacturing sectors also boosted investment, with  63.7 percent growth reported by the electric machinery industry  and a 55.6 percent increase by the transportation industry.    China and Hong Kong were the most popular regions for direct  investment, with growth of 58.0 percent in total investment in  China and a 68.4 percent increase in Hong Kong.    In contrast, direct investment in North America by Japanese  manufacturers fell by 0.7 percent while Europe saw a 2.9 percent  decline.    Investment by Japanese nonmanufacturers, however, grew by  20.4 percent in Europe and by 6.3 percent in North America.    Although large investments were seen by electric appliance  companies in North America, and by chemical firms in Europe, the  ministry official said that "large-scale investment in these  areas has basically peaked out."    Foreign direct investment in Japan fell 24.6 percent to  3,078  million dollars.    Investment in the manufacturing sector dropped 2.8 percent,  while falling a sharp 38.8 percent in the nonmanufacturing  sector.    In the nonmanufacturing sector, investment in service  businesses declined by 74.8 percent, and by 77.2 percent in the  financial and insurance industries.    Japan's economic slump and high investment costs discouraged  foreign investors, the official said.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Royal Bank tumbles to Pounds 72.4m halfway THE ROYAL Bank of Scotland suffered a 58 per cent fall in taxable profits in the first half of its financial year after more than doubling provisions for bad debts. Mr George Younger, the former Tory minister who recently took over as chairman of the Edinburgh-based group, said yesterday that recession in the UK and the US, coupled with the Gulf war, had had 'a severe adverse impact on our performance'. Tough conditions had forced up the number of bad loans. Meanwhile new income was proving difficult to generate, and inflation was pushing up costs. However, Mr Younger stressed that the group remained strongly capitalised, and that it was well placed to benefit from any recovery, of which there were at the moment only distant glimmerings. The Royal Bank made Pounds 72.4m before tax in the six months to March 31, down from Pounds 173.6m the year before. This was after provisions of Pounds 126.8m for bad debts. Most parts of the group were affected. The clearing bank's contribution was cut to Pounds 76m (Pounds 149.8m). This included a poor result from RoyScot, the finance company which is now incorporated in the bank following a recent reorganisation. Charterhouse, the merchant banking arm, made Pounds 11.2m (Pounds 21.1m) after provisions against deteriorating loans and investments. Direct Line, the insurance company, raised profits to Pounds 3.7m (Pounds 3.5m) as it continued to increase its share of the market. In the US, Citizens Financial, the group's banking subsidiary, saw profits fall to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 11.8m) because of the severe downturn in the New England banking market, and one-off acquisition costs. The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.8p, payable from earnings per share of 6.1p (14.1p). The balance sheet expanded by 9 per cent to Pounds 32.2bn, and the risk:asset ratio declined to 11.1 (11.6) per cent at September 30 1990, though this was comfortably above the 8 per cent minimum. The cost:income ratio deteriorated from 60.7 to 64.9 per cent, both because of weaker income and rising costs. Mr Charles Winter, chief executive, said that cost containment remained a high priority. He described current banking conditions as among the worst in recent history, with little prospect of early recovery.</p>

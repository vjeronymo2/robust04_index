			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Following the [Arab Maghreb Union] summit [in  Tunis], Mr. Liamine Zeroual had a number of activities including  meeting with the Algerian community in Tunisia, whom he  addressed and called upon to work and contribute to removing  Algeria from its plight. He stressed that the state is looking  with every possible care at its communities abroad.    [Begin Zeroual recording] In the Name of God the Merciful  and  Most Compassionate.    Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me pleasure to thank you for  the good expressions of welcome which you addressed to me.  [passage omitted]    The Algerian communities abroad will be the subject of  special in all our decisions for the service of our country and  people.    More than at any time in the past, Algeria today needs all  its children to contribute to correcting the current situation,  promoting its development, and strengthening its true position  among the nations to enable every citizen inside or outside our  borders to show the sense of honor which characterizes the  Algerian people.    As you know, our country currently exists in a difficult  condition characterized by the phenomena of violence and  terrorism which are alien to our values and traditions. It also  lives in a critical economic crisis.    You all know these problems and the ways and means defined  by  the Algerian people to overcome them. These ways and means  stemmed from the national conference which was held in January.  I am committed to making things concrete in order to emphasize  the unity of the Algerian people, ensure civil peace and calm,  and to provide the conditions for the free choice by the nation  within the framework of sovereignty and stability. This  endeavor will also encompass all the necessary actions aimed at  consolidating and activating the national economy. [end  recording]    The head of state's address also touched on the course  Algeria is following, on democracy, and the transitional period  and on far-reaching reforms which would satisfy the citizen's  needs and open the door for creative initiatives. In short, he  talked before everyone on the need for a break with the past.    [Begin Zeroual recording] It is a break which calls for  eliminating the spirit of monopoly in the different spheres.  The democracy which the transitional period would strengthen  would open the field for individual and collective freedoms.  The far-reaching reforms of our national economy would not only  satisfy the needs of the citizen, but would also open the field  for creative initiatives. These are the new goals which would be  confirmed before our expatriate community and before the whole  of our Algerian people to enable everyone of us to offer his  contributions to invigorate the national development effort in  all spheres.

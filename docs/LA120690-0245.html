			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITISH RECESSION STIRS CONCERN  </P> <P> Britain's recession is starting to alarm economists, who fear the  government-induced slowdown to quash inflation may become one of the worst  slumps in decades.  </P> <P> "We see a deep and prolonged recession.  </P> <P> In terms of cumulative gross domestic product loss, it could be the  second-worst recession since the Second World War," said Peter Spencer, an  economist at Shearson Lehman Brothers.  </P> <P> Economists are increasingly questioning the government's claim that the  recession will be modest. Recent economic indicators and business surveys all  show economic activity at its lowest level since the 1980-81 recession,  Britain's worst slump in 40 years.  </P> <P> Surveys show the need to repay large personal and business debts built up  during the 1980s, and slower growth among some of Britain's key trading  partners points to a long slump.  </P></p>

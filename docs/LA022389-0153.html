			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> A COURT, NOT A JAIL PLANNED  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors formally reassured Monterey Park on Tuesday that the  county plans to build a $45-million Children's Court in that city, not a new  jail.  </P> <P> The city's redevelopment agency tentatively agreed Feb. 10 to sell four acres  to the county for $3.5 million for construction of the court. But some  officials expressed concern that the site might be used for a jail because it  is next to the county's women's jail, the Sybil Brand Institute, supervisors  said.  </P> <P> The supervisors directed that a letter be written to Monterey Park, affirming  the county's intentions.  </P></p>

Total annual costs for each of the three main parts of the asbestos standard are as follows (excluding EPA-related training costs):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;General Industry_$14.8 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Construction_$346.5 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Shipyards_$93 thousand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Summing compliance costs across affected sectors, OSHA estimates that annual incremental compliance costs of $361.4 million will result following promulgation of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The next section applies these estimates of incremental compliance costs for an analysis of the economic impacts of the revised asbestos standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Economic Impact and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Introduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA examined the impacts of compliance costs on payroll, sales and profits for firms in general industry, shipyards and construction affected by the revision to the asbestos standard. OSHA's economic impact analysis is presented below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Data Sources and Methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA used a variety of financial indicators and sources of statistical data to assess the impacts on the affected industries. Payroll data for primary manufacturing industries and real estate industries were taken from  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> County Business Patterns,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1990 [Dept. of Commerce, 1993]. Payroll data for construction industries were taken from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1987 Census of Construction,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> [Dept. of Commerce, 1990b]. Data on sales were obtained from Dun and Bradstreet's Marketing Information computer database [Dun and Bradstreet, 1992a] for the following industry groups:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Primary asbestos manufacturing;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Automotive repair;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Shipyards;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Selected groups in general industry where the disturbance of asbestos during routine maintenance falls under the construction standard; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selected real estate industries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Data on net value of construction work (a statistic approximating the sales volume of construction firms) for the construction sector were taken from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1987 Census of Construction  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> [Dept. of Commerce, 1990b]. OSHA derived pre-tax profit rates using Dun and Bradstreet post-tax return-on-sales data from Dun's Insight computer database [Dun and Bradstreet, 1992b] and the 1987 tax code. Pre-tax profits were calculated using a formula that contains the marginal corporate tax rates for 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Impacts in General Industry and Shipyards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Primary manufacturing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has determined that the following four industries in primary manufacturing would be affected by the revision to the asbestos standard: SIC 3292, Friction Materials; SIC 3053, Gaskets and Packings; SIC 2952, Coatings and Sealants; and SIC 3089, Plastics. OSHA has concluded that there will be no incremental costs for the secondary manufacturing industries identified in the preliminary regulatory impact analysis because these manufacturers are believed to have already achieved exposure reductions that bring them into compliance with OSHA's new PEL of 0.1 f/cc.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA compared the incremental compliance costs anticipated for the four affected primary manufacturing industries with three financial indicators: (1) Annual payroll per firm, (2) dollar value of sales per firm and (3) pre-tax profits per firm. The comparison with annual payroll conveys the magnitude of compliance costs relative to labor costs. The comparison with sales provides a measure of the extent to which prices would rise to maintain profit levels if a firm is able to pass 100 percent of incremental costs forward to buyers. If firms, for competitive reasons, are unable to pass costs forward and must instead absorb the full impact internally, pre-tax profits would be expected to fall. The comparison with pre-tax profits thus illustrates the maximum financial impact if the firm absorbs 100 percent of the incremental compliance costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table 11 presents the estimated impact of compliance costs in relation to annual payroll, sales, and pre-tax profits per plant in primary manufacturing. Compliance costs as a percentage of sales are modest, averaging 0.6 percent for affected establishments in primary manufacturing (Column 7). However, as shown in Column 8 in the table, profit impacts are relatively high for two sectors: friction materials (26.2 percent) and gaskets and packings (7.3 percent). For reasons given below, OSHA believes that profit impacts will be minimized by the ability of firms to pass forward costs to consumers. The small increases in product prices (less than 2 percent) necessary to cover the increased costs of production would be unlikely to affect the demand for these products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

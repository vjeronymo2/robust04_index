			<p>BFN     [Text] Changchun, June 16 (XINHUA) -- Northeastern China's  Changbai Mountains Nature Reserve, unique in its forest  ecosystem and biological variation, is attracting increasing  numbers of world ecologists.    It is becoming a sought-after place for international  cooperation in research on forest ecosystems.    Set up in 1960, this nature reserve covers more than 190,000  ha. It joined the network of international biosphere protection  areas in 1980.    Specialists point out that the same kind of forests had once  existed in North America and Europe, but they have vanished  because of human felling or through glacier movements. That  leaves Changbai as an important genes store for temperate zone  animal species and plant varieties.    It has been calculated that there are 2,500 kinds of plants,  500 kinds of vertebrates and nearly a thousand kinds of  invertebrates in the area.    The Chinese Academy of Sciences has set up Changbai  Mountains  Research Station of Forest Ecosystems there.    According to a deputy director of the station, with China's  wider opening to the world, ecological research has also ended  its seclusion.    Since the research station first invited two ecology  advisers  from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural  Organization (UNESCO) to inspect the station in 1979, more than  100 overseas experts have been there to cooperate with Chinese  research staff in their studies.    It has finished a cooperative research program with Germany,  and another program with Britain, studying the application of  forest nitrogen, is going on.    It is also involved in joint studies of volcanic history  with  the Swiss Academy of Science, and the research of volcanic  activity and changes of vegetation with Japan.    The participation of noted world experts and scholars has  helped the research there to move further and faster.</p>

"In 1993 Sino-Japanese trade reached a new historic level,"  Wu Jianmin said at his weekly news briefing. "Bilateral  cooperation in all areas has been growing constantly and  steadily, especially in the economic and trade fields where  bilateral ties are maintaining strong momentum."    Wu said Hata's visit from January 8 to 9 will be the first  high- level meeting between the two countries in 1994 and that  China hopes the visit will "push forward" further developments.    Trade between the two countries is expected to have reached  30 billion dollars in 1993, up from 25.3 billion dollars in 1992.    Hata will hold meetings with key leaders, including  President  Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.    Hata also will hold his fourth overall meeting with Qian.</p>

			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets: S African industrials drop as investors await budget details Industrial stocks fell sharply amid continuing uncertainty in the world's financial markets and ahead of today's South African budget announcement. Brokers noted that a midsession recovery in industrials had proved unsustainable in line with weakness among European equities. Gold shares were more active as they tracked the move in the price of bullion, which rose above Dollars 390 an ounce. The overall index ended 9 up at 5,721, industrials fell 26 to 6,594 and the golds index added 18 at 2,245. De Beers and Anglos rebounded after early losses, reflecting an improvement of sentiment in mining-related stocks. De Beers gained R2.25 at R115 and Anglos closed R4 ahead at R238. Gencor slipped 15 cents to R11.95.</p>

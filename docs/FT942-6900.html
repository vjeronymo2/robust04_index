			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Glaxo India sells unit to Heinz for Dollars 70m Glaxo India, a subsidiary of Glaxo Holdings of the UK, has sold its family products division to HJ Heinz of the US for Dollars 70m. The division contributes 30 per cent to the offshoot's net profits and generates annual revenues of Rs1.5bn (Dollars 47.8m) from products including baby foods, health beverages and toiletry products. The deal involves all brands, a factory at Uttar Pradesh and an undertaking by Heinz to employ the division's 950 employees. The sale, which will be put to shareholders next month, is subject to government approval. The sale is in line with Glaxo's strategy to concentrate on its mainline pharmaceutical business which contributes around 65 per cent to total revenues of Rs6bn. Last year, Glaxo Holdings invested Rs510m to increase its stake in the Indian company from 40 per cent to a majority 51 per cent. Since then steps have been taken to align the Indian subsidiary's businesses more closely with the parent company's. In an attempt to overcome constraints imposed by drug price controls introduced in 1979, Glaxo India had diversified into products such as starch derivatives, soya bean oil and liquid glucose by setting up joint ventures. Last year the board decided to move out of these loss-making businesses. A Glaxo spokesman said that while the division has contributed to the bottom line, its growth was in question with the entry of multinational food companies to India.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MAN GETS 15 YEARS TO LIFE IN KILLING  </P> <P> A 23-year-old Pacoima man was sentenced Monday to 15 years to life in prison in  the shooting death of the girlfriend of a reputed San Fernando Valley drug  czar.  </P> <P> Vincent Williams pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in San Fernando  Superior Court in the Feb. 14 shooting death of Michelle Smith, 18. Williams  turned himself in to police soon after Smith's body was found in the Sylmar  motel room where she lived in the 13100 block of San Fernando Road, Deputy  Dist. Atty. Sid D. Trapp said.  </P> <P> Smith died of one shotgun blast to the chest. Williams had argued with the  victim before the shooting, but the exact motive for the slaying was not clear,  Trapp said.  </P> <P> As part of a plea agreement with prosecutors, Williams was sentenced to 15  years to life in prison for the slaying.  </P> <P> Trapp said the victim was the girlfriend of Stanley Bryant, who authorities say  operates a sophisticated Valley drug organization with his older brother, Jeff  Bryant.  </P> <P> Stanley Bryant is in Los Angeles County Jail awaiting trial on murder charges  in the Aug. 28 slaying of four people at a Lake View Terrace "rock" house owned  by his brother. Jeff Bryant is serving the final months of a four-year sentence  for operating a drug center at the house.  </P> <P> Williams' defense attorney, Alan Budde, asked the court Monday to consider  putting his client in a high-security unit in state prison. He said that  because of Smith's relations with Stanley Bryant, Williams has been the target  of several attacks at County Jail.  </P></p>

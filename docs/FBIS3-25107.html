Nzuzo Matiwane, suspected of involvement in the SADF [South  African Defense Force] raid on an Umtata home in which five  youths were killed, has been held in detention under Section 47  of the homeland's Public Security Act for the past four months.  Lawyers for Human Rights have tried unsuccessfully to free him  and are now working on alternative ways of challenging his  detention.    Approached for comment on Monday, ANC spokesman Ronnie  Mamoepa said the organisation remained steadfast in its  opposition to detention without trial. "The position of the ANC  has always been that any person who has been detained as a  suspect should be brought before a court of law as speedily as  possible," Mr Mamoepa said.    He repeated this statement six or seven times when asked  whether Gen Holomisa, who is 13th on the ANC's national election  list, was not causing embarrassment to the organisation.    He maintained that the Transkei police and not the homeland  leader was responsible for Mr Matiwane's arrest and continued  detention.    Asked whether the ANC planned to approach Gen Holomisa to  discuss the situation he said: "As far as I know we don't have  any plans to intervene in the matter."    In an interview earlier, Gen Holomisa questioned how he  could  be considered an embarrassment to the ANC when the organisation,  as a member of the Transitional Executive Council, had agreed to  postpone the abolition of the detention without trial clause.    He blamed South African "agents provocateurs" for the  continued existence of Section 47 on Transkei's statute books.  "We were about to remove the act in 1990 but after the  attempted coup we had to stall the process. Anyway, that law  has only been used against South African agents provocateurs.  "We are in the process of removing all other related laws but we  can only take a final decision on Section 47 after we have  completed a threat analysis," he said.    While the multiparty talks decided that all laws which  inhibited personal freedom should be scrapped, Gen Holomisa said  he feared South Africa might continue to destabilise Transkei in  the run-up to the election.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: HOORAY FOR . . . ER . . . BELLFLOWER?  </P> <P> Civic pride can be an ugly emotion, elevating the territorial imperative to  plateaus of brutal conflict.  </P> <P> Poke fun at a home town and you run the risk of a counterattack vastly  exceeding the tone or intent of the original comment.  </P> <P> Angry ladies hit the phone, editors of community newspapers hit their battered  old word processors and almost everyone writes a letter.  </P> <P> Not that I am unfamiliar with abuse. Just yesterday I received a note from a  woman who attacked me for my views on mountain lions. She called me what Zsa  Zsa Gabor is said to have called Officer Kramer.  </P> <P> I was ready to defend myself when it occurred to me I hadn't even written  anything on mountain lions. Defending an action I hadn't taken would be like  Poland apologizing for World War II.  </P> <P> When I telephoned the lady to tell her there had been no mention of mountain  lions in my column, she chewed me out for having ignored an imminent peril to  an entire species of animal. Then she hung up.  </P> <P> Which leads, however circuitously, to Bellflower and Hollywood.  </P> <P> I made fun of both cities recently and am busy ducking the outraged response. I  said no one of importance ever goes to Bellflower, and there's nothing to do in  Hollywood that doesn't require a condom.  </P> <P> Katie, bar the door.  </P> <P> I heard first from Bellflower, which is just south of Paramount and not to be  confused with Bell Gardens, which is near Cudahy.  </P> <P> Proud citizens telephoned, civic leaders wrote and a local poet tried to rhyme  Bellflower with hell's hour in verse intended to glorify the town's ecumenical  spirit.  </P> <P> Of special note, however, was an editorial in the tabloid-sized Paramount News  Tribune entitled, "Importance of Being Al."  </P> <P> I knew I was in trouble with the first line: "How easy it is to make fun of  something decent."  </P> <P> The editorial refers to me as "Call-me-Al" and says I fancy myself a  second-rate David Letterman. I'm not sure why the Call-me-Al, but that's all  right. It's better than being called Elmer Teenez.  </P> <P> "Bellflower," the editorial fumes, "is better off if the likes of Charles  Manson, Sirhan Sirhan, gang chieftains, Tom Bradley, drug kingpins, organized  crime figures, talk show hosts, shallow movie stars and other 'important'  people stay the hell out of town."  </P> <P> Well, I . . .  </P> <P> "That's not what matters in Bellflower."  </P> <P> I didn't mean to imply . . .  </P> <P> "Church matters in Bellflower."  </P> <P> OK, so I wasn't . . .  </P> <P> "Families matter in Bellflower. Good schools matter. Friendly neighbors and  responsive local government matters."  </P> <P> The message comes across like the drums of Gotterdammerung. The editor loves  Bellflower. It could be worse. Some editors have never known love at all.  </P> <P> Fly now on the wings of incredulity to Hollywood where, I have learned, not  everyone is involved in erotic industry. There are, for instance, cobblers in  Hollywood.  </P> <P> I heard this from Oscar and Nyla Arsianian who are both members of the board of  directors of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> They spoke for an hour on the abundance of art and human decency in their home  town, giving lie to whoever said, "Strip away the phony tinsel of Hollywood and  you find the real tinsel underneath."  </P> <P> The Arsianians, who are man and wife, run a public relations business out of a  ship-shaped building in Crossroads of the World, a unique complex of offices  built about the time Errol Flynn was entertaining teen-aged girls aboard his  yacht Sirocco.  </P> <P> Oscar and Nyla are the driving force behind a campaign that extols the virtues  of Hollywood, from its movie industry to, well, its cobblers.  </P> <P> "Crime, prostitution and filth didn't stop the 'I Love New York' campaign,"  Oscar said. "They chose to point out the city's positive aspects. That's what  we're doing."  </P> <P> Urban squalor, he adds, exists in Hollywood, but so do upbeat industries and  decent little people who whistle as they work, much like the Seven Dwarfs  around Snow White.  </P> <P> Another booster heard from was Ken Schessler, whose book "This is Hollywood,"  offers plenty of activities that do not require condoms.  </P> <P> You can visit the place where John Belushi OD'd, where silent film star Lou  Tellegen killed himself with sewing scissors or where Clara Bow made love to  the entire USC football team. Maps provided.  </P> <P> Well, OK. I was wrong. Bellflower is a swell little town, and Hollywood is  perfect for hookers and cobblers.  </P> <P> Now I'm off on vacation for a month, so tuck your causticities away until  October. I won't say where I'm going, but I'll tell you this. It won't be  Bellflower.  </P></p>

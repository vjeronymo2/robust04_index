			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 13 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu and the chief of the U.N. nuclear watchdog  agreed on the need for further inspections in North Korea at  their talks Tuesday. Han stopped off in Tokyo on his way to  Moscow to meet with International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  Director-general Hans Blix, who is in the Japanese capital to  attend a conference.    During the one-hour meeting, the foreign minister reminded  Blix of the March 31 U.N. Security Council presidential  statement urging all involved nations to engage in dialogue with  North Korea, and suggested that the IAEA make the first offer to  negotiate with Pyongyang, officials at the South Korean Embassy  said.    He proposed that if North Korea still refuses inspections  early next month, the IAEA should report Pyongyang's  non-compliance based on technical information, the officials  said.    IAEA inspectors went to North Korea last month but were  denied access to critical areas necessary in determining whether  Pyongyang diverted nuclear material for non-peaceful uses.</p>

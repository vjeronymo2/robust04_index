			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Brussels pressure over social security: Commission seeks acceptance of 'guidelines' intended to improve benefits THE European Commission yesterday put forward guidelines intended to harmonise and improve social security benefits throughout the EC. Brussels officials believe that endorsement of the guidelines by member states would show stronger commitment to the Community's social aims than the support given to the Social Charter, adopted in December 1989 with the sole dissent of the UK. The guidelines are a 'recommendation' which Brussels wants the Council of Ministers to adopt. This would have no legal standing, but would, in the Commission's view, acquire political and moral force if it gains the required unanimous approval of member states. Brussels wants a general right to benefits, based on need, to be recognised all over the EC. Eight member states have some form of guaranteed minimum income for the poor, such as 'income support' in the UK or Sozialhilfe in Germany. Italy and Spain have similar but limited regional schemes, but Greece and Portugal have virtually nothing. The Commission also wants such benefits to be without a time limit, to be extended to non-EC nationals resident in the Community, and to be accompanied by access to health care, housing and training. Its initiative is an attempt to generate movement in an area where it cannot get laws through, as part of its emphasis that the 'social dimension' to the single market programme has not been forgotten. More practically, it wants to limit the scope for 'social dumping': companies moving to areas of the EC where social legislation is weakest, or, once exchange rates are locked by monetary union, countries cutting social expenditure to boost competitiveness. The Commission's aim is to be able to monitor the extent to which member states' social security regimes converge. As part of this, it wants the Twelve mutually to scrutinise each other's practice, rather as they now examine each other's macroeconomic performance within the so-called 'multilateral surveillance' sessions of the council of finance ministers. 'The strongest we can expect . . . is to be able to embarrass laggard member states,' a Commission official said. Britain, which believes that EC social policy should limit itself to health and safety regulations and the creation of jobs, 'is unlikely to have serious difficulties with the recommendation,' British diplomats here said. It could benefit those EC workers who now fall outside any national safety net, they said.</p>

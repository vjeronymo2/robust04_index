			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Japanese banks face 'serious' debt problem: Confidential report puts bad and doubtful debts at Y42,000bn to Y53,000bn THE collapse of the Japanese property boom has left banks with a bad debt problem that is 'serious but not lethal', according to a senior official of the Bank of Japan, the central bank. Yesterday, the stock market lost some of its recent gains, on renewed worries about banks' exposure to property sparked by the troubles of Olympia &amp; York. The Nikkei index closed down 730.33 at 18,074.27. The central bank official said Japan's bad loan data were 'still a moving target' because the commercial property market had not yet stabilised. 'Nobody at this moment can possibly have an accurate estimate because the situation in real estate is so fluid,' he said. The official said the Bank of Japan had been carrying out 'all sorts of mental exercises' to calculate the possible magnitude of the problem. A report circulating among bankers in Tokyo, said to be based on confidential Bank of Japan data, puts the total bad and doubtful debts of the banks and financial institutions at Y42,000bn to Y53,000bn (Pounds 177bn to Pounds 224bn). The report, obtained by the Financial Times, indicates total potential problem loans are far greater than the banks or the authorities have hitherto admitted. Moreover, the estimate is based on figures collected at the end of last September. A further fall in land prices since then could well have aggravated the position. However, the figures add together different categories of problem loans  - including loans on which at least some interest is being paid as well as those where interest payments have stopped altogether. They are also calculated without taking account of the value of collateral. For the three categories of leading national banks - the top commercial or 'city' banks, the long-term credit banks and trust banks - problem loans total Y26,400bn-Y35,400bn. This compares with a figure published by the Ministry of Finance last month of Y7,000bn-Y8,000bn for loans at these banks on which interest had not been paid for six months or more. The contrast suggests that the ministry's figures could grow markedly in the next year or two, as more loans move from the doubtful to the non-performing category. The report says estimated total problem loans of Y42,000bn-Y56,000bn account for 6.5-8.7 per cent of total loans as at the end of September 1991. Of this, some Y19,000bn-Y25,000bn are loans to property companies and a further Y23,000bn-Y31,000bn are loans to non-bank financial companies, which in turn lent heavily to property developers. The biggest burden falls on city banks, with problem loans of Y13,700bn-Y18,300bn. However, other banks have higher ratios of problem loans to total loans - including long-term credit banks, trust banks and non-life insurance companies. Japan-based foreign banks also suffered damage - with some Y1,800bn-Y2,300bn in problem loans, fully 16.2-20.7 per cent of their total loans in Japan. This figure confirms anecdotal evidence of foreign banks lending to Japanese non-banks relatively late in the property boom.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                 POTENTIAL DOUBTFUL LOANS AT JAPANESE                     FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS (Ybn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------                            Total loans      Doubtful loans (range) City banks                   236,900             13,700 - 18,300 Long term credit banks        47,100              5,400 -  7,300 Trust banks                   59,300              7,300 -  9,800 Regional banks               119,000              5,200 -  6,900 Other                        181,700             10,300 - 13,600 Total                        644,400             42,000 - 56,000  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Japanese bankers' estimates  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

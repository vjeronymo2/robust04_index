			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Today's Comment" column by Thlang Ambal: "Communism is not </F> Wanted Anymore in Cambodia!"]    [Text] The various communist regimes in the world have all  committed suicide. Only a few countries remain communist. They  are moving gradually, however, toward a free market system.  They are not abolishing with their communism speedily because  they are ashamed before the rest of the world. These countries  are Vietnam, the PRC, North Korea, and Cuba.    As for our Cambodian people, they do not want communism, and  especially such a communist like Khieu Samphan, in the royal  government.    Our people, as many as 99.99 percent, want multiparty  liberal  democracy. They want genuine freedom, genuine liberalism.    Therefore, to serve the people and their interest, we must  unite as one to eliminate the Khmer Rouge to the last man to  avoid their presence in the government. We must not allow any  communist to hold power in our Cambodia.    If the "roundtable" accepts the Khmer Rouge, it would be  tantamount to accepting a tiger, thus suicide for the government.    The Cambodian people absolutely reject the Khmer Rouge. No  influence can oppose this people's will! Anyone who overlooks  the Khmer Rouge threat should not call himself a Cambodian.</p>

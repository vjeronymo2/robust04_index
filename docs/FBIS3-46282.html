The State Statistics Bureau (SSB) said in a release today  that 4,989 towns out of a total of over 50,000 have registered  an agricultural and industrial output value of more than 100  million yuan (about 12 million U.S. dollars) each.    Among these towns, called China's "100-million-yuan towns,"  72 enjoyed an output value of more than 1 billion yuan (some 120  million dollars) and 434 boasted at least 500 million yuan (some  60 million dollars) in output.    The township is China's fundamental governmental unit. The  mushrooming of comparatively wealthy towns is considered an  indication of the upgrading of China's rural economy.    Statistics show that the "100-million-yuan towns," home to  20  percent of China's total rural population, produced half of the  country's rural output value, and two-thirds of China's rural  industrial output value.    The booming rural industries have been the biggest  contributors to the development of the wealthy towns, the  statistics show. In these towns non-agricultural production  accounted for 88 percent of total output value, about 24  percentage points higher than the country's average.    The output value of township enterprises in these prosperous  communities made up 52 percent of the country's total.    Most of the towns are scattered in the southeastern coastal  areas, mainly in the provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong and  Zhejiang, where rapid economic growth has taken place over the  past decade.    Experts said this manifested the disparity of economic  growth  in different areas in China. However, they said, the most  encouraging si'nal is that 100-million-yuan towns have sprung up  in poor areas, especially in the western part of China.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Union check-off shortfall reported Between 600,000 and 1.2m of the 6m trade unionists who pay their subscriptions through the check-off system for deducting dues from wages had still not signed new instructions to do so by the beginning of last month, the independent Labour Research Department said yesterday. Under the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act 1993 union members who pay through check-off had to confirm their desire to continue paying in this way by yesterday. The unions will have to repeat this exercise every three years. A survey by the department found that very few members had refused to confirm, but many unions were having difficulty contacting remaining members. In the AEEU engineering union, refusals are running at only 0.5 per cent of the membership but the union is still nearly 20 per cent, or 160,000 members, short of a full sign-up. Just 414 of the 55,416 members of the IRSF tax officers union had decided not to re-sign. The public-service union Unison, Britain's largest union, said yesterday that around 130,000 of its 1.3m members had still to re-sign. Three unions encouraged their members to switch from check-off to direct debit payment of their subscriptions. The NUT teaching union persuaded 65 per cent of its members to switch to direct debit, the banking union Bifu had a 56 per cent conversion and Natfhe, the lecturers' union, had a 47 per cent conversion. The survey found that 12 employers had withdrawn check-off facilities including the Bank of England, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays (from November) and BAA, the airports group.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Agitation for  increased production is brisk in all parts of Korea.    The Pyongyang municipal art propaganda troupe is now greatly  encouraging working people in the city to register great  achievements in carrying out the revolutionary economic strategy  shaped by the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK].    Its performance vividly reflects the fruitful efforts of  working people to successfully implement the agriculture-first,  light industry-first and foreign trade-first policies advanced  by the WPK.    The art troupe is calling on them to make this year a year  of  a historical turn in the revolution and construction by  effecting a revolutionary upsurge in socialist economic  construction in the spirit with which they crossed the river in  flame and marched through the marsh during the rigorous war in  the 1950s and in the spirit with which they brought about a  great upswing of Chollima in the postwar period when everything  had been destroyed.    Art propaganda troupes engaged in agitation for increased  production were organized and are now active in all provincial  seats. Travelling art propaganda troupes are seen in all  counties, factories, enterprises and cooperative farms.    They are encouraging working people to increase production  in  various forms and ways on cooperative fields bustling with  sowing, at consumer goods production bases, power stations, coal  mines, railway stations, chemical, metal and building material  production sites, housing and other construction sites in the  capital and deep sea fishing grounds.    Stirring and appealing oral propaganda and introduction of  achievements through on-spot broadcasting and by radio cars and  loud voices of announcers congratulating innovators are making  the whole country replete with revolutionary zeal and spirit.    Agitation troupes made up of artistes and men of the press  of  the capital and provinces have been dispatched to major sites to  powerfully rouse working people in increased production and  faster construction.</p>

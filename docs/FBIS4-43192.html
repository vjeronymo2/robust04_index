			<p>BFN     [Text] New deliberations on the issue of Skopje [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] will begin in New York  with Cyrus Vance and Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias  who will go there tomorrow. Vance will also meet with Skopjean  Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski.    [Begin Foreign Ministry spokesman Konstandinos Bikas  recording] Our position on the issue of Skopje's name is firm.  We will not recognize a state that has the term `Macedonia' in  its name. Furthermore, a condition for the lifting of the  embargo is a change of Skopje's flag, either by amending the  constitution, or having Skopje submit a binding peaceful  declaration to the United Nations. It should confirm at the  first opportunity that it will take the necessary steps in  parliament to change the relevant articles of its constitution.  [end recording]</p>

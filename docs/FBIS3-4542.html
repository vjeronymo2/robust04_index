Vang  Pao's fighters taking refuge in Saraburi's Wat Tham Krabok and  other immigration centers. Gen. Prathin said 40 Lao out of 6,096  living in Wat Tam Krabok were suspected to have military  connections with Gen. Vang Pao's groups.    "I have ordered metropolitan and provincial police,  including  state agencies concerned, to inspect whether the Laotian  anti-government members are living in the immigration centers in  the northern and northeastern provinces," he said. "These people  will be arrested and brought to court," said Gen. Prathin.  "This includes Lao illegal immigrants." He said the illegal  immigrants would be deported to their home country after being  prosecuted.    The chief ordered police to search for more evidence to  prove  that Gen. Vang Pao and Gen. Thonglit Chokbengboun had been using  Thailand as the base to mastermind subversive activities against  the Lao government. Gen. Prathin's pledge to arrest the rebels  came after the military filed charges against Gen. Vang Pao,  claiming the movements of the Lao dissidents in Thailand had  shaken national security and had affected the relationship  between the two countries.    The military yesterday arrested three Lao believed to work  for Gen. Vang Pao's group. They are identified as Pa Cha Pa,  Cheu Yang, and Mai Jung Yang. Pa and Cheu hold American  citizenship and Mai has Australian citizenship.    According to the police, after the civil war in Laos died  down in 1975, the court of the then Lao government ruled that  Gen. Vang Pao and Gen. Thonglit, now in exile in the United  States, were war criminals. [passage omitted]    Based on last year's intelligence information, the Supreme  Command Headquarters discovered some Hmong ethnic people  allegedly belonging to the Lao anti-government forces had been  active militarily along the Thai-Lao border.</p>

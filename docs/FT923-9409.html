			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Director well-known in anti-European group: Wallace Smith Trust Liquidation Duncan to his friends - is described as a friendly family man and his business acquaintances say he has firm political views. Mr Smith, from western Canada, is well known among the Bruges Group of anti-European federalists who number Lady Thatcher, the former prime minister, among their supporters. Lord Harris of High Cross, a former chairman of the Bruges Group, said yesterday that Mr Smith was in no sense high-living. 'He struck me as an extremely gentle, extremely decent and straightforward man,' he said. He added: 'He was extremely interested in the whole idea of the market economy. He has taken an alert and scholarly interest in economic argument. He is a student of these things in a quiet way.' Mr Smith is known to have paid the rent on the Bruges Group's one-room office in Jermyn Street, central London for nearly two years, and to have made the same level of contribution to its bigger rent bill after the group moved to Whitehall. According to an individual familiar with the Bruges Group Mr Smith contributed 'a small percentage' of the ongoing cost of the group's campaigning without taking a public role in its affairs. Like other contributors, he took no part in the group's internal decision-making process. Outside politics, however, Mr Smith was recognised as a dealer in trade finance. During the 1960s he joined Nesbitt Thompson, a Canadian broking firm and was sent to London about 20 years ago to set up a money market and Euro-market trading presence in the UK. He and two colleagues left the firm to establish what was described as a money market advisory boutique which became the embryo of Wallace Smith Trust Company. Mr Smith is known to have approached at least one large conglomerate seeking to handle its treasury funds, although the offer was declined. A banker who knew him said: 'He said he was dealing in fixed-interest securities to get a return above the rate that could be achieved by putting the funds into bills. 'I think the process was called riding the square and involved interpreting the interest curve.' During the late 1970s Mr Smith worked in east Africa, handling Canadian export finance in coun-tries such as Kenya and Uganda. His bank maintained a balance of between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m which enabled it to carry out sophisticated trades in swaps and deals in various commercial paper such as certificates of deposit. His interests in the Canadian-registered Wallace Smith Group are held in a complex structure of family trusts. Neighbours of Mr Smith in Chelsea, west London, said yesterday that the property was rented out and no one answering Mr Smith's description had lived there for some time. His whereabouts last night were not known.</p>

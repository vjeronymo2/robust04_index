			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Observer: Full circle The chattering classes have been droning on for years about the way Britain's high streets have been overwhelmed by a tidal wave of building societies, estate agents and tweely-named antique shops. Where were the real shops, they asked, the friendly old-fashioned shops - cobblers, greengrocers, fishmongers? Now the recession is starting to deprive them of this subject of conversation. Does Highgate high street in north London represent the thin end of the wedge? Two of the big building societies have already closed down expensively purchased estate agency branches there. And now a shop that used to specialise in elaborate antique mirrors has been replaced with an old-fashioned greengrocer. Whatever next: a traditional ironmonger selling mops, brushes and galvanised iron pails?</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to SCS's support of the proposed deletion of the use of first-lien security interests from the definition for ``collateral bond'' at Rule 1.04(25), the Director is approving, as discussed in finding No. 2.b, the proposed deletion of all forms of real and personal property as forms of collateral bond. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the SCS comment that mining companies should be liable for all lands that are disturbed by their activities regardless of the relative location of these lands, Colorado, by definition of ``surface coal mining and reclamation operations'' at Rule 1.04(133) and the requirement to obtain a permit at Rule 2.01.3(1), requires that any land disturbed by mining and reclamation activities must be included within the permitted area. Therefore, if land outside of the permit area has been disturbed by mining activities, the operator is mining in violation of the approved permit. As discussed in finding No. 1, the Director is approving the proposed deletion of the requirement for bond liability on disturbed lands that are outside of the permit area from Rule 3.02.1(4). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the SCS question concerning who would be responsible for site-specific standards of success for revegetation proposed at Rule 3.03.1(2)(b), the applicant for a permit is responsible for proposing site-specific revegetation success standards that are in accordance with the Colorado rules. The proposed success standards, as well as the permittee's demonstration that the standards have been achieved, must be approved by the Division. As discussed in finding No. 8.b, the Director is approving, at proposed Rule 3.03.1(2)(b), the requirements for revegetation success that must be met prior to phase II bond release. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the SCS question concerning whether there would be language proposed to replace the proposed deletion of Rule 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix), regarding the disallowance of real and personal property as a form of collateral bond, and Rule 3.06, regarding the deletion of special bonding requirements for construction of mine drainage control facilities, Colorado has not proposed replacement language. As discussed in finding Nos. 2.b and 10, the Director is approving the proposed deletions at Rules 3.02.4(2)(c)(ix) and 3.06. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Mine Safety and Health Administration responded on August 15 and September 8, 1994, that there was no conflict with the Federal regulations (administrative record Nos. CO&hyph;640 and CO&hyph;645). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Concurrence and Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM is required to solicit the written concurrence of EPA with respect to those provisions of the proposed program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> None of the revisions that Colorado proposed to make in its amendment pertain to air or water quality standards. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

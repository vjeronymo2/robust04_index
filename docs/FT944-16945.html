			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Observer: Scholarly sandwich Bully for St Edmund's College; it can take a joke. Observer recently mentioned that England's oldest Roman Catholic school wants planning permission for a petrol station/roadside cafe, and suggested it might exchange its motto - Avita pro fide (for the ancient faith) - for a more contemporary version, like 'Fill 'er up'. Donald McEwan, St Edmund's headmaster, argues: 'Surely it should be in Latin, and not the fractured English you suggest.' He offers three options. Tu das escam in tempore opportuno - 'you fill them up at the necessary moment' - is a little verbose. Mens sana in vehiculo sano - 'a healthy mind in a healthy vehicle' - is a touch obvious. But Conviva felix - 'happy eater' - has the snappy ring of commercialism.</p>

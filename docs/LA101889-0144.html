			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAMMER ART MUSEUM FACES SHARP PENCIL;  </P> <P> BUDGETS: COST OVERRUNS MAY FORCE OCCIDENTAL TO SCALE BACK OR DEFER THREE MAJOR  COMPONENTS OF THE CULTURAL CENTER.  </P> <P> The Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center under construction in  Westwood has encountered significant cost overruns and may be forced to scale  back or defer completion of three of its major components, according to sources  close to the project.  </P> <P> The museum is being financed by Occidental Petroleum Corp. Meetings have been  under way at Occidental this week to determine what sources called the museum's  "guaranteed maximum cost" -- a term commonly used to indicate the price at  which a contractor guarantees to finish a building.  </P> <P> The sources said the projected total had ballooned to as much as $80 million  before Occidental officials ordered a comprehensive review. They said the  internal inquiry was focusing on elimination of lavish features in the design  -- particularly millions of dollars worth of electronic gear and expensive  finish materials in the auditorium -- that could potentially reduce the total  cost to about $58 million. The museum was originally estimated to cost about  $50 million.  </P> <P> The museum is being built to house the art collection amassed by Occidental  Chairman Armand Hammer, who turns 92 next May. Hammer's collection was bought  partly with Occidental funds.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, crews of dozens of construction workers have been working  overtime to complete the museum's seismically reinforced outer shell and steel  skeleton.  </P> <P> "The museum construction is proceeding on schedule," said Occidental spokesman  Frank Ashley. "It is expected to open about this time next year. Beyond that, I  wouldn't elaborate."  </P> <P> Other Occidental or construction officials contacted by The Times would not  discuss the project, and the office of Alla Hall, the museum's director,  referred calls to Ashley. Hammer did not return calls seeking his comment.  </P> <P> Sources familiar with the project and a lawyer representing Occidental said the  museum may be forced to leave vacant the space reserved for a restaurant,  auditorium and library. It also might have to cut back drastically on other  museum features.  </P> <P> "It's all money-related stuff," said one source closely familiar with the  project. He said the issue is one "of too much building and too few dollars."  </P> <P> Bruce Kauffman, a Philadelphia attorney who represents Occidental in a pending  shareholder suit challenging the oil company's commitment to the museum  project, said he was aware of deliberations over the last several weeks that  focused on construction costs.  </P> <P> Kauffman said he knew of at least one discussion, to which he was not a party,  in which scaling back or eliminating the auditorium and restaurant had been  considered.  </P> <P> Occidental is required under terms of a pending court order to limit cost  overruns to $10 million. Previously sealed court documents, made public as a  result of a court petition by The Times and the Wall Street Journal, also  indicate that Hammer ordered in a memo that the museum construction be held  within the original $50-million budget.  </P> <P> A series of factors -- ranging from the discovery of an underground stream  during excavation to cost underestimates of expensive marble veneers -- have  apparently driven up the price beyond even the highest initial estimates.  </P> <P> Some of the problems were alluded to by Hammer in a deposition taken earlier  this year in one of the pending shareholder lawsuits. Hammer said the  subterranean stream and the discovery of a foundation of a former building on  the site added $3 million to the museum price tag alone.  </P> <P> The museum is being constructed behind the existing Occidental Petroleum  headquarters building on a site bounded by Wilshire Boulevard, Glendon Avenue,  Westwood Boulevard and Lindbrook Drive. Original estimates were that a parking  garage below the museum would cost $23 million and the museum space itself,  another $27 million. The garage is the structural support for the museum, which  is to be connected to the first four floors of the oil company building.  </P> <P> In addition to committing as much as $60 million in museum construction costs,  Occidental has agreed to purchase a $36-million annuity to subsidize the museum  in its first five years of operation.  </P> <P> Kauffman had estimated that Occidental's total potential financial exposure  could be as high as $160 million. But in a telephone interview earlier this  week, Kauffman said the $160 million figure "has absolutely no meaning" and was  derived from estimates at the start of the museum project when "all kinds of  figures were being thrown around."  </P> <P> Hammer announced plans to build the museum in late 1987 after he abruptly  withdrew from a previous commitment to donate his art collection to the Los  Angeles County Museum of Art. The agreement was canceled after the museum  balked at a series of demands by Hammer, including that names of other donors  who gave money for galleries where his paintings would be displayed be stripped  from the spaces and that life-sized portraits of Hammer and his wife be  permanently displayed with his art collection.  </P> <P> Hammer also demanded that the county museum hire a curator for his collection  who would not be answerable to the county museum director, and that the museum  pledge never to exhibit works along with Hammer's collection other than those  he donated.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in an another development, Occidental has failed to meet an Oct. 6  deadline to respond to a set of written questions in a pending shareholder  lawsuit demanding to know the source of funds used to purchase virtually every  work in Hammer's art collection, the value of which has been estimated at as  much as $450 million.  </P> <P> The filing of the questions in early September followed the disclosure by  Hammer earlier this year that Occidental was the source of funds used to  purchase a collection of Leonardo da Vinci drawings subsequently renamed the  "Codex Hammer."  </P> <P> Kauffman said Occidental refused to answer the questions because they were  filed late and because Occidental has moved to dismiss the shareholder suit.  Attorneys for New York investor Alan Kahn, the plaintiff in the lawsuit, said  they would seek a court order compelling Occidental to reply.  </P> <P> The $5.8-million purchase of the "Codex Hammer" in 1980 was announced at the  time as an undertaking of the Armand Hammer Foundation. Court documents made  public several weeks ago revealed, however, that Occidental Petroleum provided  the money in the form of a gift to the foundation.  </P> <P> The disclosure prompted more court action last month. The California Public  Employees Retirement System, the state's largest pension plan and owner of 2.4  million shares of Occidental stock, filed court papers demanding that any part  of Hammer's art collection purchased with Occidental funds be returned to the  oil company and that the museum building itself be sold.  </P></p>

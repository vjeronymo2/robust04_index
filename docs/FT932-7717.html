			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury falls With brand worries continuing to haunt food manufacturers, the fall in Cadbury Schweppes was further fuelled by renewed rumours that the company was about to launch a rights issue. Although heard before, particularly in relation to a bid for United Biscuits, rights hints have received fresh impetus from the recent spate of issues by other consumer groups. However, while food analysts remain sceptical, Cadbury has often emphasised its strategy that a rights issue would only be contemplated for acquisition purposes. Underpinning Cadbury's decline and general weakness in the sector was the continuing fallout from comments this week from French food group BSN, which have reignited recent fears over the vulnerability of food brands to discount retailers. Among those to fall yesterday, Unilever retreated 18 to 996p, Hillsdown 8 to 139p, Cadbury 14 to 422p and Associated British Foods 5 to 469p. UB lost 2 to 403p.</p>

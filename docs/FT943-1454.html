			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (8): Fresh US capital in fewer, larger funds - A record-breaking year The US venture capital industry, which was becalmed for lack of funds in the early 1990s, is once again racing away on a following wind. In the first half of 1994, US venture capital funds raised Dollars 1.88bn, a 45 per cent increase over the same period last year, according to Venture Economics, the New Jersey-based information service. This is more than was raised in the record-breaking 1994 fund-raising round and only Dollars 660m short of the total raised in 1993. What is more, this year's fund raising was achieved by 35 venture capitalists, nearly half the number who raised the capital in 1984, confirming the industry's move towards raising larger funds. With more funds available, the question facing venture capitalists is where the capital will be invested and how quickly. Implicit in this question is whether the US venture capital industry has matured since the 1980s and will better manage the new funds. Looming over the industry is the fact that the market for initial public offerings is not as encouraging as even six months ago. During the first half of 1994, 79 venture backed companies went public with a value of Dollars 2.12bn, up on the same period last year, according to VentureOne, a San Francisco-based research organisation. But venture capitalists say the figures are deceptive and that the market is sagging. According to VentureOne, it is also becoming for expensive for venture backed companies to raise capital through an IPO. While in 1992, companies needed to sell on average 1.6 per cent of their equity for every million dollars raised, that figure has jumped to 2 per cent in the first half of 1994. This effectively means the cost of raising capital through an IPO has risen by 25 per cent, making it less attractive to float at the moment. What is more, the recently floated venture-backed companies are not performing as well as they have done in the past year in the after-market, barely posting gains over their issue price on average, compared with an 18 per cent increase last year. Venture capitalists are therefore accepting they will need to build more companies rather than seek a more immediate IPO. The concentration of fresh capital in fewer, larger funds, threatens to increase competition in the larger deals. Some observers say more cash will be chasing a similar number of deals, with the effect that rates of return will fall and more debt will begin to creep back into deal structures. The fear is that venture capitalists will feel they have to put money to work, irrespective of the prices they pay and the quality of the deals they are currently seeing. Alan Patricof, chairman of Patricof and Company, the US member of Apax Partners, thinks these fears are over done. 'There is a much more mature attitude to pricing, more disciplined pricing,' he says. 'I see very little sign of extreme valuations.' He believes the industry has matured since the 1980s - 'there is no question that there is a maturing in the industry,' he says. 'There are a lot more experienced people who have been around since the early '80s, there are bigger firms that are better staffed.' The competition means there will be more need for venture capitalists to differentiate their product. More funds will be backing turnarounds and distressed private and public companies, says Bob Johnston, president of Beacon Hill Financial, a Boston-based agency that specialises in raising funds. But while specialists and well-known individuals will always be able to raise early stage seed funds, there is a move towards investing in later stage companies, says Jesse Reyes, managing director of Venture Economics. Whereas in the early 1980s many funds became interested in early stage investments and start-ups, they are doing more later stage growth capital for companies already making profits. This could become a problem for early stage funds even though the large state pension funds, which are increasingly allocating funds to the asset class, frequently say they want to support early stage development capital. 'They say they are firmly committed to early stage development capital - but there are not a lot of Dollars 100m early stage seed funds around,' says Reyes. To get around the problem, Reyes says he is hearing that some states, including Texas and Oklahoma, are considering starting seed funds. As far as the areas that have received venture backing and have provided their investors with an exit, there has been a large swing in the first half of the year. No fewer than 18 communications and networking companies raised Dollars 636m in the first half of the year, up from 10 flotations raising Dollars 504bn the previous year. As concern about President Clinton's healthcare reform eased, so the number of flotations more than doubled to five and the amount raised rose by a factor of four to Dollars 217m. Biotechnology and pharmaceuticals companies raised only Dollars 152m from 11 IPO's, down from Dollars 278m in the first half of 1993. Venture Economics says its most recent figures on overall returns explain why more institutions like state pension funds are allocating more funds to private equity investment. In 1993, the overall internal rate of return - the annual compound rate of return to the investor - rose to 18.3 per cent up from 13.5 per cent in 1992 according to the study of over 460 funds. This improvement will have something to do with the state of the US economy. But there are also fundamental changes in the way growth companies are being financed. 'Venture capitalists have moved much more towards growth capital for companies growing fast but already into revenues and profits,' says Patricof. 'The banks still are not providers of capital to younger companies  -they are asset not cash flow lenders. If you are looking for capital - venture capital is the only place to go.'</p>

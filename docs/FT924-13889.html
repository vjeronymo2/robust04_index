			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Publisher with a flair for the right image  -Dorling Kindersley plans to raise Pounds 30m through a flotation STRIKING combinations of images and text on the page have fuelled the rapid growth of Dorling Kindersley, the British publisher which is soon to be floated on the stock exchange. The Covent Garden-based company, which is likely to have a market capitalisation of Pounds 75m-Pounds 100m, is best known for books such as Penelope Leach's Baby and Child manual and its encyclopaedias of gardening, plants and flowers, produced in association with the Royal Horticultural Society. Mr Peter Kindersley, the company's chairman and chief executive, said illustration used to be an afterthought in British publishing, with poor pictures and graphics just dropped anywhere into an already written text. DK's reference books are conceived from the outset as an integral combination of images and words, with captions wrapped round high quality photographs and graphics, printed on clear white backgrounds. The company spends as much as Pounds 2,000 per page in its books - well above the industry average. Mr Kindersley, 51, who trained at arts school, believes publishing has suffered from a failure to invest sufficiently in its products, which in turn leads to low profit margins. DK recoups this heavy investment by achieving high sales of its reference books for adults and children. Most of the company's titles sell more than 100,000 copes, even although the majority are in hardback. To date, 38 have sold more than 500,000 copies and 12 titles have sold more than one million copies. The sales level results from the company's decision to focus on the international market. DK's books currently sell in more than 80 countries and in 37 languages. Last year 30 per cent of group sales were in the UK, 32 per cent in the US and 38 per cent from the rest of the world. The increasingly international outlook of the business has spurred growth at DK, which saw its pre-tax profits double to Pounds 7.5m in the year to June on sales which increased by 66 per cent to Pounds 70.9m. Mr Kindersley believes that publishing has suffered from the dominance of author's agents, who have been been able to extract huge advances by forcing individual publishers to bid against each other for each new title in separate territories around the world. DK's royalty rates and advances tend to be lower, since the company normally originates the concept and is responsible for commissioning authors, rather than bidding for ideas from authors. Some titles have no named authors, thus saving royalties completely. The company publishes a relatively small number of titles, bring out only 168 in the last year. DK says this enables it to concentrate its efforts on achieving high quality and on heavily marketing the finished products. Of the company's 700 employees worldwide, 400 are editors and designers. DK describes itself as market-led, with each new book idea being developed after extensive market research. The group aims to ensure that likely sales will cover the costs of each new title, and employs no fewer than 50 people on foreign rights. Since the company was founded in 1974, DK has published more than 560 titles, 90 per cent of which are still in print. About 30 per cent of the group's turnover comes from 'backlist sales' - titles which have been published for more than a year or two. DK said only 6 per cent of its books were returned by shops - compared with an industry average of more than 20 per cent. Another strong selling point has been DK's success in signing up learned and official bodies - such as the British Medical Association, Red Cross and London's Science Museum - to advise on and endorse publications, in exchange for royalties. The American Medical Association endorsed a Family Medical Guide which has already sold 5.3m copies and continues to sell 100,000 copies a year, providing a steady stream of income. DK's pathfinder prospectus, being published today will seek to raise Pounds 30m in new money for the company. The flotation is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with Cazenove acting as broker. The shares will be firmly placed with financial institutions, but will be subject to clawback by financial intermediaries for sale to private clients. Mr Kindersley's family will own about 45 per cent of the enlarged share capital. One of DK's most successful ventures has been its Eyewitness series of children's books, which it established in 1987 with the French publisher Gallimard. Since 1988 the Eyewitness series has sold more than 13m copies in 30 languages. Mr Kindersley is at his most eloquent about the growing importance of education. He believes that in a culture flooded with fleeting images, both children and adults can best learn by browsing and indulging their curiousity in a careful blend of images and text. Perhaps the most exciting long-term prospects come from DK's link with Microsoft, the US computer software company which after the flotation will have a 20 per cent stake in the British company. Both companies have just finished work on their first joint project, an interactive CD 'reference book' of musical instruments. Having slotted the CD into an appropriate personal computer, users can interrogate the huge database - calling up pictures, words and sounds of the world's instruments. Mr Kindersley believes this interactive form of education has huge potential, and will also provide a lucrative outlet for DK's existing archive of more than 500,000 images.</p>

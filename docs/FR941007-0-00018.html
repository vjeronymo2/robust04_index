			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Act generally requires a qualified intending immigrant to obtain an immigrant visa abroad before seeking admission to the United States for lawful permanent residence. It also allows certain persons who have not obtained an immigrant visa abroad to adjust status to that of a lawful permanent resident after arrival in the United States. As set forth in the Act, most persons seeking adjustment of status must show that they could qualify for immigrant visa issuance abroad and must meet certain additional requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An immigrant visa may be issued only at a United States consulate or embassy abroad. Each prospective immigrant is required to show that he or she is eligible for immigrant classification and has an immediately available immigrant visa number through a qualifying family or employment relationship, or other means. The applicant must also establish that he or she is not included in any of the classes of persons who cannot, by law, be admitted to the United States, or that any basis for inadmissibility has been waived. After the immigrant visa has been issued, the person may lawfully travel to the United States. A qualified immigrant visa holder becomes a lawful permanent resident upon admission to the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An adjustment of status applicant must be physically present in the United States at the time of application. A person applying under section 245 of the Act, the most frequently used adjustment of status provision, must meet the basic requirements for immigrant visa issuance. Like immigrant visa applicants, the adjustment applicant must prove that he or she is eligible for immigrant classification and has an immediately available immigrant visa number through a qualifying family or employment relationship, or other means. The adjustment applicant must also show that he or she is not included in any of the classes of persons who, by law, cannot be admitted to the United States, or that any basis for inadmissibility has been waived. Section 245(a) of the Act further restricts eligibility for adjustment of status by prohibiting adjustment unless the applicant entered the United States after having been inspected and admitted or paroled by an immigrant officer. Section 245(c) of the Act also bars the adjustment of most applicants who have been employed in the United States without authorization; who have not complied with the terms of temporary nonimmigrant status; or who entered in transit without visa status, under a visa waiver program, or as crewmen. A qualified adjustment applicant becomes a lawful permanent resident upon approval of the adjustment of status application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements of sections 245(a) and 245(c) of the Act were established to discourage intending immigrants from moving to the United States before becoming fully eligible for permanent residence and bypassing the orderly immigrant visa issuance process abroad. These requirements have caused many persons who are in the United States to be unable to adjust status in this country.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

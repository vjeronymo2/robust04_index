			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Zofran approval in Japan Glaxo has secured approval in Japan to sell one of its fastest growing products, Zofran, which reduces the side-effects of cancer chemotherapy. Zofran will be competing against a newer SmithKline Beecham product, Kytril. The Japanese market is unusual in that Kytril was launched there 18 months ago. In most other countries, Zofran was approved first. Analysts yesterday estimated that annual sales of Kytril in Japan were already worth Pounds 70m. Zofran has an advantage over Kytril in that it has been approved for both injections and tablets. Kytril is only available as an injection, although this is the normal means of delivering anti-emetic drugs in cancer chemotherapy. The launch date for Zofran in Japan is in the spring.</p>

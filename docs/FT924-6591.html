			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / UK Company News: York Waterworks rises to Pounds 1.28m York Waterworks raised pre-tax profit from Pounds 1.17m to Pounds 1.28m in the six months ended September 30 1992, and is lifting the interim dividend from 2.8p to 3.05p. Turnover rose from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 3.66m principally as a result of the April tariff increase. Sales by meter had not been affected by the depressed economy, but the growth in domestic sales slowed because of the reduction in housebuilding. Earnings per share came to 13.9p (12.3p).</p>

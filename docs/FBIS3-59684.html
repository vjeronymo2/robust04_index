			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] It is possible to set goals for the application of  fast breeder reactors (FBRs) that are to be ready by the first  half of the 21st century. As the FBRs secure safety, the amount  of resources and the economics will sufficiently concur with  light water reactors (LWRs), and possibly it will become the  main facility for generating electricity. This type of results  from research were reported on 8 June at a meeting held by the  Atomic Energy Commission of Japan-FBR Development and Planning  Specialist Subcommittee. The research made together by Japan  Nuclear Power Plant and by the Power Reactor and Fuel  Development Corporation (PNC) has concretely shown that their  goal is aimed toward future accomplishments in technical  development. It points out that in order to materialize such  goals it is necessary to devise a long term and a well planned  match. The research outline will be introduced in two issues.  <H5>  Preface </H5>   The development of our country's FBR has been considered as  one of the most important subjects concerning the country's  nuclear power policy and has been advanced under the cooperation  of both government and people. The technology of FBR beginning  with basic foundational research goes back to over 20 years of  development to reach the present stage where it is now ready to  test operate the model reactor, "Monjyu," and it has reached the  level to where application is possible.    In order to complete FBR as commercial power reactors, it  would not only have to be economical but would have to be  planned for its utmost safety and reliability. By early 21st  century (about 2020-2030), about the time it is ready for  commercialization, it is going to be necessary to prepare for  the heightening of public acceptance. For this reason, the  construction and operation of demonstration reactors following  "Monjyu" should be advanced faithfully. It is also necessary to  accumulate technology and experience and to perform technical  development and demonstrations leading to application.    For the application of FBRs, at the same time the technical  development of the reactor is being made, the fuel cycle (fuel  production and recycle) should also be studied. It is necessary  to plan improvements for the complete FBR system including the  fuel cycle for its safety and its economy.    Assuming the commercial operation of an FBR application  plant  is possible by early 21st century, in order to make it more  attractive than the prevailing LWR, the following must be  considered: 1) A need exists to establish goals to improve  economical aspects, safety, reliability, operation, maintenance  and repair; 2) For a clear view of the future, a construction of  an application plant design is needed so a generalized direction  can be searched; 3) Technical developments in order to  materialize the above has been put together as a concept.  <H5>  The Goals Toward Application of FBR </H5>   To materialize an FBR plant that would be more attractive  than the existing LWR of the same generation would mean  recognizing the positive aspects of FBR, overcoming necessary  subjects compared to LWR, analyzing the future movements  concerning LWRs, and to identify the views of each of the  established goals. From the above, the economic characteristics  and safety goals toward application was established. The  following are main goals for development.  <H5>  Economy </H5>   1) Compared to LWR, the largest element contributing to the  construction cost would be the nuclear reactor structure,  cooling system and fuel handling system. Considering the above,  the goal is to make use of the sodium system characteristics as  follows:        -  Simplifying the system;    -  Reducing and simplifying  equipment and structures;    -  Integrating equipment and  structures.       2) By putting into practical use the advantages of FBR, the  aim should be to reduce fuel cost and to lower the cost of  generating electricity. It can be done by:        -  Increased combustibility;    -  Creating high temperature  and high heat efficiency in the plant.   <H5>    Safety </H5>   Assuming conditions where many commercial FBRs will be  operating, the goal should be for utmost safety and easily  understandable safety procedures for the public.        -  Core that is highly safe (improvement in the core  characteristics).    -  Safe facilities (passive equipment and system  application) having high reliability.   <H5>    Reliability, Operation, and Maintenance-Repair </H5>   While accepting the advancement and technical developments  made for LWRs, and reflecting on the plant designs,  construction, and operational experiences made by the model and  demonstration reactors, an improvement in reliability,  operation, and maintenance-repair can be gained for the FBRs.    Together with all these goals set for applications of FBRs,  from the viewpoint of making use of the FBR's original  characteristics, it is necessary to advance technical  development and to establish sophistication of the plutonium  utilizing system that includes a total fuel cycle system  containing new type fuel and TRU recycle.  <H5>  The Application Reactor Plant Design </H5>   The application of FBRs can only be accomplished by basing  it  on future outlook of new technological developments, its  applications to plant designs followed by the actual  construction of the plant, operation and repairs etc., and  through the accumulation of demonstrations and experiments.    As an outlook to the future, in order to obtain prospective  of the direction to be taken by technical developments and  financial aspects of the application of FBRs, the formerly  mentioned developmental goals based on economics and safety  aspects have been referred to and the designs of application  reactors (five types of reactors) have been constructed. (The  figures are examples of two reactor designs.)          The following considerations were made in the construction  of  the application reactor design.    1) In regard to the size of power outputs, assuming that a  period for applications when many FBRs would be constructed in  concurrence with large LWRs will come, similar to the LWR, an  economically superior large reactor will be the subject for the  plant design.    The economical aspect will depend on the scale effect which  will depend on the power output size. In addition, it will be  affected by the standardization and module effects which depend  on the number of reactors constructed.    2) Concerning the fuel form, mixed oxide fuel (MOX) which at  this point in time has a record of high experience and  accomplishments together with especially high degree of  technical proficiency would be the object. Of the newer fuels  such as nitrides and metallics, the actual demonstrations will  be for future topics and whether to adapt them will only be  decided from future technical developments.    3) In regard to reactor cores, assuming the conditions that  several commercial FBRs will be built and be in operation, the  object will be to aim for a core that is highly safe and easily  understandable to the public despite the possibility of an  economical impact (improvements to the core characteristics  accompanied by an increase in the diameter of the core).    4) About the economical and safety aspects, a renovative  technology that would contribute largely to its upgrading is  expected, and will be incorporated into the plant design after  consideration of its application possibility and time factor is  made. The evaluation of the economical aspect up to date is to  target a 70&percnt; reduction of nuclear reactor and cooling  system  amount of resources below that of LWR.    In order to construct an improved economical plant design,  the following points have been listed.        -  Integration of equipment by adopting large capacity  electromagnetic immersion pump;    -  Simplification and  standardization of equipment structure by adopting shock proof  technology;    -  Elimination of secondary sodium system  (intermediate heat transfer system).       Results from the summarized evaluation of the construction  of  the plant design are given as follows:    1) In order that FBRs can economically concur with LWRs, it  is believed necessary that the plant construction cost would  have to be kept at approximately 110&percnt; of LWR. FBR plants  have  large scale merits that accompany its capability for large power  output. Furthermore, in contrast to the construction cost of the  original reactor (FOAK cost), by introducing several reactors,  it is anticipated the construction cost (NOAK cost) will be  reduced approximately 20&percnt; due to mastery effects. The  present  demonstration reactor No. 1 consists of large power output of  1.3 million KW and due to the mastery effect gained from  commercial introduction, it has been evaluated to be in the area  of 110&percnt; of LWR.    2) In directing FBR toward application and in order that it  establish the utmost highest goals, the achievement of the  economic aspects of the first reactor concurred with LWR were  investigated and the results were as follows:    (i) In the case of secondary sodium system existing plant,  it  is believed there will be some difference arising in the plant  designs following the advancement in future equipment planning  techniques. However, the evaluation at this point shows there  are no effects from methods used for equipment integration and  it remains almost the same. At any rate, the amount of resources  for the nuclear reactor and the cooling system was about  70&percnt; of  LWR and the construction cost was 97-104&percnt;. It is  anticipated  that the construction cost should be around 80&percnt; after the  introduction of several reactors.    In these application reactor plant designs, in addition to  the techniques adapted in the plans for the already developed  demonstration reactor No. 1, additional improvements in the  reactor core characteristics, equipment integration by large  volume immersion electromagnetic pump, shock proof,  simplification of upper reactor etc. are made using new  technology. Already, concerning these reform techniques, they  have been realized inside and outside of this country, efforts  have begun toward its materialization, and the prospects of  development are good.    Furthermore, the construction cost can be reduced by the  application of FBR's scale merit obtained by enlarging the power  output to 1.5 million KW, or by adapting the twin plant formula  of common usage of the used fuel handling facility which shares  a large portion of the FBR expense.    (ii) For the secondary sodium system elimination plant, it  turns out that the amount of resource for nuclear reactor and  cooling system would be approximately 60&percnt; of LWR and  90&percnt; for  construction cost. The estimate in construction cost would be  around 70&percnt; after introduction of several reactors.    Therefore, even if the three dimensional shock proof and  secondary sodium system elimination techniques were not adapted,  at the present, the renovation technology (equipment integration  through enlarging capacity and using immersion electromagnetic  pump) is the only one that can maintain a clear view of the  developmental period, and possibly approach facing the  accomplishment of the goal set for application of FBRs.</p>

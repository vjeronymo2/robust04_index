			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Russia is in favor of  rigidly observing the appropriate resolutions of the UN Security  Council which have established the regime of trade and economic  sanctions against Iraq. However, the same resolutions allow  supplies of goods and produce to Iraq in the form of  humanitarian aid, provided permission exists from the Security  Council committee for sanctions, said Grigoriy Karasin, director  of the information and press department of the Russian  Federation Foreign Ministry, speaking at a briefing today.    In this connection he said that the Russian side is  seriously  concerned over a number of Russia's humanitarian requests which  are now going through the UN Security Council committee for  sanctions. In particular, for several years now the Committee  has been blocking Russia's request to supply Iraq with equipment  in order to continue the construction of Iraq's "Yusufiyah"  thermal electric power station .    "We have always believed that the purpose of our project is  solely humanitarian. On no account does it contradict the well  known resolutions of the UN Security Council, particularly  considering that the special missions of the UN which at one  time visited Iraq attributed the restoration and the  construction of the power station in that country to  humanitarian needs," he said.</p>

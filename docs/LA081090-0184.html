			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STEINBRENNER WANTS TO REVISE SANCTIONS;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: COMMISSIONER VINCENT INDICATES HIS ANGER AT THE POSITION AND SAYS HE  WON'T CHANGE ANY PART OF THEIR AGREEMENT.  </P> <P> George Steinbrenner wants a revision of some aspects of Commissioner Fay  Vincent's sanctions. Steinbrenner believes the written agreement does not match  the one he agreed to with Vincent in the commissioner's office July 30,  according to two sources in Steinbrenner's camp.  </P> <P> But Vincent indicated Thursday night that he is angered by Steinbrenner's  posturing and that he will not alter any portion of their agreement.  </P> <P> "I will adhere to the agreement," Vincent said. "The agreement between Mr.  Steinbrenner and myself stands. That is what I intend. I am absolutely against  redoing the agreement. And it seems to me they are looking for a major  renegotiation. I will not do that."  </P> <P> Steinbrenner has moved for a restructuring of the agreement's language because,  among other things, he has apparently been stunned in recent days by the  prospect that his son Hank may not receive enough support from the 25 other  major-league owners to be approved as his successor as Yankees general partner.  In that case, controlling interest of the franchise would fall out of the  Steinbrenner family.  </P> <P> "George thought he was willing to step down to a limited partner only if his  son would (automatically) replace him," Vincent said. "That is not the case."  </P> <P> Indeed, though Vincent said he would approve of Hank Steinbrenner, the  agreement says the Yankees' choice to replace George as general partner is  "subject to the subsequent approval of the major-league clubs." Steinbrenner  signed that document.  </P> <P> Vincent indicated that Steinbrenner is also trying to redo the sanctions as  they pertain to:  </P> <P> * Reinstatement. Persons placed on the permanently ineligible list, such as  Pete Rose, may apply for reinstatement one year after being placed on that  list. But the Steinbrenner agreement says the owner "will be treated, for all  purposes, as if he were on the ineligible list although he will not actually be  placed on" that list. Steinbrenner thought he could apply for reinstatement,  but because he is not on the ineligible list, Vincent said, there is no  provision for that action.  </P> <P> * His attendance at major-league games. Vincent banned Steinbrenner from  major-league parks and spring-training facilities, though Steinbrenner can  purchase a ticket or seek written approval from Vincent. Steinbrenner, Vincent  indicated, is seeking to rework that sanction, too.  </P> <P> * Tax consequences. Steinbrenner has tried to include language that his lawyers  claim would protect him against unintended tax burdens as a result of his  switch to being a limited partner. Vincent sees no basis for that argument.  </P> <P> Steinbrenner became subject to the sanctions because the commissioner  determined that he had paid gambler Howard Spira to furnish information on  ex-Yankee Dave Winfield, who was embroiled in a dispute with Steinbrenner over  his Winfield Foundation.  </P> <P> Vincent already has warned Steinbrenner once that he should not test the  agreement.  </P></p>

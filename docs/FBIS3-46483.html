An estimated  300-strong group of guerrillas attacked Rumchang in the Ampil  district bordering Thailand early New Year's day, military  officials said. The Khmer Rouge withdrew after several hours,  the officials said, adding the government had sent  reinforcements to the area.    The attack took place as government troops were conducting  an  offensive on Khmer Rouge positions further west, near the border  town of Poipet.    Fighting had died down in the Poipet area Monday, but the  situation remained tense after three days of battles between the  government and the guerrillas, Thai army officials said.    Prior to the May U.N.-organised elections which brought  FUNCINPEC into a coalition government with their former Phnom  Penh foe, the Cambodian People's Party, Rumchang served as a  base for royalist troops and current co-premier Prince Norodom  Ranariddh maintained a residence in the area.    The prince's former residence was not burnt in the attack, a  government official said.    FUNCINPEC was in alliance with the Khmer Rouge throughout  the  13- year civil war which was brought to a formal end by the  signing of the Paris peace agreement in October 1991.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Observer: Sailing by Former chief government whip Timothy Renton mucks around in boats in his spare time, according to his Who's Who entry, so it is perhaps no surprise that he should appear at ease yesterday fielding questions about sundry vessels in front of the Scott inquiry. When at the foreign office in the mid-1980s, Renton fought a spirited battle with the DTI and the Ministry of Defence to prevent export licences being granted for inflatable dinghies bound for Iran, when similar craft were already being sent to Iraq. According to Renton yesterday, what took up a great deal of Whitehall time was arguments over whether a boat of approximately 20 ft in length could be construed as having military applications. Whatever the judge thought of Renton's performance, the loyalty of one member of the public was assured. The souvenir-hunting Mrs Renton was heard to ask assembled TV artists whether they might make available to her their drawings of the event.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vice Premier Boris Fedorov has still not received an  official answer to his rejection to occupy the post of Finance  Minister in Russia's new government.    In his interview with INTERFAX, Fedorov reaffirmed that the  day before, on Tuesday, he forwarded a letter to President Boris  Yeltsin in which he called the proposal to head the Finance  Ministry as "unacceptable."    He also reported that he disagrees with the turn in economic  policy which has become quite obvious. Fedorov is against  Aleksandr Zaveryukha occupying the post of vice premier and  Viktor Gerashchenko the post of the Central Bank of Russia's  chairman.    The letter also contains several other explanations  regarding  his refusal about which Fedorov decided not to inform "for the  time being."    On Tuesday neither the prime minister nor the president gave  their answers to this letter. At the same time, Fedorov  underlined that he had not presented any letter regarding his  resignation.    Sources close to Fedorov believe that the final issue on his  participation or non-participation in the government has not  been solved yet.    Nevertheless, a well-informed source in the Russian  Government reported to INTERFAX on Tuesday that Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin made a decision not to include Fedorov in  the composition of Russia's re-organized government as Finance  Minister "according to Fedorov's provisions."    This source asserts that President Yeltsin shares this  opinion.    On Tuesday during their working meeting in the Kremlin,  Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin did not sign any decree on the  composition of the reorganized government.</p>

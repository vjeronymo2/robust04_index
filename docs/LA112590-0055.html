			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL FORECAST;  </P> <P> TOWARD THE YEAR 2000: WILL WE BREATHE CLEANER AIR?  </P> <P> Will tough new anti-pollution regulations really make Southern California air  quality better by the year 2000? How will the changes affect you personally?  </P> <P> Mary D. Nichols, senior attorney, Natural Resources Defense Council:  </P> <P> I think it is quite certain that we will have fewer days when we violate the  first-stage emergency episode level. Perhaps we might even be at a point where  we don't have any episodes because of an enormous effort on the part of many  different industries and the consuming public to use cleaner technology than  the ones currently in use: the turnover of our automotive fleet, beginning the  successful introduction of electric cars or extremely low-polluting,  alternative-fueled vehicles.  </P> <P> We will see shifting of some polluting businesses to electricity, from those  that currently burn fossil fuels. More of our electricity will be generated  outside the basin with clean-burning and renewable fuels, including solar and  geothermal. I think we will have a goodly amount of energy conservation in  effect, which will reduce the overall demand for electric power.  </P> <P> By the year 2000 there will be a few million more of us here. We are beginning  to see some serious efforts made on the part of local planning and  transportation planning to cope with that growth in a way that promotes infill  instead of sprawl, and that can be serviced by mass transit, which is a much  more energy-efficient and less-polluting way of getting around.  </P> <P> Personally, I will be able to tell my grandchildren that I was part of the  process that made it all happen -- tell them stories about how much worse it  used to be when I was young.  </P> <P> Dan Garcia, Los Angeles attorney, member of the city's Police Commission and  former president of the Los Angeles City Planning Commission:  </P> <P> I think the air quality will be somewhat better. We still have -- and have had  for some time -- the strictest controls on stationary sources of pollution in  the world. With new regulations being issued practically every day as to  manufacturing and other sources of pollution, those levels will be diminished  even further.  </P> <P> The bottom line is that there is an open question as to whether the burdens of  achieving air quality have been fairly distributed. It seems apparent, at least  to the extent that you can single out air quality -- and this is hard -- as  being a major contributing factor to the diminution of manufacturing jobs,  those jobs are held disproportionately by minorities. If you are looking at  increased costs for utilities, that is a regressive sort of tax.  </P> <P> Miriam Levon, senior consultant in environmental sciences, ARCO:  </P> <P> With the new car technology, the air is going to get significantly better  because the new cars are better able to handle the emissions. . . .  </P> <P> The one biggest source for reducing emissions is the automobile, and the  California Clean Air Act recognized this. This is why the major provision for  transportation control measures (van pools, car pools, other public  transportation) are now required for every company that employs more than 100  people. Such rules (help) to make people aware that they will directly  contribute to reducing smog by increasing the occupancy of vehicles on the  road.  </P> <P> Personally, I commute about 40 miles a day to work, so that will help me as far  as just the daily routine on the road. There are going to be less cars on the  road. ARCO has had this (van-pooling and ride-sharing) program in effect for  close to 20 years now. I participate in a van pool.  </P> <P> John Mack, president of the Urban League:  </P> <P> There are some competing and conflicting agendas here. . . . On the one end of  the spectrum . . . environmentalists are rightly upset and exercised by the  terrible condition of the environment. (But) I think some of the approaches  have been so sweeping and so severe that they part company with business.  </P> <P> I have been hearing recently from small, minority businesses that want to  comply with the regulations that people are throwing at them, but frankly, it  would put them out of business.  </P> <P> Clearly, cleaner air will have an impact on me personally as a resident. The  Urban League will get increasingly concerned with some of the issues that our  constituency faces. We have such a dearth of businesses and we certainly want  to see the few that we have survive -- not only survive, but survive properly.  </P> <P> I think it is important that we begin to have communication across sectors  among the various, sometimes competing interests.  </P> <P> Paul Ong, associate professor of urban planning, UCLA School of Architecture  and Urban Planning:  </P> <P> There is no doubt in my mind that, over all, the quality will improve. We do  know that as we start tightening down on manufacturing, it will lead to some  job losses, and it will also, obviously, lead to the creation of other jobs --  particularly jobs that supply equipment to control emissions better .  </P> <P> Unfortunately, we also know that the group that is displaced is not the same  group that is going to get employed. . . . We do know that women and minorities  tend to be displaced at a higher rate. They lose their jobs at a higher rate;  they tend to be unemployed for a longer time, and when they do find new  employment they tend to suffer much larger losses in earnings than other  groups.  </P> <P> We don't have in place an employment policy to match our environmental policy.  </P> <P> Lamont Hempel, assistant professor and associate director of the Center for  Politics and Policy, Claremont Graduate School:  </P> <P> My guess is that it will be cleaner in the year 2000, but will it be cleaner in  the year 2010? There is a race between the increase in vehicles and the  increase of environmental control measures.  </P> <P> We have learned that environmental regulation is a sometimes thing. We can  expect reversals. We can expect some backlash. . . . .  </P> <P> I think I am going to own an electric vehicle in the year 2000. I will be using  telecommuting for some of my business travel, and I will just use electronic  mail for things that would have involved a trip with my car in past years. It  will probably affect my mental health if only visibility is improved. I am  going to enjoy the aesthetics of living in Los Angeles now a lot more than I do  today.  </P> <P> By the year 2000, I am going to be more concerned about the things I can't see:  toxins in the air. And I am going to be more concerned about the things that I  can't control as a resident of the Los Angeles area -- which means  trans-boundary environmental pollution (greenhouse effects, carbon-dioxide  emissions), things that the Air Quality Management District can only control  locally without having any appreciable affect on the planet's atmosphere. I  suspect that as our technology to detect what is in the air improves, we are  going to find new things to worry about.  </P></p>

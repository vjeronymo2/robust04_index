			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. SCHOOL BOARD HIKES WAGE OFFER TO TEACHERS 1.5%  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Board of Education on Monday announced that it was increasing  its three-year wage offer to teachers to 21.5%, an increase of 1.5%. But the  head of United Teachers-Los Angeles said the new offer was unacceptable,  leaving the Los Angeles Unified School District on course toward a May 30  strike.  </P> <P> In a hastily called press conference at board headquarters downtown, board  President Roberta Weintraub said the district will raise its offer of a 4%  increase next year to 5.5.% because of unexpected state revenues and lottery  profits.  </P> <P> The board's last offer -- 8% this year, 4% in 1990 and 8% in 1991 -- provided  that 60% of any new money that becomes available be added the the second year's  raise up to a maximum of 8%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extra Money  </P> <P> School officials determined Monday that the district will receive an extra $10  million to $12 million from the lottery. In addition, on Friday, the district  learned that its share of a $660-million state income tax surplus could be as  much as $33 million.  </P> <P> But district officials said they are not sure how much of the money can be used  for teachers' salaries because the state may earmark the money for specific  goals, such as reducing class size.  </P> <P> The district estimated that about $16 million of the surplus would be  unrestricted, and 60% of that amount is about $10 million. Sixty percent of the  $12 million in lottery funds would bring the total for teachers' salaries to  about $17 million.  </P> <P> The revised offer shows that "this board honors its commitments," Weintraub  said.  </P> <P> "We're not doing this in anticipation that it will avoid (a strike). We're  doing it because it is what we said we were going to do," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Labor Dispute  </P> <P> However, union President Wayne Johnson said the new offer was insufficient to  settle the yearlong labor dispute.  </P> <P> "I think it is grandstanding on the part of the board . . . It's an attempt to  formulate public opinion against teachers," he said. "We want that money  applied to this year's offer."  </P> <P> The union wants a 21% raise over two years -- 11% this year and 10% in 1990.  But Johnson has said that a 10% raise this year, combined with concession on  certain non-monetary issues, could be sufficient to head off a strike.  </P> <P> The board was divided 4 to 3 on the district's earlier offer of 20% over three  years, as well as on Monday's revision. The district maintains that $80 million  in budget cuts are needed to pay for the 20% wage package.  </P> <P> Board members Leticia Quezada, Rita Walters and Alan Gershman have largely  opposed making such deep cuts in other areas to pay higher teacher salaries.  The union says the district has surpluses in several accounts that could be  re-allocated for teacher raises.  </P> <P> The union voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike on May 30, which is about  three weeks before the end of the school year. The district and union officials  agree that a strike could disrupt graduation ceremonies, promotions and other  year-end activities.  </P> <P> The union says it will not report final grades to the district if there is a  strike but will give copies to students to take home. Teachers normally report  final grades to district offices.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "PSP, 39.4 Percent; PSD, 26.2 </F> Percent; CDU, 9 Percent; CDS, 7.4 Percent"]    [Text] The PSP [Portuguese Socialist Party] has a  comfortable 13-percent lead over the PSD [Social Democratic  Party] three weeks from the holding of the elections to the  European Parliament, according to a major EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao  opinion poll with 1,051 interviews in mainland Portugal,  conducted by the ballot box method between 11 and 18 May.    With 39.4 percent of voting intentions for Antonio  Vitorino's  list, 26.2 percent for Eurico de Melo's list, and just 10.8  percent undecided, it could be said that right now the PSP is  virtually assured of victory 12 June, its scale remaining to be  seen. It is an election triumph that, if confirmed, will follow  the Socialist victory in last December's local elections,  placing the PSP in an advantageous starting position for next  year's legislative elections. And it should be emphasized that  the poll was conducted on the days when the disagreements  between Belem Palace and Rato Square [PSP headquarters] over the  "Portugal, what future?" congress had their greatest coverage in  the news media.    On the other hand, the PSD's prospects are not encouraging.  Reduced to 26.2 percent (almost the hard core of the PSD vote),  Cavaco's party is in danger of a second consecutive election  defeat, and this time with a humiliating difference from  Guterres' party. Moreover, let it be recalled that the PSD won  the European elections in 1989 with 32.8 percent against 28.5  percent for the PSP, 14.4 percent for the CDU [Unitary  Democratic Coalition], and 14.2 percent for the CDS [Social  Democratic Center Party].    And if the CDU, with 9 percent in this poll, does not  diverge  from its result in the last legislative elections, the 7.4  percent for Manuel Monteiro's party threatens not to come up to  the expectations aroused in the CDS and to leave its leader  short of the result achieved by Lucas Pires five years ago.    As regards the small parties, the poll gives the following  figures: Portuguese Workers Communist Party/Movement for the  Reorganization of the Proletariat Party (1.7 percent),  Democratic Renewal Party (0.6 percent), MPT [expansion unknown]  (0.5 percent), PSN [Socialist Party of Navarre] (0.5 percent),  Revolutionary Socialist Party (0.4 percent), Popular Democratic  Union (0.4 percent), PDA [expansion unknown] (0.3 percent),  Policy XXI (0.2 percent), and Popular Monarchist Party (0.1  percent). The poll was stratified in terms of region and  habitat, and the quota method was used with an age/sex/education  matrix. The margin of error is plus or minus 3 percent for a  degree of probability of 95 percent.</p>

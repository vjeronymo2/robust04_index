			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: GM Europe net profit declines 30% to Dollars 1.2bn THE net profit of the European operations of General Motors, the world's largest vehicle maker, fell last year by 30.4 per cent to Dollars 1.228bn from Dollars 1.76bn in 1991 and a record Dollars 1.92bn in 1990. Despite the decline, GM Europe - Opel in continental Europe and Vauxhall in the UK - remained one of the most profitable of the big six volume car makers in 1992. Its performance in Europe was in sharp contrast to its rival Ford, which disclosed earlier this week a record Dollars 1.3bn loss on its European automotive operations, including Jaguar. GM's European profits provided a partial cushion for the continuing heavy losses suffered by the group's North American automotive operations. The net profit of Dollars 1.2bn in Europe was also achieved after taking account of GM's 50 per cent share of the continuing losses of Saab Automobile, where the US group has management control. The Swedish carmaker is expected to announce later this month a loss of more than SKr2bn (Dollars 270m) for 1992. GM also suffered continuing losses in Europe last year at Group Lotus, the UK specialist sports car maker and automotive engineering consultancy, and it incurred losses through the restructuring of the European subsidiary of GM Hughes Electronics. Within its core Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations GM added significantly to its fixed costs in 1992 with the opening of several new plants, including a DM1bn (Dollars 625m) car assembly plant at Eisenach in eastern Germany and a Pounds 190m (Dollars 266m) V6 engine plant at Ellesmere Port in the UK. The 1992 financial performance was also burdened by part of the start-up costs for the new generation Opel/Vauxhall Corsa small car at GM's plant at Zaragoza, Spain, as well as by a deterioration in the mix of its product sales with a shift to a larger share of small cars in southern Europe and lower sales in Germany. The group's Opel/Vauxhall operations achieved a record sales volume of 1.61m cars in west Europe last year, up from 1.55m in 1991, with a best-ever market share of 12 per cent, an increase from 11.6 per cent in 1991. Car production rose by 5.7 per cent to 1,700,053 from 1,607,629 a year earlier. GM's turnover in Europe rose by 13.7 per cent to Dollars 28.8bn from Dollars 25.4bn a year earlier.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Big rise seen for US sales in Mexican energy market THE North American Free Trade Agreement will boost US sales in Mexico's energy market, Mr John Easton, US assistant secretary for domestic and international energy policy, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. Energy sales by US companies in Mexico at present topped Dollars 1bn out of a total market of Dollars 8bn, and 'we see a further increase there'. Mexico's decision to open 50 per cent of procurement by Pemex, the giant state-owned oil company which buys Dollars 5bn worth of goods a year would also boost US sales. Further, US investment in Mexico was expected to rise sharply in the wake of the agreement, which will open a significant part of Mexico's energy market to unlimited foreign investment, Mr Easton added. Some big US companies had already expressed interest in setting up independent power projects in Mexico.</p>

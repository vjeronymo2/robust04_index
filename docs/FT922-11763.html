			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Sharp decline at Dow Chemical DOW CHEMICAL, the US chemicals group, yesterday turned in a 32 per cent decline in first-quarter operating income to Dollars 531m, reflecting sharply lower prices in 1992. Dow's net income for the first three months of this year fell to Dollars 171m or 62 cents a share, from Dollars 578m or Dollars 2.13 the previous year. Last year's results include the benefits of a one-time gain from an initial public offering of stock in Destec Energy, and higher prices linked to the Gulf war. Sales in the latest quarter slid 6 per cent to Dollars 4.64bn from Dollars 4.95bn. The results continue to reflect the weak state of the US chemicals industry. Dow's earnings have fallen steadily since 1989 when it turned in record profits of Dollars 2.49bn or Dollars 9.20 a share. Mr Frank Popoff, president and chief executive, said comparisons with last year were very difficult 'because of the rapid escalation of prices during the Gulf war. 'The good news is that pricing has become relatively stable over the past six months, feedstock costs have declined and we have probably reached the bottom of the economic cycle in the US.' Dow's chemical and performance products division saw a 56 per cent drop in first-quarter operating income to Dollars 95m, although product sales fell only 9 per cent to Dollars 1.1bn. Dow said that the decline was led by chlorinated solvents and softer demand for caustic soda, although vinyl chloride showed signs of volume recovery. The group's plastic products division also suffered a 56 per cent decline in operating income to Dollars 95m on a 10 per cent fall in sales to Dollars 1.6bn. Dow's hydrocarbons and energy business posted an operating loss of Dollars 30m, compared with operating income of Dollars 24m, while sales fell 30 per cent to Dollars 385m. The company's consumer specialties division - which brought in more than half of Dow's total operating income of Dollars 1.7bn in 1991 - had first-quarter operating income of Dollars 342m, up 17 per cent from the previous year. Sales rose 9 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn. Mr Popoff said that the company remained optimistic it would have 'positive earnings momentum during the second half of 1992', although the chemical industry tends to lag any upward economic movement by as much as six months.</p>

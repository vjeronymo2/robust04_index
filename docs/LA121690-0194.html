			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROOKS BECOMES ODD MAN OUT, IS DEALT FOR OJEDA;  </P> <P> DODGERS: TRADE, COMBINED WITH SIGNING OF FREE AGENT BUTLER, SOLIDIFIES THE  OUTFIELD SITUATION AND PROVIDES A LEFT-HANDED PITCHER.  </P> <P> One of the Dodgers' most popular players became a surprising victim of their  outfield crunch Saturday when Hubie Brooks was traded to the New York Mets for  left-handed pitcher Bob Ojeda and pitching prospect Greg Hansell.  </P> <P> The trade was completed almost exactly 24 hours after the Dodgers acquired free  agent center fielder Brett Butler. That agreement enabled Darryl Strawberry to  move to right field, essentially forcing the Dodgers to either trade right  fielder Brooks or move him to left field and trade Kal Daniels.  </P> <P> Many players thought Daniels, 27, would be traded because he is seven years  younger that Brooks and has a higher market value. And many players, admiring  Brooks' quiet leadership and clutch hitting, hoped he would stay.  </P> <P> "Hubie didn't have one enemy -- Hubie was one of our cornerstones," outfielder  Chris Gwynn said.  </P> <P> Fred Claire, the Dodger vice president who did not flinch last season when  trading team leader Willie Randolph during a losing streak, might have ignored  chemistry again.  </P> <P> "Yes, I am concerned about chemistry, but we now have a ballclub that should  produce victories . . . and victories produce chemistry," Claire said.  </P> <P> Claire is counting on Ojeda as the only left-hander in a starting rotation that  includes Ramon Martinez, Tim Belcher, Kevin Gross and Orel Hershiser when he is  sound.  </P> <P> This rotation could also include Fernando Valenzuela if he accepts the club's  offer for a one-year arbitrated contract. But Valenzuela, meeting with advisers  this weekend, might feel squeezed out by Ojeda and refuse the Dodgers' offer.  </P> <P> Yet Valenzuela could surprise the Dodgers, as did Juan Samuel by accepting a  similar offer Saturday morning. Samuel will compete for the second base job  this spring.  </P> <P> "If Fernando comes back, that will please us . . . it will give us a pitching  surplus, and we will use that surplus," Claire said.  </P> <P> Statistically, Ojeda is a suitable replacement. In parts of 11 major league  seasons, mostly as a starter, he is 95-79 with a 3.65 earned-run average.  </P> <P> Last season, after being left out of a crowded Met rotation, Ojeda was 7-6 with  a 3.66 ERA in 38 games, including 12 starts. He held left-handed batters to a  .168 average.  </P> <P> "I feel like a big kid being back home," said Ojeda, a Los Angeles native, in a  conference call Saturday night.  </P> <P> "I grew up like everybody down there, watching Vin Scully and the Farmer John  Hot Dog."  </P> <P> Tom Lasorda, Dodger manager, announced on the call that Ojeda would no longer  be in the bullpen.  </P> <P> "That is music to my ears, Tommy," said Ojeda, who will turn 33 next week. "You  are the maestro down there. I am looking forward to this year like I've looked  forward to no other year."  </P> <P> He added: "The bullpen, I don't like it. I'm not ready for it. When I'm 37,  I'll be ready for it. I have proved, when I get a chance, I can still pitch."  </P> <P> Lasorda said that Ojeda completes the Dodgers 1991 team, even if the roster  doesn't include a veteran left-handed relief pitcher. Their only veteran in  that area, Ray Searage, was released Friday to make room for Butler.  </P> <P> "I can get around that -- we have Dennis Cook and David Walsh, we'll be fine  there," Lasorda said, later adding, "I'm very happy with this ballclub with the  way it is set. If the season started tomorrow, we'd be ready to go.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you this much, a lot of pitchers who pitch against this club, the  night before they go to sleep, they are going to be doing a lot of tossing and  turning."  </P> <P> One problem for the Dodgers is that most of those pitchers will be left-handed.  Because they traded Brooks instead of Daniels, four of the Dodgers' top five  power hitters will bat left-handed. This includes Strawberry, Butler, Daniels  and Mike Scioscia. Only switch-hitting Eddie Murray will keep left-handed  pitchers honest.  </P> <P> "Yes, I'll admit, we are overbalanced in that area," Lasorda said.  </P> <P> The Dodgers will miss Brooks in other ways, and not only because he was third  on the team with 20 home runs and 91 runs batted in.  </P> <P> "Hubie was one of the three or four people Tommy could always count on," Gwynn  said.  </P> <P> "He brought this team stability."  </P> <P> And Brooks will miss the Dodgers. The Southland native believed he had returned  home for good last winter when he signed a three-year contract as a free agent  from Montreal.  </P> <P> When Brooks was told about the acquisition of Butler late Friday, he reacted  with dismay.  </P> <P> "It does look like I've lost a job," Brooks said at the time. "I can't believe  it. I do feel like the odd man out. What are they going to do?"  </P> <P> Gwynn said Brooks, who could not be reached late Saturday, phoned him  immediately after the trade.  </P> <P> "Hubie was shocked," Gwynn said. "You could tell he was really disappointed."  </P> <P> Said Claire: "I loved Hubie. Trading him was one of most difficult things I  ever have had to do."  </P> <P> At least one Dodger was understandably happy about the move.  </P> <P> "I just got home to spend Christmas with my family, and this is one great  present," Daniels said late Saturday from his Warner Robins, Ga., home.  </P> <P> "I feel bad for Hubie, and I thought I would be the one traded because my trade  value was higher, but I am glad they didn't choose me.  </P> <P> "I am really happy to stay in Los Angeles. It looks like our puzzle is all  coming together. We are looking like a championship team."  </P> <P> Greg Hansell, the other Met acquired in the Brooks trade, is a former  12th-round draft pick from La Palma Kennedy High in Orange County. He is a  right-hander who spent last season in Class A. He was 7-10 with a 3.60 ERA for  Winter Haven, Fla., of the Boston Red Sox's organization, then was traded to  the Mets and went 2-4 with a 2.61 ERA for St. Lucie, Fla.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> The Dodgers finally announced that they had agreed to terms with Brett Butler  at 8 a.m. Saturday, 12 hours after Butler had confirmed it. Fred Claire, Dodger  vice president, did not announce it sooner because he had promised Dick Moss,  Butler's agent, that he would give Moss time to contact the two other teams  bidding for Butler's services, Atlanta and Boston. Lou Gorman, Boston general  manager, did not return home until late Friday, and was not contacted until  Saturday morning. Butler was given a $1-million signing bonus with a  $2.5-million salary next season, $3 million in 1992, $3 million in 1993, and a  $3-million option in 1994 with a $500,000 buyout.  </P></p>

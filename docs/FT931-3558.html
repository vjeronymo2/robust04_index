			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / People: EBRD picks chief economist Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has hired a heavy hitter as chief economist to replace John Flemming, who leaves in September to become warden of Wadham College, Oxford. Michael Bruno (right), governor of the Bank of Israel between 1986 and 1991, will take over in October. He was approached indirectly by the EBRD about six months ago and opted for the London-based bank after turning down an offer to be chief economist at the World Bank in Washington. Bruno is currently Melchior Professor of International Economic Policy at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and president of the International Economic Association. At 60, Bruno is no stranger to the problems of radical economic change and has been willing in the past to take a tough line with politicians. He was one of the architects of a successful Israeli economic recovery programme in the mid-1980s and later, as bank governor, had to cope with the economic strains caused by mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. Bruno has advised Mexico, the former Yugoslavia and Poland on economic reform and wrote a book on stabilisation and reform while he was a visiting professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At the Israeli central bank, he was often embroiled in controversy with the Likud-led government. In 1989 he took the brave step of urging cuts in the Israeli defence budget to curb increases in government borrowing. Such policy-making experience will be invaluable in his dealings with the new democracies of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet republics as well as with the Byzantine bureaucracy of the EBRD itself.</p>

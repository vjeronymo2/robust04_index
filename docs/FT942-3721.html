			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Cuba close to telecoms sale Grupo Domos, a Mexico-based holding company, is close to finalising a deal to buy 49 per cent of Emtelcuba, Cuba's telephone monopoly, for about Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn). This would be Cuba's first important privatisation since the 1959 revolution and would be in the context of rapidly growing business between Mexico and Cuba. The deal is likely to include a concession to operate the telephone system in Cuba and an ambitious modernisation plan. The length of the concession and its price are still being negotiated. Company officials said the deal was being discussed yesterday during a one-day visit to Havana by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico. He is being accompanied on his trip by Mr Javier Garza Calderon, leader of Grupo Domos and a member of the wealthy Garza family of Monterrey in Mexico, which has interests in such industrial giants as Visa, Femsa and Bancomer. Mr Garza Calderon was a bidder for Telmex when the Mexican government privatised its telephone monopoly in 1990. He did not win on that occasion but has maintained his group's interest in telecommunications, until recently operating cellular-phone services in northern Mexico. The Cuban telephone system that Domos would purchase is even more antiquated that the Mexican network it once tried to buy. Fewer than five in every 100 people in Cuba have telephone lines and as many as half of those lines are not functioning at any one time. However, Domos is betting that negotiations between Cuban and US officials will open a lucrative long-distance calls market between the two countries beyond the current limit of 300 calls per day. Even with the limit, those and other international calls generate hard-currency income of an estimated Dollars 2m per month for Cuban Telecommunications. Other Mexican companies are operating in Cuba, in tourism, textiles, cement, cellular-phones and oil exploration, among other areas.</p>

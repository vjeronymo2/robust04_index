			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIXON'S VISIT TO CAPITOL HILL  </P> <P> Once again, ad nauseam, Nixon is being "rehabilitated" by his nostalgic  admirers and a bemused press. Conrad, as usual, is right on target in  satirizing this latest resurrection of our disgraced ex-President.  </P> <P> What puzzles me, as a retired Foreign Service officer, is Nixon's reputation as  a foreign policy guru, which rests largely on the puffery that surrounded his  not-so-surprising restoration of relations with China. Otherwise, he has been  associated with some notable fiascoes.  </P> <P> As President Eisenhower's reputed expert on Southeast Asia, our then-vice  president pushed for us to replace the French when they were forced out of  Vietnam by the 1954 debacle of Dien Bien Phu, while he ignored any possible  understanding with Hanoi.  </P> <P> Later, his decision to bomb Cambodia appears to have been part of a sequence of  disasters that led to the genocidal scourge of Pol Pot. Was the slaughter of  millions of Cambodians part of his "peace with honor"?  </P> <P> On Iran, did Nixon foresee that our overthrow of Premier Mohammed Mossadegh in  1953 might eventually lead to the fanatical revolution of 1979? What led him,  as President, to believe that the vain, mercurial shah could be our effective  surrogate in maintaining peace in that troubled area?  </P> <P> Has Nixon ever regretted our 1954 ouster of the leftist Arbenz government of  Guatemala, which led to a series of brutal military dictatorships and to the  loss of more than 100,000 lives?  </P> <P> The same deviousness and amorality that entangled Nixon in Watergate  characterized his foreign policy maneuvers. By using his national security  adviser, Henry Kissinger, as de facto secretary of state, he was able to avoid  Congress' traditional scrutiny of cabinet members. This finally led him to use  the NSC for action purposes, as in the CIA's apparently successful overthrow of  Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973, which almost certainly became the  precedent for the supreme folly of Irangate.  </P> <P> This institutional perversion persists, with President Bush frequently relying  on his NSC staff to perform missions that should logically fall to our resident  ambassadors or to the secretary of state and his deputies.  </P> <P> MARSHALL PHILLIPS  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

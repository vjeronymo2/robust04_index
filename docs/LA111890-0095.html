			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOULD AMERICANS BE HAPPIER IF THEY WERE HIRELINGS?;  </P> <P> PACIFIC PARAMETERS  </P> <P> JAPAN  </P> <P> If Japan pays the total cost (of keeping the U.S. military in the Persian  Gulf), the American troops will become Japan's hirelings. Would they be happy  with that?"  </P> <P>  -- Takashi Osumi, a banker, in a man-on-the-street interview with the Japan  Economic Journal  </P> <P> "(Japan's proposed peacekeeping force) won't be taking bazookas to the gulf  area. Just pistols. Even my bodyguards carry pistols."  </P> <P>  -- Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu  </P> <P> "They should call (Japan's proposed peacekeeping force) the U.N. Murder Forces.  Peace has nothing to do with it."  </P> <P>  -- Atsuo Nakamura, actor  </P> <P> "The strength of Americans is that the word 'class' has never been part of  their vocabulary. But looking at present American society, this superpower is  vexed by complex social frictions -- inequalities between rich and poor and  between whites and minorities, and in taxation among them.  </P> <P> To regain its past glory, the United States must confront the same kinds of  Third World issues it finds within itself. By doing so, Washington's proper  approach to developing nations would undoubtedly be advanced."  </P> <P>  -- Asahi Shimbun editorial  </P> <P> "No matter how hot this issue gets in Washington, it is sure to have a cool  reception in Tokyo. (Pat) Choate's blustering in ('Agents of Influence') can be  parried with a simple, 'After all, it's Washington's problem, not Japan's  fault.'  </P> <P> "If trade problems could be solved by reasonable country-to-country  negotiations without spending a cent, there would be no need for Japanese  companies to resort to mercenary tactics."  </P> <P>  -- Taro Kimura, journalist, in Asahi Shimbun  </P> <P> CHINA  </P> <P> "The U.S. forces . . . still stationed in South Korea should pull out as  quickly as possible to let the Korean people settle the problem of peaceful  reunification of the fatherland free from any external interference."  </P> <P>  -- People's Daily editorial  </P> <P> "The (main) cause behind the (prolonged U.S. budget) debate was that the  financial and budget policies -- of 'robbing the poor to help the rich' --  carried out by the Republican Administration . . . naturally made large  segments of the population dissatisfied."  </P> <P> New China News Agency  </P> <P> "One of the reasons for (Americans') general indifference to (voting) can be  attributed to the failure of a real freedom of choice. . . . At the moment,  many voters have launched campaigns to prevent politicians from being elected  -- some states have voted for a ceiling (on their terms). Although these  measures are far from eliminating age-old malpractice in the American  bureaucracy, they are a vivid reflection of the strong discontent felt by the  American electorate with the political status quo."  </P> <P> New China News Agency  </P> <P> "If the United States cancels (its most-favored-nation) treatment of China, it  will surely harm its strategic interests around the world, in the Asian and  Pacific region in particular."  </P> <P> New China News Agency  </P> <P> SOUTH KOREA  </P> <P> "The complaint filed by the American Chamber of Commerce here against the  government's campaign to discourage excessive spending on luxury goods once  again shows a failure to understand the Korean situation . . . . In Korean  society, where Confucian moral value is upheld, excessive spending on luxury  goods . . . is regarded as a vice, regardless of one's economic situation . . .  . Under this circumstance, what can justify excessive imports of luxury goods?"  </P> <P>  -- Chosun Daily editorial  </P> <P> THAILAND  </P> <P> "The Palestinian plight, the denial of human rights, the oppression of an  innocent, defenseless people are infinitely more revolting, more perilous for  world peace than anything Saddam Hussein has perpetrated so far or could  possibly perpetrate."  </P> <P>  -- Letter to the Bangkok Post  </P> <P> SINGAPORE  </P> <P> "I think (gold-member credit cards) are particularly popular among the Chinese  because there is a significance attached to the color gold. There is a general  perception that gold-card holders are a class above the rest. Americans and  Europeans are less concerned about the rat race and the emphasis to do well."  </P> <P>  -- Government official quoted in The Straits Times  </P> <P> HONG KONG  </P> <P> "The Marlboro cowboy is so firmly entrenched (in Asia) as an advertising icon  that Philip Morris can get its message across by simply playing the Marlboro  theme song or flashing an image of the cowboy seared beside a campfire -- no  name, no sales pitch."  </P> <P>  -- Asian Business magazine  </P></p>

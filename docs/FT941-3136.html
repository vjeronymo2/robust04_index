			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Domnick Hunter priced at Pounds 65m following share placing Shares in Domnick Hunter Group, which makes filters for compressed air and liquids, have been placed with institutions at 200p, valuing the group at Pounds 65.2m. The shares were aggressively priced at 21.5 times historic earnings, reflecting the high level of interest shown in the company during its presentations. Analysts said the north-east of England group was one of the best to be floated in the past year. The value of the placing was Pounds 20.9m, with 32.1 per cent of the enlarged ordinary share capital being placed. Net proceeds receivable by the company will be Pounds 15.3m. Mr Brian Thompson, executive chairman, said: 'We are delighted with the level of interest that institutions have shown and we are looking forward to an exciting future as a quoted company.' The group, which employs 554 people and exports more than 60 per cent of its sales to more than 40 countries, claims to be a world leader in high-efficiency compressed air filtration. Its filters can purify air to one million times cleaner than the air we breathe. About 75 per cent of the group's sales last year were in industrial products, used to purify and dry compressed air and gases. Activities are split between the group headquarters at Birtley and a factory at Team Valley, both in Tyne and Wear. The prospectus was published yesterday and dealings in the shares are expected to begin on Tuesday, March 29. The flotation is being sponsored by Granville and Company, with NatWest Wood Mackenzie acting as brokers to the issue. The notional net dividend per share for the year to December 31 was 4.25p, giving a notional gross dividend yield of 2.7 per cent.</p>

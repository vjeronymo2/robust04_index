			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Nickel moved ahead on the LME after news that a compromise had been reached in the German steel industry dispute, prompting some short covering. The strike that appeared inevitable after Friday's ballot in favour of a stoppage appears to have been averted. Continued speculation on Russian smelter closures was also supportive, dealers said. Three-month tin held just above support at Dollars 5,500 a tonne on persistent short covering. The closure of the Kuala Lumpur market until Thursday for the lunar New Year holiday could dampen sentiment, dealers said. London cocoa prices closed lower, although off the day's lows. Dealers said fund-selling appeared to be partly responsible for an early tumble, but there were signs of industry buying around the lows, with support for near May pegged around Pounds 730 a tonne. 'People are anticipating the Ivory coast will come back into the market as a seller with the new crop, and the arrivals of the current crop have remained higher than expected,' said one dealer. 'The charts are turning bearish again.' In Chicago wheat prices were up at midsession on fund and commission house buying. Trade talk that India requested 500,000 tonnes of old-crop EEP wheat provided initial support. Compiled from Reuters</p>

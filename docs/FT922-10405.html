			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Arts: Britain pays homage to emigre craftsmen - The Crafts Council It is all so familiar. The City of London street sign with its typeface designed by Berthold Wolpe; Marianne Straub's blue/green chequered moquette that covers the seats of the Piccadilly Line and the London buses; Alvar Aalto's utilitarian birchwood schoolroom stool; the distinctive dustjackets of 1940s and '50s Faber &amp; Faber. The Crafts Council's current show reminds us how easy it is for the British to overlook the fact that so much of what has come to be considered quintessentially English is rooted firmly in wider European traditions. Even the title of the exhibition illustrates the point: 'Influential Europeans in British craft and design'. I thought we were European; obviously the Crafts Council disagrees. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this richly varied and not uninteresting show is muddled and, for an exhibition about things European, depressingly parochial. Too much is taken aboard. There is a passing nod to the craftsmen who settled in Britain before the 20th century, and a fragmented selection of disparate contemporary work. The show begins with a 17th century Mortlake tapestry panel woven by Flemish weavers, 18th century Huguenot silver and mid 19th century crystal made in Stourbridge by Bohemian refugees. It closes with Elisabeth Holder's minimalist jewellery, Andre Dubreuil's steel neo-Rococo 'Ram' chair and Jan Zalud's chilling wooden automata. There is a central coherent group, albeit unhelpfully dispersed. Its furniture, ceramics, textiles and typography are witness to the impact of Bauhaus Modernism on design throughout Europe, and to the exodus of well-trained professional craftsmen and designers from Central Europe during the 1930s. To Britain came ceramicists Lucie Rie, Hans Coper and Ruth Duckworth, for instance, and jeweller Gerda Flockinger. A ream of textile designers and weavers, including Zika Ascher, Jacqueline Groag, Margaret Leischner Marianne Mahler, Tadek Beutlich and Hans Tisdall, rapidly made their mark on textile design and production. Typographic and graphic design was transformed by Wolpe, at Faber's 1941-75, Hans Schmoller at Penguin - responsible for our Pevsners - Hans Schleger and FHK Henrion. Entry into Britain up until 1938 was restricted to those with proof of adequate financial resources, and sponsors were crucial. Ralph Beyer, whose serene and beautifully judged inscriptions for Coventry Cathedral are a highlight of the show, arrived through the good offices of his art historian father's friend, Erich Mendelssohn. Margaret Marks came through the assistance of Heal's, which had been the principal outlet for her ceramics. Most of the men were interned in 1940, and so too was the weaver Margaret Leischner, a gentile. There is a dignity and courage about these sombre works of the 1930s and '40s. What is more difficult to convey (and no attempt is made) is the shock of the starkly functional Modernist aesthetic. The British Arts and Crafts movement in particular had become increasingly insular and isolated. How did, say, the clean lines and controlled decoration, and urbanity, of a Lucie Rie cup and saucer look to those used to Leach's traditional fat-bellied brown jugs? The response can be gauged in part by the success in Britain of what became known as Scandinavian Modern, which represented a more human face of Modern Movement mass-production with its respect for natural materials. It is revealing, too, that it was the emigre craftsmen rather than the architects and designers who tended to remain in Britain. Marcel Breuer, for instance, whose plywood 'Long Chair' stretches out across the show's central space, came to Britain in 1935 to join the architectural practice of FRS Yorke, but left for America two years later. Britain seemed to prove more congenial to Rie (DBE), Coper and Flockinger (CBE) who established international reputations from a British base. The quirky individualism and integrity that continues to characterise the applied arts in Britain have attracted later generations of students from all over Europe. That brings us back to the scrolls of Andre Dubreuil, a pioneer of the new metal furniture who has now returned to France, and the Post Modern desk of Floris van den Broecke, currently the head of the Royal College of Art's furniture department. The dialogue between Europeans continues much as before. 'Influential Europeans' continues at the Crafts Council Gallery, 44A Pentonville Road, Islington, until June 14, and travels to Truro, Cardiff, Hull and Wakefield.</p>

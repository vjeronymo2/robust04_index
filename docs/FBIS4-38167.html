			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman--AL-DUSTUR--A delegation from the Islamic  Action Front [IAF] and the Pan-Arab Action Front [PAF] has  visited the North Korean Embassy to deliver a message expressing  their solidarity with the North Korean's resistance to the U.S.  policy aimed at strangulating the northern part of Korea,  controlling the Pacific Ocean, and creating appropriate  circumstances for marketing old U.S. weapons in the region.    The North Korean ambassador expressed the appreciation of  his  embassy and government for the stand of IAF and the PAF. He  stressed the firm Korean position in confronting U.S. threats.    Included in the delegation were Deputy Hamzah Mansur,  spokesman for the IAF deputies bloc; Muhammad al-Zu'bi, PAF  secretary general; Deputy Doctor Bassam al-'Umush; Naji 'Allush;  Deputy 'Abd-al-'Aziz Jabr; Ahmad Ibrahim; and Engineer 'Ali  Abu-al-Sukkar.    In a separate development, seven Jordanian parties issued a  statement of solidarity with North Korea against the onslaught  being waged against it.    The statement says: "Contrasting with this U.S. plotting  against the DPRK concerning nuclear inspection issues is the  imperialist states' full collusion and suspect silence toward  the government of Israel, which is being turned into a nuclear  base far away from international inspection in the Middle East.  Moreover, Israel's military arsenal is constantly beefed up,  thus violating the international will and peoples' interests."    The seven Jordanian parties called for a campaign of  solidarity with the Korean people.    The parties that signed the statement are: The Jordanian  Democratic Popular Unity Party, the Jordanian Democratic  Progressive Party, the Jordanian Communist Party, the Jordanian  Socialist Democratic Party, the Arab Socialist Ba'th party, the  Jordanian Arab Masses Party, and the Jordanian Arab  Constitutional Front Party.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Up the pole at the town hall: A review of UK local government could cost voters money - and the Tories votes Local government is leading the government back into political trouble, only months after the death of the poll tax. This time the issue is local government reorganisation. Plans to streamline local authorities in England to save on administration costs and improve accountability threaten to be both costly and unpopular with voters. Launched enthusiastically two years ago by Mr Michael Heseltine, then environment secretary, the objective of the independent Local Government Commission was to do away with the two-tier system of district and county councils which cover most of England outside the conurbations. Mr Heseltine thought local government would be cheaper, and easier for voters to understand, if all local services were provided by a single, all-purpose unitary authority. Yet far from saving money, it now appears sweeping reorganisation along lines envisaged by Mr Heseltine will add to the cost of local government both in the transition period and afterwards. One estimate is that it could add Pounds 100 to each council tax bill in the first year of reorganisation, 1996 - within 12 months of the next general election. The new environment secretary, Mr John Gummer, confronted the issue last month by announcing the government might accept restructuring plans which were more expensive than the status quo. He also bolstered the review by shortening its timetable, and announcing that leaving two tiers intact would be 'the exception'. He apparently sees single-tier authorities as a cause worth paying for. Besides courting trouble with voters, that judgment appalled employers, worried that they would be asked to foot the bill via business rates. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, told Mr Gummer last week that 'we have always suspected that local government reorganisation could turn out to be an expensive hobby for the government'. He added: 'This looks to be an exercise in bureaucratic job creation across the country.' Worse for the government, Sir John Banham, the former CBI director-general appointed by Mr Heseltine to chair the Commission, takes a similar view. For him, the review is an opportunity to save money: if unitary authorities will not achieve that, he would be happy to retain the status quo. His misgivings have been strengthened by Mori polls conducted for the commission in Derbyshire, Durham and Cleveland, the first mainland counties on which proposals have been published. These suggest the 'man in the street' has little or no enthusiasm for reform. In Durham, 54 per cent favoured the status quo. In Derbyshire the status quo was the single most popular option with 39 per cent. The most popular unitary option - splitting Derbyshire into two councils - was favoured by just 11 per cent. 'Artificial' counties created in 1974 - for instance Cleveland and Avon, which did not conform to historical county borders - may be an exception to the trend. Mori's Cleveland poll showed only 21 per cent favouring the status quo, and a conversion into three or four unitary authorities now seems likely. Big cities lacking their own strategic authority - such as Bristol, Leicester and Nottingham - can also be expected to muster enthusiasm. The polling evidence has led Sir John to doubt the recommendations his commission has made for new, large single-tier authorities. He believes the Durham poll shows voters have been 'thoroughly unimpressed' by the unitary options put to them. Public opinion was to have driven the commission in its work, as Mr Heseltine sought to avoid the mistakes of the last reorganisation of local government in 1974. But it is the government that is ever more enthusiastic about reform. Mr David Curry, local government minister, said this week the government might reject proposals which would protect the status quo. He added: 'If I wanted the entire reorganisation to be determined by Mori, I would have asked them to carry it out in the first place.' Policymakers even have an ideal size in mind for the single-tier authorities, according to Mr Martin Easteal, chief executive of the commission. He says the latest guidance from Whitehall suggests ministers believe the ideal population under a new single tier authority would be between 150,000 and 250,000. The stance taken by Mr Gummer and Mr Curry is hard to explain. Mr Gummer argues it is 'clearer where responsibility lies' if there is a single level of local government, adding unitary authorities 'can reduce bureacracy and costs, and improve the co-ordination and quality of services.' Yet research suggests that it is far from proven that unitary authorities are cheaper and more accountable. According to Professor John Stewart of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Local Government Studies, there is no evidence that the existence of two tiers of local government confuses people over local authorities' responsibilities. Around 70 per cent of voters know that education is provided by counties - a figure not far behind those correctly identifying the prime minister. Confusion over accountability is serious only for services provided by appointed government boards, such as hospitals - thought by 50 per cent to be run by counties, and by 20 per cent to be run by districts. Professor Stewart points out that three-tier government is the norm in larger European countries. No EC country other than Luxembourg has unitary authorities. The extra tier allows the lowest level to be small and thus highly accountable. While the average English district has a population of more than 100,000, the largest lowest-level authorities elsewhere in Europe have populations of 28,000 in Sweden and 17,000 in Denmark. As for cost, re-organisation seems likely to increase council tax bills. Ernst &amp; Young, accountants appointed by the commission, have found a marked 'economy of scale'. While councils serving a population of 50,000 or less needed more than five administrative staff per 1,000 population, only 3.5 were needed for a population of 300,000. Less than three were needed in councils with a population of more than 1m. Replacing a two-tier system with small unitary authorities could thus increase total staff costs. There would also be transitional expenses. The Association of County Councils estimates that converting each county into three unitary authorities - roughly the option the government has in mind - would cost about Pounds 27.2m per county in new town halls, redundancy bills and other transitional costs. The Department of the Environment has left open the option that council taxpayers should foot this bill, possibly adding more than Pounds 100 per head to council tax bills. Against this background, Mr Major's decision in July to reject a proposal from the department for authorities to 'opt in' to the review process if local people were dissatisfied with the status quo looks like a mistake. An 'opt in' process would have allowed a less ambitious review of council boundaries, much as the Boundary Commission periodically redraws parliamentary boundaries. Unpopular 'artificial' counties, such as Avon and Humberside, might then be disbanded, while Yorkshiremen could reclaim their ridings and Bristol might become a city in full control of all its services. Areas happy with the two-tier structure could carry on undisturbed. Mr Major felt a voluntary review would encourage authorities in Wales and Scotland - where restructuring plans have been imposed without formal consultation - to resist change; moreover, this would show lack of confidence in a policy seen as a vote-winner in the last general election. But the new, accelerated review could lose votes. If the commission finishes its work by the end of next year, the new councils, with their higher council tax bills, should come into being in May 1996. The next general election must be held by April 1997.</p>

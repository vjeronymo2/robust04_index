			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts tumble following disappointing auction UK GOVERNMENT bonds fell a quarter-point after the Bank of England's disappointing auction of government bonds. The Bank offered Pounds 2.5bn of a newly-created stock, the 8 per cent gilt due 2003, which is expected to take over as the new 10-year benchmark gilt. However, demand for the stock was poor: the Bank reported a cover ratio (the ratio of bids to the amount on offer) of only 1.26 times, and the auction was dominated by domestic players as foreign investors continued to shy away from the gilt market. The lowest accepted price was 96 13/16 , to yield 8.48 per cent, while the highest accepted price was 96 15/16 , yielding 8.46 per cent. The spread of bids was relatively narrow, as dealers pointed out that it was not difficult to price the new gilt. 'The bids were very tightly grouped around the market level', said Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. The auction was the first since sterling left the European exchange rate mechanism in September. Foreign investors have been reluctant to invest in gilts since then because of the greater exchange rate risk, and were largely absent from yesterday's auction. Both domestic and foreign investors have become concerned about the heavy funding pressures on the market and the possibility of rising inflation. Dealers said that quite a lot of the auction stock ended up with marketmakers, and warned that this could overhang the market for a while. GERMAN government bonds ended weaker as the Bundesbank emphasised its commitment to low inflation, wiping out any hopes of lower German interest rates. In addition, the new issue of bonds from Treuhand, the privatisation agency, had a poor reception which further depressed the bund market. The Liffe bund futures contract fell from its opening 91.03 to a low of 90.71 on around 45,000 contracts. The fall in bund prices followed comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, that Germany should not give up its tight monetary policies to fall in with the wishes of other European countries. The Treuhand agency yesterday allocated DM 4.05bn of its new ten-year 7 3/8 per cent bonds in a tender. The minimum accepted price was 99.51, and the average was 99.54, for a yield of 7.44 per cent. JAPANESE government bonds closed higher on expectations of a cut in interest rates. The benchmark No 145 opened with a yield of 4.605 per cent and climbed steadily all day, to close at 4.58 per cent. The rate on three-month certificates of deposit fell from 3.8 per cent to 3.75 per cent, encouraging hopes that the Bank of Japan may cut the Official Discount Rate this month. Dealers said the passage of the supplementary budget in Japan's lower house added to the bullish mood. US TREASURY prices were mixed across the maturity range yesterday as dealers and investors traded cautiously ahead of today's all-important November employment report. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/32 at 100 21/32 , yielding 7.564 per cent. But prices were slightly firmer at the short end of the market with the two-year note up  1/32 at 99 5/8 , to yield 4.808 per cent. Eyes were focused on jobs data due this morning. Recent statistics have painted a picture of gradual recovery, but the employment report should give the best indication yet of economic conditions. Economists expect a rise of about 50,000 in non-farm payrolls. Nervousness ahead of the figures partially explained the slight reaction to the 10.3 per cent plunge in home sales in October. But the chief reason for indifference was the unreliability of home sales data, and the fact that the big drop in October was offset by an upward revision for September.</p>

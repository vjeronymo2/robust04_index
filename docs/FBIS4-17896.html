			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the Today's World" program] </F>   [Summary from poor reception] The DPRK has decided to  allow the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to inspect  nuclear facilities in Yongbyon near Pyongyang. This has evoked  a positive reaction among countries concerned. Pyongyang had  not permitted the agency's special inspection of DPRK nuclear  facilities in Yongbyon, and are thus suspected of developing  nuclear weapons.    As the dispute over the nuclear issue of the peninsula  further deteriorated, the position of some neighboring countries  became more hardline. First of all, Pyongyang, Seoul, and  Washington respectively assumed hardline positions. Pyongyang  complained about the IAEA's unfair attitude in dealing with the  North Korean nuclear issue. This made the IAEA's inspection  more difficult.    On the other hand, the United States and the ROK were  attempting to apply pressure on Pyongyang by talking about  imposing economic saanctions or resuming the Team Spirity joint  military exercise.    U.S. Secretary of State Cristopher said that the change in  Pyongyang's position toward the IAEA's inspections is a good,  positive phenomenon.    Son Song-pil, DPRK ambassador to Russia, said that the IAEA  inspection team scheduled to arrive in Yongbyon will be provided  with all the conditions necessary for its work.    We can say that such a position of Pyongyang totally  corresponds not only with the interests of the DPRK itself but  also with the interests of other countries.</p>

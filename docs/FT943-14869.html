			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (12): Recession forces urgent rethink - The Japanese industry faces challenges of epic dimensions Japanese component suppliers may be excused a hollow laugh at the crisis alleged to be facing their counterparts in Europe, as set out in the European Commission's study into the sector. But feeling sympathy for the Europeans is altogether another matter, since the Japanese components industry itself faces commercial, economic, financial and political pressures which pose challenges of epic dimensions. The problems start at home where component suppliers are still smarting from the length and depth of the motor industry's recession. Poor domestic demand coupled with slumping exports in the context of worldwide recession and the strength of the yen have led to a marked cut in orders. In 1993, Japanese car production fell by 9 per cent, while commercial vehicle output declined by 13 per cent. Moreover, the rot has continued into 1994 with vehicle output falling by around 12 per cent during the first quarter - although more recently there have been signs that Japanese car buyers are coming out of hibernation. However, the strength of the yen remains a serious barrier to the motor industry's export effort. It is hardly surprising that latest financial results have made dismal reading. In the tyre sector, for example, Bridgestone - the number one manufacturer - saw its turnover fall by 8 per cent in 1993 and suffered a 53 per cent decline in pre-tax profits. The company cited a sharp reduction in orders from domestic car manufacturers, a sector where it holds a 50 per cent market share, as the principal cause. In addition, the Japanese replacement market was depressed with consumers trading down to cheaper brands and, adding a further twist, prices came under severe pressure. The same circumstances led Sumitomo Rubber to experience a 13 per cent drop in turnover and a 69 per cent fall in pre-tax profits. In another product category, the ball-bearing producer NSK recorded an 8 per cent fall in turnover and a 20 per cent decline in pre-tax profits during the year to end-March 1994. The underlying trend was even worse, since a profit was achieved only by realising a capital gain through the sale of investments. Sales to motor industry customers fell by an above average 9 per cent. Vehicle manufacturers' profits have been sliding, too, with consequent wide-ranging cost-cutting measures. These seem likely to have an adverse impact on the components sector. Reports indicate that vehicle producers are taking a robust approach during supply contract negotiations and are seeking substantial price reductions in an attempt to restore profitability and compensate for the yen's strength. Toyota, for example, is understood to be looking for price reductions of around 15 per cent during the three years to 1997, while Mazda - which incurred a pre-tax loss of Y48bn in the year to end-March 1994 - is looking for quicker results with price cuts of around 10 per cent during the 1994/95 financial year. Even the smaller producers are in the hunt for big reductions. Daihatsu is believed to be seeking an across-the-board reduction in unit component prices of 20 per cent over the next three years. Failure to meet these 'requests' could result in an increasing volume of component imports from other nations in south-east Asia such as Korea, the Philippines and Thailand where unit costs are lower. Longer term, the region will provide Japanese vehicle makers with an increasing range of component sourcing options, many of which will be exercised in the interests of maintaining international competitiveness. Some of these new vehicle manufacturing ventures are being established with help from Japanese manufacturers, and it is logical to expect growing ties which will involve, among other things, an increasing flow of components into Japan from cost-effective sources. Honda is well advanced in establishing a components supply network in south-east Asia, while Mitsubishi is importing parts from Korean-based Hyundai. Another threat arises over the likelihood of rising component shipments from America, as Japan comes under mounting pressure to narrow the trade gap. The five largest Japanese vehicle producers - Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi and Mazda - have all announced plans to boost purchases from American component producers. This will involve a higher level of imports into Japan for domestic vehicle assembly as well as greater use of local suppliers in overseas assembly operations. Toyota envisages that its purchases from American component producers will rise by Dollars 630m in 1994 from the Dollars 4.7bn level in 1993, increasing still further to Dollars 6.5bn in 1996. Nissan's purchases are due to rise from Dollars 2.4bn in 1992 to Dollars 4.3bn in 1997, Mitsubishi's from Dollars 900m in 1993 to Dollars 2.1bn in 1996, Honda's from Dollars 3.7bn in 1992 to Dollars 5.2bn in 1995, and Mazda's from Dollars 1.8bn in 1993 to Dollars 2.3bn in 1997. Even without this political pressure, the currency factor has resulted in overseas assembly plants of Japanese vehicle producers stepping up their purchases from local sources rather than using high cost supplies from Japan. All the factors mentioned are combining to force an urgent rethink among Japanese component suppliers concerning the most appropriate strategy for future survival. First-tier producers of systems are likely to expand purchases of materials and components from foreign sources. Another trend widely expected is an increase in partnerships with American and European companies to share research and development costs and facilitate entry into a wider international marketplace.</p>

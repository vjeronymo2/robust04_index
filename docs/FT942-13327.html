			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World Trade News: Bonn export credit premiums changed Hermes, the German export credit insurance scheme, will introduce a new set of country risks, designed to make the programme more flexible and give German companies a better chance of competing with foreign companies paying lower premiums. Countries will be classed in five new categories according to political risk starting July 1. Premiums in category one, which includes countries such as France or South Korea, will cost one-third of the present premium while double the present rate will be charged for exports to high-risk countries. Hermes said it could not forecast how much business would fall into the different categories. However an official in Bonn said the insurance would become more expensive because most would fall under categories four and five since exports to less riskier countries rarely needed Hermes guarantees. That spells trouble for many medium-sized companies which benefit most from the scheme and had campaigned to keep the premiums as cheap as possible. However, pressure to price premiums more flexibly mounted after Hermes reported a 1993 deficit of DM5.1bn (Pounds 2.04bn). This worst ever shortfall was caused mainly by losses of DM4.5bn on business between east German companies and insolvent counterparts in the former Soviet Union. Credit guarantees to Russia have been limited to DM3.5bn this year in an attempt to stem the losses. Under the Hermes programme German exporters can take out coverage against political and exchange rate risks as well as the risk of non-payment. Exports worth DM33.7bn were covered in 1993. Germany was the last major exporter to operate a uniform pricing system for export insurance. This often meant that German companies doing business in relatively low-risk areas in Asia were paying much higher premiums than foreign competitors. The uniform premium system was introduced in 1948 when, as one official put it, 'we did not think it was very good to divide the world up into good and bad parts. However, 50 years after the second world war there is no reason to continue such practices.' An official at the Hamburg-based Hermes Kreditversicherungs-AG, the company which administers the credit guarantees, said discussions were under way to introduce a set of premiums which could be used by all European Union countries, but no decisions had yetbeen reached.</p>

			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: NEW RESEARCH SUPPORTS OMEGA-3'S ROLE IN PREVENTION OF  HEART DISEASE  </P> <P> A group of international researchers, gathered here for the II International  Conference on the Health Effects of Omega 3 Fatty Acids in Seafood, fell short  of announcing a formal nutritional standard for the nutrient, but they did call  for the U. S. National Research Council to reconsider its position and include  omega-3 in the Recommended Dietary Allowances.  </P> <P> To date, the U. S. government has refused to include omega-3 in its RDAs,  explaining that further study of the fatty acids' role in metabolic function is  necessary.  </P> <P> But, citing research done by members of the group, which charts the amount of  omega-3 required to produce a variety of positive responses in either animal  models or in patients in a clinical setting, the group described omega-3's  protective effect against chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease,  rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes and psoriasis and determined that it does indeed  have an essential role in human growth and development.  </P> <P> At a press conference, representatives from the United States and the United  Kingdom suggested that a minimum of 1% of a day's total calories be derived  from omega-3 fatty acids -- the type found primarily in fish that inhabit deep,  cold waters. That percentage could be achieved by eating two to three meals of  fish per week from sources such as tuna, salmon, mackerel, herring or sardines,  the scientists said. The American Heart Assn. and the American Dietetic Assn.  already encourage consumers to eat fish two to three times a week but no health  organization has recommended a specific amount for omega-3.  </P> <P> Clinical studies have proven that for proper functioning, the body needs to  derive only about 2% of its total calories from fat -- of all types -- yet  Americans currently consume about 30% -- most of it from saturated fat,  according to health experts. Eating more fish would presumably replace some of  the saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat and simultaneously supply omega-3 to  the diet. Equal distribution of each type -- 10% saturated, 10% polyunsaturated  and 10% monounsaturated -- is optimal, all health agencies concur.  </P> <P> "I think (eating fish) is something very healthy to do," said Evelyn Tribole, a  registered dietitian and media spokesperson for the American Dietetic Assn.  "Canned tuna contains omega-3, and (the nutrient) is available in the  water-packed variety too.  </P> <P> "I would prefer a recommendation in terms of an absolute number of grams rather  than a percentage because it's not as absolute. There are a number of Americans  who are dieting on any given day so that their total caloric intake is  variable. But with two to three meals (of fish) a week you know you're at least  in the ballpark."  </P> <P> Tribole also cautioned against meeting this requirement with supplements  because they will add additional fat to the diet.  </P> <P> "I recommend that my patients rotate the use of oils -- canola oil, then  safflower, then olive. The more variety you have the more likely you are to  maximize nutrients and minimize toxicity." (It is possible to eat too much of  one type of fat and cause an imbalance, leading to toxicity, in the body.)  </P> <P> Dr. Michael Crawford of the Institute of Zoology, London, also believes in  balance and explained that prevention of chronic diseases is one of the most  logical applications of omega-3. He and many other scientists at the meeting  agreed that even though the evidence examines intervention, the data should  encourage consumers to seek balance in the diet and include nutrients from a  variety of sources -- including those containing omega-3 -- to delay the onset  of disease.  </P> <P> The doctors explained that although American consumers have made an effort to  switch from saturated fat to polyunsaturated fat, the United States still has a  high mortality rate from degenerative disease. But, according to early studies  of Greenland Eskimos, who also consume large amounts of saturated fat from  whale blubber and very fatty fish, some of the negative effects of a  high-saturated fat diet can be reduced by the omega-3s in the fatty fish.  </P> <P> "The evidence is clear that the seeds of coronary artery disease are already  being sewn in childhood so we're looking at doing things in terms of initial  nutrition," Crawford said. "We're not just talking about giving people with  heart disease or rheumatoid arthritis some fish oils. We're looking at stopping  these (diseases) from starting in the first place."  </P> <P> Bill Lands, professor of Biological Chemistry at the University of Illinois,  agreed. He described a study of 6,000 high-risk middle-aged men that noted a  40% lower mortality rate among fish-eating Americans, compared to the non-fish  eating group. In the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT),  participants were studied over a 10-to-12-year period to investigate a number  of risk factors for coronary heart disease, including diet, blood pressure and  smoking.  </P> <P> A similar result was observed in a significant study published last year in the  Lancet, a British medical journal. It reported that of the nearly 2,000 men who  had previously had a heart attack, those who were advised to eat at least two  oil-rich fish meals per week had a 29% lower mortality rate over the next two  years compared to those who were not advised to eat fish.  </P> <P> "Whatever is in the food chain is in the tissues. There's not much  discrimination (by the body)," Lands said. "Epidemiology tells us that those  with omega-3 (in their tissues) have a 40% lower mortality rate." Until all the  evidence is in, consumers can follow the AHA recommendation to include more  fish meals in the diet.  </P> <P> "Eat Fish, Live Better" (Harper &amp; Row: $18.95) by Anne M. Fletcher, a  registered dietitian, can help consumers further appreciate the benefits of  fish oils.  </P> <P> In addition to recipes and some discussion of fish-oil capsules, the book  features an easy-to-understand explanation of the role of omega-3 in the diet,  including how it influences hormone function. Early population studies are  discussed, and a detailed section on pesticides, pollutants and poisoning  associated with eating fish is provided.  </P> <P> There is an extensive glossary, which ranges from anchovy to wolfish. In it,  each species is defined in terms of its pseudonyms, market forms, eating  quality, methods of preparation and nutritional value.  </P> <P> GRILLED TUNA IN TOMATO-BASIL-MINT SAUCE  </P> <P> (From "Eat Fish, Live Better")  </P> <P> 1 (16-ounce) can stewed tomatoes, drained  </P> <P> 1 medium clove garlic  </P> <P> 1/4 cup basil leaves  </P> <P> 10 large mint leaves  </P> <P> Pepper  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon olive oil  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons dry Sherry  </P> <P> 1 1/4 to 1 1/3 pounds fresh tuna steaks, 3/4 to 1-inch thick  </P> <P> Blend tomatoes and garlic in blender 20 to 30 seconds or until frothy and fine.

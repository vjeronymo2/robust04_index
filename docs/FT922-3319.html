			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Lafontaine survives censure vote MR Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) and premier of the Saarland, yesterday survived a vote of no confidence in his state parliament by 29 votes to 21. He had rejected charges of self-enrichment, for claiming a full pension as former mayor of Saarbrucken from the age of 42, on top of his ministerial salary, as a 'dirty smear campaign.' The Saarland assembly split on straight party lines, with all the SPD members backing their leader, but the affair has left Mr Lafontaine, who was candidate for German chancellor in 1990, with his national reputation in tatters. The other result has been an upsurge in public interest in all the perks, pensions and privileges of their politicians, and calls for an independent inquiry into salaries in the Bundestag in Bonn.</p>

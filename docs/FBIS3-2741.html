			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Linda Lee report from Beijing, from the "News </F> at Eight" -- recorded]    [Excerpt] China's pro-democracy campaigner, Wang Dan, left  Beijing early this morning, just hours before the arrival of  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. A family member  said Wang Dan left at 9 a.m. with two friends. He was said to  have left in a rush to southern China, for probably a week.  Wang has been detained by police several times over the past  few weeks. It is believed he was warned by the authorities to  leave Beijing during Christopher's visit. The dissident's home  is still being guarded by security police, who tried to stop our  camera crew from taking pictures outside. [Video shows  medium-distance shot of a six-story housing block, followed by a  closeup of the sign hanging beside the entrance; it reads:  "Guest House of the Museum of Chinese Revolution; no security  police can be seen, nor is any intervention in the filming  shown.]    Another well-known dissident, Wei Jingsheng, also left the  Chinese capital last week. The reason given by his secretary  was that he was not feeling well. The Chinese justice minister  declined to say whether the dissidents will be allowed to meet  with Christopher.

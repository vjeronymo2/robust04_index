			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Provisions take Credit Lyonnais to FFr1.85bn loss CREDIT Lyonnais, one of France's largest state-controlled banks, fell into the red last year with a net loss of FFr1.85bn (Pounds 223m). This followed a steep increase in net provisions from FFr9.6bn in 1991 to FFr14.69bn in 1992 due to heavy losses on its cinema and property interests. The loss, the fourth in the bank's history and the first since 1974, comes at an extremely delicate time for Credit Lyonnais, which is a candidate for privatisation. It also poses a threat to Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman since 1988 and architect of Credit Lyonnais' ambitious lending strategy. He was appointed by the outgoing socialist administration, and his position may be reviewed by the conservatives. The dividend has been cut from FFr23 in 1991 to FFr15. Credit Lyonnais increased net banking income from FFr46.33bn in 1991 to FFr48.97bn in 1992 in spite of the competitive state of the French banking market. The group benefited from Mr Haberer's successful European expansion strategy, culminating in its recent investment in BfG Bank of Germany, and the rationalisation of the French network. It held operating profits at FFr13.21bn last year, against FFr13.31bn in 1991. However Credit Lyonnais raised net new provisions to FFr17.6bn on unsuccessful investments and sour loans, although it recouped FFr3.6bn of previous writedowns on country debt. Mr Haberer said 40 per cent of the new provisions related to loans made by CLBN, its Dutch banking subsidiary from 1986 to 1990, which included its involvement in the abortive bid by Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the disgraced Italian financier, for MGM, the stricken Hollywood studio. Credit Lyonnais set aside FFr2.3bn in 1992 for its cinema interests, FFr3bn for its exposure to Sasea, the bankrupt Swiss holding company. It also wrote down FFr6bn on property. Mr Haberer said provisions would be lower this year. He expected the first half of 1993 to be similar to 1992, but anticipated improvement in the second half. Lex, Page 24</p>

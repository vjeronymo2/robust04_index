			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (v) Particulate emissions shall not be combined with semi-volatile phase emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Generation of evaporative emissions for characterization and biological testing. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1) Except as provided in paragraph (f)(5) of this section, an evaporative emissions generator shall be used to volatilize samples of a fuel or additive/base fuel mixture for evaporative emissions characterization and biological testing. Emissions shall be collected and sampled using equipment and methods appropriate for use with the compounds being characterized and the requirements of the emission characterization analysis. In the case of potentially explosive test substance concentrations, care must be taken to avoid generating explosive atmospheres. The tester is referred to &sect;79.61(d)(8) for considerations involving explosivity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Evaporative Emissions Generator (EEG) Description.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An EEG is a fuel tank or vessel to which heat is applied causing a portion of the fuel to evaporate at a desired rate. The manufacturer has flexibility in designing an EEG for testing a particular fuel or fuel additive. The sample used to generate emissions in the EEG shall be renewed at least daily. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The evaporation chamber shall be made from materials compatible with the fuels and additives being tested and shall be equipped with a drain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The chamber shall be filled to 40  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5 percent of its interior volume with the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture being tested, with the remainder of the volume containing air. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The concentration of the evaporated fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in the vapor space of the evaporation chamber during the time emissions are being withdrawn for testing shall not vary by more than 10 percent from the equilibrium concentration in the vapor space of emissions generated from the fresh fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in the chamber. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) During the course of a day's emission generation period, the level of fuel in the EEG shall be maintained to within 7 percent of its height at the start of the daily exposure period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The fuel used in the EEG shall be drained at the end of each daily exposure. The EEG shall be refilled with a fresh supply of the test formulation before the start of each daily exposure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The vapor space of the evaporation chamber shall be well mixed throughout the time emissions are being withdrawn for testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The size of the evaporation chamber shall be determined by the rate at which evaporative emissions shall be needed in the test animal exposure chambers and the rate at which the fuel or the additive/base fuel mixture evaporates. The rate of evaporative emissions may be adjusted by altering the size of the EEG or by using one or more additional EEG(s). Emission rate modifications shall not be adjusted by temperature control or pressure control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The temperature of the fuel or additive/base fuel mixture in the evaporation chamber shall be 130  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. The vapors shall maintain this temperature up to the point in the system where the vapors are diluted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) The pressure in the vapor space of the evaporation chamber and the dilution and sampling apparatus shall stay within 10 percent of ambient atmospheric pressure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) There shall be no controls or equipment on the evaporation chamber system that change the concentration or composition of the vapors generated for testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) Manufacturers shall perform verification testing of evaporative emissions in a manner analogous to the verification testing performed for combustion emissions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) For biological testing, vapor shall be withdrawn from the EEG at a constant rate, diluted with air as required for the particular study, and conducted immediately to the biological testing chamber(s) in a manner similar to the method used in &sect;79.57(e), excluding the mixing chamber therein. The rate of emission generation shall be high enough to supply the biological exposure chamber with sufficient emissions to allow for a minimum of fifteen air changes per exposure chamber per hour. Interruption of evaporative emissions exposures during biological testing for more than four consecutive hours, or on more than two separate occasions within a four-week period for less than four consecutive hours, shall cause the affected test(s) to be void. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

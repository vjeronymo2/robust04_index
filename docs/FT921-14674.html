			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Observer: Female takeover By all accounts Frances Heaton, new director general of the takeover panel, is a jolly good egg. But given the rarity of women in the top echelons of City merchant banks the appointment is pretty remarkable, Opportunity 2000 notwithstanding. She was the first woman to become a Lazard director in 1986, and her departure means that only one member of the 40-strong board will now be female. She is one of a growing number of women who made their initial mark in the Treasury before moving out - Rosalind Gilmore of the Building Societies Commission, is another. However, Heaton seems to have found the bureaucracy of the civil service stultifying and after a two-year secondment to SG Warburg, she decided to start a second career as a merchant banker. It is always hard for non-professionals to judge whether the director general of the takeover panel is doing a good job. But the 47-year-old recruit starts with right sort of qualifications, and her sense of humour as well as inside knowledge of Whitehall should stand her in good stead particularly if there is a change of government. Her appointment means that three of the City's key regulators - the Serious Fraud office and the Building Societies Commission are the others - are now headed by women. The real breakthrough will come when a woman is put in charge of running a big City institution, as opposed to regulating it.</p>

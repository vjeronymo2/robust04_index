DiFatta said her organization  caught the attention of the judges with a wide menu of policies and programs.  The council created a program to educate parents about substance abuse, work  habits, teen-age pregnancy and suicide.  </P> <P> The council also devised an incentive scheme where points are awarded to PTA  units based on the number of activities and projects undertaken, reports put  out, and attendance at Simi Valley Council and district meetings.  </P> <P> The Simi Valley PTA Council was also the state's most outstanding in 1983.

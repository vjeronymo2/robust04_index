			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Car industry report attacked as 'sell-out' THE Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on new car sales in the UK was condemned yesterday as a 'sell-out' by the Consumers' Association, and was greeted mostly with relief by motor manufacturers and dealers. The 1,000-page report, published yesterday, concludes that consumers, particularly private motorists, pay more for their cars than they should, and proposes a range of measures to increase competition. It also finds there is a complex monopoly involving 24 carmakers and importers, and a number of restrictions imposed by suppliers on their dealers which operate against the public interest. In spite of these findings, the report largely absolves carmakers and dealers of profiteering and effectively rejects consumer group calls for the current system of exclusively franchised dealers to be scrapped in favour of a market 'free-for-all'. Mr Peter Lilley, trade and industry secretary, acknowledged that the MMC had examples of cars priced 'significantly lower' in some continental European countries than in the UK. Nevertheless, 'a comparison of the price ranges in the UK with those in the markets most similar to the UK - France and Germany - did not indicate significant differences in general price levels', he said. Mr Lilley, who has had the report for three months, said that before taking any decisions he wanted to hear the views of motorists, dealers, importers and carmakers. But with the consultation period lasting until April 3, government action is unlikely before the general election. Most significantly Mr Lilley said yesterday the government would be considering whether the UK should remove all restrictions on Japanese vehicle imports before the end of 1999, the date agreed last year by the European Commission and the Japanese Ministry for International Trade and Industry for full liberalisation of the EC new car market. A voluntary export restraint (VER) or gentleman's agreement, in existence in the UK since 1975, has effectively limited the share of Japanese imported cars to about 11 per cent of the UK new car market. This restraint must be terminated by the end of 1992 under the terms of last year's EC-Japan accord, but will be replaced by an overall VER for the whole of the EC. There will be no limit on Japanese production in Europe, however, and the share of Japanese makes in the UK is widely expected to more than double during the decade. The MMC report says that on competition grounds alone the restraint should be removed as soon as possible. The Consumers' Association claimed UK motorists would still be paying up to Pounds 3,000 more than they should for a new car, in spite of the report's conclusion that there was a complex monopoly. 'It still hammers motorists,' said Dr John Beishon, the CA's director, adding that 'the only people to gain from it are car manufacturers, dealers and company car buyers'. However, the Retail Motor Industry Federation said the report demonstrated that the motor trade was 'the most price-competitive area of consumer goods retailing in the UK economy'.

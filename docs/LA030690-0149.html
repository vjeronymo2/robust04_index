			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;  </P> <P> THE DRIVING FORCES;  </P> <P> HAS THE TIME COME FOR '80S-ERA GREED TO DROP OFF THE BOARD?  </P> <P> The Roaring '80s -- the decade of ambition, of excess and, yes, of greed -- is  finally ending.  </P> <P> It is ending a few weeks after the calendar actually turned, and not with a  bang but with a bankrupt thud: The demise of Drexel Burnham Lambert -- the  money machine largely responsible for driving junk bond takeover mania -- gives  the dawn of the decade the feel of a bank vault slamming shut.  </P> <P> These days, a real-life Gordon Gekko -- the supremely glamorous yet corrupt  investor in the 1987 movie "Wall Street" -- would have a tough time finding  enough killer deals to keep busy. There is no early '80s, Ronald Reagan-style  tax cut in the offing to provide a cash bonanza for masses of American  consumers. And everybody is sick of yuppies.  </P> <P> "The zeitgeist of greed that really defined the 1980s has become shopworn, a  little tired," said William Schneider, a political analyst at the American  Enterprise Institute in Washington. "But I don't sense anything new that is  coming to replace it yet."  </P> <P> For social seers, the big question appears to be: What follows an era of  indulgence?  </P> <P> Will America's most ambitious graduates become more eclectic, less focused on  Wall Street and a handful of other platinum-plated professions, more willing to  experiment? Will manufacturing, for instance, come back into business school  vogue in time for American industry to stave off the Japanese? Is it possible  that -- gasp -- idealistic values will come back into fashion?  </P> <P> "The trend we see is that they (students) want to do something for others,"  said Deborah McCoy, director of UC Riverside's Career Service Center. "They  want to make a meaningful contribution." McCoy, for instance, sees growing  interest in ethical issues among business students.  </P> <P> That's not surprising, perhaps, in light of the imprisonment of super-rich  investor Ivan Boesky or the more recent legal difficulties of financial wizard  Michael Milken.  </P> <P> This much appears certain: The high-powered, high-finance jobs that became  cultural symbols of the past decade -- and potent lures for a generation of  graduates -- will be far less plentiful in the early 1990s.  </P> <P> Already, the headlines are full of the painful contraction on Wall Street, such  as last week's notice by Shearson Lehman Hutton that 2,000 employees are about  to get their walking papers. Many observers believe that in the glamorous and  wealth-creating investment banking field, the crunch is just beginning.  </P> <P> "The junk bond business is drying up," said George Monahan, director of  industry studies for the Securities Industry Assn., a trade group.  </P> <P> Phones along Wall Street are ringing off the hook as traders and brokers search  for more stable employment. Drexel Burnham's collapse has left thousands of  employees scrambling for jobs and created enormous uncertainty about the future  of other firms that relied heavily on junk bonds.  </P> <P> Yet employment prospects in financial services have soured far beyond Wall  Street. Scandals and huge losses have hurt job prospects at many savings and  loans, for example. But it is Wall Street, which has lost at least 40,000 jobs  since 1987, that has suffered the most visible and dramatic decline.  </P> <P> For youthful job seekers, the message is stark: "There's a recognition on Wall  Street that one can no longer get rich just by getting an MBA and putting in 90  hours a week," said Joan Zimmerman, executive vice president of GZ Stephens, a  New York executive search firm that specializes in the financial community.  </P> <P> "Investment banking will go back to the way it was before the 1980s: People  will have apprenticeships at the start of their careers."  </P> <P> Layoffs also have hit virtually every major brokerage firm, due to the long  decline in "retail" volume, the stock purchases that individual investors make.  Some 14,000 retail stockbrokers have lost their jobs since the crash of  October, 1987, the Securities Industry Assn. reports. And Wall Street still is  believed to have 25% more employees than it needs.  </P> <P> Even those who retain investment jobs have lost some of the rewards they  enjoyed at the peak of the opulent '80s. Year-end bonuses for investment  bankers were down roughly 25% last year.  </P> <P> Ironically, one of the few growth areas on Wall Street may come from the need  to fix the many ailing leveraged buyouts and other junk-laden corporations.  Many of those who helped put those fragile deals together may find work helping  the firms straighten out their balance sheets in order to survive the 1990s,  some recruiters say.  </P> <P> To be sure, the grim job outlook in the financial services industry hasn't been  lost on business school students, who understand the laws of supply and demand  as well as anyone.  </P> <P> "The pipeline is drying up on both sides," said Doyle Lyons, an analyst at  Merrill Lynch who follows the securities industry. "There is less hiring, and  fewer MBA students are interested."  </P> <P> At Stanford's Graduate School of Business, for instance, the number of  graduates taking jobs in investment banking fell from 23% of the Class of 1987  to 7% of the Class of 1989, according to spokeswoman Cathy Castillo.  </P> <P> "Those that are interested in investment banking are finding good jobs, but  there are just not as many of them," she added.  </P> <P> Nor is there any one field that students are flocking to instead of investment  banking. That old standby of business school graduates -- management consulting  -- remains hot, ranking first among Stanford graduates, with 16% of them taking  consulting jobs in 1989.  </P> <P> In general, students seem to be weighing a more diverse array of possibilities  than their predecessors did in the go-go 1980s, according to Maureen McNulty,  director of Stanford's career management center.  </P> <P> "First-year business school students looking for summer jobs are looking at a  broader range of activities," McNulty said. "Management consulting is still No.  1, but manufacturing is stronger than it has been."  </P> <P> Careers in real estate investment also seem to be attracting more business  school students, despite the uneven housing market in Southern California,  which ranges from sluggish in the San Fernando Valley to brisk in the Antelope  Valley and the Inland Empire.  </P> <P> The San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors reports that it has attracted more  than 1,000 new members -- realtors and their associates -- in the last year.  "We haven't noticed any slowdown at all" in membership, board staffer Susan  LeRoy said. 'We're getting just as many new applications for membership as we  were getting before,' " she added.  </P> <P> Yet those realtors are splitting up a smaller pie than existed just a year or  two ago, and many marginal brokers may not last much longer. In January,  realtors sold 287 fewer existing houses in the San Fernando Valley than they  did a year earlier, a 27% decline, and more than 10,000 homes in the region  remained unsold on the market.  </P> <P> "A lot of people aren't buying because no one knows where the bottom is in  Southern California real estate right now," said Alex Auerbach, a spokesman for  the Los Angeles Board of Realtors, which represents, among other areas, the  city's affluent Westside.  </P> <P> With so many get-rich professions seemingly not quite as alluring as they once  were, what is there for a young go-getter to do in the 1990s?  </P> <P> Many erstwhile Wall Streeters will, of course, go into corporate America or  management consulting. And in a more closely knit global economy, international  business and entrepreneurship are likely to provide new opportunities.  </P> <P> Yet there also are clues that business in general may be losing some of its  luster among students these days. Interest in business careers among those  entering college last fall fell to the lowest level since 1983, according to  the annual survey of college freshmen by UCLA's Higher Education Research  Institute.  </P> <P> Moreover, a growing number of students may be gravitating toward fields that  reflect non-financial values, such as environmental science and counseling,  McCoy of UC Riverside maintains. It even seems possible that graduates in the  1990s will show greater interest in public service, a surprising epitaph to a  decade that glamorized greed on magazine covers.  </P> <P> Laina Warsavage, a project coordinator for Campus Compact, a group that  encourages public service work at 230 colleges, said: "I think students are  seeing other opportunities."  </P></p>

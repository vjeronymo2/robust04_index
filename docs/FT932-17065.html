			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Letter: Deaths do not equate Sir, Dominic Lawson ('The horror of dead children', March 27) overlooks the fact that one of the men shot in Northern Ireland was a member of the IRA. The children were not. The deaths do not equate. In the week that the children were being buried it was a very insensitive article. Cyril Ubsdell, 7 Kings Road, Benfleet, Essex SS7 1JP</p>

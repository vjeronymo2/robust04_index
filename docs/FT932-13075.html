			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Arts: Slice of vagrant life MOST OF us know too little about the two most crucial decades of British history: 1640-60. Any play from that era that gives us a fresh insight into that era is welcome, and Richard Brome's A Jovial Crew (1641), currently presented by the RSC in Stephen Jeffreys' adaptation, is - as a slice of history onstage - an amazement. It is about a troupe (and, by implication, troupes) of vagrants, who beg and perform to win their daily bread, who roam to escape conformism and to discover truth, and who seek to realise Utopia in England; and its central characters are young gentryfolk who take off and join the vagrant life. The play is a serious comedy, occasionally larded with juicy caricature and farce. But watching Jeffreys' version is an uneasy experience, especially if you are not one of those rare birds who have swotted up on the original. On the one hand, has Jeffreys, in 'improving' what was surely no masterpiece in the first place, hotted up the play's socio-political content? I am curious less on account of purism than because, to me the play's main interest is what it tells me about 1641. On the other, if Jeffreys simply wanted to make A Jovial Crew a better show, why has he not pruned it more? Three hours and a quarter is at least half an hour too long. The jovial crew, in Max Stafford-Clark's staging, could be a heap more jovial. Their biggest song-and-dance number features some very interestingly fierce choreography by Sue Lefton, in which the performers work themselves up to fever pitch, losing self-control as if in some 17th-century British Rite of Spring. This was fascinating and impressive, but did not fit into Brome's play. These problems apart, this is a powerful production. The beggars' life becomes vivid, serious, at times alarming (the women encounter attempted rape), at times hilarious (as when these new beggars beg in over-educated language). When the play reaches its happy ending, some characters choose to remain wanderers; and their words - 'I've a journey yet to go' - clearly echo Kent's dark words at the end of King Lear. Amid a lively and well-integrated ensemble, Ron Cook as the steward turned vagrant Springlove gives an exemplary performance: sombre, generous, wry, alert. In repertory at the Pit, Barbican Centre</p>

			<p><P> May 29, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Bush Administration is planning to change the mix of airplanes and  helicopters assigned to aircraft carriers, resulting in a Navy-wide loss of one  full carrier's worth of aircraft, according to a study by the Congressional  Research Service of the Library of Congress. Rep. George J. Hochbrueckner  (D-N.Y.), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, requested the study  as part of efforts by him and Long Island's four other congressmen to save the  F-14D jet fighter, which was cut from the 1990 budget by Defense Secretary Dick  Cheney. The F-14D Tomcat is manufactured by Grumman Corp. in Bethpage, N.Y.  Ronald O'Rourke, the naval analyst who prepared the study, said he learned that  the Navy is planning to switch in the 1990s from a combination of aircraft  carrier configurations to a standardized "transitional" air wing, for a  reduction of 126 to 128 aircraft.  </P></p>

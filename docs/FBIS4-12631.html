			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, April 12 (AFP)--A senior leader of Algeria's  outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) has blasted a government  decision to devaluate the dinar and ruled out plans to abide by  Algeria's future financial accords.    The decision to devaluate the dinar by 40 percent which went  into effect Saturday was "not in Algeria's interest," the  London-based AL-HAYAH newspaper quoted Rabah Kebir, FIS leader  outside Algeria, as saying in an interview published Tuesday.    Under a deal struck with the International Monetary Fund  (IMF), Algeria is to receive a 1-billion dollar loan. The  measure also opened the door for other financial aid to the  country.    "The move does not solve the financial crisis facing  Algeria.  It is worsening it," Kebir told AL-HAYAH in the telephone  interview, according to the daily which is published in several  Arab capitals.    "The front has said in the past its respect for loans  contracted by the former Algerian Governments but it announced  after the coup (scrapping of 1992 elections) that it would not  respect any new loans," Kebir said.    The FIS "considers any loan or any financial assistance from  any country as not beneficial for the Algerian people.    "These loans contribute to criminals who kill innocents in  the streets," he added.    The devaluation has triggered criticism in Algeria.    Islamic groups have said the government crackdown on  militants claimed more than 500 lives and was part of a plan to  "help the country swallow the IMF plan's impoverishing of the  masses."    Algeria's main trade union, the UGTA [General Union of  Algerian Workers], said it was unhappy that it was not included  in the IMF negotiations and will call for strikes if the effects  of the devaluation become unbearable for workers.    Other associations said the plan was not well-adapted to  social conditions in the country and have pledged to form an  "anti-IMF front."    After the devaluation, the dollar stands at 36 dollars.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Restructured FMT in the black on reduced sales FMT, the Brighton-based producer of sophisticated machining centres, lightened the gloom hovering over the UK machine tool industry by announcing it had made a first-half profit and won Pounds 1.7m of orders in June. Profit figures were not disclosed, but were struck on slightly lower turnover of Pounds 7.5m. The company has gone through a series of restructuring moves in the past year which have reduced employment from 450 to just over 200. Mr Mike Bright, chairman, said he had 'high hopes' that the company could remain in profit this year, even though the effects of reduced order intake in the UK over the past months had not yet fed through to the results. The recent batch of orders includes more than Pounds 1m to rebuild seven machine tools for two customers, Cummins Engine and Rockwell. In addition, two new machining centres have been ordered by Crosrol, the textile machinery manufacturers. Together with pallet stands, these are valued at more than Pounds 650,000 and will extend two machining cells already installed. FMT, formerly called KTM, was acquired in 1988 by Mr Bright and five senior managers in a Pounds 10.6m buy-out from Vickers, the engineering group.</p>

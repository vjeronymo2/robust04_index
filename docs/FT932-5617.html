			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Japan's corporate investment falls JAPANESE corporate investment will fall for the second year running in the year to next April, the most severe contraction since the early 1970s, according to a wide-ranging survey published yesterday by the Ministry for International Trade and Industry (Miti). The survey of 1,591 large companies found they planned to cut investment by 2.8 per cent this financial year, after a 9 per cent drop last year. It will be the first time since 1971 and 1972 that corporate investment has fallen for two years running. The cutbacks are in response to the squeeze on corporate profits following heavy investment during the late 1980s by both manufacturers and service companies. Continued corporate retrenchment, combined with stagnant personal consumption, means public sector spending on social infrastructure will continue to be the main domestic source of growth in the Japanese economy until corporate profits and consumer spending recover. The survey found that steep falls in manufacturing investment more than offset increases planned by service companies. Manufacturing investment in facilities and equipment is expected to fall by 14.6 per cent next year after an 18.2 per cent drop last year. Investment in the car industry will fall by 17.5 per cent, in steel by 22.1 per cent and chemicals by 20.8 per cent. The private sector advisory panel which oversaw the survey said it was concerned that the cuts increasingly included spending on research and development which were vital for companies' long-term competitiveness.</p>

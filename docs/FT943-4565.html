			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Leading Article: John Major's Europe The British prime minister has lost no time in responding to the challenge implicitly thrown out last week by his French and German partners when they outlined their separate, but overlapping, visions of the future development of the European Union. In his speech at Leiden yesterday, Mr Major welcomed 'their emphasis on a more flexible Europe'. Recalling his own preference for a multi-speed Europe in which some states 'should integrate more closely or more quickly in certain areas' than others, he nonetheless insisted that such development must be acceptable to all member states, and that 'no member state should be excluded from an area of policy in which it wants and is qualified to participate'. The French and German proposals have thus had the merit of obliging Britain to clarify its views. Mr Major named three areas 'where conformity is right and necessary', which apparently means that there must be no opt-outs. These areas are international trade, the single market and - perhaps more surprisingly, but logically - the environment. (He should probably have added immigration, but this is an area the British government has not yet clearly thought through.) Everything else, in Mr Major's vision, is a la carte. He claims a leading role for Britain in foreign policy and defence, while recalling that, on stage three of economic and monetary union, 'I have thought it right to reserve the United Kingdom's position, and still do'. Clearly what causes him anxiety is the attempt by the German Christian Democrats, and perhaps also (though this is less clear) by the French prime minister, to define a 'hard core' of leading member states, for which full membership of Emu would be an essential qualification. That would indeed be matter for concern if the proposal were to exclude non-members of Emu from participating in such things as the common foreign policy or common defence. But no one has actually proposed that. The CDU proposal is almost as much analytical as prescriptive: it says that leadership in the EU must come from a hard core of countries which 'participate as a matter of course in all policy fields, but should also be recognisably more community-spirited in their joint action than others'. The CDU thinks that core will initially consist of only five countries, but 'must be open to every member state willing and able to meet its requirements' and must indeed seek actively to involve other member states more closely. The only point on which it clearly differs from Mr Major is in refusing to allow him a veto on the efforts of other countries to move ahead in areas for which Britain is not ready. Britain's pretention to such a veto must in the long run be politically unsustainable. For the rest, Britain will no doubt retain the right to opt out of Emu and other aspects of the EU that it does not like. But the more it exercises that right, the more it will exclude itself from the EU's central leadership.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 24 (TANJUG) -- The Serbian parliament,  acting on a motion by the Democratic Party of serbia (DS), will  soon examine abuses in the privatization process. DS leader  Zoran Djindjic has submitted to parliament an amendment to the  law on the conditions and procedure of transforming public  property, said the DS press office on Tuesday. The amendment  envisages a revaluation of all deposits made during 1993, when  annual hyperinflation soared to a record 116 trillion per cent.    The DS believes that the abuses in the privatization process  had taken place during the hyperinflation, because public  property was sold at a price which was as many as hundred times  less than its real value. The DS moved that an agency in charge  of evaluating and revaluating the public capital examine what  was the price of the shares enterprises had sold to their  employees. It also proposed that experts determine the value of  the public capital as against the German mark according to the  market rate of exchange on the payment date.    The privatization process was made official under the  federal  law on public capital, adopted in 1990, prior to the  disintegration of the former Yugoslavia. Serbia and Montenegro,  who constituted the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1992, have  been enforcing their respective laws on public property  transformation since 1991.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / International Company News: Banco Santander sells 1.47% Banesto stake Banco Santander has sold 1.47 per cent of Banesto, the troubled bank it took over earlier this year, to La Caixa, the Barcelona-based savings bank. The deal could foreshadow wider agreements between the two leading domestic financial institutions. La Caixa, which paid Pta7.4bn (Dollars 57.4m) for the stake, said the acquisition, an unprecedented investment by a savings institution in a leading commercial bank, was a 'purely financial investment'. It rejected speculation that it formed part of a 'non-aggression pact' with Santander. The savings bank paid Pta830 per Banesto share, well below the average trading price during August of more than Pta1,000 for Banesto stock. Santander had paid Pta762 per Banesto share when it took control of the bank in April. It emerged, however, that the purchase, which makes the savings bank Banesto's fourth largest shareholder, coincided with a Pta13.6bn sale by La Caixa to Santander in early August of 0.7 per cent of its equity in Telefonica, the national telecommunications company. La Caixa, ranked second after Italy's Cariplo among European savings banks, earned Pta5bn in capital gains from its Telefonica share sale to Santander. The disposal lowered La Caixa's equity in Telefonica to 1.3 per cent although it remains one of its largest individual shareholders. Market sources believe that there could be further deals between La Caixa and Santander, which has become Spain's leading commercial bank after its takeover of Banesto. Santander now holds 68.4 per cent of Banesto and intends to cut this to about 50 per cent.</p>

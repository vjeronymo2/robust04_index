			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / International Company News: Dutch state gives ground on Fokker deal THE PURCHASE of a 51 per cent stake in Fokker, Holland's financially troubled aircraft manufacturer, by Deutsche Aerospace (DASA) moved a step closer last night when the Dutch government accepted sharply revised terms. However, a difference remains over the level of state support for redundancies. The Dutch government, which holds a 10.6 per cent stake in Fokker, says it remains committed to 'an economically viable take-off' of the planned airline consortium. But in a letter to DASA, the aerospace subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz, Mr Koos Andriessen, Dutch economic affairs minister, said The Hague could not accept 'the open-ended support' on redundancies demanded by DASA in a final offer earlier this week. In that letter, DASA asked for broad 'support in adjusting the capacity of Fokker to an appropriate and sustainable level', but the vague wording of this clause kept alive hopes that a mutually acceptable accommodation dan be reached in the near term. Under the terms of the revised deal, which is aimed at raising some Fl 720m (Dollars 396m) in new liquidity for the troubled group, Fokker will issue some 13.2m shares at Fl 30 per share for a total of Fl 396m, to a newly formed holding company 51 per cent controlled by DASA. This will bring the total number of outstanding shares to 46.7m. In a second stage, Fokker will seek an additional Fl 334m on the open market through a subordinated convertible loan subscribed by DASA and underwritten by the Dutch state. The Hague will exchange its stake in Fokker for a 22 per cent share in the newly formed holding, and will subscribe to the loan offer and will receive Fl 196m in two tranches. The total purchase price for DASA will be about Fl 685m. Under the terms of the original deal, signed last October, DASA was to pay DM800m (Dollars 506.3m) for its 51 per cent stake in Fokker which it was seeking to acquire as part of its bid to create a new European airliner consortium. However, DASA demanded renegotiation of terms early this year, arguing that the financial and business position of Fokker had deteriorated sharply in the interval. Fokker gained Fl 1 to close at Fl 10.50 yesterday. The Dutch government's counter offer to DASA comes after a week of intense speculation about Fokker's financial position, following the cancellation of a number of important orders and the deterioration in the global civil airliner market. Regional and commuter aircraft manufacturers such as Fokker have been particularly hard hit. At the same time, the government has been under intense pressure to avoid a repeat of the debacle at Daf, the Eindhaven-based truckmaker which financially collapsed and was forced to seek protection from its creditors earlier this month. In a letter to parliament, Mr Andriessen likened the government's position to steering a course 'between Scylla and Charybdis'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Jiang Zemin Inspects Zhongshan, Visits Shoe </F> Factory"]    [Text] Chinese President and CPC General Secretary Jiang  Zemin is now on an inspection tour of Guangdong. In the company  of Xie Fei, CPC Political Bureau member and Guangdong provincial  party committee secretary, and of other officials, Jiang Zemin  arrived in Zhongshan the day before yesterday [16 June]. He met  with some Taiwan businessmen who were running investment  projects in the city, and visited a local Taiwan-funded shoe  factory. This is the second inspection tour of Guangdong by  Jiang Zemin in the past nine months.    A reliable source told this reporter that Jiang Zemin and  his  entourage arrived in Guangdong on Wednesday afternoon (15 June).  After staying in Guangzhou for one night, they left for  Zhongshan by car on 16 June. On the afternoon of that day,  Jiang toured the city of Shiqi in the company of local party and  government officials. After that, he drove to Sanxiang to visit  the Baolong shoe factory, a local, wholly Taiwan-funded  investment.    According to an informed local source, the Baolong shoe  factory is the largest wholly Taiwan-funded enterprise so far  operating in Zhongshan. Employing several thousand workers, the  factory exports all its products abroad.    Having had a brief chat with the Taiwanese hosts in the  factory's reception room, Jiang Zemin visited two production  workshops.    Jiang Zemin stayed at the Zhongshan Hot Spring Guest House  the night before last [16 June]. Yesterday morning, he met at  the guest house with some Taiwan businessmen who are running  investment projects in Zhongshan, mainly to solicit their  opinions on the local investment environment.    The informed source believed that Jiang Zemin obviously had  a  strong motive behind his behavior of particularly highlighting  his concern about Taiwan-funded enterprises during his current  inspection tour of Guangdong Province. After the Qiandao Lake  case, the idea of "independence for Taiwan" has been activated  daily in Taiwan. The CPC higher leadership's response to this  development is to increase its economic influence on Taiwan,  while using the mass media to strongly criticize Li Teng-hui's  "radical" remarks. In light of their successful experience in  dealing with the United States regarding the most-favored-nation  status issue, the CPC higher authorities have made up their  minds to play the "economic card" with Taiwan. Recently,  high-ranking CPC officials have paid visits to Taiwan-funded  enterprises across the country. For instance, Wang Zhaoguo,  head of the United Front Work Department and director of the  Taiwan Affairs Office, made an inspection tour of Jiangxi and  Hubei. Wang Daohan, chairman of the Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait, with association Vice Chairman Tang  Shubei, visited Zhejiang and Jiangsu. All of them assumed a  "high posture" toward Taiwan businessmen during their inspection  tours. So it is believed that Jiang Zemin's current visit to  Guangdong will bring this round of the great united front work  offensive to a climax.    Jiang Zemin last visited Guangdong in late September last  year. During that inspection tour, he called the party and  government leaders of the six central-south provinces to meet in  Guangzhou to solicit their opinions on the macroeconomic  regulation and control operation. He also went to Zhanjiang to  inspect the South China Sea Fleet, in his capacity as chairman  of the Central Military Commission.    Apart from the inspection of Taiwan-funded enterprises,  Jiang  Zemin's current visit to Guangdong also will focus on state-run  enterprises and on local scientific and technological  development. By the way, Zhongshan is one of the cities in  Guangdong Province selected to run pilot projects under the  "Torch Program" for the development of science and technology  sponsored by the State Science and Technology Commission.    Like his Shanghai trip earlier and like other leaders'  visits  across the country, Jiang Zemin's present tour has another  purpose: Conducting surveys in preparation for the Fourth  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, which is to  be held later this year.    The informed source disclosed that Jiang Zemin originally  planned to further his inspection tour from Zhongshan to Zhuhai,  but his plan to visit Zhuhai has been canceled for security  reasons following a major fire in Zhuhai earlier. His motorcade  left Zhongshan yesterday and turned northward. It is said that  he may pay a visit to Foshan and Sanshui, both under the threat  of flood. A Foshan resident said jokingly: "Jiang Zemin is not  coming at the right time; perhaps he is bringing the flood along  with him everywhere in Guangdong."</p>

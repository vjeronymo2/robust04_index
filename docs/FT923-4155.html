			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (14): Good ideas grounded - The US WHEN IT comes to personal communications, the US is bursting with ideas. Over the past two years, a staggering 156 companies have applied for licences to set up trial personal communications services or PCSs. But a complicated regulatory process and a wrangle over radio spectrum threaten to delay the introduction of commercial PCSs - a delay which analysts say could cost the US economy billions of dollars. PCSs - referred to in Europe as PCNs or personal communications networks - have been allowed to acquire a more flexible definition in the US than in Europe. In Europe, PCN has come to mean a version of the GSM digital cellular system employing smaller-sized cells and higher frequencies. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute has produced a detailed specification for it under the title of DCS-1800. All PCN operators in Europe will be obliged to make sure their systems conform to this standard. In the US, as long as a proposed PCS uses the appropriate frequencies and does not interfere with other services, the Washington-based licence awarding authority, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), cares little about the proposed technology. The result has been an explosion of enthusiasm and ideas about personal communications. PCSs, either already or soon to be in trial operation, range from enhanced versions of home cordless telephones allowing outgoing calls only when away from home, to PCN-like modified cellular radio systems with full two-way communications and uninterrupted conversations even when travelling at high speed in a car. Many US proposals for personal communications go well beyond the original European concept. Chicago-based Motorola, for instance, wants to create a global pocket phone system by mounting radio base stations on satellites. Telecoms giant AT&amp;T has joined up with the Californian based GO Corporation to develop a personal communicator which integrates voice, data, fax and electronic mail with handwriting recognition. The FCC - vital to the development of PCSs because of its regulatory function - has, under the chairmanship of Mr Alfred Sikes, been supportive of those looking to create these services. It has awarded over 130 licences for PCS trial systems across the US. But in spite of the will to be helpful, there are problems. The FCC's decisions are made by a panel of seven politically appointed commissioners, not all of whom are as enthusiastic about PCS as Mr Sikes. And the FCC itself is answerable to an unpredictable Congress. At the end of July, the FCC's PCS plans suffered a setback when a Senate committee moved to block the FCC's ability to free its proposed PCS band. The Senate move followed intensive lobbying by the utilities and emergency services which are the main users of the frequencies. In spite of an FCC proposal that PCS newcomers compensate incumbents for moving to new frequencies, the current users are proving reluctant to make the move. 'The microwave lobby is proving to be very stubborn. A feeling of not wanting to give up what you've got has taken hold,' says Mr Michael Vernetti, senior vice-president of Telocator, the trade association which looks after the interests of operators of mobile communications networks. Many also see problems with the FCC's licensing procedures. In particular, the system of first awarding trial licences, then later selecting commercial operators by lottery is causing friction with industry. 'The idea of spending hundreds of millions of dollars without knowing whether or not we would be able to profit from our investment is difficult to justify,' says Mr David Frear, vice-president and chief financial officer of New York-based Millicom, which, despite being one of the first recipients of a PCS trial licence in May 1990, suspended its PCS experiments at the end of 1991. The speed of the process is also under fire. In December 1991, Millicom filed an application to be allowed to operate wireless local telecommunications networks in the UK. Last month, Millicom was promised its licence. 'It's three years since we asked for authorisation to run a PCS from the FCC,' says Mr Frear. By the FCC's own admission, the process of awarding licences is a slow one. 'We have still not managed to award all of the cellular licences,' says an official. By its own calculations the FCC is unlikely to be able to award PCS licences before 1994. But this could easily slip into the second half of the decade, complains Mr Frear. Estimates of the economic impact of delays to PCSs run to billions of dollars. Mr Chuck Jackson, vice-president of the Washington-based firm of consulting economists, National Economic Research Associates (NERA), estimates the delay in authorising PCSs is imposing costs to the US economy of 'somewhere between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 10bn a year'. In a study not yet published, Mr Jackson and NERA colleagues Mr Jeffrey Rohlfs and Ms Tracey Kelly, show that the cost to the US economy of not licensing cellular when it was first technically feasible in the early 1970s was Dollars 86bn. 'And that's a very conservative estimate,' says Mr Jackson. If factors such as the effect on the competitiveness of US manufacturers were taken into account, he says, the figure would have been as high as Dollars 120bn. 'Whichever way you look at it, it's a lot per household in the US.' The FCC and the PCS lobby both hope that the House of Representatives will overturn the Senate's block on the FCC's PCS spectrum plan before Congress adjourns in October. By the time it meets again, there will be a new Congress. And probably at least a few new commissioners at the FCC. What happens then is anybody's guess.</p>

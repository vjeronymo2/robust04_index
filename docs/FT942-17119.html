			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Pakistan prepares for power crisis: Worst-case scenario predicts six-hour electricity cuts each day Pakistan is preparing for one of its worst power crises this summer as water levels at Tarbela and Mangla, two of the world's largest earth dams, and a large source of power generation for the country, remain critically low after a long dry spell. The worst-case scenario predicts at least six hours of power cuts a day, senior officials say. That forecast has added a sense of urgency to efforts for attracting new investments in the power sector. The government estimates the country will be short of almost 7,000MW of electricity within the next five years, almost 60 per cent of the present total generation capacity of almost 10,600MW. Efforts to cut waste could save up to 2,000MW. 'The most critical shortage of all in the economic sector is that of power which is holding up our production, investment and causing a lot of inconvenience to people,' says Mr VA Jafarey, adviser to the prime minister on finance. A recent report prepared by a government task force on energy forecasts that investment of up to Rs329bn (Dollars 10.8bn) would be needed to fill the gap. Only some Rs54bn in new private investments is currently projected, it notes. For the public sector to plug the gap 'is totally unrealistic' in view of budgetary constraints, the task force adds. Among incentives to attract investors, the task force has recommended increases in tariffs, and cutting down red tape. Increased domestic use has been partly fuelled by growing imports of air-conditioners and other electrical appliances. Domestic users account for 40 per cent of total generated power, compared with only 10 per cent in 1970. The proportion is estimated to rise to 52 per cent by the end of the decade. 'Every dollar you invest in power is now giving you a lesser return,' says one official, adding: 'This is an unsustainable situation'. The government is also preparing a bill to be sent to parliament this month to punish the theft of electricity with up to five years' imprisonment. Up to 23 per cent of the power generated by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the largest power generation and transmission company, is lost in transmission, breakdowns, leakages and corruption, some officials estimate. The government has also committed itself to privatising thermal power generation units of Wapda, which could together be worth Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn. Mr Shahid Hasan Khan, an economic adviser to Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, chaired the energy task force and supports a wider role for the private sector. He acknowledges the success of the initiative will depend on the extent to which foreign private investors can be attracted. Mr Michael Woodruff, chief executive of the Karachi-based 1,292MW Hub power project, expected to be fully commissioned by summer 1997, says that 'almost as important as money is time'. 'If you can put together a project in a shorter time somewhere else offering a similar rate of return, you'll go to that place.' The Hub project, biggest of its kind in Pakistan to be backed by the private sector, took almost six years to move from planning and arrangement of a financial package to the actual ground-breaking last year. Project sponsors had to deal with at least seven agencies. Mr Woodruff commends the government's decision to set up a 'one-window' operation at the Ministry of Water and Power to deal with all the needs of project sponsors. 'You have to convince those coming from outside, in particular, that the bureaucracy isn't going to be a problem,' he says. Other businessmen also want to see if the government is able to resolve political controversies, the most important being that surrounding the Kalabagh Dam project in Punjab province. Objections from Pakistan's North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) that the dam would cause flooding in a part of its territory have held up the project for well over five years. Ms Bhutto's government has recently backed the sacking of the NWFP government led by Mr Sabir Shah, an opposition leader, after a breakdown in the provincial administration due to the defection of at least six provincial MPs. If a new provincial government can be formed which supports Ms Bhutto's government, an agreement with Islamabad on the Kalabagh issue may be in sight. For a country where the lack of generation capacity may in future threaten economic growth, any rainfall in coming weeks helping to raise the water levels in dams would bring only temporary relief.</p>

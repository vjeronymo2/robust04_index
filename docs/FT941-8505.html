			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Lambeth dubbed a 'shambles' by chief There was 'a shambles at the very heart of the organisation' of Lambeth Borough Council mid-way through last year, Mr Henry Gilby, the London borough's chief executive, has told councillors, John Authers writes. He recommends department mergers and redundancies as part of the changes needed in the borough. Only eight directorates would report to the chief executive rather than the present 13. The changes would be part of Lambeth's attempt to answer criticisms in a report by the district auditor last year, which found that Pounds 20.2m had been spent unlawfully. Mr Gilby says the council's central support services unit for members is 'wholly unsatisfactory, confused and overmanaged', and 'developed in an ad hoc way that does not directly relate to the requirements of this section'. The corporate standards unit - charged with co-ordinating policy - 'had not had an appointed head for nearly two years' and its work had not been satisfactorily dealt with. The equalities unit 'has not had an appointed head for a very considerable period'. This meant that equalities had become marginalised. The two units would be merged. The information services and finance services departments would also be merged. The report is still at the draft stage and must be approved by councillors before further management action can be taken.</p>

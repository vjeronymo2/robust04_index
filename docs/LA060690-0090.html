			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARENTS' ROLE STRESSED AT LATINO EDUCATION HEARING  </P> <P> More than 150 parents, educators and business and community leaders from Los  Angeles County and beyond turned out Tuesday for a federal hearing on ways to  improve the educational track record for Latino students.  </P> <P> Many sought funds for specialized programs, bilingual teachers, anti-dropout  projects and new schools and updated equipment.  </P> <P> But the dominant theme of the hearing, the last held on a five-city tour by  President Bush's Task Force on Hispanic Education, was parental involvement.  </P> <P> "Data has repeatedly shown that parental participation is the most critical  factor behind the achievement of high levels of academic performance among all  age categories and ethnic groups," U.S. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos  said in opening the hearing at the county Office of Education in Downey.  </P> <P> Last spring, Cavazos, the first Mexican-American to hold a Cabinet-level post,  angered Latino leaders by saying parental attitudes are responsible for many of  the achievement problems of Latino students, including a high school dropout  rate nearing 40%.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, noting that Latino youngsters will represent 20% of the school-age  children in the United States by the year 2080, Cavazos said, "The future  prosperity of cities like Los Angeles depends on how well we educate our  children," especially those most likely to founder in the present public  education system.  </P> <P> "Sadly, Hispanic students are a disproportionately large part of this at-risk  category," Cavazos said, adding that the problem becomes more urgent as the  proportion of young Latinos entering the work force continues to increase.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, Latino students make up nearly 50% of all public school  students. In the giant Los Angeles Unified School District, the proportion is  62%, or 372,221 students. About 55% of the 18,131 who dropped out of the class  of 1989 were Latinos, according to Supt. Leonard Britton.  </P> <P> "Those who do not value education will find not the 'American Dream' but the  harsh reality of limited opportunities and frustrated hopes," Cavazos said.  </P> <P> But Gabriel Alvarez, a parent who serves on a school district advisory  committee, said Latino parents want to participate but often are made to feel  unwelcome or feel they do not speak English well enough.  </P> <P> "The Spanish community is being offended by Dr. Cavazos' saying they don't want  to participate. They would like to," Alvarez said.  </P> <P> Although she did not testify, Sylvia Corona, a mother of three who works a  swing shift and volunteers at Belvedere Elementary and Belvedere Junior High  schools, attended the hearing with other East Los Angeles mothers "because I  want to be involved. . . . I want a better education for my kids."  </P> <P> Stuart E. Gothold, superintendent of the county education office, said schools  have a responsibility "to make all parents welcome."  </P> <P> City School Supt. Britton, in seeking federal dollars, told the 10-member task  force that "parent-education programs are critical. . . . (Parents) are the  most important models for Hispanic young people."  </P> <P> And Board of Education member Leticia Quezada said Cavazos' remarks about  Latino parents not putting a high value on education "were a literal slap in  the face to those parents that are trying, that are learning English and  meeting with the teachers."  </P> <P> Quezada and others testifying Tuesday agreed with Cavazos that it is important  for students -- and their parents -- to learn English without losing their  ability to speak Spanish.  </P> <P> Cavazos said testimony from Tuesday's hearings -- which were expected to last  into the evening -- will be added to that gathered in San Antonio, Chicago,  Boston and Miami. It will form the basis of a report that he hopes will be the  "blueprint for positive action . . . to improve the educational quality" for  Latinos.  </P> <P> He said he expects to send the report to the President by the end of the  summer.  </P></p>

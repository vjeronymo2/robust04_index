			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Leading Article: TUC's right step The last 15 years have largely stripped the UK trade union movement of the negative, obstructionist image of the past. It is no longer fashionable to blame unions for the UK's labour market failures. But shedding a negative role is not the same as acquiring a positive one. Finding such a role need not take another 15 years, but it will take a willingness to transcend old-style collectivism. Collective workers' rights were viable as long as employees were more or less homogeneous, and union membership was high. Neither condition holds today. The new framework of UK employee rights currently under discussion at the Trades Union Congress would not entirely equip the movement for the new era. But it is an important step in the right direction. The proposals for a new system of UK employee rights, published in yesterday's FT, will not be formally agreed until next week, and may undergo significant revision. But the draft blueprint is encouraging. It shows that Mr John Monks, the new general secretary of the TUC, has recognised that the current complexities of UK labour law provide a golden opportunity for a post-collectivist union movement to prove its worth. The UK labour law system is an increasingly unworkable product of two distinct approaches to worker rights. The first is traditional contract law, under which trade union rights are expressed as collective immunities. The second rests on the positive individual rights embedded in some domestic and, increasingly, European Union legislation. UK union leaders have often been unable to capitalise on moves towards legislating enhanced worker rights in the EU, because they remained wedded to the collectivist tradition. The drafters of the blueprint have made a creditable attempt to marry the UK tradition to the universal rights more common in European legislation. Doubtless, there will be many compromises with the different parts of the movement before a new framework, if any, gains majority approval at next year's TUC Congress. But Mr Monks has already managed to win converts to the new guiding ethos. The idea visible in these new proposals is that a post-collectivist union movement must address the concerns of all workers, not just of union members. Moreover, it must address them in a way that balances individual demands for security and protection from unfair treatment against the economy's need for labour flexibility and wage restraint. Few of the world's union movements have met the challenge successfully. But many have at least recognised its existence. The signs are that the TUC is at last beginning to join them.</p>

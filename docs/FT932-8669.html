			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Arts: Siobhan Davies premieres at Brighton - Dance Part of the fascination of dance is that it always hovers between being figurative and abstract. Though people talk of 'abstract ballets,' dance - as several choreographers have remarked - cannot be truly abstract, because it deals with bodies. Yet we keep seeing human beings, as they dance, become changing shapes of ideal geometry, or impersonal embodiments of pure rhythm. And this is only the beginning of the mystery, for the greatest choreography plunges us into the drama of forms. 'An abstract ballet,' a critic once said, 'is a ballet with more plot than a narrative ballet.' All the great choreographers, and many of the good ones, have been fully aware of this ambiguity. The British modern-dance choreographer Siobhan Davies has several times made it the conscious theme of her work - has made dances that hover between communicative drama and sheer dancing-about dance purity. I recall in particular Something to Tell, which she made in 1980 for London Contemporary Dance Theatre and which made a poetic dilemma out of the ambiguity of its dances. And, as the title of the new work she has made for her own company, Wanting to Tell Stories, tells you, she is back at this theme again. The six dancers maintain an almost constant flow of motion, with a wide dynamic range from phrase to phrase. The main emphasis is men and women alone or in pairs, and the main drama - as often in Davies's work - is about people's need to depend on another and at the same time to be independent of them. The piece (part of a double-bill, with last year's White Bird Featherless), derives much of its essence from its score by Kevin Volans: brisk, changeful, suggestive. The pendulum nature of Davies's dance style is itself emotionally suggestive. The dancers fall away from balance, decelerating as they do, and then scoop back up to recover balance. There are shades of retrospection and surrender in the fall, shades of aspiration and endeavour in the ascent. Motionless equilibrium is never achieved, and on the rare occasions that dancers hold a still pose they seem switched off - the pose is not charged with energy. There are, however, stories behind the dance's stories. The decor for the piece - two highly mobile fence-screens suspended from above - has been provided by David Buckland, who has designed for most of Davies's choreography and who is her partner in private life. As on many previous occasions, Buckland's decor keeps busily interrupting Davies's dances, helping them out intrusively, drawing attention to how beautifully it means to assist in dramatising the choreography, and frequently drawing attention away from the dance. Too bad the two screens couldn't have been given curtain-calls; they did wonderfully - but at the expense of everything else. Another problem is the different manners within the Davies dance company. In some ways the company's virtuoso is Gill Clarke. She has the most striking dynamic range, the most striking legato fluency. But she exists in a cocoon; she only knows how to make her own inner world real onstage. And there is a hark-at-me self-consciousness about her dancing that distracts from the dance. The other dancers have a kind of innocent attack and an absorption in a larger stage world that makes Davies's choreography more interesting. In this respect, Paul Douglas is outstanding here. His behaviour is completely modest, and yet he makes the dance, and his role in it, adult, affecting, poignant. Gardner Arts Centre, Brighton. Siobhan Davies then tours to Harlow (May 18-19), Exeter and Dundee</p>

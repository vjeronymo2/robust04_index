			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Dispute over membership to Northern Ireland Select Committee Government and opposition business managers are thought to be trying to resolve a continuing dispute over membership of the Northern Ireland select committee ahead of next week's meeting of the cross-party committee of selection which will decide the MPs to sit on the new body, David Owen writes. Labour is understood to be continuing to object to Conservative proposals which would restrict the party's membership on the 13-seat body to two MPs. The Liberal Democrats are also thought to be objecting to the proposals, under which they would have no representation on the committee at all. MPs voted to set up the committee earlier this month. It is expected to start work shortly after Easter.</p>

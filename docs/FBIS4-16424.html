			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The present summit introduced several innovations to  the organizational structure of the CIS. Leaders of CIS  coordinating bodies -- Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the  Interparliamentary Assembly, Defense Council Chairman Pavel  Grachev, Andrey Kozyrev, chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Council, and Andrey Nikolayev, chairman of the Council of  Commanders of CIS Countries' Border Troops -- took part in its  work for the first time. A one-year term was set today for the  rotation of the leaders of the statutory bodies of the CIS.  This means that Boris Yeltsin and Viktor Chernomyrdin will  continue to carry out the functions of chairman of the Council  of Heads of State and chairman of the Council of Heads of  Government until 31 December 1994. The CIS heads of state also  approved the symbols -- the flag and emblem -- of the  Commonwealth of Independent States, viewing this graphic image  as a powerful and developing tree, a chalice bringing people  light and warmth, and wings of birds in a single formation. The  next meeting will, therefore, be held under the sky blue flag of  the CIS. That meeting is scheduled to take place on 9  September.</p>

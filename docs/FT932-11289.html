			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / People: Poulson to move to Farnell Howard Poulson, chief executive of Volex, the electrical and electronic connection products group, has been appointed group chief executive at Farnell Electronics, the Harrogate-based electronic components and equipment manufacturer and distributor. Poulson, aged 50, is expected to take up his new appointment before October. He joined Volex in 1990 as managing director and chief executive and has played an important role in revamping the group. Having graduated in engineering and metallurgy from Imperial College, London, he entered industry by joining Lucas in 1964 and was technical director of Lucas Industrial Systems between 1981 and 1985. Before joining Volex, he worked for Dobson Park Industries, where he was main board director responsible for the industrial electronics division. His appointment to Farnell is seen as a further indication that the group, which once had a reputation for being a somewhat introverted business, is now much more outward- looking and determined to continue its expansion. Farnell has been looking for a group chief executive since Richard Hanwell became chairman in June last year in succession to Ray Kidd. Hanwell's arrival was quickly followed by the acrimonious departure of Eric Hall, the previous chief executive of Farnell's manufacturing division. Since then the new chairman has restructured Farnell's manufacturing division, dividing it into three product sectors, each with its own managing director and with Andrew Lamming as divisional chief executive. Farnell also announced yesterday the promotion of Chris Emptage, 43, from deputy to managing director of the UK-based Farnell Electronics Components company, the largest and most profitable business in the group. Allan Daniel, currently managing director of FEC, will now concentrate fully on his role as chief executive of the coredistribution division.</p>

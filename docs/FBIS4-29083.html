			<p>BFN     [Text] At the upper house Budget Committee session on 14  June, Defense Agency Director General Atsushi Kanda expressed a  positive stance toward introduction of the Theater Missile  Defense (TMD) System.    In response to questions by Councillors Taizo Nozawa and  Fumio Saito on Japan's defense system to counter threats from  the DPRK's (North Korea) "Nodong-1" missiles, Kanda said: "We  do not presently have an adequate defense system. We must have  some sort of large-scale air defense system, such as the TMD."    The United States is planning to develop the TMD with the  participation of Japan and other nations; and, at the Japan-U.S.  security talks in March, foreign and defense ministers of the  two nations agreed to "continue talks" on whether Japan should  join the project. However, the Japanese Government has not so  far determined its official policy on the project.</p>

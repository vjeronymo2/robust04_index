			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Macedonia's Albanians fear ethnic bloodbath ETHNIC divisions have deepened in Macedonia, threatening to shatter the fragile coexistence between Macedonians and ethnic Albanians as the former Yugoslav republic waits in limbo for international recognition. Leaders of Macedonia's Albanians, who comprise about one-third of the 2m population, fear a violent conflict in the southern republic following riots this month. Serious unrest in Macedonia, in the heart of the Balkans, could trigger intervention by some or all of its neighbours, Serbia, Albania, Greece and Bulgaria. Greece has blocked international recognition on the grounds that the name Macedonia is Hellenic property. But Mr Sami Ibrahimi, vice-president of the Party for Democratic Prosperity, the biggest Albanian party, says the controversy surrounding the name Macedonia is 'a very small problem compared to the inter-ethnic problems here'. Mr Muhamed Halili, a deputy in the Macedonian parliament, says Albanians are now debating whether to continue to participate in official institutions after four people were shot to death by police in the riots on November 6. Ethnic Albanians went on the rampage in Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, when rumours swept the city that a 14-year-old Albanian cigarette seller had been beaten to death by the police. Ironically, Albanian leaders claim police incited the unrest in Bit-pazar, Skopje's oriental market which has become a centre of the black market, in order to hasten international recognition. 'They are trying to show Europe and the world that there could be more trouble and problems if Macedonia is not recognised,' says Mr Ibrahimi. The Albanians have four cabinet ministers in the government. Although a minority, they are better integrated into Macedonia than the majority Albanian population in neighbouring Kosovo, the southern Serbian province. But the events of November 6 appear to have been a watershed. 'Albanians are now faced with a choice whether to stand behind the people or the government,' says Mr Saso Ordanovski, an independent journalist in Skopje. He says the police may have used excessive force in suppressing the riots, but fears that Albanian extremists are using the incident in order to force Albanian leaders to pull out of the ruling coalition. Mr Ljubomir Frckovski, the interior minister who has ordered an investigation into the riots, says: 'Albanians and Macedonians share a collective memory of living together without ethnic conflict.' But he fears the 'imported influence' from Serbia and Albanians abroad could destabilise Macedonia. 'The behaviour of the police can lead to violent conflicts in Macedonia which will be a real catastrophe even compared to the Bosnian war,' says Mr Ibrahimi. 'I am certain that the neighbouring countries would be involved - even Turkey and Hungary - the third world war could start right here,' he says. For the time being Macedonian and Albanian politicians are calling for a dialogue in order to find a solution. Mr Ibrahimi says that if this fails, 'Macedonia will disappear and become a piece of cake for the neighbouring countries'.</p>

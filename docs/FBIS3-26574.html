With an annual production capacity of 2,000 tons, it is said  to be the third-biggest in the world.    Located in the Yunnan Tianli Bio-Fermentation Plant, the  line's main equipment was designed, manufactured and installed  by China, at a cost of over 60 million yuan (about seven million  U.S. dollars).    A high-tech product, itaconic acid is a non-saturation  binary  organic acid, widely used in the chemicals, pharmaceuticals,  building materials, ion-exchanging and light industries.    China started research into the acid in 1958, and the  project  was listed as a state key project of the Eighth Five-Year Plan  period (1991-1995).    During two years of trial production the plant produced over  300 tons of itaconic acid, which was exported to Japan, the  United States, New Zealand and Australia.    Sugar is the main raw material in itaconic acid, and Yunnan  is one of the biggest sugar producers in China, with a total  output of one million tons last year.    Itaconic acid was first discovered in the United States in  1936, but because of complicated production technology,  large-scale production only started, in the United States and  Japan, in the early 1980s.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 27 (CNA) -- Vietnam and Taiwan will  soon sign an agreement on the avoidance of double taxation, Le  Sinh Tang, new director of the Vietnam Economic and Cultural  Office in Taipei, said Friday [27 May].    "Negotiations are under way to remove the last and small  obstacle to the proposed pact," Le, who assumed his post on May  19, said.    Le, a former Hanoi vice mayor, said he expects trade and  economic exchanges between his country and Taiwan, especially in  tourism and agricultural and technological cooperation, will  continue to increase.    Taiwan is currently the largest source of foreign investment  in Vietnam, having pumped US$1.5 billion into the country as of  the end of last month. Both nations earlier this year signed an  investment- guarantee agreement.    The Vietnam Economic and Cultural Office was set up in  Taipei  early last year, with Dao Duc Chinh, a former Foreign Ministry  official, as acting director. He is now serving as Le's deputy.    Le refused to comment on the possibility that Vietnamese  Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet might visit Taiwan.    Vo, while taking part in the annual conference of the  Pacific  Basin Economic Council in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week said he  would be willing to visit Taiwan if invited.    Le, however, said many obstacles would have to be removed  before Vo could visit, given the absence of diplomatic relations  between the two countries.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARSHALL RALLIES SADDLEBACK, 65-61  </P> <P> Left for dead midway through the first quarter -- when it trailed 11-1 -- and  seemingly just hanging on throughout the game, the Saddleback High School boys'  basketball team somehow found a way to beat Lakewood, 65-61, in overtime in the  semifinals of the Southern Section 5-AA playoffs before an overflow crowd of  3,200 Friday at Rancho Santiago College.  </P> <P> A good portion of that somehow was 6-foot-1 guard Craig Marshall, who scored 21  points, many on attempts that ranged from far-fetched to simply far.  </P> <P> "This game was Craig Marshall's," said Malru Dottin, Saddleback's center. "He  sparked all of us. They were dropping three guys in on me and I just threw the  ball out to him and let him do the job, and he did."  </P> <P> It was a spinning, reverse, two-handed layup by Marshall that drew Saddleback  (27-1) to within 52-50 with 2:32 left in regulation. Marshall was fouled on the  play by Lakewood forward Brian Camper, who came into the game averaging 21  points a game. Camper, who had 11 points Friday, fouled out on the play.  Marshall missed the free throw but rebounded the shot and got the ball to  Dottin, whose five-foot jumper went in and came out.  </P> <P> Lakewood (23-7), which had a 30-23 lead at halftime and a 38-29 lead midway  through the third quarter, then scored to go up 54-50 with 1:28 left. But  Saddleback's Jimmy Galbert drove for a basket with 1:14 left, and Dottin made a  leaning eight-footer from the left side of the key that tied the score at  54-54, which is how it remained in regulation.  </P> <P> In overtime, Galbert drove for a basket and was fouled. His free throw gave  Saddleback a 57-54 lead with 2:48 left. After a Lakewood basket, Marshall made  a short jump shot to put his team up, 59-56.  </P> <P> Lakewood guard Tom Sellers made a three-pointer to draw Lakewood to within two  at 61-59 with 1:23 left. Saddleback spread its offense, and Marshall darted in  for a drive and basket with 47 seconds left. The teams traded baskets and  Saddleback had earned its first berth in a Southern Section basketball final.  </P> <P> "This whole thing is like a movie," said Pat Quinn, Saddleback coach. "We're  behind, behind, behind the whole game, but these kids stuck at them. They  wouldn't quit."  </P> <P> Marshall made three three-pointers in the first quarter, and Saddleback made  seven three-pointers in the game. Marshall's leaning 25-footer at the buzzer,  capped a six-point Saddleback surge that left it trailing, 16-13, at the end of  the quarter.  </P> <P> "We just weren't ready to play in the first quarter," Dottin said.  </P> <P> In the second half, it was Lakewood that seemed less than willing to play. The  Lancers used a spread offense for much of the half.  </P> <P> "We've played good defense all year and they seemed to get a little tentative  as the game went on," Quinn said. "Then the breaks started going our way."  </P></p>

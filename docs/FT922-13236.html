			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Four of the new faces around Major's cabinet table - Gillian Shephard: Employment secretary AS A former Treasury minister, Mrs Gillian Shephard will be on familiar ground this week as she attempts to come to terms with a set of grim economic indicators. One of her first duties as employment secretary will be to preside over the publication of the latest unemployment figures. Unemployment has risen for the past 22 consecutive months, reaching a seasonally adjusted figure in February of more than 2.6m. Last month's total will continue the trend. Even with her Treasury contacts, there are no indications that Mrs Shephard will be able suddenly to reverse the decline of government expenditure on measures to tackle unemployment. Since 1986-87 these programmes have experienced cuts totalling a fifth in real terms. Instead, Mrs Shephard will be relying on the assistance of another new appointee, Mr Michael Heseltine, at the Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Heseltine, will have his department strengthened as he takes on the employment department's old responsibilities for small businesses. Mrs Shephard will retain the primary responsibility for the employer-led Training and Enterprise Councils. While Mr Heseltine will also be charged with forging links with the Tecs, Mrs Shephard will find herself the primary focus of Tec lobbying over budgets and what is seen as a lack of flexibility in government contracts. Expectations may be raised that she will bring in measures to promote the position of women in the workforce, particularly since responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Commission will move to her department from the Home Office. Here, again, her room for manoeuvre will be strictly limited by restraints on expenditure - and exhortations to industry on equal opportunities may remain the only form of action.</p>

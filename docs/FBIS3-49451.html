[passage omitted]    President Lech Walesa, who took part in the government  meeting, left the Office of the Council of Ministers without  making any comment to the press. Olechowski said that the  president will take part in the Prague summit. According to the  foreign minister, the president -- like the government --  considers the Partnership for Peace proposal as insufficient,  which does not mean that he is against it. "If when jumping  across a hole in the ice your jump proves too short you have  every chance of falling in," Olechowski quoted Walesa as saying.    One of the Polish reservations about Partnership for Peace  concerns the lack of a time-frame for granting NATO membership.  "We perceive it as a process lasting several years," Olechowski  said. He recalled that even a few months ago there was no  mention of NATO opening up to new members and added that at  present the "partnership" makes our future participation in the  structures of the treaty plausible. In his opinion the  postponement in time of Poland's membership will not bring about  immediate negative effects because currently there is no  military threat. Olechowski said that he does not regard our  present position concerning NATO as a waiting-room situation but  rather as "being engaged to a girl who only yesterday said that  she was going to get married but did not say to whom." He  expressed the hope that Poland will be in the first group of  countries which NATO will incorporate in the future.    According to Olechowski, as far as democratic standards and  the development of the military sector are concerned, Poland is  no more lagging behind than was Greece when that country joined  the treaty. He said that issues related to the funding  necessary to implement the "partnership" program were also  discussed at the meeting. He emphasized that the pace of  bringing Poland closer to NATO will depend on our financial  contribution.    Asked whether he envisages a meeting with Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, if his visit to Poland takes place, Olechowski  said that his diary is full. "If I were to meet every member of  parliament, I would not be able to do my job," he said, adding  that Zhirinovskiy may enter Poland, but if he breaches our  interests, he will be taken back to the border with an  administrative visa</p>

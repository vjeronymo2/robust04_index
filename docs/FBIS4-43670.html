			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tim Coone: "Ulster Agreement Late, Says Spring"] </F>   [Text] Dublin -- A framework agreement on new  constitutional arrangements for Northern Ireland is unlikely to  be completed in time for next month's UK-Irish summit, Mr Dick  Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday.    Talks between the political parties in the province are not  expected to resume before the autumn because of slow progress by  the British and Irish governments in drafting the framework  document, which is intended to provide a focus for the talks.    The governments had hoped to publish the document to  coincide  with a planned bilateral summit next month, but following a  meeting of the UK-Irish inter-governmental conference in Dublin  yesterday, Mr Spring admitted it would be "difficult to meet  that timetable."    Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, said the  framework document, which will flesh out the principles  established in December's Downing Street declaration would not  be "a blueprint or template" to which the parties would have to  conform.    But he stressed that it would have to address modification  of  the Republic's territorial claim to Northern Ireland "if it is  to have any chance of success" in bringing unionists to the  negotiating table. "It is central to the problem," said Sir  Patrick.    Mr Spring said: "There has to be compromise on both sides,  by  both governments." Modification of the territorial claim would  be in the context of a "balanced accommodation" which would also  involve modifications to the Government of Ireland Act of 1920.    He referred specifically to Section 75 of the act, which  states: "The supreme authority of the parliament of the United  Kingdom shall remain unaffected and undiminished over all  persons and things in (Northern) Ireland and every part thereof."    Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has indicated that  it intends to give its "definitive response" to the Downing  Street declaration early next month -- but is not now expected  to recommend an end to the IRA campaign.</p>

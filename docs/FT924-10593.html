			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / N-plant workers will be laid off ONE THOUSAND white-collar contract workers engaged by British Nuclear Fuels to help get its Pounds 2.8bn Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant into commercial operation are being told this week they are to be laid off in a month's time, Chris Tighe writes.

But Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution, to which BNF applied several months ago for airborne and water discharge consents for Thorp, has yet to issue its draft authorisation.

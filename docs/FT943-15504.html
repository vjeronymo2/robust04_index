			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining share 'indigestion' approaching Mining companies have raised at least USDollars 5.584bn from the issue of shares and convertibles so far this year, topping the Dollars 4.84bn they collected in the whole of 1993. Mr Nick Hatch, analyst at the Ord Minnett financial services group, who collated the statistics, says last year's total 'looked a pretty impressive number' but 1994's will put it in the shade. There is at least another Dollars 2bn of equity potentially to be offered to investors during the rest of this year, he says, and warns: 'one can't help feeling that the gourmet grazing on mining equities is rapidly approaching indigestion'. He points out that shares in some of the big new issues in the first half of 1994 - Ashanti Gold Fields (which raised Dollars 320m); Santa Fe Gold (Dollars 252m) and Falconbridge (Dollars 1bn) are all trading below their issue prices. According to Mr Hatch, North American mining companies so far this year have raised Dollars 2.441bn; Australian companies have raised USDollars 1.731bn; European companies Dollars 631m; African companies Dollars 511m; and Dollars 270m was raised by mining companies based elsewhere in the world. He points out, moreover, that he has tracked only substantial issues and there were certainly more, particularly in North America, that were not included. Included in the total raised so far by Australian mining companies is the USDollars 525m being asked for by Western Mining to help pay for its deal with Alcoa of the US, announced this week. Other capital-raising operations expected this year include Royal Dutch/Shell's sale of some Australian mining assets for about USDollars 300m; the USDollars 450m flotation in Australia of a company with an interest in the proposed Lihir Island gold mine in Papua New Guinea; a share sale by Alcan Australia to net about USDollars 230m; and a rights issue by Comalco. Elsewhere in the world, a sale of shares in Outokumpu of Finland is to raise Dollars 276m; Metallgesellschaft is expected to sell its controlling interest in Metall Mining of Canada, which might raise USDollars 300m; while in the UK the London-listed Bakyrchik Gold will be seeking about Dollars 120m for expansion before the year-end. In North America nearly every substantial mining company has made a 'shelf' registration - an indication to the authorities that it might soon issue new shares. Zeigler Coal, the fourth-largest US coal company, recently announced it will raise about Dollars 160m.</p>

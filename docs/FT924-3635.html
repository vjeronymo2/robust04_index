			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Computer financial service launched MAID SYSTEMS, a privately owned, London-based electronic publisher, has secured deals with six large corporate information groups to establish a screen-based service in financial intelligence. The service, Companyline, will provide information from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Disclosure, Moody's, Extel Financial, ICC and Hemmington Scott, publisher of the Hambro Company Guide. It will be available from January 1. According to Maid - Market Analysis and Information Database - Companyline will provide access on computer screens to the financial results and reports of 4.5m companies in 40 countries. Credit ratings, brokers' analyses and directors' curriculum vitae will also be available. The new service will be in direct competition with Profile, owned by the Financial Times group, and the Swiss company DataStar together with Mead Data Central and Dialogue of the US. It will also compete with Reuter, the world's largest electronic publisher. Mr Daniel Wagner, Maid chief executive, seems to have pulled off something of a coup in persuading traditionally competitive information providers to agree to merge their information into a single global library. Pricing for Companyline has not been finalised. Typically, a short Dun &amp; Bradstreet report might cost Pounds 2 and a Moody's report Pounds 25. Maid Systems was founded by Mr Wagner in 1985. Its existing services are Researchline and Newsline. It has 3,000 subscribers including Boots, Cadbury Schweppes and Goldman Sachs. In 1992 it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 470,000 on sales of about Pounds 3.4m.</p>

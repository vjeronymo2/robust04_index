			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: UNCOVERING SOVIET WOMEN AND REAL EDDIE MURPHY  </P> <P> With the Berlin Wall down, Western magazines are charging in to give Americans  their first good peek behind the Iron Curtain.  </P> <P> The most revealing uncoverage to date may be "The Women of Russia," in the  February Playboy.  </P> <P> An accompanying article by photo editor Jeff Cohen details the relatively  ho-hum derring-do that went into capturing the naked truth about the evil  empire on film.  </P> <P> But if glasnost has taught us anything, it's that folks are all pretty much  alike underneath, right? Take away the backdrop of St. Basil's Cathedral and  the Lenin props, and you couldn't tell this layout from "The Girls of the PAC  10."  </P> <P> Elsewhere in the magazine, Eddie Murphy also reveals himself, in a sometimes  hilarious, frequently obscene, always intriguing interview with editor David  Rensin.  </P> <P> Astutely noting that "the press builds you up and tears you down; I'm in the  tear-down stage right now," Murphy remains in control of the interview. The  comedian turned multimillionaire mogul rather enjoys being feared by Hollywood,  he says.  </P> <P> Murphy repeatedly states that he wants to keep their conversations superficial.  But Rensin coaxes psychological revelations from the self-defined "matinee  idol."  </P> <P> Perhaps the most peculiar personality quirk unearthed is that Murphy -- who  lives in a Graceland-like New Jersey estate called Bubble Hill, who choked  director John Landis on the set of "Coming to America" and who sometimes  cruises through impoverished crack neighborhoods trying to talk users out of  their habit -- thinks of himself as normal.  </P> <P> Murphy comes across as a complex blend of sometimes conflicting traits. He's  bright, morally conservative (except for a decided lustfulness to which Jerry  Falwell might object), naively sexist, apolitical, socially conscious,  surprisingly humble, and a bit solipsistic.  </P> <P> But few readers are likely to find him normal. How normal, after all, is  someone who thinks that singer Michael Jackson's only abnormality is that "he  doesn't use profanity?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Brighter Side of the Greenhouse Effect  </P> <P> Next to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and other celebs, the greenhouse effect  is about the most popular subject in magazine-dom these days. Most mainstream  magazines accept that this projected global warming, attributed to the burning  of fossil fuels, is real, and to be avoided at all costs. A few, mainly  conservative publications, have dismissed it as another paranoid fantasy of  worrywart environmentalists.  </P> <P> Then, there is the libertarian monthly Reason, which believes that the  greenhouse threat is real all right, but says, "Hey, we can live with that."  </P> <P> Entitled "Keep Your Cool," the Reason article presents a clear paraphrase of  the scientists who argue that the 18 billion tons of carbon dioxide humanity's  cars and factories are pumping into the atmosphere is enough to tip the natural  balance and cause temperatures on the planet to rise 5 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit  over the next century (or two or three).  </P> <P> Author T. A. Heppenheimer, also agrees with scientists' assessment of the  problems this twist of the global thermostat will bring: hot weather, regional  droughts, major changes to ecosystems, and flooding of low-lying lands due to  the melting of Antarctic ice sheets.  </P> <P> But Heppenheimer's reaction to these "unpleasant" problems is markedly  different than the reaction of most.  </P> <P> Some environmentalists have suggested that we could stop the buildup of carbon  dioxides by halving worldwide consumption of fossil fuels, by halting  deforestation (trees make oxygen) and by replanting the clear-cuts.  </P> <P> With true libertarian sang-froid, Heppenheimer argues that such measures would  be intolerable, resulting in a worldwide economic collapse -- after all,  "carbon dioxide is a byproduct of industrial growth and of a prosperous  economy."  </P> <P> Rather, he suggests we look on the bright side -- the greenhouse will slow the  next Ice Age, and places such as Siberia will become Sunbelt hot spots.  </P> <P> The article's approach seems quite reasonable. Still, readers may find it hard  not to envision Heppenheimer in Bermuda shorts and flowered shirt, sipping a  tropical drink and listening to Bobby McFerrin as he spells out his solutions:  Don't worry -- the heat's going to take a long time to peak; be happy -- we'll  build more air conditioners and persuade the populations of New Orleans,  Sacramento, and dozens of other cities to move to higher ground.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Reputation of Getting Smarter  </P> <P> Well into its second year, Smart magazine is beginning to live up to its title.  The January-February issue packs between its covers an array of copy that is  both intelligent and -- to fit the more elusive definition of the word -- brisk  and stylish.  </P> <P> In one article, Loren Jenkins treats readers to a glimpse of the brave and  buffoonish exploits of Hunter S. Thompson. Bullets fly, peacocks squeal, trout  go belly up and tigers prowl as the father of gonzo journalism battles the  "greedhead " developers (one in particular) he thinks are trying to turn his  beloved Woody Creek, Colo., into a garish clone of neighboring Aspen.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, Adam Begley provides an interesting look at cult novelist Thomas  Pynchon's obsessively reclusive life; Spy magazine editor E. Graydon Carter  writes a surprisingly un-snide profile of "Saturday Night Live's" Gatsby-esque  producer, Lorne Michaels; and Robert Knafo presents a "demystification of  Jackson Pollock," titled "Sex, Lies, and Abstract Expressionism." (Magazine  editors: no more plays on that movie title, please).  </P> <P> And there's more: A slightly leering but entertaining look at Meg Ryan titled  "The Mysteries of the Orgasm"; an excerpt from journalist Rian Malan's new book  on returning to his native South Africa (a book that would seem to deserve all  the excerpting in magazines it has received); and a novella by author Jim  Harrison.  </P> <P> In his opening remarks, editor Terry McDonell quotes composer Gustav Mahler:  "If you think you're boring your audience, go slower, not faster." And there's  a sense that the editors -- unlike their more cynical comrades at so many of  the established publications with which Smart competes -- have stepped back,  taken a deep breath, and decided to actually care about everything that goes  into their book.  </P> <P> Even the short features and columns, by the likes of Bruce Jay Friedman, Eve  Babitz, and Tony Hendra, say something worth saying.  </P> <P> About the only item in the whole issue that smacks of the lazy pretentiousness  so prevalent in slick, hip magazines is a photo layout by German photo-artiste  Jaschi Klein. Featuring bleak landscapes littered with expressionless models,  it has all the clever imagination of an ad for Obsession perfume.  </P></p>

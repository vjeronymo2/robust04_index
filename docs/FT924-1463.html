			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / EBRD signs Dollars 10m telecoms loan pact THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the government of Albania have signed a Dollars 10m loan agreement for a telecommunications project. The bank has also been awarded a mandate to act as financial adviser on foreign investment in its chromium industry. The loan will help finance the modernisation and expansion of the telecommunications system in Albania. The expansion will almost double the number of subscribers in Albania, increasing the telephone density from 1.45 lines per 100 inhabitants to 2.25. The project is the first phase of a long-term development programme towards a digital network by the turn of the century. The European Bank's involvement with Albchrome, the Albanian state-owned chromium industry, will be assisted by a consortium of advisers providing technical assistance in legal, mining, accountancy and financial analysis. The bank has arranged for the financing of technical assistance contracts from funds made available from the US Agency for International Development. Albania is the third largest producer of chromium in the world.</p>

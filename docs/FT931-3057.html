			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Analysis): Mixed blessings for oil industry - Petroleum Revenue Tax THE OIL industry was caught by surprise yesterday by the extent of the chancellor's changes to the tax regime in the North Sea. He proposed a sharp reduction in the Petroleum Revenue Tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent for existing field and its elimination for new fields. But he also said tax allowances for the industry would be sharply reduced. Few in the industry had been expecting a significant overhaul of petroleum taxes and many producers were in disarray about whether they would lose or gain from the move. But the tax changes are likely to affect the way in which companies operate in the North Sea and raise the prospect of a substantial reduction in exploration in the area. In spite of the fact that some companies will see substantial gains from the changes, many North Sea operators were infuriated by the move which they believe will place an extra burden on the industry when oil prices are low and costs high. Mr Harold Hughes, who heads the industry group: the UK Offshore Operators Association, said: 'We're very concerned at the enormity of the change - it will decrease the amount of exploration in the North Sea and add to the cost burden the industry is facing.' Mr Hughes said that exploration costs for many companies could quadruple as they will be unable to write them off against Petroleum Revenue Tax. In the past, many companies have been able to fund their entire oil drilling programmes by reclaiming PRT they have previously paid on producing fields. This is why the regime cost the treasury Pounds 200m in 1991 to 1992. But some large North Sea operators such as British Petroleum which pay a lot of PRT on producing fields will benefit from the new tax regime. City analysts reckon that the reduction in the PRT rate from 75 per cent to 50 per cent along with other tax changes could add as much as Pounds 130m to Pounds 140m to BP's profits. Mr Fergus MacLeod, industry analyst at NatWest Securities in Edinburgh, estimates that BP will make a profit of Pounds 725m this year. The PRT benefit could increase its profits by 20 per cent next year. Shell is also likely to benefit by about Pounds 40m a year, he estimates. However, smaller exploration and production companies which have traditionally written off their exploration costs against PRT will be badly affected by the move. In addition, under the proposed changes, companies such as Lasmo and Enterprise Oil will not be able to transfer tax allowance benefits between fields in the North Sea so that they offset part of their development costs for new fields against tax paid on producing fields. The UKOOA challenged the chancellor's figures for revenue he expects to raise from the tax changes. Mr Lamont said the changes will raise Pounds 300m in 1994 to 1995 and Pounds 400m the year after. However, Mr Hughes believes the figues will actually be much higher. He said it could cut down the extent to which companies want to become involved in North Sea exploration. 'This will mean companies have to review their commitments to the next licensing round (for oil exploration acreage) and some partnerships could fall apart under the strain,' he said. The North Sea last year reached a production peak of over 2m barrels of oil a day and the chancellor is clearly hoping that the tax changes will not deter too many companies from exploration and production.</p>

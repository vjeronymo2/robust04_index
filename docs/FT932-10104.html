			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Warning over level of TV imports MS ANN CLWYD, the shadow heritage minister, strongly criticised the ITV companies in the Commons yesterday for relying too heavily on programmes imported from the US, Ivor Owen writes. She warned that there was a danger that the BBC would become 'the only significant source of original high-quality UK production'. Mr Robert Key, junior heritage minister, denied that the ITV companies were being swamped by American material and insisted that they were making programmes which were held in high esteem. Ms Joyce Quin (Lab Gateshead East) called for a review of the television franchise system, but Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, said it was too early to consider changes to the franchise arrangements which came into effect at the beginning of the year.</p>

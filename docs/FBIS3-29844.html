			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 22 KYODO -- Science and Technology  Agency head Satsuki Eda said Tuesday [22 February] the Japanese  Government expressed through diplomatic channels its regret that  Moscow plans not to accept an international ban on the dumping  of nuclear waste at sea.    "Even though all nations that had originally hesitated to  accept (the ban) have all fallen in step with the comprehensive  ban (on dumping), it is regrettable that only Russia remains out  of step," Eda told a press conference after a cabinet meeting.    Eda said Japan will continue to urge Moscow to accept the  dumping ban and offer technological cooperation in helping  Russia to manage and store its nuclear waste.    Russia registered its noncompliance on Friday to an  amendment  to the London Convention on Sea Pollution and will be the only  country of 72 signatories of the treaty to continue dumping  nuclear waste at sea.    Belgium, Britain, China and France, along with Russia, had  abstained on voting for the amendment when it was introduced  last November at a meeting of the International Maritime  Organization (IMO).    IMO officials said Monday that all of the countries, except  Russia, have now accepted the international ban.    The amendment was prompted by Russia's dumping of a large  quantity of liquid radioactive waste into the Sea of Japan last  October.</p>

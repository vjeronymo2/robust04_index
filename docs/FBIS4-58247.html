			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Week" column by 'Uzi Benziman: "Departure From </F> Oslo"]    [Text] An interesting -- some may say precarious -- trend  has emerged in Jerusalem policy-making bureaus with regard to  the Oslo agreements; it implies a departure from these  agreements. The new inclination is tacit, for the time being,  and no one will publicly admit it, but it is not one man's  domain. It is embraced by power centers at the Foreign Ministry  and, to a certain extent, by top IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  echelons. It has not taken root at the prime minister's bureau  yet, but experience shows that things which start brewing at the  Foreign Ministry never fail to touch Yitzhaq Rabin eventually.    Both the IDF and the Foreign Ministry would like to deviate  from the Oslo agreement timetables and move on at once (after  the agreement on the Gaza and Jericho withdrawal is signed) to  talks on the permanent arrangements. In both bodies, the  prevailing opinion is that adherence to the staged  implementation principle will generate a prolonged period of  terror that would best be skipped or reduced. It is believed  that when the PLO takes over in Gaza and Jericho, it will try to  curb terrorism in these districts and prevent terrorist attacks  in the Jewish enclaves under its rule. Yet it is clear to all  those who are involved in the negotiations that terror will  continue in the West Bank and inside the Green Line and that the  PLO will not go out of its way to prevent it. From 'Arafat's  point of view, continued terror spurs Israel to concessions and  makes territorial occupation abhorrent to it.    In view of these assessments, very senior IDF and Foreign  Ministry officials are saying that it would be preferable to  forgo negotiations on the West Bank autonomy (following the  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement) and broach the  permanent arrangement issue at once. There is another, more  moderate alternative: No official declaration concerning the  dissolution of the negotiations on the interim stage of West  Bank self-rule will be made. Rather, the interim stage will be  imbued with permanent arrangement contents.    Meanwhile, a proposal for an even more far-reaching course  of  action has evolved at the Foreign Ministry: Other central  components of the Oslo agreements should be abandoned on the  pretext that the experience amassed since September 1993  requires that new lessons be learned and basic premises be  updated. This theory contends not only that the second stage --  that of the establishment of interim self-rule -- is superfluous  and cumbersome, but also that Israel should dispense with the  axiom that it will not disband settlements. The grounds for  this doctrine are as follow: Israel scored "superfluous  achievements" in Oslo. It demanded and received a five-year  interim period, which today seems an undesirable station along  the road. Furthermore, it has obtained the PLO's consent to all  the Israeli settlements' remaining intact, although the truth of  the matter is that there are quite a few settlers who would  rather return home to inside the Green Line.    The same applies to the fate of entire settlements that are  isolated (such as Netzarim and Kfar Darom), which are being kept  in place only because of the principle signed in Oslo, although  all the Jerusalem policymakers agree that they are nothing but a  nuisance. Why, then, should Israel zealously insist on each  clause of the agreements, when the new reality suggests that  certain clauses should be amended or waived? The promoters of  this approach note, in addition, that under the interim stage  clauses of the Oslo agreements, the IDF will have to evacuate  the centers of West Bank cities. They wonder how this clause  can be implemented as long as the Jewish islands in the heart of  Hebron (and in Nabulus: the Joseph's Tomb yeshiva, for  instance) are kept in place.    The one man who does not share this perception (for the  moment?) is Yitzhaq Rabin. The prime minister has developed an  obstinate -- some say "square" -- adherence to the Oslo  agreements, from which he refuses to budge. He wants to see how  the Gaza-Jericho agreement is implemented, and only on the basis  of lessons learned from this experience will he approach the  next stage of the agreements. The message he is conveying is  that he cannot imagine reneging on the commitment that no  settlements will be disbanded during the interim period. For  Rabin, keeping his promises is the supreme test of his personal  credibility and, therefore, of his ability to retain his main  electoral asset: the public's trust. In the coming days, Rabin  is liable to find himself in a complicated situation in which  the question will again arise: To what extent is he steering  the course of events and to what extent are events controlling  him?</p>

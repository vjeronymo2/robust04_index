The outgoing Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar accused the  army of the former Czechoslovak Republic of preparing an attack  on Slovakia.    "During a session of the federal army General Staff I asked  Pezl whether he could give me a pledge that the staff officers  were not preparing a military attack plan on Slovakia. He  sweated something terrible and said he could not," Meciar  reported.    According to Pezl, Meciar's question was different: "Mr.  General, can you give me a pledge that no officer of the General  Staff has prepared an attack against Slovakia, even at home?"    Pezl said he had replied that the General Staff could give  the pledge that it was not preparing, planning or considering  it. He did not give a pledge for the individual officers. "I  cannot know who is preparing what at home," he added.    To the question of whether or not he had really sweated  after  Meciar's question, Pezl replied that he did not know how another  person could tell if someone was sweating or not. "I was  surprised and shocked because no chief of the General Staff had  ever been asked such an absurd question before," Pezl said.    Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus dissociated himself categorically  from the alleged talks with Meciar on the issue denying them  totally. He rejected the idea of a military attack against  Slovakia as absurd.</p>

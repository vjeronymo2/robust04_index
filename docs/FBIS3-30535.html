The same source  quotes intelligence reports as saying that in addition to the  Croatian Army's guards' brigades, Croatia has reserve units in  the field -- the 114th Split Brigade, the 123d Slavonia-Pozega  Brigade, and the 128th Rijeka Brigade, as well as units of the  101st and 102d Zagreb brigades, and the 112th Zadar Brigade,  numerically equivalent to one battalion. These units, military  sources in Knin claim, are mainly engaged against Muslim forces  from Stolac [in Herzegovina, southeast of Mostar] to Gornji  Vakuf [in central Bosnia].</p>

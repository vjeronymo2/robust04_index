			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Queens Moat loss estimated at up to Pounds 80m QUEENS MOAT Houses made losses in 1992 of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 80m, compared with expectations a fortnight ago that pre-tax profits of Pounds 80m would be reported. This preliminary loss estimate was reported yesterday to a four-hour emergency meeting of the group's 62 banks. Barclays, which was chairing the meeting, asked the 120 bankers present to give formal agreement to a two-month freeze on interest and principal payments on the international hotel group's Pounds 1bn debt. A longer-term debt rescheduling proposal is expected to be put to banks in six weeks, when an information package should have been produced by accountants from Grant Thornton, who were appointed last week to review the company's financial condition. It also emerged yesterday that the Stock Exchange's insider trading group is expected next week to pass to the Department of Trade and Industry the results of a preliminary investigation into possible insider trading of shares in Queens Moat Houses. An official said the DTI will then decide whether to launch a formal investigation under Section 177 of the Financial Services Act. Meanwhile bankers were told that the company appears to be profitable at the trading level. The two co-ordinating banks, Barclays and National Westminster, said after the meeting that they believed Queens Moat had 'substantial assets and real value' and that the group had sufficient funds to meet its trading needs in the short term. A banker said he hoped Queens Moat might emerge with net assets of around Pounds 1bn, compared with Pounds 1.3bn at the end of 1991. He added that the best way to preserve the value of the company's assets was for its bankers to keep their nerve and eventually agree to a financial restructuring. Bankers were told that considerable progress has been made in the search for a caretaker chief executive. The company last week suspended its finance director, Mr David Hersey, and its deputy chairman, Mr Martin Marcus. The Exchange's share probe focused on the sale in early February of 1.1m Queens Moat Shares by Mr Marcus for Pounds 627,000. He sold the shares shortly before the start of the company's close season, when directors' share sales are banned. Lex, Page 20</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Technology: Conflict of man and machine - How the Airbus A320 fly-by-wire system takes control away from pilots Aircraft falling out of the sky are bad for confidence. They worry passengers, regulators, airlines, aircraft makers and governments. In the case of the Airbus A320 which ploughed into the snowy, forested Vosges mountains last Monday night, the aircraft's ultra-modern control technology has been the subject of fierce debate. This is because the same model of aircraft has crashed three times in its four-year history and because the controls which the pilots use are unique to this particular commercial passenger aircraft. They are computerised controls, sometimes known as fly-by-wire. 'Probably the worst name for them,' says Freddy Yetman of the British Airline Pilots Association. Wires and levers are what controlled the aircraft at the time of the first world war, he explains. The A320 still uses the hydraulics that have been standard in passenger aircraft for decades. In order to increase safety, however, it adds computers between the pilot and the hydraulic motors. The computerised controls in the A320 stop the pilot from stalling the plane, for example. An A320 pilot uses a joystick like one in a computer game. When the lever is pulled back, the computer is signalled to operate movable parts on the wing and tail to turn the nose of the aircraft up. If the pilot pulls back on the joystick and tries to stall, the computer calculates the angle at which this would happen and stops the nose rising just before this point. It is here that many criticisms of computerised controls are voiced. 'There is a danger of over-confidence if the pilot is left out of the control loop,' concedes an executive at one aircraft manufacturer. Airbus says that the computers in the A320 can be switched off to give the pilot direct control over the aircraft. But is switching off the computers uppermost in a pilot's mind in an emergency? 'Some pilots think it (computerised control) is complicated if anything unusual happens,' says Yetman. The next generation of aircraft, exemplified by the Boeing 777, takes a different approach from Airbus. It has a more traditional cockpit in which control wheels, rather than a joystick, control the aircraft. These control wheels are linked to each other so that pilot and co-pilot can see and feel what the other is doing. When the pilot moves one control wheel, the other wiggles in sympathy. On a more sophisticated level, the computer will not simply override the pilot's decision if it calculates a manoeuvre to be unsafe. Instead, it resists it. The control wheels have motors in them that make turning them progressively more difficult if the manoeuvre is extreme. 'So the pilot can bend the wings if he thinks that is better than the alternative,' explains Boeing. Other advances include liquid crystals displays in the cockpit instead of ordinary television screens (which were in themselves an advance over dials). The 777 and the A320 are not directly comparable, however, because the Boeing carries more than twice as many passengers and is almost a decade newer in design. The origins of the control technology in both aircraft is more than 20 years old. It was developed by the defence industry in an effort to create a more manoeuvrable fighter aircraft. Defence designers wanted to build something that was inherently unstable. Rather like a pencil balanced on your fingertip, such an aircraft can move quickly in any direction. But no human pilot could react fast enough to keep control, let alone shoot at an enemy. Computers, however, were fast enough to make rapid small adjustments to keep the aircraft flying. By distancing the pilot from the controls, the performance of the aircraft was improved. In the case of a civil airliner, the priority is not manoeuvrability but safety. In spite of this emphasis the aircraft has crashed three times, although inquiries into the first two accidents blamed pilot error. So what is the solution to the problem? Better training is one possibility. After the A320 crash in India in 1990, Airbus contacted its customers to remind them of the landing procedures. In the UK, A320 pilots do a ground school, simulator course and are tested by examiners authorised by the CAA. Then follows a series of flights with training crews before pilots are authorised to fly. They have to return to the simulator every six months to renew their authorisation. Training standards are set by individual countries' civil aviation authorities, subject to international minimum if the flight is international. There are more than 250 A320 flying today with 26 airlines. Another 550 have been ordered. The Boeing 777 enters service in 1995. More than 90 have been ordered already. Computerised controls seem here to stay and the powers in the world of aviation are stacked up behind them. Regulatory bodies have certified them, accident inquiries have blamed the pilots and still the pilots 'find it a fine aircraft to fly,' says Yetman. Much more evidence yet will have to be amassed against the the A320 if the aircraft is to be found guilty through criticisms of its fly-by-wire controls.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Blair points crime finger at the shires CRIME IS rising more rapidly in the affluent suburbs and shires than in rundown areas under the control of Labour councils, Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, said yesterday. He accused Mr John Major, the prime minister, of debasing a serious issue by his recent statement that socialism was to blame for inner-city crime. Mr Blair backed his claim with evidence from 10 police authorities covering areas in East Anglia and the Midlands to the south-west of England showing the rise in burglaries since 1979 when the Conservatives came to office. Leicester headed the list with a 452 per cent increase, followed by Gloucestershire (444 per cent), with Bedfordshire and Suffolk (both 290 per cent) and Devon and Cornwall (274 per cent). Mr Blair said crime had more than doubled in the 14 years of continuous Conservative government - and had risen by 50 per cent in the past three years. Calling for a fresh approach to combating the crime wave, he refused to accept that in many cases it could be attributed to social deprivation. He said: 'Those who commit crimes should be caught and punished. There are no excuses for crime and it is some of the poorest and most vulnerable in our society that suffer its worst effects.' He made clear that Labour would oppose any move by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, to replace elected councillors serving on police authorities with local businessmen. Mr Blair said: 'By all means let local businesses and others be involved in policing and policing priorities, but removing a local say through local representatives would be a foolish and regressive step.' Mr Blair was addressing the Labour local government conference in Bournemouth. Mr John Smith, the party leader, will speak tomorrow. Britain will become the 'environmental dustbin of Europe' because the government is making a 'bonfire' of 'green' rules, Mr Chris Smith, shadow environmental protection spokesman, told the conference. He said offshore oil-drilling regulations were being loosened to speed development regardless of the 'green' cost, and the government had signalled its intention to relax air pollution controls and to allow industry to self-monitor its pollution discharges. 'This is alarming in the extreme. It's like telling burglars to police themselves,' he said.</p>

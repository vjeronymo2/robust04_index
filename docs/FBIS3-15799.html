			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [INTERFAX report under the "In Brief" rubric: "Moscow"] </F>   [Text] Russia has a special place in the world, and other  countries should pay heed to its stance. This is what Grigoriy  Yavlinskiy, leader of the State Duma's "Yabloko" faction, said  during his meeting with Richard Nixon, former U.S. president, in  Moscow. Yavlinskiy attributed that not only to Russia's nuclear  potential, but also to its geopolitical situation. The  "Yabloko" leader also spelled out to Richard Nixon his vision of  the problems facing economic and political reform in Russia,  Western assistance, and the Russian Federation's place in world  politics.</p>

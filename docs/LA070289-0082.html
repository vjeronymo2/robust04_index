			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO O.C. ABOUT DRUGS  </P> <P> On April 25, George Bush, President of the United States, paid a visit to  Orange County to present local law enforcement officials with more than $4  million confiscated from local drug dealers. Members of the various media were  there and dutifully documented the occasion, or did they?  </P> <P> In his 20-minute presentation, President Bush discussed the tragic devastation  perpetrated by drugs. He mentioned the 401 Orange County residents, ranging in  age from 1 month to 82 years, who had died with cocaine and/or heroin in their  systems in the 27 months preceding his visit.  </P> <P> The President commended the officers of the Orange County Regional Narcotics  Suppression Program who, in the same 27-month period, had taken 37 million  doses of cocaine and 9 million injections of heroin off the streets of Orange  County.  </P> <P> As he has done before, President Bush called upon each member of our society to  do whatever they could, individually or collectively, to help rid our county of  the plague of illicit narcotics. The President praised the residents of Orange  County, the high school students, the business leaders, church groups, sports  organizations, civic leaders and the private individuals who had already  answered his call to halt the demand for these substances by getting the word  out: "We want a drug-free America."  </P> <P> The President asked that even more people get involved and end the devastation  and undermining of our society. Then, and only then, did the President present  more than $4 million to local law enforcement, along with his entreaty to "keep  up the good work and continue to set an example for the rest of our great  country."  </P> <P> Did the media accurately document the true and correct context of President  Bush's visit to Orange County?  </P> <P> Did they assist him in getting out the message that a resident of Orange County  dies every other day with cocaine or heroin in his system?  </P> <P> Did they point out that, in slightly more than two years, enough drugs were  taken off the streets of Orange County to supply every man, woman and child in  the county with 15 doses of cocaine and four injections of heroin?  </P> <P> Did the media address the alarming fact that, even with a successful  interdiction rate of 20% by local law enforcement, cocaine and heroin worth  more than $15 million enters our county each and every month?  </P> <P> Perhaps members of the media merely misunderstood the true purpose of the  President's visit to Orange County. A visit, mind you, that was initiated by  the President and not, as was implied by grandstanding officials some two  months later, as a "dog-and-pony show" or "political posturing" by local law  enforcement figures.  </P> <P> Let's all get with the program to support a drug-free Orange County.  </P> <P> ROBERT J.

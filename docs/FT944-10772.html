			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Europe's big challenge The events of 1989, symbolised by the fall of the Berlin Wall five years ago today, presented Europe as a whole with its greatest challenge since the Berlin blockade of 1948, and its best chance to build a 'just and lasting peaceful order' since 1919. It was a challenge to the peoples of eastern and central Europe themselves, but also to the west, which was asked to put its money where its mouth had been for 40 years. And not only money. During those 40 years western Europe had achieved unprecedented security and prosperity through a model of economic and political integration which, even while rhetorically deploring the division of the continent, tacitly assumed that it was here to stay. Now western Europe had either to renege on its proclaimed ideals, or find a way of sharing its security and prosperity with the rest of the continent. Three questions were unavoidably posed: Which west European institutions could be expanded to take in the newly free countries? How much adjustment of those institutions would the expansion imply? Were some existing institutions, on the contrary, rendered redundant or anachronistic by the end of the cold war? Only in relation to one small part of the former east were those questions given a definitive answer. West Germany absorbed 16m East Germans into the whole gamut of its internal laws and external commitments. Even this relatively small-scale exercise proved almost ruinously expensive for the strongest economy on the continent. Clearly the model is not applicable to the continent as a whole. Nato, the successful guardian of western Europe in the cold war, has proved itself largely irrelevant to the challenge of peace. It feared to jeopardise its previous success by reaching out too quickly to new member states where democracy was new and fragile, and it allowed itself to be manoeuvred into giving Russia an implicit veto over any future expansion. It tried to find a new raison d'etre in peacekeeping, but in the former Yugoslavia it is now deep in the conceptual quagmire between peacekeeping and peace enforcement. Strategic leadership The European Community (as it still was in 1989) has been less troubled by self-doubt. Its special stock in trade, economic integration, was clearly what the east was looking for. But its first instinct was to reinforce the integration of its existing membership, in order to forestall any disintegrative effect that the sudden crumbling of its eastern border might have, and to endow Europe with a political centre capable of giving strategic leadership. The instinct was sound but the rationale was not clearly spelt out, nor the measures proposed clearly related to it; and the economic climate was hardly conducive to an enthusiastic response. The result is a European Union in name more than substance: divided, sulky, and offering more difficulties than attractions to potential new members in the east. But at least the EU has paid lip-service to the need to absorb the states of central Europe. Several of them, meanwhile, have risen impressively to the challenge. They already look more credible potential members than they did a year or two ago. What is needed now is a plan to make the next five years a period of adjustment for both east and west, during which an eastward expansion of the EU can be seriously prepared. The intergovernmental conference scheduled for 1996 should mark an important stage in that plan, but it can do so only if it takes full account of the views and interests of candidate as well as existing members. Radical reform The plan will have to include a complete opening of the west European market to central and east European products (including 'sensitive' ones), and a more radical reform of the common agricultural policy and the regional and structural funds than so far envisaged. That is not an agenda that France and Spain, which will hold the presidency next year, are at all keen to embark on. But they have to face the reality that the EU does not have the resources to bring central European food prices up to west European levels, even if that were an economically sensible thing to do. Nor does it have funds to dish out to central Europe on the scale that it now does to southern Europe. Yet the EU is committed in principle to eastward expansion, and Germany, the biggest net contributor, will not let it renege on that commitment. Germany will also keep pushing for a central core of countries to lead the way in forming a fully-fledged federation, with political integration as the counterpart to monetary union. France appears less and less sure of the value of this bargain, but is more than ever keen on a joint European defence, partly to provide a framework within which German military capabilities can be cultivated without seeming dangerous to Germany's neighbours. Britain too is keen on this aspect of European integration, but it must be doubted whether a common defence will really be credible unless there is also a unified political leadership to give it its orders. In any case, the existence of such an integrated hard core will be of interest to the candidate members only if it provides Europe with the strategic leadership that has been lacking for the last five years. Most of them now understand that their security depends less on military guarantees than on being fully integrated into a pan-European economy and society. By November 9 1999 that process must be well under way.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> $7-BILLION BID BY TRUMP FOR AMERICAN AIRLINES  </P> <P> New York real estate and gambling magnate Donald J. Trump bid more than $7  billion Thursday for AMR Corp., parent of giant American Airlines, in what  would be the largest airline deal in history.  </P> <P> Trump's "unsolicited" offer of $120 in cash for each of AMR's nearly 60 million  shares outstanding was viewed by some analysts as being too low a price for the  airline, which is widely considered to be the industry's best managed and whose  19% market share is the largest among U.S. air carriers.  </P> <P> American is the leading airline serving Orange County, flying 35% of the daily  flights to and from John Wayne Airport.  </P> <P> A statement issued by AMR said that its board of directors would consider the  offer "in due course" but indicated that it was likely to reject it.  </P> <P> The flamboyant billionaire gave no details about how he would finance the deal  but said he is prepared to commit at least $1 billion of his own money to the  transaction.  </P> <P> It is known that Dallas-based American has about $1 billion in cash in its  treasury that could be used by Trump to help finance the deal. Moreover,  American has been trying to sell half of its highly profitable Sabre  computerized reservation system, for which it could receive $700 million to $1  billion, and that money also would be available to Trump.  </P> <P> But, whether or not Trump, who also owns what was once Eastern Airlines'  lucrative Northeast air shuttle operation serving Washington, Boston and New  York, is serious in his bid to take over American, he has put the big airline  company "into play," Wall Street analysts said Thursday. Some said that Trump  may just be trying to drive up the price of the stock so he can sell his shares  at a large profit.  </P> <P> Airline analysts maintained in interviews that American is worth at least $130  a share and that, if a bidding war occurs, it might fetch $140 a share, which  would make the deal worth about $8 billion. They predicted that similar bids  soon will be made for Delta Air Lines and USAir Group, even though both have  recently taken steps to protect themselves against takeovers.  </P> <P> But Wall Street did not appear to have taken the Trump offer all that  seriously. Although AMR stock was the day's most heavily traded on the New York  Stock Exchange, with 8,359,800 shares changing hands, the price per share was  up only $16.875, closing at $99.875 -- far below Trump's bid price.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Financing Details Needed  </P> <P> "All we have is a letter," said Thomas C. Longman, airline analyst with Bear,  Stearns &amp; Co., a New York broker. "At this point, we have to get the  details of Trump's financing plans to see how serious an offer this is."  </P> <P> Trump said in a letter to AMR's board of directors that he would be able to  obtain the financing "in a reasonable period of time."  </P> <P> Louis Marckesano, airline analyst with the Philadelphia brokerage firm of  Janney Montgomery Scott, said: "If anyone would be able to finance such a deal,  Trump would have the wherewithal. But we are not talking small change like what  he paid for the shuttle ($365 million)."  </P> <P> The Trump offer, which has been rumored since it became known several weeks ago  that the financier had bought an interest in AMR, comes at a time when federal  regulators are expressing concern about the heavy debt loads taken on by U.S.  airlines in recent purchases.  </P> <P> NWA Corp., parent of Northwest Airlines, was recently bought for $4.05 billion  by a group of investors headed by Los Angeles financier Alfred A. Checchi. A  $6.75-billion management-employee offer for UAL Corp., parent of United  Airlines, is currently under consideration. These so-called leveraged buyouts  are new to the airline industry, which in the previous five years had seen a  frenzy of airline mergers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> May Have White Knight  </P> <P> As AMR watched the NWA and UAL transactions, Marckesano said, it most probably  prepared itself to fend off an unfriendly bid. "They might have a white knight,  somebody who has said to (AMR Chairman Robert L.) Crandall: 'Let me know if you  need any help.' "  </P> <P> Marckesano said that, as another defensive measure, AMR could make a bid for  Pan Am Corp., or let Pan Am make a bid for AMR "so as to take on a great amount  of debt." Such debt would make AMR much less attractive as a takeover target.  American now has one of the best balance sheets in the airline industry, with  only 37% debt to total capitalization.  </P> <P> American said in a terse announcement after receiving Trump's offer that "there  has been no change . . . in the policy and belief" that AMR and its  shareholders will be best served by AMR's remaining an independent company and  "continuing the strong partnership among American Airlines, its employees, the  communities it serves and the public -- a partnership that has given AMR the  great success it enjoys today."  </P> <P> The company has had healthy profits. In the six months that ended on June 30,  its net earnings rose to $278.9 million from $209.8 million during the same  period last year. Total revenues rose to $5.17 billion in the first six months  of 1989 from $4.13 billion in the same period of 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Has Ordered New Planes  </P> <P> In the last 2 1/2 years, AMR has placed orders and options for more than $23  billion worth of airliners for American Airlines and for American Eagle, its  commuter subsidiary.  </P> <P> In his letter to the AMR board, Trump said his offer to buy the company will  expire on Oct. 20 unless he extends it.  </P> <P> Trump said it is his intention to acquire AMR in a "negotiated transaction. In  this regard, my proposal is subject to the execution of a mutually satisfactory  definitive acquisition agreement."  </P> <P> He said also, "In recognition of the outstanding job done by company  management, I would hope that, following an acquisition of the company by me,  operating management would continue to work with me to build on the company's  reputation as the premier airline in the industry."  </P> <P> But it is questionable whether the American management team would remain under  Trump. According to Kevin C. Murphy, airline analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp;  Co., another big broker, AMR has termination benefit agreements with nine top  executive officers. Crandall has been given options on 355,000 shares of stock  worth $46 million, assuming the stock is valued at $130 a share.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Appeal and a Threat  </P> <P> The Trump letter contained both an appeal to stockholders and a veiled threat  to management.  </P> <P> "While I share your vision of the future for the airline," he said, "and I  admire the values that have been created for the company's shareholders, I  believe that the shareholders of the company should be given an opportunity to  decide whether now is an appropriate time to realize those values."  </P> <P> He added: "While I appreciate that the seemingly patterned response to letters  such as this is one of immediate rejection and vilification of the author, I  ask you, can such a response genuinely be in the interests of the company's  shareholders who, as you are aware, have received no dividends on their shares  for many years?"  </P> <P> Analysts noted that the company considers itself to be a capital-intensive firm  and prefers to reinvest its profits in assets such as new airliners rather than  paying them out in dividends.  </P> <P> But, despite AMR's expression of its intention to remain independent, it is not  altogether out of the question that some kind of compromise could be worked  out, some analysts said.  </P> <P> "I would not call this a hostile bid," said Timothy Pettee, airline analyst  with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, a New York-based broker. "Of  course, it is unwanted, but that does not preclude a friendly agreement."  </P> <P> Pettee said Crandall and Trump probably would not get along well together.  </P> <P> "Crandall is not used to reporting to anybody," he said. "But Trump is an  investor, not a manager."  </P> <P> He added that Trump, who named the Eastern shuttle after himself when he  acquired it in June, would not be likely to do that with American. "The Plaza  (Hotel in New York) had a name, and he was smart enough not to rename that."  </P></p>

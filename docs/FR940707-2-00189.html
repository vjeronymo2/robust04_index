			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Need for a Short Sale Bid-Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commenters argue that the NASD has failed to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating the need for short sale regulation in the form of a bid-test. Indeed, many argue that there is no need for additional short sale restrictions. They argue that instead of adding another layer of regulation to the OTC market, the NASD should enforce existing anti-fraud rules more stringently and increase surveillance over market participants. Commenters further believe that the NASD proposed the rule with the primary purpose of eliminating a competitive disadvantage vi&sacute;-&agrave;-vi&sacute; the exchanges. They argue that the NASD is simply responding to issuer misconception of the effect of the Commission's short sale rule, which applies only to exchange-listed securities. They believe that issuers incorrectly conclude that manipulative short selling is substantially diminished because of the restrictions on short selling on exchanges. Finally, these commenters believe the NASD has not adequately balanced the benefits of short selling, such as increased liquidity and more accurate pricing of securities, against the costs that its rule will impose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also argued against the NASD's proposal on the basis that there are less restrictive alternatives. For example, the NASD could limit short selling in a given security only when the security has experienced a certain percentage decrease during the trading day. Many of these commenters further argued that the NASD's proposal would create long periods of short sale prohibition in some of the less liquid Nasdaq National Market securities. Commenters also opposed the rule due to concerns that it could encourage Market makers to manipulate bids to guard against short selling. Finally, several commenters cited economic studies such as that of Irving M. Pollack to support their arguments that short selling restrictions in the form of a bid-test are unnecessary. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In 1986, the NASD retained former Commissioner Irving M. Pollack to conduct a study of short selling in the OTC market. Irving M. Pollack, Short-Sale Regulation of Nasdaq Securities (July 1986) (``Pollack Report'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the Pollack Report recommended against a formal short sale rule for Nasdaq and found that the preponderance of short selling is done for legitimate purposes by market professionals. The report also found that short positions in Nasdaq stocks generally are smaller overall in relation to average daily volume and share outstanding than is true of exchange-listed securities, and that Nasdaq stocks have lower average short-interest percentages.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Pollack Report  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at 65. The same finding was made by the NASD based on later data. NASD,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Reports of the special Committee of the Regulatory Review Task Force on the Quality of Markets  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 32 (1988).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See also  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> J. Randall Woolridge and Amy Dickinson,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Short Selling and Common Stock Prices,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Fin. Analysts J. 20 (Jan.-Feb. 1994) (analysis of overall market data and selected individual securities traded on exchanges and in the OTC market indicating that there is an insignificant relationship between changes in short positions and stock prices). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Pollack Report also concluded that, unless accompanied by a violation of delivery and settlement requirements or by fraudulent or manipulative conduct, short selling is not improper or abusive. Since the study found that there was no current evidence of problems that would support consideration of tick-test type restrictions, the study did not explore the varieties of tick-tests and their feasibility for the market. The study identified, however, the build-up of short to clearing ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> naked short) positions as having the potential to create serious problems in a lengthy bear market or in times of market stress.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Pollack Report  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> at 63&hyph;64.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the commenters' belief that a short sale rule for the Nasdaq market is unnecessary, the NASD stated that notwithstanding the implementation of the Pollack Report recommendations, it remains concerned about short-term volatility and inaccurate pricing of Nasdaq securities often associated with short selling. In addition, the NASD cited to over one hundred comment letters submitted by issuers claiming that they have experienced short selling problems, some recounting specific instances alleging that participants sold short on the basis of rumors or inaccurate reports. The NASD, therefore, indicated its belief that its proposal is a reasonable approach to solving these problems and is consistent with the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Effect of Primary Market Maker Qualification Standards on Nasdaq Market Makers and the Market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters indicated their believe that most short selling is done by market makers and, therefore, if the NASD does impose a bid-test restriction on short selling, there should be no exemptions. Many market making firms and others criticized the NASD's primary market maker qualification standards, which goes into effect one year after the effective date of the rule. They argued that the criteria will unfairly discriminate among market makers and create two tiers of market makes and, thus, will fragment the market making community and restrict the ability of non-primary market makers to use short sales as a risk management technique.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters also believe that requiring market makers to maintain the inside bid or offer will result in dealers following the lead of other dealers in the issue, thus creating additional volatility. Additionally, commenters stated that the requirements that no more than 50% of a market maker's quotation updates occur without being accompanied by an execution appears to be in direct conflict with a market maker reflecting a customer's order in its quote. In addition, some commenters believed that this requirement would prevent market makers from updating quotes in response to significant external events and amounts to a penalty on efficient pricing policies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters also strongly opposed the interim, first year 20-day qualification criteria, stating that it is overly restrictive and disadvantageous to market makers that want to add new stocks. They believed that the inability to short a stock at the bid price will seriously impede market makers' capital commitment to these issues and recommended that the 20-day test be a stand-by provision, to be implemented only when abuses of the market maker exemption have been uncovered. On the other hand, at least one commenter believed that immediate implementation of the permanent qualification standards may have the effect of improving the quality of the market and, thus, is preferable to the 20-day registration standard. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

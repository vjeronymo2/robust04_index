			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patten in shift over CTCs GOVERNMENT funding will be made available to schools which specialise in technology and can find sponsors from local businesses, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, announced yesterday. The move marks a shift from City Technology Colleges, which had previously been at the centre of the government's attempts to encourage technology teaching. Only 14 CTCs have been built, with another opening in September. Mr Patten proposes that schools with local businesses represented on their governing bodies should be backed with additional support from the government.</p>

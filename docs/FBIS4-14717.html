			<p>BFN     [Text] Tbilisi, April 2 (SNARK)--"If I wished to carry out  a military overthrow, I would have done it", told in his  exclusive interview to SNARK today General David Zeikidze, the  earlier removed commander of the Tbilisi police.    As already reported, he rushed in the Georgian Parliament  building with a group of armed policemen, for which fact he  found himself later in "off-side" position.    Zeikidze announced that, instead of thirty, he could have  brought the whole three thousand his supporters into the  parliament on the day of intrusion, who, as he claimed, back up  Eduard Shevardnadze.    "I was removed by the opposition who made Shevardnadze face  a  deadlock", said the former commander of city police, adding that  he will yet utter a sensation.    Zeikidze informed he intends to establish his own party and  engage the active political life.</p>

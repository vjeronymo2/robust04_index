			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Frankfurt Another firm week is in store. UBS said that while polls are suggesting that a re-election of the CDU/CSU-FDP coalition might have helped sentiment, its key reason for being positive was the likely surprises in earnings due to higher volumes and prices. KHD is expected to report interim results early in the week. UBS forecast a loss of DM100m after a of DM98.3m deficit last time. However, he said the full-year result should be somewhere around break-even as the industrial plant division is likely to book most of its profits in the second half. Compiled by Michael Morgan</p>

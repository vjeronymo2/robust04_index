			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Loyalist troops recapture Zaire radio ZAIRE'S national radio station in the capital Kinshasa was believed to be back in government hands early this morning after rebel soldiers had seized it and called on President Mobutu Sese Seko to resign, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. Ealier, gunfire had echoed through Kinshasa, witnesses said, as the mutinous troops broadcast a call for the government of Prime Minister Nguza Karl-i-Bond to step down. Also yesterday, the European Community suspended all non-humanitarian aid to Zaire in protest at the failure of the government to move towards a more democratic system. The soldiers, who seized the radio station at midnight, called on their colleagues to stay in barracks and told the people not to riot. The rebels appealed to the embassies of the US ,Belgium and France for military help andsaid their action was due to the 'poverty and famine' in the vast central African country. Earlier in the day the main opposition party, Union for Democracy and Social Progress said its co-chairmen, Mr Etienne Tshisekedi and Mr Frederic Kibassa had been injured when presidential guards drove into a protest march in the capital. Supporters of the opposition alliance, Sacred Union, had clashed with troops on Monday and Tuesday in protest at the suspension of a national conference last Sunday aimed at guiding the country towards democracy. The Sacred Union called a general strike starting today if the government failed to revoke the suspension. Kinshasa and other major cities were devastated by a wave of looting and riots last September, triggered by unpaid troops. At least 250 people were killed and some 20,000 expatriate workers were evacuated by French and Belgian troops. Earlier yesterday both Washington and Paris condemned Zaire for suspending the national conference aimed at moving the country towards democracy.</p>

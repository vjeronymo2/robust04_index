			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian chemical weapons expert Vil </F> Sultanovich Mirzayanov by Fulvio Scaglione; place, date not  given: "Factories Akin to Gulags"]    [Text] Vil Sultanovich Mirzayanov, 59, married to a poetess  and the father of two children, is a repentant scientist. After  working for almost 30 years at Moscow's Organic Chemistry  Research Institute -- a secret apparatus which is part of the  military complex -- Mirzayanov has now launched a campaign  against chemical weapons. With his colleague Lev Fedorov he  published a number of articles which led to his arrest, his  indictment for "divulging state secrets," and finally his  release due to the authorities' manifest embarrassment.  Mirzayanov lives with his family on the outskirts of Moscow in  two poorly furnished rooms, on a 60,000-rouble [R] pension. At  the time of his arrest, he was selling cheap shirts in the  street. Chemical weapons did not make him rich.    [Scaglione] Doctor Mirzayanov, how does a brilliant  researcher become an inventor of awesome weapons?    [Mirzayanov] In 1965, when I joined the institute, certain  material considerations carried considerable weight. If I had  remained at the Science Academy, I could never have afforded to  rent this apartment in a cooperative. Wages were higher; a  researcher with my grade earned R280 a month at that time. At  the institute I earned R500, I got free meals in the canteen, I  got two months' vacation instead of just one. In short, it was  advantageous. On the other hand, it was almost like being in a  gulag: very strict security regulations, checks, punishment for  even very small transgressions. I even needed a special permit  to go to the Lenin library, and if by any chance I had been  fired, I would have found it almost impossible to find another  job.    [Scaglione] What were your specific duties?    [Mirzayanov] For many years I was involved in producing  weapons as an expert in the processes whereby the various  substances are absorbed. Then, in the last period, I was  responsible for safety checks in the various laboratories and  plants.    [Scaglione] Did you often observe incidents or violations of  the safety regulations?    [Mirzayanov] I recorded about 100 such "incidents." In 1987,  when I informed the institute's management, a huge scandal broke  out. I was even summoned by Chemical Industry Deputy Minister  Golubkov [as published], who reprimanded me and warned me not to  overstep my authority. They cared nothing about the  consequences -- whether for the environment or for people -- of  what I had seen. Their only fear was that information might be  leaked outside.    [Scaglione] What led you to criticize and attack the world  in  which you lived and worked for so many years?    [Mirzayanov] Because signing the chemical disarmament treaty  is mere hypocrisy, an empty gesture which not only leaves  problems unresolved but actually worsens them.    [Scaglione] So do you also believe that new chemical weapons  are being prepared in Russian laboratories?    [Mirzayanov] No, I do not believe so. Especially because it  is not necessary to do so. In the first place, the convention  does not prohibit research and, in the military field, the  dividing line between research and production is very thin, far  too thin. Besides, there is no need to build special factories  or special chemical weapons. All you need is, for example, a  laboratory producing a given pesticide in Siberia and another  plant in Moscow producing a second pesticide. There is nothing  irregular about that. Even the technicians involved believe  that everything is all right. However, in a third laboratory,  kept secret from everybody, a military scientist studies a  formula, develops a synthesis of the two substances, and the  result is a third substance, ready to be used as a weapon. You  must bear in mind that certain chemical syntheses take place in  a few seconds, a shorter time than it takes for a missile to fly  from one country to another. Thousands of such syntheses are  possible without ipso facto violating the convention.    [Scaglione] What about the disposal and destruction of the  substances which have already been accumulated in laboratories  and storage facilities?    [Mirzayanov] That is another great scandal. Russia signed  the convention knowing very well that it could not dispose of  its own reserves, or that it could only do so by exposing the  population to very serious risks. According to my estimates,  700,000 tonnes of various types of aggressive substances were  produced overall in the Soviet period. But let us assume  smaller estimates, like the ones accepted even in official  scientific circles, where they speak of 400,000 tonnes only.  Today the Russian authorities admit that they still have to  dispose of 40,000 tonnes, which means that 360,000 tons have  been buried, dumped, or hidden somewhere in a makeshift and  dangerous way -- which, in any case, represents a greater hazard  than the 40,000 tonnes which, somehow or other, are still stored  in the old facilities.    [Scaglione] Where do you think the missing tonnes might be?    [Mirzayanov] It seems reasonable to think that they were  disposed of not far from the production centers, i.e. in the  Bryansk region, in Shikany, Kurgan, in Russia's great northern  region. There are plants in Cheboksary and Volgograd, but in the  fifties certain substances were also being manufactured near  Moscow, in Kazan, Dzerdzhinsk, and other towns.    [Scaglione] What do you make of General Kuntsevich's sudden  dismissal?    [Mirzayanov] I met him in the seventies -- as a matter of  fact in Shikany, where I was sent several times on assignments.  At that time Kuntsevich was still only a colonel and had only  recently arrived in Shikany as head of the research center,  after being posted for a long time in the Far East. Kuntsevich  never worked much in the laboratories. He is a technocrat  rather than a scientist, even though he became a general by  implementing production of the so-called VX-33 chemical weapon  in the Cheboksary laboratories. I know that for some time now  he has been out of favor in military circles: They blame him  for signing the convention. Perhaps my campaign did the rest,  offering the "hawks" a good excuse to fire him.</p>

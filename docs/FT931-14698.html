			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / BA employees protest at 'dirty tricks' affair BRITISH AIRWAYS employees have bitterly attacked the company's role in the Virgin Atlantic 'dirty tricks' affair in the airline's weekly staff newspaper. A series of critical letters published yesterday in British Airways News included calls for the resignation of BA directors and the dismissal of all those responsible for the 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin. The letters reflected the dismay and demoralisation that has swept the company since BA apologised to Virgin in the High Court on Monday and agreed to pay Mr Richard Branson and Virgin Pounds 610,000 in libel damages. Virgin had accused BA of going 'beyond any limits of commercially acceptable practice' in a campaign to discredit its rival. Mr Derek Porter, a priority spares controller at Hatton Cross, wrote that he hoped 'the perpetrators of this obscene episode are brought to justice'. Those responsible should be instantly dismissed, he added. Captain Peter Jenkinson, a Boeing 757/767 pilot, argued that the claim by directors that they did not know what was going on was 'difficult to believe'. He recalled an earlier instance of a director stepping down after accepting responsibility for events of which he had no knowledge at the time. 'Surely the same rules apply today and the responsible parties must accept their grave mistakes and take the consequences,' he wrote. Mr Gary Moore, a product development co-ordinator, said he hoped 'heads will roll' not only of those who planned the malpractice but also of those involved in what appeared to be a cover-up attempt. Although some staff wrote to support BA's management led by Lord King, chairman, and Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive and deputy chairman, others said the company's credibility had been damaged and that they felt humiliated and ashamed. Mr Will Herlihy, a senior fleet engineer at Heathrow airport, said: 'Let's now all make sure it can never happen again.' Sir Colin yesterday wrote in the same paper that BA was taking 'fair but effective and appropriate action' to ensure there would be no recurrence of the affair. He said BA intended to build a 'new and less confrontational relationship' with Virgin. 'The means, the only means, by which we have achieved our success is to have consistently delivered a better standard of service than our competitors,' he added. BA is expected to revive soon a partnership deal with USAir, the US carrier. BA last month abandoned a proposal to acquire a 44 per cent stake in the airline but is now expected to propose taking a 10 to 15 per cent stake.

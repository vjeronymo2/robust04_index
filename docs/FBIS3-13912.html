			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "For Arab-Muslim Complexion of Jerusalem"] </F>   [Text] The international community, as well as Arabs and  Muslims, ought to lend a hand to Jordan's broad-based drive for  U.S. recognition that Jerusalem is part of the occupied Arab  territories.    To quote His Majesty King Husayn, it is vital that  Washington  be bound by previously U.S.-endorsed UN resolutions granting the  Arab identity of [east] Jerusalem.    We will not beat around the bush. With all honesty we will  tell all Arab and Muslim nations they have to back the Jordanian  moves and join His Majesty King Husayn's drive to uphold the  Arab-Islamic complexion and sanctity of Jerusalem. The absence  of Arab solidarity and a less-than-firm Islamic position has  tempted Israel to pursue its expansionist ambitions in the  occupied Arab territories, most of all in Jerusalem. It has  also prompted the United States to backtrack on previous  positions and so abstain on the Jerusalem part of UN Security  Council Resolution 904.    Should this kind of Arab and Islamic position persist, the  Arab-Islamic complexion of Jerusalem will be commandeered in  broad daylight with U.S., and maybe international, support.    Arab and Muslim leaders cannot afford to remain mere  spectators as the Arab-Islamic complexion of Jerusalem, the  al-Aqsa Mosque, and the Dome of the Rock is hijacked. It is the  duty of every Arab and Muslim to strive to maintain the identity  of this holy city. Under no circumstances should we remain  passive toward the plot to confiscate Jerusalem's identity and  Judaize it and its Islamic shrines.    Hence our argument that all Arab and Muslim leaders must  heed  His Majesty King Husayn's call and join forces with him to  preempt the confiscation of Jerusalem's identity and bring  sufficient pressure to bear in the interest of a renewed  commitment by the U.S. Administration to the UN Security Council  resolutions according to which Jerusalem is occupied territory  not subject to annexation by Israel under any circumstances.    If the U.S. Administration really cares about a viable peace  process, it will have to rethink its positions and obligate  itself to UN resolutions and the terms of reference of the  Madrid conference that the United States itself initiated.  Otherwise, the peace process is doomed.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: RISKY BUSINESS WITH AN ARMS DEALER  </P> <P> I live in a beautiful, but not very forgiving, neighborhood.  </P> <P> When Adnan Khashoggi was arrested and detained in Switzerland for extradition  to the United States, the residents of Wesley Heights were in an uproar. The  reason for this is that, just up the street from us, at American University,  there is a large building named the Adnan Khashoggi Sports and Convocation  Center. It was donated by the zillionaire arms dealer who is wanted by the U.S.  for racketeering, fraud and obstruction of justice, and the people in my area  are afraid that real estate values will fall if his name stays on this  building.  </P> <P> Feelings are so strong that, as I was coming home the other night, I saw Jim  Lawson backing his bulldozer out of the garage.  </P> <P> "Where are you going?" I asked.  </P> <P> "I'm driving up to American U. to knock down that Khashoggi monument before  Wesley Heights becomes the laughingstock of the Western world," Lawson told me.  </P> <P> "You're jumping to conclusions. It's true that the man has been arrested, but  people don't knock down a brand-new building just because the person who paid  for it is accused of a crime. If we destroyed every edifice donated to a  university by a white-collar criminal, the college campuses of America would  look like the Arctic Circle. American U. accepted Khashoggi's money in good  faith, and you can't expect the school to turn its back on him just because he  has allegedly been playing 'spin the bottle' with Mr. and Mrs. Ferdinand  Marcos."  </P> <P> "Even though the guy was in on every arms deal in the world?" Lawson yelled.  "How does a school know where to draw the line when it comes to deciding which  money is clean and which is dirty?"  </P> <P> "The line is so fine that only presidents of universities can see it. Their  problem is not the fact that they accept the money, it's having to explain to  faculty and students why they put the scoundrel's name on the building."  </P> <P> "Well, I am going to pulverize the Khashoggi Center anyway. If he turns out to  be innocent, I'll apologize to him. Why would American U. take money from a  notorious arms dealer in the first place?"  </P> <P> "The kids had to have a place to play basketball. Long after Khashoggi does  time, and I'm not saying he will, the cheers of students will be resounding  from the rafters of the AU Sports Center. We should not concern ourselves with  Khashoggi's guilt or innocence, but rather be happy about the Olympic-sized  pool he left behind."  </P> <P> "Can we at least tape over his name on the building while the jury is still  out?"  </P> <P> "No, it would suggest that AU is making a judgment on the case, which the  university never does to one of its white-collar givers."  </P> <P> "Until Khashoggi is judged by 12 of his peers, is there any action we can  take?"  </P> <P> "We must strike while he's reeling, and ask him to provide the funds for  another building on campus to match the first one. People in trouble with the  law are always anxious to perform good deeds to make amends for their bad ones.  I know of one white-collar criminal who beat a million-dollar embezzlement rap  because the sentencing judge found out that the man had given his Jaguar to a  women's volleyball team."  </P> <P> "If you won't let me bulldoze the building, will you allow me to rename it the  Michael Milken School of Business?" Lawson pleaded.  </P> <P> "It's too risky. The way things are right now, today's financial heroes could  easily wind up as tomorrow's license-plate makers."  </P></p>

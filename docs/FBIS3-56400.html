He said that the inter-bank agreement did not have anything  to do with the unification of the monetary systems. This may  happen when both Russian and Belarusian governments take a  corresponding decision, he said. So far, the Russian and  Belarusian prime ministers have only signed a statement on the  forthcoming, not actual, unification of the monetary systems, he  continued. Moreover, the agreement envisages a detailed analysis  of all aspects of both countries' monetary emission and credit  policies.    Solovov believes that Gaydar deliberately distorted facts  and  that the financial policy, pursued by the government has pushed  the Russian financial system on the verge of ruin. Moreover,  "many people claiming to be experts are in fact dilettantes  looking for a way out of the crisis in the banking policy,  instead of concentrating on economic restructuring," he said.    He stated that Gaydar's resignation was not motivated by the  inter-bank agreement. "Gaydar used it as a pretext for covering  up more complicated problems," he said.    An attentive reader of the inter-bank agreement will not  fail  to see that the actual unification of the monetary systems will  occur when the purchasing power of the Belarusian monetary unit  will become equivalent to the Russian ruble. Only then will it  become possible to exchange the national banknotes according to  the 1 to 1 rate. This work is already being done by experts of  ministries, by the Committee for Prices and by the Central Bank.  This requires a serious analysis not slogans," he said.    To quote Solovov, Russian industrial enterprises owe Belarus  211 Bn rubles (as of December 1, 1993). If this money were  repaid to Belarus, the exchange rate between the Russian and  Belarusian rubles would not be so striking, he said. The  Russian enterprises' insolvency was largely caused by the  economic policy pursued by the government in 1992-93. It had a  strong impact on the exchange rate and strongly influenced the  economic processes, stated Solovov.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Listeners, we have broadcast excerpts of the first  part -- Review of the Work in 1993 -- of the Government Work  Report delivered by Chairman Gyaincain Norbu at the second  session of the Sixth Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress  in this program in the past few days. Beginning today, we will  broadcast excerpts of the second part -- Exercise Greater  Efforts in Reform and Promote Sustained, Rapid, and Healthy  Economic Development.    Chairman Gyaincain Norbu said in his report: The year 1994  is crucial for Tibet to promote reform in all fields as a whole,  make breakthroughs in key areas, and accelerate the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure. The  guiding principles for the government's work are: Taking  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line as the  guidance to comprehensively implement the guidelines of Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Fifth  Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fourth Tibet CPC Autonomous  Regional Committee; seizing the opportunity; deepening reform;  opening wider to the outside world; promoting development;  maintaining stability; continuing to improve microeconomic  regulation and control; stepping up the infrastructure  construction; vigorously restructuring the economy; avoiding  exaggerations of economic results; and promote sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic development in Tibet.    This year, all kinds of work must serve the overall  situation  of reform, development, and stability; reform must be made to  dominate the overall situation. In restructuring the economy,  Tibet must uphold the criteria of productive forces, seize the  opportune time, promote the reform as a whole, make  breakthroughs in key areas, and keep our framework and systems  consistent with those of the state. Proceeding from the actual  situation in Tibet, we must act firmly, carry out policies  flexibly, and take each step steadily and properly. Governments  at various levels should meticulously carry out various reform  measures which have been launched and do a solid job in all  areas.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WORK HARDER TO SETTLE DISPUTES OUT OF COURT, JUDGE WARNS LAWYERS  </P> <P> An Orange County Superior Court judge, worried about a potential backlog of  lawsuits, warned lawyers this week that they must work harder at settling  disputes out of court.  </P> <P> Judge William F. McDonald, in a memo being circulated within the legal  community, announced that he and other jurists who hear legal arguments in  civil cases will soon demand "literal compliance" with a widely violated local  rule of court. That rule requires lawyers to meet and try to iron out their  differences before bringing legal motions to court.  </P> <P> The action is aimed at unclogging of the courts at a time when record numbers  of lawsuits are being filed. In 1985-87 alone, the number of new civil claims  in the county climbed from just more than 33,000 annually to almost 38,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Creative Arguments Expected  </P> <P> Some lawyers, however, doubt that the judge's warning will result in more  productive out-of-court discussions but, instead, expect that it will spur more  creative arguments by lawyers who want to convince the court that they are in  compliance with the "meet and confer" rule, as it is known.  </P> <P> "The court realizes that a lot of lawyers aren't meeting and conferring now,  but this isn't going to change that much," said lawyer Robert John Rossi of  Santa Ana. "The problem really has to be resolved between the attorneys  themselves."  </P> <P> Orange County Superior Court was one of the first courts in the state to  require that lawyers make an effort to work out disputes before bringing judges  into battles over legal motions. Several other judicial districts have followed  suit.  </P> <P> Some observers say the rule has been all but ignored by many lawyers in Orange  County.  </P> <P> Too often, Judge McDonald said in an interview Wednesday, local lawyers get  around the "meet and confer" requirement with nothing more than a quick and  essentially useless telephone call. The lawyers then take up huge chunks of  court time with legal squabbles that could have easily been resolved by the  lawyers.  </P> <P> In a memo dated Jan. 9 that will be published in local legal journals, McDonald  declared that, beginning in March, judges will no longer tolerate a brief  declaration from lawyers claiming that "we met and could not agree."  </P> <P> And lawyers who do not demonstrate a "good-faith" attempt to resolve their  disputes out of court will face sanctions, he said.  </P> <P> "We're hoping that this will result in a more substantial discussion between  the attorneys and help the courts run more smoothly," McDonald said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heading Off Problems  </P> <P> McDonald maintained that the law-and-motion section of Superior Court, which he  oversees, has overcome previous backlog problems and that his warning is only  precautionary, aimed at heading off future problems.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, he said, the daily workloads of the judges who handle  law-and-motion matters have increased from about 15 hearings to 20 in just the  last few years.  </P> <P> And several local lawyers, citing a backlog they consider to be a serious  problem, said they often have to wait up to 2 months for a hearing, while the  time lapse just a few years ago was several weeks.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The YOMIURI SHIMBUN conducted a nationwide public  opinion poll 21-22 May to survey the approval rating of the Hata  Cabinet that came to office in late April. The poll's outcome  showed that the Hata Cabinet gained a 51.6-percent approval  rating, the fourth highest approval rating following the  Hosokawa, Tanaka, and Miyazawa cabinets. Meanwhile, the outcome  of the poll showed a 34.2-percent disapproval rating of the Hata  Cabinet. Explaining reasons for approval of the Hata Cabinet,  the surveyed said: "The Hata Cabinet appears to be intending to  do something new," or "the Hata Cabinet is better than the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] cabinets." Explaining reasons  for disapproval of the Hata Cabinet, more than of 40 percent  said: "The prime minister holds no real power" or "the Hata  cabinet is unstable." In this way, many of the polled revealed  their criticism of influence wielded by Ichiro Ozawa,  representative secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party].    The YOMIURI SHIMBUN undertook an emergency telephone opinion  poll in late April right after the Hata Cabinet was inaugurated.  The poll at the time showed a 56.8 percent approval rating of  the Hata Cabinet. The latest poll was conducted as part of the  YOMIURI SHIMBUN'S regular monthly poll. According to past polls  on cabinets conducted shortly after their inauguration, the  Hosokawa Cabinet gained a 71.9-percent approval rating in the  September 1993 poll, the Tanaka cabinet won a 60.5-percent  approval rating in the October 1992 poll, and the Miyazawa  cabinet gained a 60.5-percent approval rating in the November  1991 poll. As a result, the Hata Cabinet's approval rating in  the latest poll is the fourth highest following the rating of  three successive cabinets. The Hata Cabinet's approval rating  is the seventh highest compared to the approval rating of all  cabinets, far exceeding the 49 percent approval rating of the  Suzuki Cabinet in the September 1980 poll.    Explaining reasons for approval of the Hata Cabinet, 36  percent of the polled said, "The Hata Cabinet appears to be  intending to do something new"; 32 percent said, "The Hata  cabinet is better that the LDP cabinets"; 30 percent said, "The  Hata cabinet is eager for political and economic reforms"; and  25 percent saying, "The prime minister is trustworthy."  Explaining reasons for disapproval of the Hata Cabinet, 42  percent of the surveyed stated, "The prime minister holds no  real power"; 41 percent stated, "the Hata Cabinet is unstable";  and 32 percent stating, "The Hata Cabinet appears to be doing  nothing."    Looking at the Hata Cabinet's approval rating by sex, 54  percent of the females surveyed approved of the cabinet while 49  percent of the males approved, showing the same ratio given to  the Hosokawa and Kaifu Cabinets. Looking at the support rating  by party, 26 percent of the polled supported the LDP; 11 percent  Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]; 7 percent the Social Democratic  Party of Japan [SDPJ]; and 3 percent the Japan New Party,  Komeito, and Sakigake [Harbinger Party]. The Japan New Party,  which once had the second highest support rating following the  LDP, suffered a sharp fall in the support rating after Mr.  Hosokawa resigned as prime minister and one legislator after  another have quit the party. The SDPJ, which backed out of the  ruling coalition, suffered a minor fall in its support rating  from the previous poll without increasing its rating. Shinseito  and the LDP increased 1 percentage point in their support rating  from the previous poll.</p>

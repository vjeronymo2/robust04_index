			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF'S SHARE OF $1.4-BILLION COUNTY BUDGET IS SHORT OF REQUEST  </P> <P> A $1.4-billion San Diego County budget unveiled Thursday includes $109 million  for the Sheriff's Department -- more than a 20% increase -- but nonetheless  falls far short of the spending increase sought by Sheriff John Duffy.  </P> <P> In his proposal, County Chief Administrative Officer Norman Hickey recommended  that the department's budget be increased by $18,822,493 for the fiscal year  starting July 1. That amount includes money for the salaries of 221 more  employees, a new psychiatric unit at the women's County Jail at Las Colinas in  Santee and about $4 million for operating the newly expanded Vista jail, which  is scheduled to open July 1.  </P> <P> Duffy had wanted an increase of $31 million. At last year's budget hearings,  Duffy vehemently opposed his allocation and underscored his protests by  temporarily disbanding the sheriff's child abuse unit, claiming the department  lacked adequate funding.  </P> <P> Over the past year, the Sheriff's Department has been harshly criticized by the  county Grand Jury, the public and the press over conditions in the county's  seven jails and the behavior of some of the jail deputies -- problems that  Duffy, in past public statements, blamed directly on lack of money.  </P> <P> Duffy was unavailable for comment Thursday. Sheriff's spokesman Sgt. Bob  Takeshta said, "We're very pleased with the fact that our crime prevention unit  is going to be fully funded, as well as additional dispatchers and the new  internal affairs positions which were recommended by the Grand Jury."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Will Probably Ask More  </P> <P> Takeshta said he had not spoken directly with Duffy regarding the budget, but  expects that the Sheriff's staff will review the proposal and go before the  Board of Supervisors to ask for more money.  </P> <P> Assistant CAO David Janssen said he and Hickey met with Duffy on Wednesday to  show him the proposed budget. Although Duffy expressed concern about lack of  funding for medical staffing in the jails and for adding law enforcement  personnel in unincorporated areas, Janssen said he expects "a positive budget  relationship this year."  </P> <P> Janssen said the sheriff and the Board of Supervisors are "particularly  interested in coming to an agreement on standards in the jails and in law  enforcement, so we don't have to fight about it anymore."  </P> <P> Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Susan Golding, in a morning press conference,  was more direct in her assessment of Duffy's relationship with the county.  Golding said that Duffy had employed "a great deal of rhetoric" to convince the  public he was short of money, "when in fact his budget has received perhaps the  most substantial increases of any."  </P> <P> "The sheriff can use more money, and I believe that, but so can every other  department," Golding said. "The entire social services and health area is more  in need of funds."  </P> <P> In fact, 55% of the total proposed budget has been set aside for health and  social services. The health-services budget includes a $1.6-million increase in  the contract the county has with UCSD Medical Center for the hospitalization  and emergency treatment of indigent patients. There are also provisions for 13  new employees in the Office of AIDS Coordination, and 37 more staffers to  handle increased caseloads in foster care, general relief and Aid to Families  With Dependent Children.  </P> <P> Under the proposed budget, 33 more county employees will be hired to address  growing environmental problems such as medical waste and asbestos in buildings,  and 41 positions will be added to the planning and land-use department, which  will manage the sensitive-lands program.  </P> <P> Other budget provisions falling under the category of "public protection"  include $2.3 million for construction of a medium-security jail and probation  camp on Otay Mesa, scheduled for completion in 1991, and $1.1 million for  expansion of Juvenile Hall. The budget also provides money for 13 more Superior  Court judges, 12 Municipal Court judges and 15 new attorneys each for the  district attorney and public defender.  </P> <P> Despite the fact that the proposed budget is the largest in the county's  history, up 12% from last year, Hickey described the county's financial outlook  Thursday as "bleak and somber."  </P> <P> Even with a balanced budget, as required by state law, the county will fall  $185 million short in funding of necessary programs, Hickey said.  </P> <P> There will be no money in the 1989-90 budget for increased medical services in  the jails or for legal representation of juveniles in dependency cases, despite  recent recommendations by the County Grand Jury to step up funding for both.  Money for the County Medical Services program for medically indigent adults  will be cut, and a juvenile detention camp for convicted youths may be closed  if no more funding is found.  </P></p>

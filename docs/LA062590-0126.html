			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GOLFER HALE IRWIN PROVES HE'S A STILL A CLASSIC AT 45  </P> <P> Once again, Hale Irwin put golf's youth movement on hold.  </P> <P> The 45-year-old Irwin became the oldest man to win the U.S. Open last week, and  followed it up Sunday with a victory in the Buick Classic.  </P> <P> "There's still some life left, still some fun left," Irwin said. "These are the  days you look forward to. There aren't many of them. You treasure them when  they arrive.  </P> <P> "And at this stage of your career, you appreciate them more than any others."  </P> <P> Irwin plans a whole lot of appreciating this week. He's taking the week off to  spend time with his family.  </P> <P> He said there is no secret to the success of older players.  </P> <P> "Hard work, fitness, diet," said Irwin, a former defensive back at Colorado. "I  think we're in better shape now than people this age used to be."  </P> <P> In April, 50-year-old Jack Nicklaus and 47-year-old Ray Floyd both were in  last-round contention in the Masters. Floyd took Britain's Nick Faldo into a  playoff before losing. And on the Seniors Tour, 50-year-old Lee Trevino already  has earned $508,633.  </P> <P> Irwin says age is an asset in golf.  </P> <P> "It's called experience," he said. "You have to learn yourself, know yourself  and your game. It is not an instant thing. It only comes with time. You have to  know how you hold up, how your game holds up in the heat of competition.  </P> <P> "You can't be running off to a swing guru or a sports psychologist every five  minutes. It takes time to learn that."  </P> <P> Paul Azinger, 30, runner-up in the Buick Classic, looks at Irwin and is  thrilled he's able to make a career of golf.  </P> <P> "I look at Hale and I'm so thankful I'm in golf," Azinger said. "In golf, I'm  young. In another sport, in tennis or basketball or something where you have to  be fast on your feet, I'd be over the hill and on the way out. In golf, I'm  young.  </P> <P> "Hale is a lesson for all us young guys. We look at him and we know that we can  still be playing and winning 15 years from now."  </P> <P> Earlier story, C6.  </P></p>

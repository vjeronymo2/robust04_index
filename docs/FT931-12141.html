			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: BCE profits record for Canada BCE, Canada's biggest telecommunications group and parent of Northern Telecom, posted record profit of CDollars 1.4bn (USDollars 1.09bn), or CDollars 4.21 a share, for 1992, in spite of the recession and rising long-distance competition. The profit is the highest posted by a Canadian company. Last year, BCE acquired 20 per cent of the UK's Mercury Communications for nearly CDollars 1bn. Mr Raymond Cyr, 59, who since 1987 has led BCE back to its core telecom businesses after several years of disastrous diversification into property, energy and financial services, retires on April 1 and will be succeeded by former banker Mr Lynton Wilson, president for two years. Mr Cyr will remain a director and adviser to Mr Wilson as well as non-executive chairman of Bell Canada, the telephone utility, and several other BCE subsidiaries. BCE's net profit for the year to December 1992 was CDollars 1.295bn, or CDollars 4.21 per share, up 5 per cent from CDollars 1.235bn, or CDollars 4.01, in 1991. Revenues rose 4.5 per cent to CDollars 20.8bn, a new peak. Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 505m, or CDollars 1.65 a share, up from CDollars 346m, or CDollars 1.11, a year earlier on revenues of CDollars 5.5bn, against CDollars 4.9bn. The 1992 period included a CDollars 95m gain on the sale of TransCanada Pipelines shares. Bell Canada provided the bulk of BCE's profits. Its 1992 performance improved with sharp gains in efficiency. Its contribution equalled CDollars 3.03 per BCE share against CDollars 2.97 in 1991 Operating revenues rose 1.7 per cent. Northern Telecom contributed CDollars 1.11 per BCE share in 1992, up from 97 cents in 1991, with a strong fourth quarter. But Montreal Trustco had a 31 cents-a-share negative impact, against a contribution of 7 cents per BCE share in 1991. Property loans were written down sharply.</p>

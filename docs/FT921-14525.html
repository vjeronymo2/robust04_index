			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Patten predicts move to extend share ownership - Tory election strategy A TRAILER for a Conservative election manifesto offering new incentives for share and home ownership, a further shake-up of the education system and more responsive public services was offered last night by Mr Chris Patten. Delivering the annual Disraeli lecture at the St Stephens' Club in London, the party chairman said that the first priority of a re-elected Conservative government would be to establish Britain as a 'low inflation country'. In a lengthy discourse designed to set out the choice facing the electorate in the election due by July, Mr Patten underlined that the Conservatives would put taxation at the heart of its campaign. He foreshadowed also an imminent Conservative onslaught on Labour's plans to repeal some of the government's trades union legislation, arguing that the opposition was at the mercy of union 'muscle'. Reinforcing speculation of a tax-cutting Budget in March, Mr Patten said the Tory commitment to lower taxes and Labour plans to increase them would be 'the fault line which will run through the political debate both in the election campaign and well beyond it'. Disclaiming any intention to pre-empt the manifesto he is now drafting, Mr Patten gave clear hints of the themes and priorities agreed in meetings between Mr Major and cabinet colleagues last week. The commitment to lower taxation underpinned the principle that freedom and choice were 'best served if families are allowed to spend their own money as much as possible'. Personal choice, freedom, ownership and responsibility will be the key manifesto themes. Mr Patten sought to emphasise that this was compatible with further improvements in the quality of public services, hinting that the party will seek to relaunch its Citizen's Charter as a vehicle to 'revolutionise' attitudes in those services. The clearest manifesto hints were to be found when Mr Patten turned his attention to areas such as housing. He indicated that the government was determined to press ahead with its plans to promote the sale of local authority properties - particularly in large estates - in spite of the present slump in the housing market. He indicated also that new incentives would be offered to encourage savings and share ownership and that the Conservative party would accelerate sharply its plans to break the influence over schools of local education authorities.</p>

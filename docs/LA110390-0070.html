			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EDBERG, BECKER APPEAR HEADED FOR PARIS SHOWDOWN  </P> <P> It appears that Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker are headed for a showdown in the  final of the Paris indoor tournament.  </P> <P> Both won their quarterfinal matches Friday. Top-seeded Edberg beat Jakob  Hlasek, 6-3, 6-2, and No. 2 Becker beat Michael Stich, 6-1, 6-2.  </P> <P> In the semifinals, Becker will play Jonas Svensson, who beat sixth-seeded  Emilio Sanchez, 7-5, 6-4. Sergi Bruguera of Spain beat qualifier Guillaume  Raoux of France, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, in another quarterfinal and will play Edberg.  </P> <P> Becker beat Edberg in the Paris final last year, but Becker has beaten Edberg  in straight sets at Sydney, Australia and at Stockholm, Sweden, in the past  month.  </P> <P> Edberg broke Hlasek's serve in the first game of Friday's match and broke again  in the first and third games of the second set with big service returns.  </P> <P> In the last game, Hlasek fell behind 0-40 and saved two match points before  Edberg hit a service return past Hlasek to close it out.  </P> <P> Becker needed only 67 minutes for his 13th consecutive victory at the Paris  indoor.  </P> <P> "It's my best match of the tournament," Becker said. "It usually gets tougher  in the quarterfinals, but for me it's getting easier."  </P> <P> Said Stich, ranked 67th: "Today I lost to a player two times better than me. I  didn't have any chances to win a set or the match."  </P> <P> Third-seeded Zina Garrison, troubled by Marianne Werdel's power game in the  opening set, converted her opponent's mistakes into a 6-7 (3-7), 6-1, 6-2  quarterfinal victory in a $350,000 tournament at Oakland.  </P> <P> Unseeded Meredith McGrath beat Rosalyn Fairbank-Nideffer, 6-3, 4-6, 6-3.  </P> <P> Accusing the United States of putting television before tennis, Australia has  demanded that the timetable for the Davis Cup final at St. Petersburg, Fla., be  rescheduled.  </P> <P> The U.S. organizers want singles matches to run from 5 p.m. until midnight on  the first day Nov. 30, with play resuming in the doubles at 12:30 p.m. the next  day.  </P> <P> Tennis Australia wants the international management committee of the  International Tennis Federation to change the timetable. In a statement, Tennis  Australia said that after having a shower and massage, speaking to the press,  and having a meal, a player would have only "five hours effective rest" before  getting up to start practice.  </P> <P> The United States has said its singles players will not play in the doubles,  but Australian captain Neale Fraser has not yet announced his lineup.  </P> <P> The Davis Cup committee refused to intervene last month, but Tennis Australia  insists that the rules do not give the host country the right to dictate  scheduling.  </P> <P> The event will be televised by ESPN.  </P></p>

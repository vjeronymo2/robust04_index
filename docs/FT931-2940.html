			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: US economy After Friday's disappointing US producer price figures, yesterday's underlying rise of 0.5 per cent in February consumer prices is somewhat unnerving. But it would be premature to conclude that inflation is gathering strength again. The consumer price figure was boosted by an unusually large but probably one-off rise in clothing prices. Producer prices reflected the higher cost of lumber as sawing restrictions were imposed to protect the spotted owl. That could be a sign that regulatory actions by an interventionist Clinton administration could push up the overall price level in the US. Otherwise there is little obvious inflationary pressure building up in the system. Broad money growth and credit demand remain weak. Productivity gains should restrain prices, and, though capacity use is at its highest for 18 months, it is still not stretched. There may be room for long bond yields to plumb new lows around 6.5 per cent in the next few months. That would be all the more likely if, as some expect, the rapid recovery established around the turn of the year slows in the second quarter. For the time being the global bond market environment should thus not hinder the UK chancellor's efforts to finance the Pounds 50bn public sector deficit announced on Tuesday. Disinflationary pressures still seem strong enough to offset growing calls by governments on bond markets around the world. That feeling could grow when continental European interest rates turn decisively and inverted yield curves become positive again.</p>

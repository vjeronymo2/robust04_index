			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / International Company News: Petrobras loss raises fears for debt servicing ability PETROBRAS, Brazil's state oil monopoly, has made its first loss, turning a Dollars 557m 1990 profit into a deficit of Dollars 237m for 1991. The result raises fears among investors over Petrobras' ability to service and repay the Dollars 761m in Eurobonds it has raised since last July. For the first time since the company's creation in 1953 it will not pay a dividend. Petrobras pioneered Brazil's recent return to the international capital markets using the slogan 'we're a good company with a bad address'. However Mr Antonio Claudio Pereira da Silva, the company's superintendent of finance, said yesterday that he considered the result was positive because it was linked to 'financial adjustments rather than operating performance'. He blamed the losses on new accounting laws which require assets to be revalued according to inflation, while liabilities are adjusted against the dollar. Last year the dollar rose 528 per cent against the cruzeiro compared with inflation of 477 per cent. The new accounting requirement is expected to result in many companies presenting surprise losses. While the parent company made profits of Dollars 118m its subsidiaries reported losses of Dollars 355m. Petroquisa, the petrochemical arm, lost Dollars 150.5m, Braspetro, its international division, lost Dollars 72.8m, Petrofertil, its fertiliser subsidiary lost Dollars 50.5m and Petromisa, its mining division, lost Dollars 113.8m. The company's gross revenues of Dollars 13.9bn were, however, 11.8 per cent down on 1990. Petrobras has debts of Dollars 3.8bn of which Dollars 2.6bn are short term.</p>

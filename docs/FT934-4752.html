			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke Things are not looking good at Ladbroke. While City attention was focused on Tuesday's budget speech, the company announced that a senior director had sold just over half his stake. Then yesterday it dribbled into the market the news that, while others are still cautiously awaiting the small print, it is leaping at the chance to pay a foreign income dividend. Only after the market had closed and its shares had already fallen 12 per cent did it issue a formal statement through the Stock Exchange. Ladbroke's assessment that the announcement was not price sensitive looks curious when the foreign income dividend will reduce the return to institutions who will be unable to claim a tax credit. The main market worry is that the company appears to be scrabbling around for ways of maintaining an unsustainable dividend instead of working to reduce its Pounds 1.5bn borrowings and repair its balance sheet. There may well be an innocent explanation for the share sale by Mr Michael Hirst, a respected hotelier who runs Ladbroke's Hilton division. But the market is nervous after the Queens Moat debacle. Perhaps yesterday's violent reaction will convince Ladbroke that it does not pay to be so coy.</p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Russian trade turns westward - A fall of commerce with other former Soviet states Russia now trades more with developed countries, especially with western Europe, than with other former Soviet states - a dramatic change in trading patterns over the past three years. The first figures showing trade with developed countries and the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) were released yesterday at a conference of senior Russian and European Union officials and ambassadors. The data show that, in the first two quarters of this year, Russia's trade volume with the members of the European Union, stood at Dollars 16.8bn (Dollars 9.9bn exports and Dollars 6.9bn imports) - 37 per cent of its total trade. This compares with Dollars 10.8bn trade turnover with the other CIS member states (Dollars 6.2bn exports and Dollars 4.6bn imports) - 24 per cent of its total trade. Trade with the former partners in Comecon, the trading bloc which used to unite the socialist countries, has fallen even faster: central and eastern European countries had a trade turnover of only Dollars 5.7bn with Russia in the first half of this year (Dollars 3.7bn Russian exports and Dollars 2bn imports). By far the largest part of Russian exports to these and other countries is raw materials, especially energy. Russia has cut back on energy supplies to the CIS states, preferring the greater ability to pay and the higher prices paid by states outside of the former Soviet Union - a policy which the government has said will continue this year and which is likely to cause problems to the weakerCIS members. Germany is by far the most important trading partner for Russia within the EU - and in the world. Bonn's 1993 trade turnover with Russia stood at Dollars 5.8bn, compared with China's Dollars 4.02bn. Mr Reiner Hartmann, the Moscow representative of Ruhrgas - the biggest foreign customer for Russian natural gas - said that Germany takes 30 per cent of its gas and 12 per cent of its crude oil from Russia. 'Without any doubt Russia's market today and tomorrow is in western Europe - and for the European Union, Russia is the most significant trading partner on the continent.' Russia is the fifth largest trading partner for the EU after the US, Switzerland, Japan and China. A background paper produced for the conference says that there is 'enormous potential' for a growth in trade. 'In the long run one might expect these trade flows to converge on something closer to the scale of the EU's trade with the US, currently seven times greater. While it will take many years for such economic structures to develop, the geographical proximity of Russia and the EU will facilitate a great trade expansion,' the paper said. Russia has progressively liberalised trade policies over the past three years - though it re-imposed some tariffs earlier this year. The government, however, faces calls for more protectionist measures in the face of continuing decline in Russian industrial production. The structure of Russian imports has switched massively from capital goods and equipment to consumer goods, especially food. The Agreement on Partnership and Co-operation, signed by President Boris Yeltsin and EU leaders in Corfu in June, established a legal framework for trade in goods and services and for the operation of foreign investments. The agreement is designed to evolve until 1998, when a review of its operation will be held to determine whether or not a free trade regime can be established between the EU and Russia. EU states also play a dominant role in the formation of joint ventures - with over 90 per cent of total ventures being between a company from one of the EU states and a Russian enterprise. However, the expansion is not without attendant problems. Mr Sergei Krylov, Russian deputy foreign minister, said EU states still practised substantial discrimination against Russian goods. 'We want no particular advantages,' he said, 'we want only agreed entrance to the European market.' Mr Oleg Bogomolov, a former official dealing with Comecon relations and now a leading deputy, said that 'the breaking of the links with our former partners has been painful for them and us - and our trade with western Europe should not be to the detriment of trade with the CIS'. Mr Georgy Gabunia, deputy trade minister, and Russia's chief negotiator of the agreement between the EU and Russia on partnership and co-operation signed in June, said that when Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden join the EU 'it will affect us adversely because we have freer trading arrangements with them than with the EU'. And Mr Sergei Baburin, a leading nationalist deputy of the state duma (lower house) told the conference that 'the influence of western Europe on Russia means an increase in pro-communist and nationalist sentiment here. . . .the western European view of Russia as a source of crime, of drugs, of prostitution is a result of these policies which the western states have urged upon us'.</p>

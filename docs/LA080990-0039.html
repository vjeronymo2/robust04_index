			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CERULLO TO MOVE SAN DIEGO MINISTRY TO EX-PTL 'HERITAGE USA' PARK  </P> <P> Morris Cerullo, the San Diego-based evangelist who is buying the Christian  theme park Jim Bakker built in Ft. Mill, S.C., said Wednesday that he plans to  move his entire ministry to the site by the middle of next year, when the park  is scheduled to reopen.  </P> <P> Cerullo estimated that his operations in San Diego employ 150 full- and  part-time staffers, but he said plans for relocation had not been discussed  with them yet.  </P> <P> He said the 2,200-acre "New Heritage USA" site, which Jim Bakker built up as  the cornerstone of the now defunct PTL Club, "will be a clean, wholesome  atmosphere" and operated strictly as a business and kept separate from the  ministry.  </P> <P> "I'm going to continue to take the lead in running the ministry," he said.  </P> <P> Cerullo said his son David will run the ministry's TV network, which will  broadcast over the former PTL satellite network. Cerullo has put $7 million  into escrow to buy the network but is still awaiting approval from the Federal  Communications Commission.  </P> <P> At Wednesday's press conference, Cerullo introduced three men who will help him  run Heritage USA. One, Bill Lund, worked for Walt Disney in the initial stages  of developing both Walt Disney World and Epcot Center. Lund is a trustee of  Occidental College.  </P> <P> Also working with Cerullo will be Hal Tysinger, a North Carolina native who  specializes in rejuvenating slumping real estate developments, and Dennis  Kohan, who has more than 25 years experience in financial management.  </P> <P> "Funding for New Heritage USA has been committed by established financial  institutions here in the United States," said Cerullo, who didn't specify which  banks. Cerullo has until Nov. 2 to find $45 million needed to finance the theme  park.  </P> <P> The money will go to pay off the secured creditors owed money by PTL (which  stands for Praise The Lord).  </P> <P> Alan Elias, a Cerullo spokesman, said a "package of benefits" will also be  arranged for those who purchased "lifetime partnerships" from PTL while it was  run by Jim Bakker, now serving a 45-year prison term in Minnesota for fraud and  conspiracy.  </P> <P> Elias also said the buying of Heritage USA is the culmination of two years of  planning and research into the purchase.  </P></p>

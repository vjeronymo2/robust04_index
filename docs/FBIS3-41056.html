			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Oleksandr Rol, head of the </F> Ukrainian Officers' Association and the Ukrainian Air Force  Operational Administration chief of staff, by Mariya Bazelyuk;  place and date not given: "It Is Impossible To Ensure State  Security Relying on Other Countries' Guarantees Only"]    [Text] Bazelyuk: What role do you think the  Ukrainian Officers' Association [SOU] should play in building  the state?    Rol: The association's chief goal is to promote  consolidation of the Armed Forces and therefore strengthen the  Ukrainian state, because the Army is one of the fundamental  institutions of its protection. As everyone knows, the SOU is a  public organization including officers in active service as well  as those discharged into the reserve or retired. The  association is experiencing hard times because of an ambiguous  attitude to it on the part of the Defense Ministry. Obviously,  there were some mistakes made by its leadership -- and therefore  by myself since I belonged to it. One of them is preoccupation  with political activities while the association's main goal is  the consolidation of the Armed Forces. Also, issuing various  declarations criticizing the commander in chief does not seem to  make much sense. This is exactly what triggered a negative  attitude among high-ranking officials.    No doubt, the SOU needs no help from the Armed Forces. On  the contrary, the association itself morally supports the  military. How? We consider it our obligation to instill the  spirit of Ukrainian patriotism and the glorious traditions of  the Ukrainian Army in the military personnel. The SOU sees this  as its main thrust of activities, maintaining close contacts  with many public organizations and participants of the  national-liberation struggle, who can have a strong impact on  education of the personnel.    Another aspect of our activities is the social protection of  servicemen and members of their families as well as assisting  the command in establishing a strict order in military units and  components.    Today, we have to clearly define and adjust methods of  restoring the SOU, and this is also a goal of its leadership.  At the end of last year, SOU leaders met with Lieutenant  General Kobzar, chief of the Main Education Administration and  head of the Socio- Psychological Service at the Ukrainian  Defense Administration. During the conversation, we found out  that our positions regarding SOU's role in strengthening the  Ukrainian Armed Forces are the same. As General Kobzar stated,  the Ukrainian Defense Ministry will support all organizations  that contribute to the Ukrainian Army's combat readiness, and  said he would like to see the SOU playing a greater role in the  consolidation of officers and cultivating the best military  traditions. We talked about involving more amateur groups,  professional artists, and simply interesting people in  performing in military units.    In other words, the general and I had a very businesslike  conversation, which he promised to communicate to the defense  minister. I think we will soon meet with the latter. The  Officers' Association ought to work in close collaboration with  the Defense Ministry and all state structures in charge of  protecting the independence of our state. After all, the SOU  and the Defense Ministry fulfill that same task of state  importance.    Bazelyuk: What is your attitude to Ukraine's  nuclear disarmament?    Rol: Since 1991, I have repeatedly spoken through  various media, maintaining that Ukraine must have nuclear  weapons until any state that could become our potential  adversary gets rid of its own nuclear arsenal. This is what I  think. Whatever large army we have, it would be nothing  compared to the nuclear potential, which is a means of  protection for Ukraine.    The position of our political leadership has caused a number  of negative processes. Back in the days when Ukraine was moving  toward independence, it hastily proclaimed its intention to  become a nonnuclear state. Here is another example. They ask:  Why should Ukraine have the Black Sea Fleet since it declared  that it needs the fleet only for local purposes? This is how  the Black Sea Fleet arose with all its consequences. It is too  bad that we so hurriedly gave up tactical weapons that could  defend Ukraine better than even the strongest Army. You cannot  guarantee national security without modern weapons.    Ukraine must proceed from the fact that it is impossible to  ensure protection of the state against an enemy's armed assault,  relying on other countries' guarantees only. In terms of combat  readiness and national security of Ukraine, we should count only  on our own strength.    Why does the West help Russia in all possible ways? Just  because it has the powerful nuclear potential and is a strong  state in this sense.    Bazelyuk: Is there anything one could do to retain  the nuclear status?    Rol: In my opinion, the question "Should Ukraine  be a nuclear state?" should be put to a nationwide referendum.  I am outraged when some state lays down the law to us: "You  must get rid of nuclear weapons." Who would dare to tell this  to China, Great Britain, or France?    Bazelyuk: What do you think about the fact that  the 43d Rocket Army personnel has not yet pledged allegiance to  Ukraine?    Rol: I will look into this as the head of the  Ukrainian Officers' Association.    Bazelyuk: You were proposed as a candidate to the  Ukrainian Supreme Council. You have accepted the nomination...    Rol: Yes, I have. First of all, because I have a  clear notion of what I would be doing in the Ukrainian  legislature. If people trust me, I will press for strong  political power that would introduce and maintain legal order in  the country. After all, a political crisis is a power crisis.  I will stand for a balanced implementation of reform based on  all forms of ownership. In my opinion, state property should  cover those industries and enterprises upon which the protection  of our country's independence and national interests depends. I  will demand the buildup of a national Ukrainian Army -- a  guarantor of independence -- equipped with modern weapons.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Government Bonds: Sharp rise in short-term interest rates weakens Irish gilts PRICES in the Irish gilts market slipped yesterday due to a sharp rise in short-term interest rates and uncertainty over the formation of the next government following Wednesday's election. Following the suspension of its key interest rate, the short-term facility, earlier this week, the central bank yesterday announced its short-term borrowings would rise to 30 per cent today and to 100 per cent on Monday in a move designed to curb speculation over a devaluation of the currency. Meanwhile, the market could be further affected if wranglings over the formation of the next government, following this week's election, prove protracted. Whatever the outcome, there is expected to be little effect on supply in the gilts market, since all parties are committed to staying within Maastricht guidelines on policy. There was speculation yesterday that if, as seems likely, the Labour party helps form a new coalition government, the chances of a speedy devaluation could be increased. In any case, many analysts believe that the current situation is becoming untenable. THE German bond market lost early gains on news of another bad regional consumer price index figure. The CPI in Bavaria showed at 0.6 per cent rise for November. Analysts said that meant that German inflation was likely to remain at 3.7 per cent at the end of this year, but was bound to rise above 4 per cent, when value-added tax increases started to come through. The Bundesbank's failure to lower rates yesterday held no surprises. 'The only thing that could make the Bundesbank move now is a desire to save the exchange-rate mechanism,' said one analyst. The bund future ended unchanged, but the Euro-D-Mark contract fell 10 ticks as any hopes of a rate cut fell further. IN London, the gilts market ended slightly lower ahead of next week's Pounds 2.5bn auction of new 10-year 8 per cent stock. The new stock is free of tax for residents abroad. Although the market has cheapened ahead of the auction, it is 'fairly well underpinned,' according to Mr Phillip Tyson, bond analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. 'Investors are reluctant to reduce exposure while prospects for short term rates remain good.' FRENCH bonds ended unchanged, after a dull day's trading. The pressure on the currency appears to have faded, and the Thanksgiving Day holiday in the US further reduced activity in the French and other markets.</p>

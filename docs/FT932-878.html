			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Scandals stir voter apathy: Japan's electors seem determined to throw out the old-style politics WHILE his opponents took to cruising the streets of Tokyo in gaudy loudspeaker vans this week to rally voters for a metropolitan assembly election tomorrow, Mr Toshio Terayama adopts a more modest approach. At 25 the Japan New party's youngest candidate, he campaigns on a banner-festooned bicycle. After last weekend's political upheaval, the city election will be a pointer to the outcome of the parliamentary election on July 18. It will test the strength of the reformist parties including the JNP as well as what remains of the ruling Liberal Democratic party. 'You don't have to spend so much on election campaigns, and I'm here to prove it,' says Mr Terayama. He tells his listeners that he will try to narrow the gap between politics and the electorate. The move to unravel the old money-driven political system dominated by the LDP has struck a chord with younger voters, who have been discouraged by the spate of corruption scandals within the ruling party. Many voters are showing greater interest in the local polls than in the past, when turnout has been below 60 per cent. 'I haven't voted since I got married, but I'm interested this time,' says a housewife in her twenties listening to Mr Terayama, while Mr Hiroaki Sawazaki, a 30-year-old writer, says: 'It's easy to be cynical, but it's our generation that has to bring in changes.' Some local LDP candidates are expected to follow Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former finance minister, who split from the LDP this week to form his own party.  A few candidates have covered up the LDP name on their sashes with tape or concealed the LDP logo on their campaign posters with stickers supporting political reform. Meanwhile, many politicians in the provinces have also indicated that they want to defect from the LDP. Even those who have chosen to remain with the ruling party have refused campaign support speeches from Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the embattled prime minister. According to a poll of 900 voters published on Thursday by the daily Asahi Shimbun, 20 per cent said they would vote LDP, down from 25 per cent in 1989, while the JNP came in second with 10 per cent support. The survey  - conducted on Sunday and Monday before the formation of the two newest groupings  - indicated that the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, could be hit the most, with a support level of 9 per cent, down sharply from 17 per cent. With political reform as the only concrete issue even on the local level, voters are increasingly confused by the sprouting new parties. Voters say it is hard to differentiate among them. 'I've voted LDP until now, but I don't really know who I'll vote for in the local election,' says a middle-aged housewife who put down her groceries to listen to a campaigner. Mr Terayama says he is trying to promote social welfare. But his main message consists of the need for cleaner politics and ousting the LDP. Whether candidates like Mr Terayama backed by the new reformists can arouse many among the electorate who have been turned off by the spate of bribery and tax evasion scandals, remains to be seen. It will take more than good weather to lure the electorate to the polls. Some voters, who for a long time have felt their votes would not make a difference, remain complacent. 'I might vote this Sunday if I have the time. It's hard when you have children, you know,' says another housewife, as she scurries past the campaigner.</p>

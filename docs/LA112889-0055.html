			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DROPOUT PROBLEM BURDENS JUNIOR HIGHS;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: RATE IS PUT AT 7.4% IN L.A. DISTRICT, RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW  THE SCHOOLS ARE RUN. OFFICIALS STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE  DIFFICULTIES AND TO MAKE THE CLASSROOM MORE APPEALING.  </P> <P> More than 8,000 junior high school students in the Los Angeles Unified School  District dropped out last year, offering troubling evidence that junior highs  -- as well as high schools -- have a serious dropout problem.  </P> <P> Many local educators say the new findings suggest that junior high -- an  institution often described as being caught in the middle, lacking direction  and adequate resources -- may be in sore need of an overhaul.  </P> <P> A recent report from the district's dropout prevention office showed that 7.4%  of the school system's 117,000 sixth-to-ninth graders -- or 8,680 students --  dropped out of junior high during the 1987-88 school year, the latest for which  statistics are available.  </P> <P> The dropout rate ranged from 1.76% at Dodson Junior High in San Pedro to 28.46%  at Bethune in South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Little is known about the scope and causes of the dropout problem in junior  high in part because most states, including California, ask school systems to  report dropouts only from the 10th grade on. The Los Angeles district began  counting junior high dropouts on its own three years ago, but made the latest  figures available as part of school board hearings on the dropout problem.  </P> <P> "We're flying blind right now," said state Supt. of Public Instruction Bill  Honig. "We know (dropping out in junior high) is a potential problem. But I  don't think people really know that much about it. We haven't been keeping  score."  </P> <P> The district's overall junior high dropout rate actually declined from 14.4% in  1985-86 and 10.19% in 1986-87. School officials say the decline may signal  better reporting by schools, although others say some schools may be  undercounting dropouts.  </P> <P> Dropout studies generally focus on the senior high years, when the hemorrhaging  is most severe. Nationally, about 25% of students fail to finish high school,  and in large cities, such as Los Angeles, New York and Chicago, the rate ranges  between 40% and 50%.  </P> <P> Los Angeles' 7.4% rate in junior high reflects the number of  sixth-through-ninth graders who dropped out over the course of one year. Most  of the district's junior highs run from seventh to ninth grade, so that could  translate into at least a 20% dropout rate overall for the graduating class of  1988.  </P> <P> Some junior high principals suspect that the figures are too low. But others  complain that the current methods of conducting dropout surveys are unreliable  and exaggerate the problem. Some of the students recorded as dropouts may be  enrolled in another district, for instance, but if they have not requested a  transfer of their school records, the district assumes they are not in school.  </P> <P> Although he disputed the accuracy of the district's figures, Gompers Junior  High Principal Ron Sakoda said, "We know what occurs and we're trying to  prevent it. For (students) to drop out at junior high school age is just  deadly."  </P> <P> Some of the reasons why students drop out in junior high are the same as in  senior high, experts say. Students who are older than their classmates because  they have had to repeat grades, who have low self-esteem and are failing  academically, or who lack strong parental guidance are prime candidates. Drug  abuse, gang involvement and pregnancy also cause many students to abandon  school.  </P> <P> But educators believe factors unique to the junior high experience also cause  dropouts. District statistics show that most junior high dropouts leave in the  seventh grade, when junior high begins. Larry Glenn, an El Sereno Junior High  School science teacher, said, "They're coming from elementary school to a big  zoo," and some students may feel lost.  </P> <P> Often, several factors combine to produce a dropout. On a recent morning, for  example, El Sereno Junior High School dropout counselor Ana Maria Romero gently  questioned a teary-eyed eighth-grade boy who had already missed half of the  first 10 weeks of classes. The boy told her that he feels dumb and can't keep  up with class work. To make matters worse, his parents apparently do little to  force him to attend school. In fact, they write excuse notes for him so that he  won't be marked truant.  </P> <P> Romero promised to provide him with extra tutoring after school and planned to  contact his parents. Without special attention, he might well become a dropout,  she said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Board of Education President Jackie Goldberg said that cultural  beliefs may contribute to the district's junior high dropout problem.  </P> <P> Sixty percent of the district's 610,000 pupils are Latino, many of them  immigrants. "In some countries," said Goldberg, "the expectation is that being  educated means (finishing) elementary school."  </P> <P> In Goldberg's view, this could explain why more than a third of the junior high  dropouts in the 1987-88 school year fell into the "no-show" category --  students who were expected to enroll in junior high but never appeared at the  school.  </P> <P> In other cases, schools find that the no-shows include immigrant students who  returned with their families to their native country -- Mexico, in particular  -- or who, because of financial difficulties, moved in with relatives in  another area. Many families who move at the end of the academic year fail to  notify the school that their children will not be returning.  </P> <P> Some principals criticize the dropout statistics because they count new  students who fail to show up for school in the fall.  </P> <P> "These are people we don't know -- we've never seen them," said Marvin  Gottlieb, assistant principal of Nobel Junior High School in Northridge, where  71 of the 95 dropouts recorded in 1987-88 were no-shows. "If they never showed  up, the school never got a chance to work with them. That should not reflect  (negatively) on the school."  </P> <P> At Watts' Gompers Junior High, where a 24.59% dropout rate was reported,  Principal Sakoda said the problem could stem in part from a shortage of "fun"  elective classes, such as wood shop, which were eliminated due to budget cuts  beginning about five years ago.  </P> <P> Deputy Supt. Sidney Thompson said junior highs also lack an adequate number of  counselors to reach out to potential dropouts. "The thing that burns me up  about this is that we know that outreach programs work. But the resources are  spread very thin. What happens is pretty soon kids start to slip through the  cracks."  </P> <P> Junior highs have about one counselor for every 400 or 500 students, Thompson  said. Twelve of the district's 73 junior highs have an additional dropout  prevention counselor paid for with special state funds.  </P> <P> At Nimitz Junior High School in Huntington Park, one of the 12 schools in the  state-funded program, dropout counselor Ryan Scott said overall student  attendance has improved from 93% to 95% in two years, in large part because of  special efforts he has mounted to reward good attendance. "We have to get the  kids in school before we can work on their academics and behavior and  attitude," he said.  </P> <P> In addition, the district runs 16 student assistance centers that provide  would-be dropouts with small group instruction and extra counseling. An  independent evaluator found that the centers' dropout rate was 7% in 1987-88,  slightly lower than the district average of 7.4%. But the centers are able to  serve only 4,500 students a year.  </P> <P> A growing number of educators believe that the problem is the basic structure  of the traditional junior high, which presents students with too drastic a  change from elementary school. Aside from coping with traumatic physical  changes associated with puberty, junior high students are asked to adjust to a  totally different school pattern. Instead of having the same teacher and  classroom all year, they suddenly have six or seven teachers, and different  classmates and rooms every period. Moreover, they have to carry books, remember  locker combinations and suffer the indignities of dressing and showering for  gym. And, junior highs are bigger, more impersonal places, with perhaps 1,000  to 3,000 instead of 300 to 600 students.  </P> <P> Junior high may represent "more of a shock for kids," UCLA education professor  and dropout expert James Catterall surmised, "and some kids fail to adjust."  </P> <P> The solution, some junior high teachers and administrators in Los Angeles and  other districts across the country say, is to reorganize the schools to soften  the transition from the elementary grades and make junior high a friendlier  place.  </P> <P> Several Los Angeles district junior highs have taken the approach of creating a  separate school-within-a-school for high-risk students. At one campus,  Hollenbeck in East Los Angeles, the entire school of 2,300 students was  reorganized this year into five separate clusters or "casitas." Each  mini-school has 466 students, 17 teachers -- including one "lead teacher" who  carries a lighter class load and helps supervise instruction -- a counselor and  coordinator. Students will stay with the same classmates and teachers for all  of junior high.  </P> <P> "We're trying to create a warm environment that is academically productive and  that makes kids feel good about being here," said Hollenbeck Principal Evelyn  Lucero.  </P> <P> Although it is too early to judge whether the new approach will discourage  dropouts, Lucero said student attendance already has improved school-wide.  </P> <P> At El Sereno Junior High School, 180 of the 2,600 students belong to Partners  in Learning, a mini-school created last year through the efforts of teacher  Larry Torres and dropout prevention counselor Romero.  </P> <P> More than one-third of the students in the program are considered at risk of  becoming dropouts, Romero said. Teachers are encouraged to collaborate on  lessons and confer with each other about their students during weekly meetings  before school, an aspect of the program that aids quicker identification of  truancy problems.  </P> <P> "One teacher can say, 'Is anyone else having a problem with Joe?' " said  Romero, "and another person may say, 'Oh, yeah, Joe's father left the home.'  There's more cohesiveness this way."  </P> <P> The program also emphasizes cooperation among students. Students tutor each  other, and the eighth graders are encouraged to "adopt" a seventh grader for  special attention. Last year, the students and their teachers went on a  three-day camping trip together, and more such activities are planned to help  foster a family feeling among the students and staff, Romero said.  </P> <P> Tony, an eighth grader who was truant during most of the seventh grade and  almost got kicked out of school, said he likes the program. "The teachers talk  to you like friends," he said.  </P> <P> Maggie, also an eighth grader, said she would be bored with school if she  weren't in the program. "We have fun together," she said, recalling the camping  trip. "The teachers know about us and we know about them." She also likes  having a fellow student tutor her in math, a subject she said she is failing.  </P> <P> Although only in its second year, the Partners in Learning program has produced  some encouraging results. Romero said that a study of students in the program  who read below grade level showed they had a 2.1 grade average, compared to 1.5  for similar students attending the regular school.  </P> <P> She also said that almost three-quarters of the program's seventh graders last  year signed up for pre-algebra this year, and 80% say they want to go to  college. "That is not representative of this school," Romero said.  </P> <P> Another component of the program offers parents training and information on how  to help their children stay in school.  </P> <P> Torres, who teaches social studies and helps coordinate the  school-within-a-school, said he has high hopes for the program.  </P> <P> "In elementary school, kids really like school. In junior high, something  happens that causes them not to like school. This type of program will make the  staying power of school greater because the school will feel more like a  community."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1987-88 JUNIOR HIGH DROPOUT RATES FOR L.A. UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT  </P> <P> Here are the Los Angeles Unified School District's dropout rates for junior  high schools. Most junior highs run from seventh through ninth grade, but  several have been reorganized as middle schools, which run from sixth through  eighth grade. The figures show the number of students who dropped out in each  grade over the course of one year and the dropout rate for each school.  </P> <TABLE

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.4% as yen strengthens against dollar LATE SELLING led by the futures market erased the session's earlier gains, as worries about a stronger yen against the dollar pressured equity prices below the 20,000 level, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 283.91, or 1.4 per cent, to 19,828.43 for its third consecutive decline, after trading between an intraday low of 19,806.65 and a high of 20,332.20. The Topix index of all first section issues dipped 10.23 to close at 1,543.34, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 4.92 to 1,213.84. Volume was estimated at 430m shares, compared to Monday's 361m. Declines outscored advances by 638 to 401, with 144 issues unchanged. The strengthening of the yen, which ended at a record high of Y110.25 to the dollar in Tokyo, triggered selling in the final minutes of trading among short-term investors. Anxiety over the yen's advance is likely to keep investors on the sidelines, traders said. Market participants had assumed that foreign exchange dealings would stabilise at lower levels, following reports of intervention by the Bank of Japan. An analyst at a Japanese brokerage expected public fund managers to prevent the Nikkei average from declining sharply below the 20,000 level. The yen's rise hurt exporters, TDK dropping Y130 to Y3,850, Sony Y120 to Y4,650 and Pioneer Electronic Y100 to Y2,460. High-technology issues also lost ground: NEC settled Y12 lower at Y928, Fujitsu weakened Y19 to Y701 and Hitachi declined Y25 to Y820. Among vehicle manufacturers, Toyota receded Y40 to Y1,650, Honda fell Y20 to Y1,470 and Nissan ended Y10 lower at Y775. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 53.03 to end at 21,757.04 in volume of 42.5m shares. Roundup THERE WERE mixed fortunes in the region yesterday. KUALA LUMPUR was the focus of strong institutional buying of index-linked stocks and the composite index rose 7.58 to a new closing high of 672.53. Banking shares were in demand by foreign investors following buy recommendations by international brokers. AUSTRALIA concentrated on the banking sector and John Fairfax Holdings as the All Ordinaries index moved forward 7.2 to 1,703.6. Turnover came to ADollars 386.2m. Westpac Banking led the actives, rising 8 cents to ADollars 3.41 with 15.7m shares traded. Commonwealth Bank closed 13 cents firmer at a record high of ADollars 8.55. Fairfax was another stock to reach a record high on news that the government would allow The Telegraph, Mr Conrad Black's UK newspaper group, to lift its stake to 25 per cent from 15 per cent. The shares appreciated 11 cents to ADollars 2.10. HONG KONG closed lower for the fourth consecutive day as the cautious mood continued ahead of tomorrow's Sino-British talks on the colony's future. The Hang Seng index slipped 412.61 to 6,638.54. TAIWAN retreated sharply on late selling in financial stocks as rumours abounded that the big three provincial banks - First, Chang Hwa, and Hua Nan  -would not pay dividends for the next fiscal year. The weighted index fell 129.05, or 2.8 per cent, to 4,448.43 in turnover of TDollars 39bn. Chang Hwa Bank dropped TDollars 6 to TDollars 148, First Bank fell TDollars 6 to TDollars 163 and Hua Nan Bank was off TDollars 7 at TDollars 159. MANILA lost ground for the second consecutive session as investors took profits. The composite index declined 13.84 to 1,554.81 in turnover of 410.4m pesos. Manila Electric slipped 7.50 pesos to 290 pesos and PLDT eased 5 pesos to 965 pesos. NEW ZEALAND's advance continued with a rise in the NZSE-40 capital index of 8.53 to 1,597.89 in good turnover of NZDollars 53m. Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher Challenge led the advance, helped by strong rises in the forestry sector in the US. Carter, up 4 cents at NZDollars 3.09, reached a 4 1/2 -year high, and Fletcher Challenge put on 7 cents at NZDollars 2.65. BANGKOK was depressed by news that the government was to take legal action against violators of the country's new securities law. The SET index fell 6.51 to 884.22 in turnover of Bt3.3bn. The Securities and Exchange Commission has said that it has been investigating four cases involving possible breaches of the securities and exchange act. SINGAPORE eased as investors took profits after the gains seen in the previous four sessions had left prices at record levels. The Straits Times Industrial index ended 8.95 off at 1,763.07. KARACHI recovered some of Monday's loss and the KSE index closed 7.59 better at 1,076.09. BOMBAY's fall accelerated, with a loss of 56.24 registered by the BSE index at 2,204.91.</p>

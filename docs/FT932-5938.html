			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / International Company News: Shares in Moksel suspended due to fraud SHARES in Moksel, the large German meat-processing company, were suspended last week shortly before the Bavaria-based group announced it had been the victim of a DM100m (Dollars 62m) fraud in a company bought last year. Moksel said on Friday it had discovered 'major irregularities' in the accounts of Salomon, a meat company with sales of DM500-DM600m bought last year, as well as evidence of 'dishonest acts'. The fraud appeared to have been perpetrated over a period of years before the acquisition, and Moksel said a total of around DM100m appeared to have gone missing. Moksel said it would be in the best interests of the company if it paid no dividend for 1992. The plan had been to pay DM11 per share. It said that beyond this it did not expect the fraud to have any other financial repercussions. Moksel's sales last year fell from DM4.02bn in 1991 to DM3.7bn despite several acquisitions. The drop reflected changing demand from eastern Germany.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Goldman fined over Maxwell share deals: US bank negotiates Pounds 160,000 settlement with securities body GOLDMAN SACHS, the blue-chip US-based investment bank that dealt extensively with companies controlled by the late Robert Maxwell, has been fined Pounds 160,000 by regulators for breaches of UK securities rules, and ordered to pay an estimated Pounds 125,000 in costs. This follows the fines imposed two weeks ago on Invesco MIM, the fund manager, by Imro, the industry overseer, for irregularities in the management of Maxwell pension funds. Yesterday's fine on Goldman by the Securities and Futures Authority, the self-regulatory body for the brokerage industry, is the first official censure of Goldman Sachs' activities in relation to Mr Maxwell and the largest fine ever imposed on a firm by the SFA. The charges relate to share deals the SFA describes as 'free payments' to Maxwell companies. The payments occurred during a time when it is now known that Mr Maxwell's companies were frantically trying to raise cash. The SFA said that its review did not conclude that 'Goldman Sachs or any of its personnel participated in any illicit conduct with, or were aware of illicit conduct by, Maxwell or any entity controlled by or associated with him'. Yesterday's fine does not rule out further actions against the investment bank by the SFA or any other bodies. Goldman Sachs was a party in transactions that have been the subject of investigations by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Stock Exchange and the Serious Fraud Office. Goldman Sachs had asked that findings should not go to a tribunal as is normal when rule breaches are uncovered. Instead, it sought a negotiated settlement with regulators that resulted in the public announcement and fine. It is understood that some findings have been sent to the US Securities and Exchange Commission for review. The rule breaches relate to three transactions, two of which were purchases of roughly Pounds 24m in securities from Maxwell-controlled fund management companies that invested assets on behalf of pension scheme members. The third entity was Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a company at the heart of Mr Maxwell's private interests. The company sold an estimated Pounds 25m in securities to Goldman Sachs just months before Mr Maxwell's death. The SFA said it concluded that in those three transactions, Goldman Sachs had paid for, but failed to receive, all the shares involved. In effect, the SFA said, Goldman Sachs made 'free payments' to Maxwell entities and failed to tell regulators about the effect on its capital position. Yesterday, Goldman Sachs emphasised that regulators had not concluded that it engaged in or knew of any illicit conduct and sought to describe its rule breaches as technical in nature. Mr Greg Palm, joint chief counsel, said they occurred because information about the free payments 'was not effectively combined with knowledge of the regulatory capital effect of such a payment, giving rise to the computational and financial reporting errors'.

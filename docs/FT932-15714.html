			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / UK Company News: Concern over domino effect from Lelliott collapse THE COLLAPSE of John Lelliott, one of the UK's largest privately-owned construction groups, has raised fears about a domino effect on some of the sub-contractors. The Lelliott group owes about Pounds 36m to trade creditors, Pounds 7m to Barclays Bank and another Pounds 1m in tax and wage bills, according to preliminary estimates from the receivers. Mrs Elisabeth Huxtable, general manager of the Confederation of Construction Specialists, expressed shock at the size of the trade debt. The experience of sub-contractors in this situation was that 'anything they are owed they are likely to lose'. Because of the level of payments retained by main contractors, she was particularly concerned about sub-contractors, 'who are just about to complete and who have not been getting paid'. The confederation is lobbying for contract money to be held in trusts, instead of being absorbed into the main contractor's account. 'If it were put into a separate account with trust status, it would be safe if the main contractor went under,' she said. The John Lelliott group, based in Raynes Park, south-west London, suffered a substantial drop in turnover from Pounds 240m in 1989/1990, when it produced Pounds 5.8m profit, to about Pounds 126m last year, when it incurred a small loss. Its problem areas included the Point West project in west London, on which it is believed to have lost Pounds 10m when the developer, Land &amp; Property Trust, went into liquidation. Its own Stone Group subsidiary went into receivership in February before being bought by Peter Cox Group. Although the whole Lelliott group is insolvent, the administrative receiverships announced on Thursday affect John Lelliott Construction and eight other subsidiaries. Mr Malcolm London and Mr Christopher Hughes, from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, have been appointed. The bank could only call them into companies over which it had a floating charge, and these account for the bulk of the group's Pounds 44m liabilities. The bank ranks alongside other unsecured creditors.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 14 KYODO -- The government on Friday  [14 January] formulated a final draft for the planned action  program aimed at boosting foreign access to Japan's construction  market, government sources said.    The action plan, worked out at a meeting of senior officials  of concerned ministries, calls for introducing an open bidding  system on public works projects ordered by both the central and  local governments.    Currently, only designated contractors are allowed to  participate in bidding for most public works projects.    According to the final draft, the open bidding system will  be  introduced for state-sponsored works projects worth 4.5 million  special drawing rights [SDR's], or 700 million yen, or more.    One SDR is currently valued at 190 yen, but the Finance  Ministry plans to change the rate to 160 yen from April. The  plan is based on the new exchange rate.    If the works are ordered by the country's 47 prefectures, or  12 designated cities, and 85 public corporations like the Japan  Highway Public Corp., the threshold is 15 million SDRs, or 2.4  billion yen.    The plan will come into force in April.    The action plan will be approved at a cabinet meeting  scheduled for next Tuesday, in time for the January 20 deadline  for threatened U.S. sanctions.    The United States originally threatened to retaliate if  Japan  failed to come up with effective measures for opening the  construction market by October 31.    It extended the deadline to January 20 in October,  responding  to a Japanese pledge to draft an action program on the matter  early this year.    The sources said the draft plan has already received basic  approval from U.S. negotiators in bilateral construction-market  talks.    Open bidding will also start for design consulting services  for public works projects. Such services for state projects are  put to open bidding if they are worth 450,000 SDRs or more and  those for local governments 1.5 million SDRs.    As for a 1988 Japan-U.S. pact on preferential treatment for  foreign contractors in 40 major projects, the government has  decided not to immediately abolish it and agreed rather to phase  it out by applying open bidding on those projects.</p>

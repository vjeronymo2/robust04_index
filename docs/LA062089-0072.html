			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURMOIL IN CHINA: CRACKDOWN ON DISSENT;  </P> <P> CHINA'S UNDERGROUND PRESSES SEIZED AS CRACKDOWN ON MEDIA CONTINUES  </P> <P> "Lies written in ink can never disguise facts written in blood."  </P> <P> Lu Xun, Chinese writer, 1926  </P> <P> Along with the pageant of arrests, interrogations, confessions and handcuffings  shown night after night on state television, there have also appeared scenes of  raids on printing presses in Beijing.  </P> <P> The machinery is shown being pulled out of dark rooms in monotonous housing  projects and loaded on army trucks -- another example of the relentless pursuit  of "counterrevolutionaries" by security forces.  </P> <P> The raids are basically an effort to monopolize the spread of information. The  government is trying to ensure that its version of violence during the June 3-4  assault on pro-democracy demonstrators in and around Tian An Men Square is the  only one.  </P> <P> The state-run press is also being brought into line in a clampdown of a  different sort.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Critical Reporter  </P> <P> During a television broadcast Monday, an announcer read a letter from a  reporter criticizing notions of a free press that surfaced here in the days and  weeks preceding the attack on Tian An Men.  </P> <P> After viewing the official version of events that have been broadcast here  nonstop since June 4, the reporter repented his participation in pro-democracy  rallies.  </P> <P> "What is freedom of the press?" he asked in his letter. "Is freedom of the  press meant to be counterrevolutionary? Is freedom of the press to subvert the  government? In the whole world, is there any nation that permits this kind of  press freedom?  </P> <P> "In the United States, the media can curse the President but absolutely not  overturn the government."  </P> <P> The statement is evidently meant to put an end to resistance by many Chinese  journalists to martial law. Some reporters had participated in anti-government  demonstrations before June 3-4. During some demonstrations, the usually tight  reins on television were loosened and reporters took the opportunity to show  all of China unimpeded scenes from the square.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On Virtual Strike  </P> <P> Others have reportedly been on a virtual strike since the attack, in which the  army killed hundreds, perhaps thousands of demonstrators.  </P> <P> The tightening of controls on the press and underground publishing will  undoubtedly make it difficult for protest literature to surface in the wake of  the Tian An Men killings.  </P> <P> In 20th-Century China, such protest writings have a history of appearing in  response to similar political cataclysms -- the May 4, 1919, student movement  against the Qing Dynasty, for instance, and the series of student protests  against the Nationalist government in the 1920s and 1930s, many of which were  brutally suppressed.  </P> <P> This spring, many students found in their demonstrations an echo of the May 4,  1919, movement. A song written by Beijing students last month ended with the  chorus:  </P> <P>  "Hold high the banner of May 4th.  </P> <P>  The May 4th spirit will forever live.  </P> <P>  Uproot feudalism and bureaucracy  </P> <P>  From the motherland!"  </P> <P> Often, links to such past struggles are forged by allusion, a favorite literary  device employed by Chinese writers.  </P> <P> After the attack around Tian An Men Square and on Changan Avenue, Beijing's  main east-west thoroughfare, students at several campuses in Beijing hung  banners bearing the inscription: "Blood debts must be repaid in kind."  </P> <P> The slogan alluded to a line from Lu Xun, one of this century's leading Chinese  writers. He penned the words in response to a massacre of 40 anti-government  student demonstrators in 1926 at the hands of the Nationalist government.  </P> <P> "This is not the conclusion of an incident, but a new beginning," Lu wrote of  that crackdown.  </P> <P> For many Chinese, the literary link to the past is as important as possession  of the square itself: It is the difference between viewing the deaths of  hundreds of demonstrators and their supporters as an isolated incident or  seeing it as part of a temporarily frustrated but still vital tide.  </P> <P> However, getting rid of the printing presses will at least narrow the chances  that essays, poems, and stories will circulate freely inside China.  </P> <P> In the past, especially after the Democracy Wall movement of 1979, writings  published abroad kept the literature alive. Dissident words from this spring  are already seeping from China into Hong Kong.  </P> <P> Chai Ling, a Beijing Teachers University student who was one of the leaders of  the movement, sent a recording of her thoughts to Hong Kong before she went  into hiding.  </P> <P> "What can we do to bring back those students who were sacrificed?" she  wondered. "Their souls will always remain on Changan Avenue. They'll never come  back. Some of them were very, very young. They'll never come back."  </P> <P> Her words, too, also recalled protest literature past. Compare, for example, a  poem by writer Wen Yiduo written after the deaths of students at Tian An Men in  1926:  </P> <P>  "See there, whose children are those?  </P> <P>  They're hardly adolescents, are they?  </P> <P>  What's going on?  </P> <P>  Aren't those bayonet wounds on their heads?  </P> <P>  By tomorrow, the city of Beijing will be full of ghosts."  </P> <P> The government seems acutely aware of the significance of such allusions and  has tried to separate Tian An Men, 1989, from repressions of the past.  Officials insist that no one was killed on Tian An Men Square during a night of  bloodshed that ended at dawn June 4. That someone might have been killed  elsewhere seems not to matter. By government admission, people were killed  along the length of Changan Avenue, the boulevard that cuts across the north  end of the square -- although the official account distinguishes between "the  people," who were killed by accident, and "thugs" and "counterrevolutionary  rioters" who were gunned down in self-defense.  </P> <P> Any rival account is blasted as "rumor-mongering."  </P> <P> Whether the Chinese believe this account may not be the point; it puts them on  notice about what they are supposed to believe. Already in Beijing, people  willing to discuss the Tian An Men massacre sometimes begin their replies with,  "I have heard a lot of rumors." It is one way to avoid taking a stand.  </P></p>

Gaviria, in a letter sent to the State Council, which has  asked him for explanations, has said the presence of U.S.  military personnel on the Pacific Coast and in the eastern  plains is in accordance with international treaties that have  been formally accepted by Colombia in the past.    In a long document, Gaviria rehashes the legal evolution of  the international law and the Colombian legislation, saying the  operations of mutual defense and military assistance do not  require authorization from the Senate or State Council.    Gaviria refers to the work by the U.S. soldiers at the beach  town of Juanchaco (Valle Del Cauca Department), where they are  building a school, a medical center, and a road, and in Puerto  Lopez (Meta Department), where they are building a river port.    "The U.S. soldiers are not in the country to execute warlike  activities against third parties," but their presence is in  accordance with agreements for technical cooperation to supply  logistic support so that the Colombian authorities may fight  crime, he adds.</p>

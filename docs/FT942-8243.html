			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Hanson to shun British Coal sell-off Hanson, the industrial conglomerate with worldwide coal interests, has ruled itself out of buying any British Coal mines in the forthcoming privatisation of the corporation. It has decided not to make any payments to take part in the pre-qualification exercise, one of Hanson's financial advisers said. Companies considering bids must pay the government Pounds 15,000 by Wednesday for each of the five regions in which they are interested. The Department of Trade and Industry confirmed yesterday that companies that failed to do so could not tender. RTZ, the other large UK company with international coal interests, is understood to be planning to pre-qualify in all five regions. It is considered unlikely to make bids but wants to see the details of what is on offer. Hanson has often indicated it was an unlikely bidder but other companies planning tenders had expected it to pay to register for the right to bid, if only to keep its options open. Both Hanson and RTZ have been put off by the likely fragmentation of the industry. Although they would be able to bid for all five regions, the chances of success in all are slim. The government has said it would consider selling the whole industry to one bidder, but is keen to inject competition into the coal market. Each of the regions is tiny in comparison with RTZ's and Hanson's worldwide interests and would therefore be un-attractive to them. Several UK companies, including RJB Mining and Coal Investments, plan to pay the Pounds 75,000 needed to qualify for all regions. Some will also pay to qualify to bid for six 'non-core' pits which have been closed by British Coal and are being offered separately from the regional packages. Pre-qualification for each stand-alone pit will cost Pounds 5,000. RJB Mining, led by Mr Richard Budge, is one of the few groups considering tendering for all five regions. Coal Investments, led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, is less likely to seek control of all regions but wants to see what is on offer. Ryan Group, another coal company, said yesterday it wanted to pre-qualify for the south Wales region. It is also, in alliance with others, hoping to bid in north-east England and Scotland. Other companies likely to pre-qualify include Mining (Scotland), a consortium which wants to buy the Scottish region, and Caledonian Mining, which is interested in the north-east. The Union of Democratic Mineworkers is considering bidding for the central and south regions, and management buy-out teams are likely to emerge in several regions. The Yorkshire area of the National Union of Mineworkers will have to re-ballot its members over its proposed transfer of assets to the national union, the Certification Officer for Trade Unions and Employer Organisations ruled yesterday, Robert Taylor writes. The certification officer said he would give the reasons for his decision at a later date. However, his office said that not all members of the Yorkshire area had been accorded equal entitlement to vote.</p>

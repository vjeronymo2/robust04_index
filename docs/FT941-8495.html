			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Greater clarity urged in accounts The new chairman of the Financial Reporting Council yesterday called for greater clarity in the presentation of company accounts. Sir Sydney Lipworth, former chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, said at the annual awards ceremony for published accounts that they should be true, fair and also clear. Technical interpretations of accounting standards had obscured 'the wider and plainer' sense of the requirement for accounts to present a true and fair view. He called for an end to 'sharply differing practices' and said he believed there would for some time be the need for the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the accounts watchdog, to deal with cases of bad accounting. Sir Sydney said he would continue to pay attention to the concern of industry that there was a danger of an 'overload' of new requirements. The Accounting Standards Board could not please everyone in drawing up new standards but it listened objectively to the case against its proposals. The award, which is sponsored by the Stock Exchange and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, was won by Coats Viyella, the textiles and clothing company, and James Cropper, the paper and board maker. Mr Richard Sykes, chairman of the judges, said he was impressed with the information provided on the companies' operational divisions, compliance with accounting requirements and the guidelines of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance, and details on share options and directors' emoluments.</p>

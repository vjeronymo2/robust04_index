			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Macedonia proposal rejected ECE yesterday rejected a UN proposal aimed at settling a bitter 18-month dispute with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia on its northern border, Reuter reports from Athens. 'Greece cannot accept the proposal by the two mediators. . . of the Geneva conference,' Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis told reporters. He said that Greece wanted the UN mediation effort to continue and that he would put forward new proposals. He also said Greece was ready to enter into direct talks with Macedonia. Greece's dispute with neighbouring Macedonia has threatened to destabilise the southern Balkans and peace envoys have tried to defuse the row, focused on the name of the new state, which declared its independence from Yugoslavia in late 1991. Efforts to settle their differences in direct talks in early 1992 failed on the first day because neither side would budge in the row over the name Macedonia. UN mediator Cyrus Vance and European Community envoy Lord Owen negotiated between the two sides and put forward the compromise proposal earlier this month. The feuding Balkan states and the mediators have imposed a news blackout on details of their talks and Mr Mitsotakis declined to say what was contained in the offer.</p>

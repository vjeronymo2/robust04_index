			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis has said  the Cypriot Government has not been sounded out on any changes  to the 21 March UN document on the confidence-building measures.  He added that the position of the Greek Cypriot side is that it  accepts the document as is, while Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf  Denktas is raising many points other than the issue of access to  Famagusta.    The spokesman stressed that Kliridhis is ready to meet  either  with Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative in Cyprus, or Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary  general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, to  reiterate that he has accepted the document as is and expects  the Turkish side to do the same. Kasoulidhis concluded that the  president is ready to say that he will accept neither new  documents nor a modification of the current document.</p>

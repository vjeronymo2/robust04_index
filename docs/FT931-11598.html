			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Technology: Clean steel gets to melting point - A saleable Austrian breakthrough that makes dirty blast furnaces obsolete Executives are breathing more easily these days at Voest-Alpine, the state-owned Austrian industrial group, thanks to a new order from the Far East which could open up sales prospects around the world for a cheaper and cleaner way of making steel. The group has just won an order from the big South Korean steel concern, Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), for its Corex technology for reducing iron ore directly to hot metal. According to Herbert Steinwender, president of Voest-Alpine Industrieanlagenbau (VAI), the group's engineering unit, it is in discussion with 35 other steel companies about possible orders. Direct reduction (DR) and smelting reduction (SR) technologies have tantalised steel makers for decades. The idea is that the oxides and other impurities present in iron ores can be removed in a single thermal process, using an ordinary hydrocarbon or coal as a reduction agent. This would enable steelmakers to dispense with the cumbersome and expensive traditional processes of refining coke from coking coal in huge ovens and then using the coke as a reduction agent in immense blast furnaces. SR plants could also be operated economically on a much smaller scale than blast furnaces, thus opening the way for new entrants into the steel industry. Another feature that has increased interest in recent years is that SR plants produce substantially fewer emissions than coking plant-blast furnace complexes. In the 1960s, the focus was on natural gas driven DR plants, but interest faded with the sharp rise in gas prices in the early 1970s. In the mid-1970s, Willy Korf, the maverick German mini steel mill entrepreneur who died in an air crash in 1990, started development of a coal-based SR system, originally called the KR (Kohlereduktion) process and later changed to Corex. In 1979, Voest joined Korf in building a 60,000 tonne per year pilot plant at Kehl, on the upper Rhine in Germany, and four years later took over the whole project when Korf's business collapsed. VAI won its first commercial contract for a 300,000 tonne per year Corex plant from Iscor, the South African steel company, in 1985. But the installation had considerable teething problems, and was not running properly until two years after its commissioning in 1987. Since then, things have been tense in Linz, to say the least. 'We have been hoping a long time for a second contract,' Steinwender says. Some executives felt that VAI should have put in a Corex plant at the Linz works of its sister company, VA Stahl, to demonstrate its confidence in the technology. But this was difficult to justify economically as long as newly modernised iron making facilities, which were well adjusted to downstream facilities, were working effectively. 'So we are very happy that Posco has come along. It is the third largest steel company in the world,' he says. The Posco order is for a plant that is double the size of Iscor's. VAI will not disclose the value of the order, but says normally a plant of this size would cost Sch3bn (Pounds 179m). Questions have been raised about how much further the technology can be scaled up without running into new complications. Steinwender says the next step up to a plant of about 1m tonnes per year should be achieved without difficulty, as the equipment needed has already been used in DR plants. Opinions are divided within the group as to whether Corex will be as big a success as Voest's development in the late 1940s of the LD (named after its Linz and Donawitz steelmaking sites) basic oxygen technology process for converting iron into steel. That technology is now universally used in integrated steel works around the world and has produced a steady income stream for the group for decades. VAI claims that total Corex plant costs for producing a tonne of hot metal are about 20 per cent less than those in a coking plant-blast furnace complex. Total energy requirements are about 15 per cent less, but considerably more excess energy is available for driving a power station. Still, the snag for many producers, like Voest itself, is that as long as old, fully depreciated plant is still working well, it is difficult to justify investing in Corex. And, as Othmar Puhringer, deputy chairman of Austrian Industries, Voest's parent company, says, 'there is already a significant overcapacity of hot metal in the world'. Puhringer believes that market development will take some time. 'The real boom will take place when environmental controls get more stringent. 'We did not see this when we developed the process, but it is a beautiful by-product.'</p>

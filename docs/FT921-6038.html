			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Seeking value in fields of conflict - Serious Money VALUE for money should be the consumers' battle cry in the financial services market of the 1990s. It is a concept that can be applied to many different financial products. Take the reduction in unit trust initial charges announced this week by Murray Johnstone, which we cover in depth on Page III. With so many companies chasing investors' money, it was perhaps inevitable that groups would start to compete on price. Charging systems such as Murray Johnstone's are two-a-cent in the US, where investors have a wide choice of so-called 'low-load' or 'no-load' funds. In the UK, there is very little variation in unit trust charging structures. Indeed, over the past few years, charges have risen while average performance has been poor; and the two facts may well be connected. Over the past five years, the average unit trust manager has failed to beat the indices, inflation or, indeed, the building society. Does it make sense to pay people to sit in expensive City office blocks when a computer, programmed to match the index, could be both better and cheaper? Perhaps there is a case for paying a premium price to companies which can outperform the index consistently; and for those which cannot beat the index to charge a lower fee until they can improve their returns. Such a system would be closer to offering investors value for money. Indeed, there is a general point here. For years, some of those working in the City were earning vast salaries. The best and the brightest of the nation's youth were lured away from industry and into the Square Mile. The problem has been that, in a free market, the financial services sector has not been generating the profits to justify such high salaries. The 1987 crash was one body blow; the recession has been the next. Whatever the reason, the sector's costs are too high. The banks, in particular, which face bad debt problems on their personal and corporate loans, are being forced to cut back. (Of course, the lion's share of job cuts will fall on the modestly-paid branch staff). But the cost structures of the High Street banks mean that consumers can obtain better value elsewhere across a range of services. A good example is the cash unit trust sector described on Page IV; but the same phenomenon can be seen in credit cards and high-interest cheque accounts. Inertia is probably the main factor that still binds many customers to the Big Four. Value for money is a theme we have also been trying to emphasise in covering the life assurance sector. Those who maintain their endowment policies to maturity seem to get good value (although other options may have done better); and there can be little doubt that those who surrender them in early years do not. One of our consistent criticisms of life products is that consumers do not receive information on their costs and penalties in a form that most people would understand easily. Without information, it is hard to get value for money. How might that information be presented? Perhaps a rough abbreviation of what the adviser or salesman could say would run as follows. 'I think you need life insurance and a savings scheme. You can bundle them together in one product called an endowment policy, in which case the insurance element costs you Pounds x a month and the life element Pounds y. 'Or you can take out term assurance and a unit or investment trust savings plan at Pounds a and Pounds b a month. 'On past evidence, this is what the average endowment policy with that premium has been worth if cashed-in after two, five, 10, 15, 20 and 25 years. The average unit and investment trust savings schemes over those same periods has been worth this much. 'There is a greater element of security in the endowment policy, plus a steady increase in the amount of life assurance. The unit or investment trust savings scheme is more flexible and, if personal equity plans continue, has a more favourable tax position. 'Would you like the security or the flexibility? If you don't think you can keep up the payments, then the inflexibility of the endowment is a disadvantage. 'If you are a cautious sort, who is conscientious about meeting commitments, the endowment will probably be better for you. 'I should tell you that I will receive more income in commission, which comes out of your pocket, if you buy an endowment rather than the other policies.' One could quibble with the details (and no doubt I will get some letters doing just that), but that might be an approximation of the style and substance of a 'value for money' piece of advice. Having said that, I still believe that FT readers will benefit from approaching an adviser who charges a fee. Such advisers have a commonality of interests with their clients; the commission system creates potential conflicts of interest all the time. No doubt many honest advisers surmount it, but the conflict is there all the same.</p>

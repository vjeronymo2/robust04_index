			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Takare makes Pounds 68m cash call TAKARE, the nursing home group, is raising Pounds 68m net of expenses through a rights issue in order to step up its expansion rate. The shares fell 8p to 235p, compared with the rights price of 195p. Takare has been adding beds at the rate of 1,200 to 1,400 a year. Mr Keith Bradshaw, chairman, said the group was now capable of growing at a faster rate but refused to say what the new target would be. Takare accompanied the 2-for-5 issue with a forecast of pre-tax profits of not less than Pounds 14.8m for 1993, including an exceptional profit of Pounds 370,000 on the sale of a nursing home, and promised a final dividend of 1.4p to make a total of 2.1p (1.8p), up 16.7 per cent. The profits will be after capitalising interest of about Pounds 2.5m, compared with Pounds 4.16m in 1992. Mr Bradshaw said the group was continuing to see occupancy levels of 97 per cent and prices were not under pressure from the new community care system introduced in April. Before this rights, Takare had raised Pounds 67.2m through three equity issues since coming to the market in 1989. It has also raised Pounds 50m through three tranches of a deben-ture. Its last equity offer was in September 1991 when the group promised not to issue more shares for two years. In recent weeks Takare has attempted to dampen speculation that it would make a rights issue this month, saying it could continue to expand with debt finance until the second quarter of 1995 without excessive gearing. Yesterday, Mr Bradshaw said that while a rights issue was not essential, its advisers, SG Warburg, had suggested now would be a good time to make one. He said he would make no promises now about the timing of any further issue. Takare would have more than 10,000 beds by the end of 1995, he said, and would reach 'critical mass', meaning it could fund expansion from cashflow, 'well before we are confronted with a gearing problem again'. The group, which has debt of Pounds 50.8m and cash of Pounds 3.05m, will have net cash following the issue. Mr Ron Reid, finance director, said that if the group opened 1,400 beds a year gearing would reach 35 per cent by the end of 1996. If it opened 2,000 beds a year gearing would reach 55 per cent by that time. COMMENT The timing of Takare's heavy rights at the earliest practicable moment it was free from its promise not to issue more shares confirms the view that this is a sector with an insatiable demand for equity capital. Fortunately, Takare has so far proven its ability to deliver the profits and earnings to justify its demands. On the profit forecast, the prospective p/e is 17 which looks reasonable.</p>

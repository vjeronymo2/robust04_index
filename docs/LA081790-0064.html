			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. REGISTERS A 11.4% DROP IN ITS WATER USAGE;  </P> <P> CONSERVATION: WHEN ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN POPULATION AND WEATHER, THE DECLINE  FOR AUGUST IS 14.2%. THE REDUCTION FURTHER DIMS PROSPECTS FOR MAYOR BRADLEY'S  MANDATORY RATIONING PLAN.  </P> <P> Halfway through the critical month of August, Los Angeles residents are saving  water in near-record amounts, pushing back the prospect of Mayor Tom Bradley's  mandatory water rationing plan well into the fall.  </P> <P> For the two weeks ending Aug. 15, city water users cut consumption by 11.4%  compared to the same period a year ago, according to figures released Thursday  by the Department of Water and Power.  </P> <P> When adjusted for changes in population and weather, the conservation figures  soared to 14.2% -- the second-highest monthly figure this year.  </P> <P> Officials said there appears to be widespread public acceptance of water  conservation, but they could not pinpoint specific reasons for the large  reduction.  </P> <P> The conservation rate in August is of particular concern to city officials  because its hot, dry weather typically leads to the heaviest water usage of the  year. And, under a city ordinance adopted last month, mandatory rationing would  be implemented if the adjusted conservation figure dips below 10% in August or  any subsequent month.  </P> <P> "That's not going to happen this month," said Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores,  who led the effort to halt rationing as long as residents voluntarily conserve  water. "We gave people the opportunity to (conserve) on their own and they are  responding."  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who joined Flores in the vote to delay rationing,  said "It validates . . . that the people of Los Angeles are capable of  attaining ambitious conservation goals without being forced to" through a  cumbersome and expensive rationing program.  </P> <P> The mid-August figures represent a rebound in conservation from July. City  residents had voluntarily reduced water use an estimated 9.8% in July, after  hefty cuts of 17.5% in June, 11.7% in May and 12.3% in April, according to DWP  figures for adjusted water conservation. Actual water use dropped by 5.8% in  July, 8.4% in June, 9.1% in May and 15.7% in April.  </P> <P> The voluntary saving persuaded City Council members last month to delay  implementing mandatory water rationing, in favor of continuing the successful  voluntary effort.  </P> <P> If triggered, the rationing plan would limit all residents and businesses to  90% of the water consumed in comparable periods of 1986 -- before the drought  and the start of city-sponsored conservation efforts. Residents and businesses  using more than their allotment would face surcharges for excessive water use.  </P> <P> "There's no way it could go below 10% this month," Flores said. "No way could  we backslide that much." If conservation stays over 10% on an adjusted basis  through the remainder of August, the earliest that rationing could be  implemented would be October.  </P> <P> Mayor Bradley, who favored implementing rationing months ago and has continued  to press for its adoption, had warned that residents would backslide in their  voluntary conservation efforts once the threat of rationing was no longer in  the news.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement Thursday, Bradley said, "It seems the call to save  water has been heard by many residents. I hope this continues." He credited  much of the saving to "our continued emphasis on the need to conserve water and  the release of daily statistics about water use."  </P> <P> DWP officials said they were not sure just how the water was being saved.  </P> <P> Jim Derry, DWP director of customer service, who heads the conservation effort,  said he suspects it is a combination of several programs, including a  multimillion-dollar ad campaign and two dozen "drought busters" who cruise the  city looking for excessive water use.  </P> <P> Since May 14, the drought busters have handed out 3,500 citations for  violations of the city drought ordinance, including hosing down driveways, not  repairing leaks in a timely manner, watering lawns between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.  and allowing water to run off into the street.  </P> <P> In addition, the drought busters have made 5,737 "informational" contacts, in  which they deliver requested information on conservation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WATER USE IN L.A.  </P> <P> WATER DEMANDS: Summer months are the peak months for water use in L.A. Figures  in this chart based on 1979-1989 statistics show the upward curve in  consumption in peak periods.  </P> <P> PERCENT CONSERVED 1989 TO 1990  </P> <P> Actual water use measures number of gallons that flow from the city's  reservoirs and aquedeuct into businesses and residences.  </P> <P> ACTUAL  </P> <P> APRIL: 15.7  </P> <P> MAY: 9.1  </P> <P> JUNE: 8.4  </P> <P> JULY: 5.8  </P> <P> AUGUST:* 11.4  </P> <P> </P> <P> When adjusted for changes in population and weather, the amount of conservation  can be even greater.  </P> <P> ADJUSTED  </P> <P> APRIL: 12.3  </P> <P> MAY: 11.7  </P> <P> JUNE: 17.5  </P> <P> JULY: 9.8  </P> <P> AUGUST:* 14.2  </P> <P> * Figures for August are for the first half of the month  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The perception that air travel in the United States has become less safe is  widespread, despite government statistics to the contrary, according to a  Gallup Poll. Telephone interviews with 1,229 randomly selected adults Aug. 15  to 18, a month after the crash of a United Airlines DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa,  found nearly two-thirds (63%) of Americans saying they have lost confidence in  the safety and efficiency of airlines in recent years. Almost half (45%) of  Americans who travel by commercial airliner say they at least sometimes feel  frightened when they fly. However, nearly three-fourths (73%) feel that even  with recent safety problems, air travel is still basically safe compared with  other means of transportation. The survey has an error rate of plus or minus 4  percentage points.  </P></p>

It should be recalled that last year those soldiers  robbed goods and resorted to other disorderly behavior,  culminating in the detention of the presumed mutiny leaders.    At the time (5 February) that assembly area, a few meters  away from the station had already received 942 men who had  already carried out their "check in" [preceding two words in  English], of which 886 had already been registered.    Three of the confined soldiers have perished in differing  circumstances.    Major De La Pena, head of the UN peacekeeping forces in the  area, has reported that weapons handed over include 886 assault  rifles (864 "AK-47" and two "FN") [figures as published], 16  submachine guns (six "RPG", eight "RP-46", and two "DP"), 49  pistols, three mortars (one "M-60" and two "M-82"), 12 "RPG-7"  rocket launchers, two hand grenades, and 17 antipersonnel mines.    There are several diseases affecting soldiers at the camp:  malaria (84 cases), gonorrhea (38), diarrhea (118),  conjunctivitis (17), parasite-related diseases (32), and  dysentery (10).    Namialo has no ambulance, but the seriousness of some the  cases prompted the removal of seven patients to other health  posts or hospitals able to afford better health care.    Major Domingos Pilote, liaison officer and commander of that  government assembly area, explained that, as a result of the  mutiny in December last year, "strong arm tactics" had to be  used to restore discipline to the camp. The forces of law and  order had to intervene and had wounded one of the mutineers.    He said that increased and more diversified food, the  neutralization of the mutiny leaders, and constant visits by  officials from government and other institutions were other  measures that had been taken with a view to restoring discipline  to the camp.    The government sent 270 kg of fresh fish, 150 kg of pork,  191  kg of dried fish, 530 kg of salt, and 650 kg of corn to that  area between 19 and 23 December.    In turn, the World Food Program ferried to Namialo assembly  area 27,609 kg of corn, 10,555 kg of rice, 3,878 kg of peas,  4,504 kg of beans, 1,185 kg of sugar, and 2,071 kg of cooking  oil.    The UN Operations in Mozambique Demobilization Technical  Unit  made available 978 blankets, 942 plates, 15 cooking pots, 432 kg  of soap, and 250 kg of cement.</p>

Russia's  Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arranges the Accents"]    [Text] Following the visit to China of A.V. Kozyrev,  minister of foreign affairs of Russia, interest in the problem  of relations with our eastern neighbor has grown sharply. Our  correspondent Valeriy Natarov interviewed Ye.V. Afanasyev, first  deputy director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Russian Federation Asia-Pacific Region First Department.    On Ye.V. Afanasyev's desk is an article by V. Sharov, our  Far  East correspondent, "The China Card" (LITERATURNAYA GAZETA No.  43, 27 October 1993). And although this material was published  at the end of last October, the Russian Foreign Ministry does  not deny its relevance today also. There is a multitude of notes  in the margins of the article, and individual paragraphs have  been highlighted.    [Natarov] Yevgeniy Vladimirovich, the article "The China  Card" outlines a very gloomy prospect for the Far  East--multimillion Chinese masses hovering menacingly over it.  Is the Chinese apocalypse impending?    [Afanasyev] It was laid on thick, of course, to say no more  than that. And the article caught our eye immediately.    [Natarov] It achieved its purpose, then?    [Afanasyev] In the sense of catching our attention, yes.  This  article is one of a series of such publications, which have  appeared in the past year in the local Far East press also. They  purport to show that China's silent expansion is under way and  that a vast number of Chinese are illegally penetrating our  territory and living there. These articles maintain also that  the territories bordering China have been stabbed in the  back--government documents that have been signed are, in fact,  opening our borders to the uncontrolled entry of Chinese.    [Natarov] Could you explain to what documents you refer?    [Afanasyev] The history of the matter is as follows. As  bilateral contacts expand, there is, naturally, an increase in  the number of people's journeys both to Russia and to China.  Last year, for example, there were more than 1 million journeys  from Russia to China, and from China to Russia, 2 million. And  Russians are, perhaps, the most representative group of  foreigners in China, what is more. In connection with the  further development of contacts, both the center and the  territorial authorities concluded that our citizens carrying  diplomatic, official, and regular passports stamped "official"  would travel to China without visas. Correspondingly, Chinese  citizens with similar passports may enter our territory without  visas. This procedure is based on interstate agreements, which  were coordinated with the leaders of all the Far East oblasts in  advance, incidentally.    [Natarov] That is, you see a certain distortion in this  article: The visa-free conditions were, in fact, introduced with  the consent of the local authorities, not in defiance of them?    [Afanasyev] Of course. In addition, I would like to refer to  the stream of letters addressed to the Foreign Ministry from  Siberia and the Far East, which say that the center is being  slow to afford opportunities for reciprocal exchanges and that  the expansion of free communication should be assisted. I would  like to mention also that such a travel category as one-day  shopping trips was introduced also on the initiative of the  territorial authorities. Our citizens have gone on these trips  without visas, on regular general passports, what is more.  Chinese have, accordingly, come to us on the same basis.    True, it was ascertained after a certain period of time that  dishonest people and representatives of mafia structures also  have been actively availing themselves of the visa-free  conditions. On both our side and the Chinese side. Chinese  criminal elements have penetrated Russia, the number of offenses  committed by Chinese has grown, and there has been an increase  in the number of Chinese who have simply "gone missing" on our  territory.    [Natarov] This is not, I suppose, a "headache" for the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs alone?    [Afanasyev] Doubtless. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs  handles questions of visa practices. The rest is up to the MVD,  the special services, the Federal Immigration Service, the  leaders of local administrations--from kray through rayon--and  to enterprises and organizations with direct relations with  China. It is all of them together that create the  situation--controlled or uncontrolled.    [Natarov] In other words, the local authorities have  perfectly sufficient powers for controlling the situation  without looking to Moscow here?    [Afanasyev] Perfectly correct. In addition, questions  connected with the presence of Chinese on our territory--whether  for business or other activity--are decided to a considerable  extent locally. The premise contained in the article, therefore,  to the effect that the center has opened the gates to the  uncontrolled entry of Chinese and that this is being combated  locally with might and main is fundamentally wrong. Basically,  this decision was dictated to the center by a mass of requests  from the localities.    But the problem about which V. Sharov writes does in fact  exist. There are, truly, instances of disgraceful behavior on  the part of Chinese on our territory--the examples cited in the  article are graphic confirmation of this. But what I personally  dislike in the way this problem is presented in "The China Card"  article is the fact that these individual cases are attributed  to China, that there is allegedly a conscious policy of the  Chinese leaders aimed at winning back territory and supplanting  the Russians, that is, creeping expansion. We in the Foreign  Ministry and in Russia's embassy in China have the impression  that it is by no means a question of any long-term, conscious,  officially approved strategy. We believe that the issue of  China's claims on our vast territory has been settled.    [Natarov] The question of the so-called "border  equalization"  in this connection. Specifically, the article of our  correspondent mentions that the local administration is fighting  Moscow's decision to unilaterally give China thousands of  hectares of land.    [Afanasyev] This also is an entirely incorrect proposition,  which, unfortunately, is given credence in our border  territories, but it is based on two circumstances. The first, an  ignorance of the essence of the border issue, which ensues from  the secret nature of the negotiations. These negotiations had  been conducted for more than 30 years, and the populace was not  informed as to their content. The second, the endeavor of  certain local political leaders to amass extra points by way of  the incitement of nationalist sentiments.    The heart of the matter is that the parties agreed to  clarify  the line of passage of the border--4,300 km. Of these, 3,700 km  run along the rivers Ussuri, Amur, and Argun. And here the  parties adopted the generally recognized principle of  international law--the border runs along the middle of the main  channel in rivers that are navigable or along the middle of the  river of nonnavigable rivers. That is, Mother Nature herself  decides to whom the islands in these rivers belong. I repeat  that this is a generally recognized principle of international  law. This question was decided according to this principle in  tsarist Russia also.    The agreement on the eastern section of the border signed in  1991 has been ratified by the parliaments of the two countries.  This agreement is already in operation, and any attempts to  revise it would lead to confrontation and conflict with China.  We know full well to what the unsettled nature of the  territorial problem with China led from the history of the  1960's: Remember Damanskiy Island.    As far as thousands of hectares of land are concerned, this  is absolute rubbish. The borders are being clarified, as a  result of which some sections will pass from China to Russia,  some, from Russia to China. Representatives of the local  authorities also are taking part in the demarcation work,  naturally.    [Natarov] Let us return to the problem of illegal  penetration  of our territory. What are the ways of resolving it?    [Afanasyev] There is a problem of illegal residence and  penetration. In some communities, considering the sparse  population of our areas, there are more Chinese than Russian  citizens. In these cases, specific measures need to be  adopted--in conjunction with the central authorities, the local  authorities, and various departments. And such measures are  being adopted, incidentally. This matter was raised in the  course of A.V. Kozyrev's recent visit to Beijing, and the  Chinese side expressed understanding of this problem; more, the  Chinese representatives were concerned to ensure that the  impressions gained from the actions of individual Chinese  offenders not be transferred in the minds of Russian people to  China as a whole. Two agreements on visa travel, which tighten  control of border crossing, have been in effect since 29  January. Thus, travel on regular passports with the "official"  stamp has been abolished--and a multitude of trips with such  passports had been made on both our side and the Chinese  side--and visa conditions for all travel other than group  tourist travel are being introduced. Special tourist  companies--there are five of them currently in the Far  East--which will draw up the papers for visa-free tourist travel  to China, have been distinguished. I would like to emphasize  that all these questions are being tackled on a reciprocal  basis. It is the bilateral nature of the resolution of  Russian-Chinese problems that I would like to emphasize. The  article "The China Card" is guilty of a one-sidedness of  consideration of the problem. After all, it is perfectly obvious  that if we restrict the entry of Chinese, we have a right to  expect the same actions of the Chinese authorities.    [Natarov] Is there any information on the response to the  publication "The China Card" in China itself?    [Afanasyev] Yes, this article was noticed in China. I will  tell you that in unofficial conversations Chinese have told me  that they were wondering whether or not to start a polemic with  us, that is, who are worse: the Chinese in Russia or the  Russians in China.    [Natarov] They have no less of a bill?    [Afanasyev] Yes. But ultimately the Chinese decided to  refrain. They are of the opinion that the start of a public  argument on these matters would have an extremely negative  effect on our bilateral relations. There is much evidence,  incidentally, of disgraceful and criminal behavior of our  citizens in China, and were the Chinese to judge the whole  Russian people by these cases, no good would come of this.    To sum up, a calm, realistic approach to this problem is  needed. We need to take a look at it and need to think how to  resolve it, but there should under no circumstances be  exaggerations in the direction of charges against China and the  Chinese people as a whole, their being ascribed sinister  intentions of expansion into Russia. This problem can be  resolved perfectly easily by way of order being brought to bear  within our country and the regulation of the rules of  foreigners' residence, with regard to the new realities. The law  enforcement authorities of Russia and China should cooperate  actively, and there are examples of this.    In short, under no circumstances must we once again erect  along our border with China a "Wall of China" and estrange our  countries and peoples. A prudent combination of freedom,  communication, movement, trade and other relations, and the most  elementary order determined by the border regime, are needed.  This is entirely within the capabilities of good  neighbors--Russia and China.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Heilongjiang Governor Shao Qihui by reporter </F> (Yang Zhaopan); place and date not given; from the "News and  Press Review" program -- recorded]    [Text] Listeners, since the opening of the sessions of the  National People's Congress [NPC] and the National Committee of  the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC],  the 20-character principle, namely seizing the opportunity,  deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and  maintaining stability, has become the consensus of deputies and  members. (Yang Zhaopan), correspondent of this station,  interviewed Deputy Shao Qihuai, governor of Heilongjiang  Province, on this principle.    [Yang] Governor Shao, the central authorities have proposed  the principle of seizing the opportunity, deepening reform,  opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining  stability as the overall interests for the work of the entire  party and state. Could you talk about your views on this issue?    [Shao] The central authorities' 20-character principle  concerning the overall interests not only tallies with the  national situation, but also completely conforms to the  (?overall) situation. The essence of the 20-character principle,  namely opportunity, reform, opening up, development, and  stability, is brought up in a definite and appropriate way. For  example, seizing the opportunity. As opportunities do not last  long, we must seize them. As far as Heilongjiang is concerned,  a very important opportunity for the province these years has  been the central authorities' (?policy) concerning opening up  border areas. By opening up border areas, Heilongjiang has made  significant development in economy and foreign trade over the  past years. I have noticed that the central authorities are  particularly concerned with the problems of agriculture and  large- and medium-sized enterprises. Under the current  situation, we should seize the opportune time at which the  development of agriculture and invigoration of large- and  medium- sized enterprises are proposed by the central  authorities to boost the development of these two sectors in  Heilongjiang.    As for deepening reform, reform has been launched for a  decade or so; how we should deepen reform is [words indistinct].  Talking about opening up wider, although Heilongjiang Province  has been stepping up the pace of opening up border areas in the  past few years, the key lies in opening up to all directions.  After all, we cannot attach importance to opening up border  areas only, and ignore countries in Southeast Asia and Latin  America. Therefore, the central authorities [words indistinct]  proposed this year that we open up border areas on the one hand,  and open up to Southeast Asia and Latin America in an all-round  way on the other.    [Yang] Governor Shao, what is your view about correctly  handling the relations among reform, development, and stability?    [Shao] I believe the handling of relations among the three  is not only to address problems in the past, more importantly it  is to set a higher standard and demand social and economic  development in the new situation. To properly handle the  relations among reform, development, and stability, I believe we  must face actual [words indistinct] and problems, think them  over and reform them. There are indeed some problems among  reform, development, and stability that have plagued us for a  long time. The key to solving these problems lies in developing  the tertiary industry step by step. For example, Heilongjiang  Province has reaped bumper harvests in agriculture for several  years in a row, and attained expected results every year. It  should have [words indistinct]. On the contrary, however,  peasants' incomes did not increase rapidly and Heilongjiang's  revenue is getting worse. This means there is no healthy cycle  among production, development, and stability. This problem has  something to do with properly handling the relations among the  above three things. Therefore, the proposal of correctly  handling the relations among reform, development, and stability  has (?addressed the actual problem). Why are the relations  among the three not handled properly sometimes? The crux of the  matter lies in the criteria for work, and whether reform and  development can be assessed by the three criteria as proposed by  Comrade Xiaoping? As far as reform is concerned, we cannot  reform for the sake of reform and oversee the (?overall  interests) for the partial needs. Therefore, I think the key to  properly handling the relations among reform, development, and  stability lies in tackling the actual problems and adopting a  definite criterion.</p>

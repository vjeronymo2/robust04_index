			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- Commemorating the 34th  anniversary of the "April 19 Revolution," the student uprising  in 1960 that toppled the Syngman Rhee regime, President Kim  Yong-sam visited the April 19 cemetery in Suyuri Tuesday and  paid his respects at the newly built and relocated shrine of the  fallen demonstrators.    Kim labeled the student uprising a "revolution" once he  became president last year and began work to make the cemetery  holy precincts.    Noting the spirit of April 19 had been newly enhanced since  the birth of his civilian government last year, Kim called for  further efforts to develop the uprising's legacy.    He ordered the commemorative service and events be held in  the cemetery from next year once the refurbishment is finished.    He spoke with representatives of the bereaved families and  then leaders of the student movement while walking around the  grounds.    Kim became the first incumbent president to visit the  cemetery last year.    Other government and political leaders, together with  students and bereaved families, lined up to pay homage to those  who died during clashes with the police.    Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang, government leaders and nearly  500 representatives of the uprising held a commemorative  ceremony, sponsored by the Patriots and Veterans Affairs  Ministry, at the Sejong Cultural Center in downtown Seoul.    "The basic idea behind the April 19 (Revolution) is to  create  a constitutional nation where people's rights are guaranteed and  individual freedom is allowed," Yi said in a keynote speech.    "We should not forget that we were able to open up a real  democratic era today because of the firm faith in democracy  implanted through the April 19 (event)," he said.    He declared that the government was hastening to carry out  legal revisions to reappraise the democratic revolution.    Similiar ceremonies were held in other cities and provinces.    The uprising, designated as a revolution from this year, was  marked not only by dissident parties and students but by  political leaders from both the ruling and opposition camps.    Opposition Democratic Party leader Yi Ki-taek and 200 party  members visited the cemetery early in the morning, followed  immediately by ruling Democratic Liberal Party members led by  Executive Chairman Kim Chong-pil.    Cemetery managers expect more than 10,000 visitors during  the  day.    Nearly 7,000 university students in Seoul gathered for  ceremonies at their respective campuses to hold various events  including a marathon, street march and cycling games.    An opera on the subject will be performed in the evening at  the Seoul Opera Theater.</p>

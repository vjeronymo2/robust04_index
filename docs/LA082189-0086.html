			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SEPULVEDA TUNNEL CLOSURE TIES UP 405, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS EXPECTED  </P> <P> Closure of the Sepulveda Boulevard tunnel for construction work resulted in an  early-morning traffic tie-up on the southbound San Diego Freeway today, but  officials said the situation was not as bad as they had feared.  </P> <P> "I haven't seen any big problems," said California Highway Patrol Officer Dave  Grajeda. "I hope it stays this good." Grajeda said that although there was more  traffic than usual on the freeway, there were no major accidents -- only  slow-moving traffic.  </P> <P> Traffic-control officers on such alternate routes as Beverly Glen Boulevard and  Coldwater Avenue said traffic on those thoroughfares was only slightly heavier  than usual as a result of the tunnel closure.  </P> <P> On a typical weekday, an estimated 28,000 cars pass through the Sepulveda  tunnel, which is one of the main links between the Los Angeles Basin and the  San Fernando Valley, officials said. Repeated repaving inside the tunnel has  raised the level of the road so much that the tops of big-rig trucks often  scrape its sloping roof. The tunnel, which runs beneath Mulholland Drive, will  be shut down until Sept. 30 while workers lower the pavement level.  </P></p>

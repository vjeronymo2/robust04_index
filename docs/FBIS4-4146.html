			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, April 26 (XINHUA) -- The needs of the  developing countries should be fully considered in the  implementation of the final agreement of the Uruguay Round  talks, Chinese delegate Tang Yufeng said here today.    He made the remarks at the 40th session of the Trade and  Development Board of the U.N. Conference on Trade and  Development (UNCTAD).    Tang pointed out that the conclusion of the Uruguay Round  talks and the creation of a World Trade Organization (WTO) will  undoubtedly have an impact on the world trade structure and the  economic development of different countries till the early next  century.    The agreement in a whole, however, hasn't reached an  expected  overall balance and in particular hasn't given a full  consideration to the interests and demands of the developing  countries, said Tang.    For example, tariff cuts on some largely-exported products  of  the developing countries didn't achieve the desired objective,  he said.    Besides, reduction of subsidies to agricultural products  failed to give due consideration to those developing countries  which are net grain importers, he added.    The Chinese delegate stressed that the developing countries  have played an active role in the GATT negotiations and they  should be given full and equal chances to participate in the  establishment of WTO and a future multilateral trade system.    Representatives from other countries also called for much  more attention to the interests of the developing countries  during the implementation of the agreement, especially in the  areas of primary products, grain subsidies and intellectual  properties.</p>

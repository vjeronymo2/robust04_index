			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Fabius challenge in Aids blood row Mr Laurent Fabius, the leader of the French Socialist party, yesterday asked to appear before a High Court to face charges over a scandal involving the distribution of blood tainted with the HIV virus, writes William Dawkins in Paris. His move followed the criticism of Socialists yesterday when MPs blocked an attempt to bring two of Mr Fabius's former ministerial colleagues to justice over the scandal. Mr Fabius's gesture could reduce the damage to the Socialists' image inflicted by the parliamentary block.</p>

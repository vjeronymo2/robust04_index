Her Majesty is keen  to do it and I believe it is a very good idea. The Russians  have now had democratic elections and have a democratically  elected president. Now seems an appropriate time to proceed.  It may happen as early as this autumn but final details are not  yet arranged."    Asked what Britain hoped to achieve with the visit by the  queen, Major replied: "The relationship between the United  Kingdom and Russia has been getting closer over some time. I  think that will set the seal on the much closer relationship we  now have." he added that it will be "the first visit for a very  long time, it may even be the first visit ever."    In response to a question about whether the queen will be  seeing more than Moscow, Major said, "It is not yet clear how  much she will see but I would think certainly more than Moscow.  She is keen to make this visit."    "Her Majesty is one of the finest ambassadors the United  Kingdom has ever had. I think from that point of view it is  highly desirable that she should visit Russia," John Major said.</p>

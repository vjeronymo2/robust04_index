			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> ANTI-NOISE HOT LINE URGED  </P> <P> Got a gripe about noisy cement trucks or jackhammers piercing the tranquillity  of your home or office?  </P> <P> City Councilwoman Christine Reed may have the answer. Reed wants to set up a  telephone hot line for residents with complaints about noise from construction  sites or after-hours construction. Building is not permitted before 7 a.m. or  on Sundays.  </P> <P> Reed said residents often feel guilty calling police with these kinds of  complaints, which could better be handled by building inspectors.  </P> <P> Reed also urged that violators be punished with something more than a ticket.  Construction companies might be forced to close for a day, for example.  </P> <P> "We have the enforcement authority of stopping the work on a project," Reed  said. "We ought to use that authority more often."  </P> <P> The telephone number for the hot line would be posted on construction notice  signs. The City Council voted Tuesday night to have its staff work out the  details.  </P></p>

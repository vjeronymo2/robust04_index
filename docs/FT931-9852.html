			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Ridley in call for 'burden sharing' LORD RIDLEY of Liddesdale, the former cabinet minister Nicholas Ridley, last night called for other nations to help bear the burdens of 'the world's policemen' now carried mainly by the US, Britain and France. In his maiden speech, Lord Ridley said he very much wanted to be in the government's camp on defence, but he said he was 'frightened that overnight the government will raise its tents and disappear into the darkness'. He insisted that ministers had to approach the issue from a 'resources angle'. Although the Cold War had ended, it had unleashed a whole maelstrom of nationalism, Moslem fundamentalism and ancient ethnic conflicts and tensions, he said. Britain should continue to play its part in policing trouble spots, he said, but 'the burden must be shared much more evenly . . . there are plenty of rich nations in the world and they contribute nothing like their full share of the cost of these operations'. Former Labour defence secretary Lord Healey also said the time had come to relate spending on defence with the country's economic situation.</p>

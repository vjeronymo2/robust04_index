			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / International Bonds: Solid European demand for Exim Bank of Japan issue Exim Bank of Japan yesterday launched a Dollars 300m offering of 10-year bonds priced to yield 30 basis points over US Treasuries. Lead manager Bank of Tokyo said that more than 70 per cent of demand came from European investors - UK investment funds and banks, Swiss pension funds, German and French insurance companies, and Swiss and Belgium retail investors. The remaining bonds were sold to central banks and private banks in Asia and the Middle East, it said. In the floating-rate sector, St George Bank, a New South Wales-based regional bank, launched a Dollars 250m issue of five-year notes, offering 30 basis points over three-month Libor. The launch coincided with the announcement of a 54 per cent increase in the bank's after-tax profits to ADollars 102.6m for the year to end-September and a fall in the charge for bad and doubtful debts to ADollars 8.2m from ADollars 45.3m. UBS, which led the offering, said the bonds were sold to UK banks, UK investment funds and other European institutional investors. St George Bank is the latest in a series of Australian banks, such as Bank of South Australia and Challenge Bank, to tap the euromarkets in recent weeks and to favour the floating-rate dollar sector. There is strong demand for floating-rate dollar notes, dealers said, and this offering represented the tightest pricing yet of the recent issues. Ford Credit Europe launched a Dollars 200m issue of three-year fixed-rate bonds priced, priced to yield 40 basis points over US Treasuries. Lead manager ABN Amro said the offering met firm demand from Swiss and Benelux retail investors, who were attracted by the 8 per cent coupon and the pricing spread. Institutional investors were also attracted by the relatively high yield offered by the short-dated bond, ABN Amro said. 'The dollar yield curve has flattened recently and investors can now get a yield at the short-end close to that on longer-dated maturities,' an official said. Ford Credit Europe came to the three-year dollar sector in September with an issue offering a coupon of 6 7/8 per cent. However, traders said the bonds were priced around three to five basis points tighter than similar outstanding three-year paper and they struggled as a consequence. Market sources said that the proceeds were swapped into floating-rate sterling. The European Investment Bank is expected to launch a two-tranche offering of dollar-denominated bonds within the next few days, dealers said. The issue is said to be of a Dollars 300m tranche of five-year bonds and a Dollars 300m tranche of 10-year bonds.</p>

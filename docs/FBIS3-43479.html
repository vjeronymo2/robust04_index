The parties are discussing the issue of the  national police. Our correspondent Pedro Manuel has further  details from Lusaka:    [Manuel] Good evening. The second round of peace talks has  already begun and there has already been a break. During this  morning's plenary session, the United Nations presented a  document on the national police to be examined by the  negotiating teams. This is the issue that is currently being  discussed. The negotiating teams examined the document and  UNITA requested a break to give a reply. Thus, there was no  meeting this afternoon.    Political observers here in Lusaka are questioning the  powers  of UNITA's new negotiating team. We say new team, because the  head now is General Eugenio Manuvakola and the deputy head is  Jorge Valentim. Antonio Dembo, the former head of the  delegation, and Generals Ben-Ben and Gato did not return to  Lusaka. Some people say that all this is part of UNITA strategy  to [words indistinct] things. This not the first time that  this is happening. In each negotiating round, UNITA always  changes the heads of its delegations. According to political  observers, this change is part of its strategy not to bind the  new head by agreements made by the former head [words  indistinct]. This was the case in Addis Ababa and also in  Abidjan. Here, we have to wait and see [words indistinct] duly  sign agreements reached.    Meanwhile, Angolan Ambassador to Zambia Pedro Fernando  Mavunza convened the national and foreign press to report that  UNITA continues to carry out a movement of its war machinery.  The ambassador cites a communique from the General Staff of the  Angolan Armed Forces.    According to a reliable source, UNITA continues to reaffirm  its intention to occupy some key posts in the government and  favors the holding of local elections. All this will be placed  on the negotiating table after the discussion of the issue of  the national police. UNITA asked Alioune Blondin Beye to give  it a break to examine the UN document on the national police  [words indistinct].</p>

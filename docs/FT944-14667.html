			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T flat despite record rise AT&amp;T, the leading US telecommunications group, yesterday said revenues jumped by a record 8.3 per cent in the third quarter but its net income was virtually static. These were the first results to reflect AT&amp;T's recently completed merger with McCaw Cellular Communications. Although the deal in effect depressed short-term profitability, it also opened up a new source of revenue for the group by giving it a solid presence in the growing market for wireless communications. Net income for the enlarged group was Dollars 1.05bn, or 67 cents a share, compared with re-stated profits of Dollars 1.02bn, or 66 cents, for the same period of 1993. About 10 per cent, or 9 cents a share, was sliced off the combined earnings by the dilutive effect of 200m new shares issued by AT&amp;T as part of the merger deal. Associated expenses reduced profits by a further 11 cents, or Dollars 170m. AT&amp;T's underlying performance was robust. Without the merger, net income would have shown a solid 13 per cent increase to Dollars 1.19bn, or 87 cents a share, against Dollars 1.05bn, or 78 cents, a year earlier. Stripping out the McCaw contribution, revenues were still strong, up nearly 8 per cent at Dollars 18bn. Wall Street had expected slightly lower figures. 'No matter how you look at the numbers, they add up to a very good quarter from operations,' said Mr Robert Allen, the chairman. However, the good results failed to have much impact on AT&amp;T's share price, which was up a scant Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 54 1/4 . For the first nine months of the year, consolidated net income was Dollars 3.37bn, or Dollars 2.16 a share, on revenues of Dollars 53.9bn. Restating the year-earlier figures, the company would have reported a net loss of Dollars 5.5bn, on sales of Dollars 50.2bn.</p>

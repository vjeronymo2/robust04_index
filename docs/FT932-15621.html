			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Gardening: For eyes and teas AFTER one day's Easter gardening, perhaps you would already like a change: after two, the back muscles may enforce one. If so, go and see what others have made of their time. This year, there are more than 2,800 gardens open on Sundays and weekdays in England and Wales. To find them, you need a car, curiosity - and the familiar Yellow Book. This year's edition costs Pounds 2 over the counter, Pounds 3 by UK post or Pounds 3.75 air mail to Europe. Cheques should be made out to the National Gardens Scheme and sent to its new address of Hatchlands Park, East Clandon, Guildford, Surrey GU2 7RT. The many great gardens in Scotland and Ulster do not appear between the same yellow covers because they run on slightly different seasons to those in the main book. But they are an essential extra. Scotland's Gardens Scheme will post you its handbook for Pounds 2.50 from 31 Castle Terrace, Edinburgh EH1 2EL; Ulster gardens can be found in a list from the Public Affairs Manager, National Trust, Rowallane, Saintfield, Co. Down. For breaks in May or late July, these booklets from the Celtic fringe are invaluable. This year's range of gardens is nothing if not varied. At Star Cottage, beginning today, meetings are promised with 'mechanical artist and author Lys de Bray, lately of Turnpike Cottage, Wimborne.' She will be greeting visitors personally and showing them a garden which 'will become another living library of her botanical drawings and paintings.' Alternatively, you can check out the taste of the previous and present archbishops of Canterbury. Today, from 2-5.30, Lambeth Palace will be showing off the 'significant renewal' of the past five years. The roots were laid by the Runcies (previous), and it is good to think that there is renewal somewhere in the Anglican garden-at-large which can be called significant. In any case, who knows what you might meet in an archbishop's garden on the eve of Easter? Remember, too, that the proceeds from tea go to the Lambeth boy scouts. Further north, near Ironbridge, Shropshire, the owners will show you their prize-winning garden, 'formerly the site of a rubbish tip developed by owners as a nature garden to attract wildlife.' Teas here assist the Arthritis and Rheumatism Council for Research: fellow-gardeners will sympathise. These prize-winnings are becoming more evident in the self-descriptions in the Yellow Book, competing with past television appearances and easily-overlooked 'features.' Near Portsmouth, you are invited to a prize-winner 'in 1988 and 1990 in The News water garden competition.' At the Tarn in Oxhey Drive, 'much of the garden was 'tree-lifted' by present owner from Hampstead in 1970' but it is not an ordinary tree-lift: in its previous home, 'it had a mention by the late Lanning Roper in the Sunday Times.' As rank and degree grows between our gardens, I have strange visions of a 21st century where Sundays will be spent seeing tree-lifts from 'gardens once mentioned by the late Arthur Hellyer.' At 2 The Cottage, near Mayford in Surrey, you are asked to park 'tactfully' beside a garden included in the Good Housekeeping feature on cottage gardens. Even more to the point, home-made teas are available all day. Indeed, teas are stratified as carefully as the prize-winning gardens. Teas should never be confused with home-made teas or teas in aid of the village church, let alone with teas at shop. At the John Hine Studios in Aldershot, Hampshire, you can even have teas in a 'traditional English tea room.' As for open villages with groups of gardens, personally, I give them a wide berth. I used to live in one and, on Sundays, unwary suckers were asked to fork out to visit several rather ordinary gardens with a cherry or two between them, lots of London Pride by the slippery paving stones, and pots of chives for sale at the door. As a gardener, I limit my visiting to those places which are given the Yellow Book's star symbol for floral or botanical interest. I avoid those laid out within the past seven years or which emphasise the approximate number of their plants. But if you want only the best, how do you find them? You can begin with the Good Gardens Guide, edited by Graham Rose and Peter King and published by Barrie and Jenkins. It narrows down the candidates to a mere 1,000, within which you can usually trust the starred choices. Regular openings usually (but not always) imply real quality. Good news spreads on the grapevine: about Greencombe, in Somerset, perhaps; the Old Rectories at Burghfield or Farnborough in Berkshire; or the Old Manor at Twyning in Gloucestershire (where I envied a superb corylopsis beside a vibrant blue corydalis flexuosa only last week). Old favourites are rising higher under a new generation of owners, like Kiftsgate Court or Hodges Barn in Gloucestershire. Others are tailing away; but one feels that Wisley, the Royal Horticultural Society's pride and joy, should not be leading them. Curiosity never killed a gardener; usually it improves us. If they try to sell you primula Wanda as if it were one of grandma's rarities among the home-made cream teas, do remember that all your visiting is also a means to an end. Not every trip can be to a little-known Sissinghurst. By this Sunday ritual, all garden visitors are turned into cash for charities: visit three shockers and you have helped to pay for a Macmillan cancer nurse. Last year, the Gardens Scheme earned nearly Pounds 750,000, a reward for all the unsung efforts of organisers and the labours of all those gardeners who, somehow, we take for granted when they have the nerve to open up for us.</p>

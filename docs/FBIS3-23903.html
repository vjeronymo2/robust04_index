Mr.  Belyayev is disputing the amendments and additions made by the  mayor to the Statute Governing Elections to the City Assembly.  In particular, in accordance with those amendments, Federation  Council members cannot be elected as deputies to the assembly,  which contradicts the Russian Constitution.    The court session scheduled for 15 February was rescheduled  to Thursday as a result of the defendant's failure to appear in  court -- Mr. Sobchak was at the opening of the Olympic Games in  Lillehammer and was supposed to return to St. Petersburg last  night.    As a Sobchak representative stated in court, the mayor  allegedly was completely uninformed about the suit that had been  initiated by Belyayev on 8 February.</p>

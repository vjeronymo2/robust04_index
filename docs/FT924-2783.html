			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1992 (16): Smarter way of working - Aircraft design / Three-dimensional models can now be made in hours, rather than weeks ADVANCES in technology at Short Brothers, one of the oldest aircraft manufacturers in the world, no longer come in leaps and bounds as they did in the days of wood and canvas. But things do happen faster, writes Claire Gooding. The CAD system used by Shorts has reduced the time taken to produce the mock-up of a wing from a few weeks to a few hours. Shorts, founded in 1909 and now owned by Bombardier (quoted on the Canadian Stock Exchange), employs 8,700 people and has a turnover of Pounds 395m. In a fiercely competitive business, it looks for an edge wherever it can find one and it introduced CAD technology 10 years ago, choosing CADDS from Computervision, in line with Boeing. 'As with all aerospace companies, we were looking for an edge: smarter ways of doing business, faster turnaround, better reactions, and dealing with changes faster,' says Mr Dennis Barritt, the CAD-CAM manager at Shorts. 'Better-quality products was the key: everyone jumps on the quality bandwagon, but you're not in the business unless you produce a quality product that users can afford and know is reliable.' In his three years at Shorts, Mr Barritt has learned that technology is not the problem - 'the big thing is not software or hardware. I would say 75 to 80 per cent of the effort goes into the change of culture.' At the time, Shorts assessed all the leading offerings and decided in favour of a turnkey solution. Considerations were the cost of ownership, and the support available from the supplier: the software had to be tailored. A decade later, the system has 'migrated' from its mainframe host. Computervision's CADDS software now runs on 130 Sun work stations and is linked directly into the production process. EDM (electronic data management) has become ingrained in the way that Shorts communicates internally - 'we can receive work from others, via data translators, and we are looking at dealing direct with partners elsewhere in the group.' Mr Barritt has seen the process of design speeded up through the use of CAD, practically eliminating the dependency on physical mock-ups. 'Initially, it was an electronic drawing board, used for producing two-dimensional sheet metal patterns,' he explains. 'These days you're only limited by your vision. We are moving towards digital pre-assembly, generating a 3D model in a matter of minutes where it used to take a week.' What users think of their CAD systems: see back page PRODUCT PROFILE CADDS Supplier: Computervision developed CADDS 5, and sells it through a network of value-added resellers (VARS). Product: CADDS is an integrated software product line used to design, analyse and manufacture complex components and assemblies. Its design and manufacturing technology features include parametric and variational geometry capabilities. Users can purchase the complete system. Number of users: 150,000 seats installed worldwide. Price: Pounds 21,450 for CADDS 5 Premium Engineering package, with CV modules starting at approximately Pounds 3.00 each. Other services available: pre-sales consultancy, maintenance, support, training, and systems integration. User views: 'Functionally not as rich as other offerings in same bracket.' (Functionality has been improved since).</p>

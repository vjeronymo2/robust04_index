In the preface the booklet notes that a fine socialist  system  has been established in North Korea, but fascist dictatorship is  rampant in South Korea.    The preface says the South Korean authorities, with a view  to  keeping the country divided forever, built the largest ever  concrete wall under the aegis of the United States and have  ceaselessly staged provocative military exercises against North  Korea.    Saying North Korea put forward a proposal for reunification  through a confederacy based on one nation, one state, two  systems and two governments, the preface stresses this proposal  is the best way of achieving the reunification of the country.</p>

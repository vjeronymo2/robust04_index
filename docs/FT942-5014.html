			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Arts: All admiration for Zimerman and the Nash - Concerts in London The Polish pianist Krystian Zimerman's packed recital at the Royal Festival Hall on Thursday night had a most unusual programme, at first sight bitty, consisting of a string of variation sets by improbably assorted composers, writes Paul Driver. However, his playing not only justified five of his six choices - sometimes making undistinguished music sound much better than it is - but nearly authenticated the sequence as an artistic whole. That playing is utterly compelling: flawlessly virtuosic; muscular and suavely lyrical by turns; equally capable of the most limpid delicacies and most massive quasi-orchestral grandeur; and always informed by a questing, unorthodox musical intelligence, which was evident in the delightfully quirky programme notes he provided as well as in such astonishing performances as that of the opening item, his own (1973) transcription of Bach's Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 582. I would never have thought that two hands on one piano could produce so detailed and convincing an impression of a full organ as this. Cheekily, he followed the gigantism of this piece with a translucent miniature allegedly by the eight-year old Schubert, Seven Easy Variations in G receiving their British premiere, no less. There is nothing beyond elegant Mozartian simplicity in the writing, but Zimerman's formidable musicianship raised the expression a power or two. For the mature Mendelssohn's Variations serieuses Op. 54 he restored some of the orchestral thunderousness of the Bach account, but making a point of not following the false Horowitz tradition and actually ending with thunder. His reading was otherwise as gloriously full of Horowitzian technical brilliance as you could wish. (Like Horowitz, Zimerman travels with his own wondrous instrument.) After the interval we were plunged, a little unpreparedly, into the glittering hard nostalgia of Ravel's Valses nobles et sentimentales, among which Zimerman found several occasions for introspective lingering; and yet more abruptly into the modernist pointillism of Webern's Variations Op. 27, which was given a passionate and athletic despatch, Zimerman squaring up to the keyboard like a tennis player receiving service. His endpiece, the diffuse, immature Variations on a Polish Theme, Op. 10, by Szymanowski, rather let the programme down, though lent moments of keen persuasiveness. Why not finish with one of the dozens of piano variation sets that are masterpieces? Critics may not be the best-loved members of the music profession, writes John Allison, but one would not have guessed that from the warmth of the audience at the Wigmore Hall on Saturday: Felix Aprahamian was celebrating his 80th birthday, and a throng of his admirers combined with devotees of the Nash Ensemble to pack the hall, leaving standing room only at the back. But then Aprahamian, who was number two on The Sunday Times for 41 years, is no ordinary critic. A legendary figure in British musical life, a friend of many composers and musicians, he was above all a champion of French music in this country. He played a significant role in presenting the 'Concerts de Musique Francaise' at the Wigmore during 1940s and early 1950s. The venue for Saturday's celebration was thus as appropriate as the Nash Ensemble's programme, all French with the exception of the honorary-French Delius. One of the group's many strengths is its versatility, and this programme had variety and balance. An evocative account of Ravel's Introduction and Allegro for harp, string quartet, flute and clarinet set the tone for the evening. Skaila Kanga was the consummate harp soloist. No less accomplished was the flautist Philippa Davies, who captured the contrasting moods of Roussel's Joueurs de Flute. A shifting of stage furniture brought out strings, piano (Ian Brown, excellent) and the baritone Francois Le Roux for Le Bonne Chanson, Faure's setting of nine Verlaine poems. Le Roux, a musicianly singer, was not at his most mellifluous: his tone seemed a little grey and colourless for music as luminous as this. Christopher van Kampen was a warm soloist in Delius's Sonata for cello and piano, and brought shape to its long, musing lines. Debussy's ethereal Sonata for flute, viola and harp was dispatched with delicacy before we heard the evening's party piece: Le Bal Masque, an appropriate choice since Poulenc was one of Aprahamian's closest composer friends. Le Roux declaimed Max Jacob's verses with verve and the eight players discharged the cheeky score with zest. The Nash musicians are renowned communicators, and here they bubbled over, providing a rollicking end to an otherwise sober party.</p>

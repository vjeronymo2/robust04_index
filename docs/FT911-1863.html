			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Distance lends enchantment FT-SE Index: 2,508.4 (+22.2) London rose obediently in response to Wall Street's welcome for the April purchasing managers' report, which came in above expectations. On Monday, the Chicago purchasing managers, usually read as a leading indicator for the big one, fell; but the national reading rose for the third successive month. There is a message here, but it may not be quite the one London is reading. The main industrial news in the US is that car output is rising - witness the very bullish Michigan report, now showing a positive balance of 25 per cent. This was bound to happen; output was some 20 per cent below even the depressed level of sales, which has so far recovered only marginally. Housing is just off the bottom, but is unlikely to rise much above it. The rest of the construction scene is dismal. In the words of the new Beige Book, activity is weak, but there are some signs of bottoming out. Wall Street comment is rather more bearish about the economy, but likes lower rates and a falling dollar. Modified rapture. The question for UK investors is how much any US delight should influence views on this side of the water. A British turnaround is still the subject of speculation, margins are being squeezed, the currency is uncomfortably strong and stuck. Higher output in Detroit means little in London. We march with Wall Street, say the brokers; but recently they have only been following it upwards. The Dow is still 3 per cent off its peak; after yesterday London is very near the top.</p>

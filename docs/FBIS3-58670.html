			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 31 December left-of-center Athens  daily TA NEA reports that Russian "supernationalist" Vladimir  Zhirinovsky was given permission by Deputy Minister of Foreign  Affairs Yiorgos Papandreou to enter the country and visit  Salonica for a few hours. This is surprising, the newspaper  suggests, given Zhirinovsky's statements during his visit to  Sofia, when he advised Bulgaria to extend by annexing Greek  Thraki and Skopje. TA NEA also blames government spokesman  Evangelos Venizelos, who "induced the newspaper into error" by  characterizing the news of Zhirinovsky's Salonica visit, which  surfaced in the Italian newspaper LA STAMPA, as a "journalistic  mishap." TA NEA cites Greek diplomatic sources as saying that a  more serious problem would have ensued had the Greek side  refused to allow Zhirinovsky into the country, given that he was  a big winner in the recent Russian elections.    According to the 3 January TA NEA, the Greek Government is  preparing a demarche to the "Russian side" to protest  Zhirinovsky's remarks on Thraki, while Yiorgos Papandreou is  claiming that the Russian's Salonica stay was a "transit, not  official, visit." TA NEA quotes Papandreou as saying in an  interview on the SKY radio station that "the issue at that time  was not substantive and was faced as such." Papandreou also  maintained that Zhirinovsky's Sofia remarks were made after the  Russian's departure from Greece. The deputy minister further  argued that the Greek Government decided to downgrade the visit  because it thought the incident was not serious .</p>

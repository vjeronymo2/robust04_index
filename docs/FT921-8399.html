			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Getting to grips with the community care market - Seton Healthcare's change of direction and its rising fortunes SETON Healthcare grew from a playful observation made by the company's founder while visiting an Oldham stockinette manufacturer in 1952. Chatting to a machinist, Mr Ivor Stoller doubled a length of knotted tubular cotton fabric along his finger - and realised he had created a tubular bandage. It took Mr Stoller a long time to persuade doctors and nurses of the contribution his new product could make to bandaging techniques which had changed little since the days of the Egyptian mummies. In 1960 the company started making Tubigrip, which now dominates the UK market for elasticated tubular support bandages. Direct marketing to health professionals has continued to be important to Seton, which is now run by Mr Norman Stoller, the founder's son. It came to the market in July 1990 through a Pounds 23m placing at 130p a share, and has since seen its market value nearly triple - making it one of the stock market's best performing shares. Annual sales of the company have grown from Pounds 700,000 at the start of the seventies reaching more than Pounds 30m last year. Pre-tax profits for the period came out at Pounds 3m. In recent years it has shifted the balance of the group away from hospitals, where competitive contracting keeps the lid on profit margins, towards supplying prescription products to retail chemists and the community care market. The trend towards more care being carried out in the community is fuelled both by the shorter length of hospital stays, and the increasing number of old people with chronic illnesses who need to be treated at home. Seton claims that while people under 65 need an average of four prescriptions per year, the over-65s need 12 and those aged over 75 average 24 prescriptions each. The group has made a particular effort to target district nurses and health visitors. They tend to be easier to reach than GPs, who are often besieged by representatives from the big drugs compan-ies. Under the Nurse Prescribing Bill, currently going through parliament, up to 28,000 qualified district nurses and health visitors will be be allowed to prescribe for the first time, once they have undergone additional training. Seton established a direct sales force in the eighties and now has 26 former nurses on its books, who spend about 80 per cent of their time selling in the community. As trained nurses, they can demonstrate products and advise on their application for particular medical problems. One of the group's newest products is Setopress, a high-compression bandage used for the treatment of venous ulcers, a common condition among elderly people. Nurses know they have applied it using the most effective pressure when the pattern woven into the bandage is stretched to form a perfect square. Seton recognises that the higher margins available in the community care side of the health business will attract competition, but is confident that the group's sales force of trained nurses gives it a considerable advantage. Mr Dieno George, managing director, said: 'If our competitors send in the salesmen with shiny shoes, they are going to struggle. Nurses want help and advice, not a hard sell.' Seton also stressed the importance of having a direct sales force last month when it announced the sale of its US subsidiary, SePro Healthcare, and new distribution arrangements in the US. Although the financial performance of its US subsidiary had improved substantially over the last three years, Seton said SePro had no sales force outside the hospital market, and the cost of building one up to take advantage of the same trend towards community care in the US was beyond the resources of the UK group. Seton has sold most of its healthcare business in the US to Acme United Corporation, a long-established company which has been distributing Seton's Lyofoam range of wound dressings since 1985. Acme has a considerable sales force in both the hospital and community sectors, and will now distribute several other Seton products. Seton is confident that these new arrangements will be to develop the sales and profits of the UK group's products more quickly in North America. The acquisition of quality brands has also been another key factor in Seton's rapid growth. In 1990 it bought two muscular pain relief creams, Transvasin and Lloyd's Cream, for Pounds 1.35m from Reckitt &amp; Colman, the food and household products group. Last year the group paid an initial Pounds 1.5m for the Steripod trade mark, which covers a new range of the latest 'blow-fill-seal' technology. This enables sterile pharmaceutical solutions to be delivered by plastic vials, containers which are ideally suited to the requirements of community nurses. Although the scale of the market caused Seton to retreat from direct selling in the US, Seton is determined that in Europe it will continue to pursue its strategy of 'following the patient' from hospital back into the community. The group has established a joint venture with its distributor in the Netherlands to share the costs of setting up a sales team which will sell Seton products directly to the community care market. Success in the Netherlands would provide a platform for considerable expansion by Seton across Europe.</p>

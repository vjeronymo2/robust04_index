			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Banks revive appetite for assets - Aggressive loan pricing set new standards in 1993 In the international syndicated loans market, 1993 will go down as the year when the pricing on loans at last headed lower, reversing the trend of the previous three years. Syndicated deals from Reuters, the international news and information group, and Northern Foods, the UK dairy and food manufacturing company, attracted considerable attention in the market because of their aggressive pricing, and were seen by many as setting new standards for loan pricing. The 1980s were a time of cheap and easy access to bank loans: banks fell over one another to lend money, and borrowers were able to command favourable and tight pricing on the loans. However, the climate changed in late 1989 and early 1990. The pricing on loans started to edge up as the international capital adequacy requirements agreed by the Basle Committee forced international banks to adopt a more selective approach to lending. Capital adequacy requirements were not the only worry for the banks. The combination of recession and a spate of corporate disasters including Polly Peck and the Maxwell empire prompted bankers to think more carefully about the creditworthiness of their customers, and should have made them more discriminating in their lending policy. Now there are signs the recession is ending, and bankers are, once again, hungry for assets. As the supply of funds exceeds demand, many borrowers are finding that they can obtain more aggressive terms on their loans. The question uppermost in some bankers' minds is whether pricing will fall further in 1994. As one banker points out, the banks will have plenty of money to lend given the expectation that about 40 per cent of the loan book of banks in London is due to reach maturity in the next 18 months. The initial signs that pricing had reached a peak and was starting to turn down came in mid-1992, but bankers said the real acid test was the Reuters deal in early 1993, followed by Northern Foods' loan - both borrowers regarded as top-class corporate names. Reuters initially set out to borrow Pounds 100m, but the deal was heavily oversubscribed and it raised Pounds 160m through a five-year loan, paying a margin of 37.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). Participation fees were 8 basis points for Pounds 15m and 6 basis points for Pounds 10m. 'Bankers sucked their teeth at the time because the margin was under 40 basis points, but the fact is the deal was done and it has set the standard for UK corporates,' said one syndicated loan specialist at a European bank. Northern Foods signed a Pounds 150m five-year revolving credit in May, also paying a margin of 37.5 basis points over Libor. Bankers point out that UK corporates had been borrowing at margins of around 50 basis points over Libor in 1992, edging down to 45 basis points in mid-1992 for good names. With Reuters and Northern Foods both borrowing at margins of 37.5 basis points, the question bankers now ask is how much further can the margin fall? 'It's going to go down lower, the question is how low - can it get to 35 basis points?' says one UK banker. The OECD figures paint a less cheerful picture of pricing for syndicated credits in the OECD area. In 1990, the average spread was 51 basis points, rising to 86 basis points in 1992 and 92 basis points for the first four months of 1993. While conditions may have become more favourable for some borrowers in 1993, there is not much sign of a stampede to the international syndicated loans market. The volume of international loans held pretty steady in 1993 with total signed loans amounting to Dollars 181.85bn, against Dollars 181.60bn in 1992, according to Euromoney Loanware. While the first three-quarters of 1993 were as strong or stronger than the previous year, the final quarter saw a sharp drop in activity. Bankers attribute this to the fact that some UK borrowers want to borrow money but would prefer to hold off until pricing comes down a few more basis points. 'My impression is that the loan market has been fairly vibrant. Some UK corporates are saying they will hold off until the New Year as there's definitely a few basis points to come off the pricing,' says Mr Stan Hurn, head of banking syndicate at the Midland Bank group in London. 'The negative factors which have been affecting the syndicated loan market since mid-1990 continued to exert a strong influence during the first four months of 1993,' according to the June 1993 OECD report Financial Market Trends. 'New capital demand continued to be limited by the protracted weakness of the world economy, a very low-level of internationally-financed merger and acquisition operations, and the availability of cost-effective and flexible financing for borrowers on the securities markets, including the rapidly expanding markets for medium-term notes or some domestic markets for private placements,' it adds. Many bankers see little prospect of activity picking up dramatically in 1994 given the attractions of alternative sources of funding such as the international bond markets and equity markets. As western economies emerge from the difficult recessionary climate, borrowers may be more cautious about becoming heavily indebted again. 'In the UK, I can't see much new demand for next year - all the multi-option facilities' refinancings have been done, and UK corporates are not in a rush because they are coming out of recession slowly and gradually and are not going to be rushing out to build new factories or acquire other companies,' says one banker.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    TOP SYNDICATED LOAN ARRANGERS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     1993*                    1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Dollars                 Dollars Bank Name                     bn    Rank Issues       bn    Rank  Issues  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- National Westminster Bank   14.28     1    99         9.36    4     93 Barclays Bank               10.17     2    89         9.52    2     91 Citicorp                     8.77     3   111         9.50    3    104 Deutsche Bank                7.35     4    51         2.74   15     43 Hongkong Bank/Midland Group  6.50     5    79         6.72    5     69 ABN-Amro Bank                6.21     6    74         6.27    6     79 Chemical Bank                6.17     7    82         3.27   11     55 Chase Manhattan Bank         5.89     8    84         3.99    7     66 JP Morgan &amp; Co.              5.01     9    36        19.23    1     27 Union Bank of Switzerland    4.21    10    58         2.96   14     55 Total signed loans         181.85                   181.60  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Signed loans only.

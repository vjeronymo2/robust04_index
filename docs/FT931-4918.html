			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: Treatment of contaminated land needs a planned approach Sir, Your leader (Polluted land, March 4) accurately summed up the current debate on contaminated land but may have given a misleading impression of the position of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors. The RICS has not, as you suggest, argued that the seller of a property should be responsible for demonstrating that the land under offer is free from contamination. That approach has been tried in parts of the US and found wanting. Our proposal is for a planning-based approach to contamination. We want to see a land quality statement, based on a site investigation, become an integral part of a planning application. This would mean that any contamination present on a site would be identified - and could then be dealt with - whenever significant development or a change of use took place. We accept the point you make that this is not the entire solution to the problem of contamination. But there is no one solution. A range of measures is needed. There is already a mass of legislation on the statute book to combat contamination that poses a threat to public health. That needs to be used more often. There is also a need for greater assistance from government to help with the very high costs of treating the worst cases of pollution. We have sympathy with your suggestion of pressing councils to identify land that is badly contaminated. The problem is that such an approach can only work if local authorities have the resources to carry out any site investigations that may be necessary and there is a mechanism in place for rehabilitating sites where serious contamination is found. One thing is clear whatever the government announces. The whole of the property world, as well as business, lenders, insurers and others, now accepts that contamination of land is an issue which is not going to go away.

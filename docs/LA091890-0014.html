			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S SPEECH ON U.S. GOALS IN MIDDLE EAST  </P> <P> Now that our troops are deployed in force in the Persian Gulf area, what are  our leaders saying?  </P> <P> In his address to Congress and the nation, President Bush said that we will  stand by our friends (Saudi Arabia and so on).  </P> <P> Henry Kissinger, a former leader, has said that nations don't have friends;  they have interests. The President says that we are ready to check aggression  as such.  </P> <P> Secretary of State James Baker says that we should be patient during this  crisis. Congressmen say that some nations who are supposed to be on our side  should put their money where their troops are not.  </P> <P> The buzz out of the Pentagon is that the brass is saying things like rotating  troops in and out of the Persian Gulf area, although Bush says that Saddam  Hussein has to get out of Kuwait immediately.  </P> <P> What our leaders are not saying is that if the national energy policy proposed  by the Ford Administration in 1975 had been implemented, our men and women in  uniform wouldn't be in the Persian Gulf area in the first place.  </P> <P> GORDON FAY  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

Several political issues of  great importance were deeply debated.    Manuel Menendez Castellanos, first secretary of the  Communist  Party of Cuba [PCC] in the province, presented an in-depth  briefing on the firm support being given to the Revolution by  the masses in the province whom are exercising admirable  selfnessness and using creative initiatives to confront the  harsh conditions of the special period. Menendez spoke of the  sustained progress made in the food program, although he  described the progress as inadequate. He stressed the efforts  being made to increase production and the recent work to ensure  that cadres of the PCC, People's Government, and organizations  can deftly conduct economic analyses and act with energy to  reduce costs and increase productivity and production.    Menendez pointed out that this strategy is essential to  attain the economic efficiency that will make possible to step  by step reduce state subsidies and repair domestic finances.    Raul praised the efforts and work of the people of  Cienfuegos, and insisted on several key points to attain goals  in the farming sector, goals such as discipline, planning, and  organization of the workers. This is to ensure effective work  shifts of never less than eight hours a day. He also insisted on  using 90 percent of the work force and fuel on the furrow  irrigation, and the minimum amount of tractors to work the land,  as well as to amply use ox teams in every possible phase of the  agrarian process.    In relation to the positive experiences of the Youth Labor  Army [EJT], Raul stated that these principles are valid for  state farms as well as for the Basic Cooperative Production  Units [UBPC] being created [words indistinct]. In every case,  the worker's income should reflect the end result of his work.    The fight against crime and social indiscipline was another  issue discussed. Colonel Luis Barrera, provincial representative  of the Interior Ministry [Minint], briefed Raul on this issue.  He described the efforts as generally favorable. However, there  is need to maintain and increase vigilance and control measures,  improve the Unified Vigilance and Protection System and broaden  even more the people's participation in this struggle.    Menendez referred to the mobilization of PCC and Union of  Young Communists members and base-level bodies in the fight  against crime and the effective intervention of the task action  brigades in necessary cases.    Raul insisted that this is a struggle of the entire people,  not only the police's and the Minint's. He also stressed that  every leader, from the minister to the manager of a small  warehouse, must be fully responsible to preserve the people's  resources under his responsibility and act accordingly. Raul  added that quicker action by judicial bodies is needed to  respond to the changing mode of operations by the criminals.    In the company of Division Generals Leopoldo Cintra Frias  and  Joaquin Quintas Solas, chief of the Western and Central Armies,  respectively, Raul visited a tourist facility and the Carlos  Manuel de Cespedes electric plant. In the Punta Las Cuevas  Hotel, manager Santiago Manzano explained to Raul that this a  recently inaugurated center primarily for vanguard workers and  couples on their honeymoons. Raul stressed the importance of  preserving these types of services and urged its workers to  maintain the quality which, despite its short time in operation,  already distinguishes this hotel.    At the electric plant, Raul was interested in the efforts of  workers and technicians who guarantee the high degree of  efficiency which characterizes this plant -- a national vanguard  for 15 consecutive years. He was told that between what is  produced in the enterprise and what is done in cooperation with  other local entities, more than 30 percent of essential parts  and components are being procured and there is the possibility  of attaining up to 80 percent. Raul asked about the conditions  of the workers' dining room and housing. He urged keeping in  mind essential needs and warmly praised this work center.    The workers asked Raul to rely a message to Castro regarding  their willingness to maintain with the available resources the  operation of this center due to its importance for the country  in terms of energy and efficiency.</p>

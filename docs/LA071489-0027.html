			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOCH AIMS FOR ENSHRINEMENT IN N.Y. POLITICAL HISTORY  </P> <P> In the fall of 1956, a young lawyer with a growing taste for politics carried  an American flag to street corners in Greenwich Village, and wherever he could  draw a crowd, he preached the election of Adlai E. Stevenson for President.  </P> <P> It was a seminal experience, good basic training amidst the traffic and the  turmoil for what would come later.  </P> <P> "You can really make great points when there are hecklers in the audience,"  Edward Isidore Koch reminisced in his memoirs. "The only kind of heckler you  can't use is the drunk. The others, the ones who want to debate you, are  terrific. I love them. I became politically active then and there."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Already Running Hard  </P> <P> On Thursday, 33 years later, Koch announced for a fourth term as mayor of New  York. His declaration on a local radio program was a formality. He had been  running hard for a year, some say for most of his life.  </P> <P> "Ladies and gentlemen, I am running," Koch, 64, said from his office at City  Hall.  </P> <P> "Is that your formal announcement?" a reporter asked.  </P> <P> "I'm an informal guy," Koch deadpanned.  </P> <P> Unlike previous reelection campaigns where he won with over 70% of the vote,  the mayor clearly is the underdog, suddenly thrust against the reality of his  political mortality.  </P> <P> Only two other mayors, Robert F. Wagner Jr. and Fiorello H. LaGuardia (Koch's  hero) ever governed New York City for three terms. David Garth, the mayor's  good friend, confidant and campaign strategist, said Koch's bid for a fourth  term "is the difference between making the All-Star team and making  Cooperstown," referring to the site in Upstate New York of the Baseball Hall of  Fame.  </P> <P> "He wants to make Cooperstown. If he has to go out, he'd rather go out  fighting. He understands the reality. He may not like it, but he faces it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Time Getting Scarce  </P> <P> The reality is difficult, and the innings are beginning to slide by quickly on  Koch's field of dreams.  </P> <P> New York's Democratic primary is Sept. 12. The latest polls show Manhattan  Borough President David N. Dinkins, who is seeking to make history of his own  by becoming the city's first black mayor, with 45% of the vote -- five points  above the threshold to avoid a runoff. Koch, in the latest Daily News/WABC-TV  poll, trails with 31%.  </P> <P> Equally serious, only 37% of registered Democrats gave Koch a positive job  rating -- an amazing slide judged against the euphoria of his first two terms  in office.  </P> <P> For millions of Americans west of the Hudson, Koch over almost a dozen years  has come to symbolize New York City: brash, brawling, tough and tumultuous. His  autobiography "Mayor" was a best seller. His many appearances on television  ranging from "The Tonight Show" to "Saturday Night Live" have made him a  national celebrity.  </P> <P> The mayor's mouth, his detractor's charge, is his most prominent political  feature. He gloats in his victories, glories in his enemies defeats.  </P> <P> It got him in big trouble when he declared during the 1988 presidential primary  in New York that "Jews have got to be crazy to vote for Jesse Jackson." The  mayor later apologized.  </P> <P> Victories have been very few in his third term, which has been marked by  charges of corruption in government, chaos in some neighborhoods caused by  crime and crack, homelessness and simmering racial tension. Voters began to  forget Koch's work that helped bring the city back from the brink of bankruptcy  in the 1970's. Koch's ability to identify with the city's worst problems as if  he were an ordinary citizen, not the public official most responsible for  solving them, began to wear thin.  </P> <P> Atop all this, Koch suffered a small stroke. It left no paralysis or diminution  of faculties, but Koch's physicians told him he'd had a close call: The stroke  was just a hairbreadth away from the motor area of his brain.  </P> <P> The task for Koch over the next eight weeks is clear: drive Dinkins below 40%  and get to play in extra innings in a runoff on Sept. 19. It will be a tricky  exercise.  </P> <P> Current polls show almost three quarters of black Democrats voting for Dinkins  in the primary, which leads Koch's advisers to believe that the mayor can't  attack the 61-year-old borough president with full vigor for fear of losing the  black vote in November's general election. U.S. Atty. Rudolph W. Giuliani, 44,  who is expected to win the Republican primary, will also appear on the  Independent and the Liberal Party ballots in an effort to make his candidacy  palatable to disaffected Democrats.  </P> <P> Instead of attacking Dinkins, the mayor has engaged Giuliani in political  combat whenever possible, hoping the perception will grow that Koch, not  Dinkins, is the only Democrat tough enough to defeat the former prosecutor.  </P> <P> At the same time, the mayor has been running commercials stressing his  achievements in minority neighborhoods. One set of commercials features black  and Latino residents praising the city's $5.1-billion effort designed to create  252,000 units of affordable housing -- the largest municipal building program  in the nation.  </P> <P> "It's still the second toughest job in America," the tag line proclaims,  attempting to tie together Koch's achievements with the oblique charge that  Dinkins is too weak to sit behind the mayor's desk at City Hall.  </P> <P> At the same time, Koch's advisers hope Richard Ravitch, a 55-year-old builder  and former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and city  Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin, 53, remain in the Democratic primary. Even  though both are polling in single digits, their endorsement of Dinkins, if they  dropped out of the race, could be devastating.  </P> <P> The mayor's advisers also hope that Dinkins will become the subject of  increasing media scrutiny. Dinkins failed to file federal, state and city  income tax returns for 1969 through 1972 -- which he admitted when he withdrew  as a potential candidate for deputy mayor in 1973.  </P></p>

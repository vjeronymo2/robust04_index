			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Militant deputies defy Yeltsin Russia's lower house of parliament yesterday failed to pass the 1994 budget at a third reading and came out strongly against President Boris Yeltsin's decree against crime as it 'seriously limits the constitutional rights and liberties of Russian citizens', writes John Lloyd in Moscow. The votes, together with a swell of protest against proposals from Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, leader of the upper house and an ally of Mr Yeltsin, to prolong the terms of both the parliament and the president by two years without election, marks a sudden militancy in a body which has been relatively restrained in its six-month life. The ground on which it is preparing to fight - that of the constitution - is similar to that on which Mr Yeltsin and the previous parliament divided and ultimately fought. The difference this time is that the constitution is Mr Yeltsin's creation. The vote on the budget, which had been expected to go through after two lower house readings in which it gained large majorities, followed its rejection by the upper house earlier this week. The upper house had demanded an increase in military spending.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Bank disappointed at rising inflation expectations The Bank of England is disappointed. Inflation on the government's underlying measure has fallen to its lowest level since the index was first compiled in 1975. But although the 12-month change in the retail prices index less mortgage interest payments was only 2.4 per cent in March - in the bottom half of the government's 1 per cent to 4 per cent target range - inflation expectations are rising in the UK. Wages are rising faster than expected and, as the chart shows, employees' expectations of inflation have been very slow to adjust to the sharp fall in retail price inflation since 1991. After jumping sharply in recent weeks, yields in the gilt-edged market are suggesting an inflation rate of above 4 per cent from 1996 to 2007. The Bank takes such expectations seriously. They 'affect behaviour, and an expectation of higher inflation can make it more difficult to achieve the combination of low inflation and output expansion permitted by the current growth of nominal demand', it says. It therefore peppers its latest quarterly inflation report with warnings that it may have to tighten monetary policy if matters get out of hand. 'Monetary policy will not validate inflation outside the target range,' it warns at one point. More explicitly, it notes that: 'If the private sector comes to expect higher inflation, this belief could cause employees and firms to push up earnings and prices even faster. A constant monetary stance would then imply the need for higher interest rates until inflation expectations were brought back into line.' It concludes the report by declaring that the public's belief in the inflation target 'must be reinforced by adherence to a firm monetary stance'. At present such warnings are a shot across the bows of wage bargainers, although they leave the clear impression that the Bank believes base rates in Britain have bottomed out. On the assumption of unchanged bank base rates of 5.25 per cent, the Bank still believes the most likely outcome for underlying inflation in two years' time is 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent. On the Bank's own favourite measure of retail price inflation less mortgage interest payments and local authority and indirect taxes, it expects inflation will be less than 3 per cent in two years' time. But the pick-up in the growth of underlying average earnings from 3 per cent in November to 3.5 per cent in February 'and possibly higher in March' worries the Bank, especially when 2.72m are still unemployed. 'It is puzzling that earnings should be increasing as fast as they are at this stage of the recovery, and it will be necessary to monitor labour market developments extremely carefully over the next few months,' it says. The Bank is also concerned that companies have not adjusted down their required rate of return from investment decisions to reflect lower inflation. Investment in Britain could be suffering as a result. The fast growth of narrow money which expanded by 6.2 per cent in the year to April is less of a worry. The Bank's current view is that the recent growth of M0 'has limited inflationary consequences' and can be explained in part as an adjustment to a new 'equilibrium growth rate' in the velocity of notes and coins in circulation. The Bank also sees little problem in the acceleration of the UK's economic growth rate to 'probably slightly above trend'. The output gap between current and potential full capacity production is narrowing 'but limits of capacity are still some way from constraining producers', it says. The report contains some good news for housebuyers. With the house price to earnings ratio at its lowest for a decade, it says house prices in London and the south-east are 'more affordable than ever'. Inflation Report, May 1994.

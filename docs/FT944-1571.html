			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / EU stalls on customs union with Turks Ankara's hopes of sealing a customs pact with the European Union look certain to remain unfulfilled before the end of the year after EU ministers last night raised concerns over human rights abuses against Turkey's Kurdish minority and Greece maintained its opposition to a formal deal. The customs union, which would open the European market to Turkey and bring its trading system into line with the EU's, is now unlikely to be signed until early next year. It is understood that Greece will not drop its opposition to the pact until a date has been set for the start of negotiations to bring Cyprus into the EU. This is expected next year, after the EU observer on Cyprus has produced a report outlining progress made in talks between the island's Greek and Turkish communities. In a separate development at the meeting in Brussels yesterday, foreign ministers gave their final approval to the Uruguay Round trade accord, plus legislation required to implement it. The 12 agreed to send the necessary papers  - which will be formally signed on Thursday  - to Geneva on December 30, by which time all member states should have ratified the package. France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Greece have still not completed ratification, but senior Commission officials are confident all the necessary documents will reach Geneva by the 30th. During the meeting  - the last foreign affairs council to be held under the German presidency  - EU ministers told their Turkish counterpart, Mr Murat Karayalcin, that they were concerned about the treatment of Turkey's Kurdish population, in particular the decision earlier this month to jail eight Kurdish MPs. However, they stressed that groundwork for the customs union had been agreed, with only the political issues of human rights and Greece's concerns over Cyprus standing in the way. Turkey is also due to receive Ecu600m (Pounds 472.2m) in financial aid from the EU, but this too has been blocked by Athens. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said it was extremely important to maintain a partnership with Turkey. 'Whether one thinks of the Balkans or the dialogue on human rights, or the Soviet Union, or the Middle East, or Cyprus, relations with Turkey are indispensable.' Against a background of noisy Kurdish demonstrations outside the Council building in Brussels, Mr Hurd defended Turkish efforts to improve their record on human rights. 'The Turks are taking quite substantial measures to legislate on human rights,' he said, adding that the rights cause would not be advanced 'one jot' by refusing a customs union. Ministers also gave their final approval to an international agreement to ban subsidies to European shipbuilders. This deal was completed after the French, in earlier talks, were given special exemptions to ensure that politically sensitive shipyards were protected.</p>

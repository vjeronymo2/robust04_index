			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Turkish threat to cut off Armenia: Nagorno-Karabakh conflict may extend beyond former Soviet borders TURKISH president Turgut Ozal yesterday threatened to block landlocked Armenia's export route to the Black Sea in an effort to 'scare the Armenians' into abandoning their fight for the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Mr Ozal, in an interview, stopped short of saying that troops from Turkey's army, the second largest in Nato, should be reinforced along the border with Armenia. However, he called on any Russian troops remaining in the disputed enclave to help keep the peace, or take their weapons with them when they left. Mr Ozal said he had information that the Nagorno Armenians were arming themselves from Russian depots. Nagorno-Karabakh is part of Azerbaijan, but its mainly Armenian population wants to be united with Armenia. The Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, forcing Turkey off the fence and on to Azerbaijan's side, threatens to extend the conflict beyond the borders of the former Soviet Union. The dispute also threatens to mar the prospect of peaceful Caucasian and central Asian co-operation developing around a diplomatically even-handed Turkey, which is the most successful capitalist state in the region. Mr Ozal said there was growing Turkish public feeling - which he clearly backs - that the government of prime minister Suleiman Demirel 'must do more' to help the Azerbaijanis, with whom Turks identify on cultural, linguistic and religious grounds. Mr Ozal's comments came as Azerbaijan's president Ayaz Mutalibov resigned after the nationalist opposition charged him with weakness in the conflict with Armenia. Mr Mutalibov agreed to go after an all-night siege of the parliament by thousands of angry demonstrators who claimed he had failed to defend Azerbaijani lives and territory in the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh. Last week at least 100 Azerbaijanis were killed by Armenian guerrillas fighting for control of Nagorno-Karabakh. Mr Mutalibov's resignation is likely to trigger an escalation of the already fierce fighting between Azerbaijani forces and Armenian guerrillas, and possibly a more isolationist stance within the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Azerbaijan has been a recalcitrant member of the CIS and its parliament may yet decide not to ratify membership of the fragile organisation. This could push Azerbaijan even closer to Turkey, which it sees as a model for a secular state. Mr Mutalibov's departure will also probably speed up moves to create an Azerbaijani army. One of the criticisms against him was his failure to set up quickly a republican army, as parliament had requested, to rebuff Armenian attacks. Mr Ozal expressed concern at Mr Mutalibov's resignation, describing him as 'quite a conciliatory man'. He said that he understood Mr Mutalibov's successors were 'hardliners'. Mr Ozal acknowledged he had told a business group earlier this week that the time had come to 'scare the Armenians a little'. An underlying element to these words is the fact that he and the prime minister, from different parties, have had difficulty co-habiting politically since last year's elections.

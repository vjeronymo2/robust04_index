			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Down Ridley road The first time I met Mr Nicholas Ridley was at a do organised by a company's public relations department - one of those functions that holds you up between leaving work and getting home. This was before the 1987 election, when he had just begun to settle in as environment secretary. His view of local government sounded appalling. As I remember it, we were to have fewer elected councils. Their powers would be circumscribed; their payrolls small. These truncated councils would be governed by feeble committees the size of an average company board. They would meet for an afternoon once a year to decide what had to be done, but they would not themselves provide services. The work would be contracted out - refuse collection to one company, street cleaning to another, housing to a housing association and so on. As we ate and listened, our imaginations soared. The great kingdom of the councils, with their endless meetings of committees of the retired, the civic-minded and the disgruntled would be eliminated, wiped from the map of Britain. Their direct labour workforces, their truculent dustmen, their unmanageable teachers and their rows of inefficient clerks would vanish from town hall payrolls. The public sector unions, so dependent upon the patronage of that kingdom, would be humbled. So-long Nupe. Toodle-oo Nalgo. Bye-bye National Union of Teachers. Four years have passed and so has Mr Ridley, but the vision persists. If you have given up on local democracy it sounds less appalling than it did on first airing, particularly as espoused by Mr Michael Heseltine in the House of Commons on Tuesday. The government was committed, said the environment secretary, 'to developing the concept of enabling authorities. Councils will increasingly be able to take advantage of competition between those seeking to provide a service'. The intention was to 'increase the momentum' of existing policies, 'to enable decision-making and responsibility to be more directly in the hands of the people'. You do not need an O-level in civil service-speak to understand what that means. The open competitive tendering now obligatory under Mr Ridley's local government act of 1988 will be extended: it is shown in one departmental sample study to have saved 17 per cent of refuse collectors and a quarter of the previous number of street cleaners, even where the work has remained in-house. But that is not all. The government will encourage the mass opting-out of secondary schools from local authority control after the next election - assuming that it wins. Who will oversee them? There are 4,900 secondary schools, more than could easily be handled by a national schools funding council. Yet I suspect that before long we will have one, from the government that gave us the university and polytechnic funding councils We imagined the great kingdom of the councils would be wiped out and recently announced a new quango to look after further education and sixth-form colleges. As to the 24,000 primary schools, some direct local governance will always be required - although by 1994 they will control their own budgets. The education departments of the local authorities could then be reduced to small agencies, with management devolved to school governors and heads. If the central government dictated the funding, as it surely will, Mr Ridley would be half way there. The arithmetic tells the story. Education accounts for just 48 per cent of local authority spending, and 37 per cent of local employees. It is managed by county councils, the upper-level authorities that both the Conservatives and Labour seek to abolish. What is left? Police and courts account for 16 per cent of expenditure; these are by custom usually treated as outside the direct oversight of most councils. Transport (9 per cent) is being steadily privatised, with more to come, and housing has either been sold off or prepared for governance by tenants or voluntary associations. That leaves something unfathomable called local environmental services (11.7 per cent) and social services (10.5 per cent), plus peanuts on libraries and the like. Mr Heseltine's vision is an improvement on Mr Ridley's. He talks up the enabling councils of the future as important local mobilising forces, able to make broad strategic decisions as he did on his famous visit to Liverpool. They would bring together business, voluntary organisations, local institutions like polytechnics and their own in-house expertise. They still sound like Mr Ridley's stripped-down headquarters boards to me, but they would meet more often and be taken more seriously in the Heseltine version. His next discussion paper, probably out next month, will argue the case for elected mayors or, alternatively, small directly-elected management boards, or, again, sub-committees of the main elected council. The essence is strong management, but delivery through contracts with others. The theology is less controversial than it was. The contract culture is a theme of the current issue of Marxism Today. The latest social policy paper from the Labour-inclined Institute of Public Policy Research (30-32 Southampton St, WC2E 7RA) has Bill Callaghan of the TUC asking: 'Do all public services have to be provided by direct labour or is there a role for the private and not-for-profit sectors?' The Labour party has not fully woken up to this: its latest policy paper promises fatter local government, fed by a broader tax base. Yet the slim enabling council vision has its attractions. The flaw in the government's version is that local finance is to be restricted to one highly-geared source, the new council tax, and capped. That is wholly in the Ridley spirit. While it prevails, Mr Heseltine's protestations of a belief in local autonomy are, in the prime minister's favourite epithet, bogus.</p>

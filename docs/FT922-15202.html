			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Danes lose out on illegal tax The Danish government will not repay to companies the revenue raised by a tax which on Tuesday was declared illegal by the European Court, Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, minister for taxation, said yesterday, Hilary Barnes writes from Copenhagen. But the government will waive payment of the tax for the fourth quarter of 1991, which falls due on April 20. The labour market tax has yielded about Kr55bn (Pounds 5bn) since 1987, a sum equal to more than 6 per cent of 1991 GDP.</p>

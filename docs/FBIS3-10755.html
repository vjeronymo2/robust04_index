			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santiago del Estero, 12 Mar (NA) -- Jose Zavalia,  the Radical Civic Union [UCR] party boss in Santiago del Estero,  last night headed a demonstration march that gathered little  support from La Banda to this city, to protest the federal  intervention headed by Juan Schiaretti and the Omnibus Law for  the rational use of provincial resources.    In contrast with other demonstrations sponsored by Zavalia,  on this occasion only about 1,500 people joined the radical  leader in his demand.    At approximately 2115 a caravan of about 1,000 people left  La  Banda toward the capital, reaching the highway at the entrance  to the capital at 2300, where 600 demonstrators were waiting,  and where Zavalia was the main speaker at the anti-government  demonstration.    Zavalia, who as usual participated in the rally mounted upon  his chestnut steed, said that with Schiaratti's trusteeship  "corruption continues" in Santiago del Estero.    It was explained that the demonstration was small because  the  unions plan to boycott the elections to be held on 10 April.    In another matter, Santiago del Estero provincial employees  have already solved part of their problem over back pay, which  was the reason for the outbreak of violence in this province  last December.    On that occasion demonstrators had surrounded Zavalia in his  house, and it even led to shots fired between Zavalia and the  demonstrators.    As to why so few people participated, those responsible for  the demonstration said that the reason was the "pressure" being  exerted on the public by the trusteeship.    Zavalia headed the demonstration riding his horse, followed  by about 100 buses contracted for the occasion, which were for  the most part filled only by UCR militants and sympathizers.    In any case, this first demonstration of power by the  Santiago del Estero radical forces in light of the upcoming  elections for Constituent Assembly members was not a very  convincing one for the UCR provincial leaders.</p>

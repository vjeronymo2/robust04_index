			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAY-BASHING IN THE RECORD INDUSTRY  </P> <P> It's become pretty clear that as long as the power structure in the United  States remains in the hands of the heterosexual males, prejudice against male  homosexuals will be tolerated, if not encouraged.  </P> <P> The way male homosexuals' increasingly vocal show of self-determination is  dealt with is the way totalitarian groups react: Government tacitly condones  discrimination by inaction, religion raises the Bible on high, and big business  (here the record industry) takes no responsibility for its product. Hey, we're  talking First Amendment rights here -- and making a buck.  </P> <P> BILL DELLIGAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

In the  course of Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to the  United States from February 13-17 "the parties did not even  raise this issue," Zhukeyev reported in his interview with  Interfax on Thursday.    The adviser voiced this statement due to the assertions of  the Iranian admiral Ali Shamakhin who declared in his interview  with the Tehran newspaper Dzhumkhurne Islami early this week  that Kazakhstan invites the Americans to ensure an American  military presence on the Caspian Sea.    Zhukeyev underlined that Kazakhstan does not plan to bring  about the presence of American naval forces or involvement of  Americans as military advisers on the Caspian Sea. At the same  time he did not rule out the possibility that the republic's  leadership would address the United States for consultation  concerning creation of Kazakhstan's coast guard service on the  Caspian Sea. "Americans have great experience in this sphere and  currently Kazakhstan faces these problems with respect to the  Caspian Sea," said Zhukeyev.    The state adviser also reported that at present, the Kazakh  and Russian governments are defining plans to jointly guard CIS  sea border on the Caspian Sea.</p>

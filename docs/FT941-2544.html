			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Arts: Greedy for antiquities - Antony Thorncroft discusses the need for the treasure trove bill Some time, around 200 BC on Salisbury Plain, a local Celt buried over 400 of his most precious objects. They consisted of shields, axes and daggers, but probably had a religious rather than a military significance. For many of the pieces were ancient to him, dating back to 1800 BC, and too tiny and brittle for warfare. In 1985 some metal detector enthusiasts came across the hoard. If they had acted legally and gone to the local landowner, they would have become rich and the nation would have gained access to an archaeological site of great importance, perhaps a temple which held our ancestors in thrall for over a millennium. Instead they photographed the objects and went to the dealers in antiquities. And once more the the nation's feeble attempts to conserve its past was in jeopardy. Now some of the objects are in the US and Japan; some have disappeared; many, fortunately, are in the British Museum; and the police are conducting an investigation into the affair. This find was so important that it was almost certain to attract attention. In this case a reputable dealer, Lord McAlpine, sold some of the objects to the British Museum for Pounds 55,000. The tiny shields aroused interest and, as more came to light, the Museum made contact with the original finders, saw the photographs, and realised the importance of the discovery. There is still much to sort out, but if the standard procedures had been followed, and the cache reported to the British Museum, the metal detector enthusiasts - and the landowner - would have shared a substantial sum. Instead, it was the dealers who did well out of the find. A new treasure bill, put forward by the British Museum and the Surrey Archaeological Society, has now started its laborious progress towards the statute books - and about time, too. The law of treasure trove, dating back to the Middle Ages and created to ensure that the monarch grabbed any hidden gold and silver, bore no relation to modern reality and gave limited incentive to finders of hidden treasures to declare them. The British Museum reckons that hundreds of thousands of objects are discovered each year, but no more than 20 or 30 finds are declared treasure trove and channelled towards a museum. Over the years the losses have been tragic. In 1990 a hoard of Iron Age torcs, bracelets and ingots was discovered at Snettisham in Norfolk, but because some of the objects were 50 per cent or more base metal only a few of higher purity qualified as treasure trove and were kept together. In 1986, the Middleham Jewel, a late 15th century reliquary, unearthed in a field in Yorkshire, was sold at Sotheby's for Pounds 1.43m because it could not be proved that it had been hidden by its original owner, which would have made it treasure trove, rather than lost. Fortunately it was acquired by the Yorkshire Museum. In law even the Sutton Hoo burial ship, the greatest ever Anglo Saxon find, was not treasure trove, and only the generosity of the landowner enabled it to end up in the British Museum. It is the same with the Salisbury Plain discovery: it contains no objects of gold and silver and is not covered by either old treasure trove - or the new treasure bill, although this does contain a clause leaving open the opportunity to extend its scope. This is one reason why the Department of National Heritage was suspicious of the bill and wanted to substitute its own measure - in time. If it became too comprehensive it would involve the recording of every find, at considerable cost in staff and resources. But this week the government acknowledged the importance of the issue and seemed set to back some form of legislation. Under the new law proposed by the BM it would no longer be necessary to establish the original owners intentions, and objects other than gold and silver will be be given more protection. There will also be a tightening of the legal process in the reporting of finds. But while there are treasure seekers, with detectors, supplying some unscrupulous dealers, the nation's heritage will be still be pillaged. Attention must be focused on dealers, and the auction houses, which have been accused of offering antiquities for sale without adequately researching their provenance. The auction houses say the problem is much exaggerated and and that photographs in their catalogues can lead to the uncovering of stolen antiquities. Joe Och, of Sotheby's, sits in the treasure trove reviewing committee which values finds legally reported, and believes that 'this is an emotional subject, like fur coats. We operate a free system in the UK which offers rewards rather than penalties.' Undoubtedly more finds are reported in the UK than in most European countries. In Italy, Greece, and Turkey, prohibitive restrictions on the ownership of recovered objects ensures that most finds are sold illegally. Important objects, turning up out of the blue, attract attention. When some distinctive Roman bronzes, discovered and spirited away from a farm at Icklingham in Suffolk, surfaced in New York, the landowner forced the new owner to promise to leave them to the British Museum in his will, guaranteeing some belated justice. There is also Lord Northampton, who paid a group of dealers millions for the Sevso treasure, the finest hoard of late classical silver ever to surface. When he tried to sell it through Sotheby's in 1990 for at least Pounds 40m, Croatia, Hungary and Lebanon all claimed it had been dug up on their land and belonged to them. Lord Northampton won the legal wrangle in New York but there has been an appeal and the silver still languishes in a bank vault. Such examples, and the sensibly modest improvements contained in the treasure bill, could help return antiquities to the antiquarians and the archaeologists and remove them from the grasp of opportunists.</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Slow recovery has compensations - Keynote / But the stock market, like the economy, is a more dangerous place than it seems HOW MUCH are we willing to pay for security in our investments? As the markets rose and became still riskier in the third quarter of the year, the question became more urgent for personal investors. A different kind of safety has also become a pressing issue for occupational pension schemes, culminating in the publication of the Goode Report on pension law reform last month. For individual savers the big challenge continues to be the shift of emphasis from nice, safe income to more ephemeral capital gains. True, short-term interest rates have not fallen since last January in the UK, but the possibility of a cut keeps re-emerging: Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer, let go his chance of a rate to coincide with the Conservative Party conference earlier this month, but he will have another opportunity around Budget Day, November 30. Meanwhile, long-term interest rates are slipping consistently. The yield on long-dated government securities slid from 8.1 per cent to 7.3 per cent during the quarter. The yield on equities also fell, but not so rapidly. When yields decline in the securities markets, investors are compensated by the capital gains that are the reverse side of the coin. But the higher that the markets rise, the greater the natural fear that one day the process will go into reverse. The July-September period, however, was a time for greed rather than fear. Although European politicians generally had a bad and embarrassing summer as the European Monetary System crumbled around them, investors could relax on the beach contentedly. Perhaps the sunshine was erratic, but generally the financial markets were set fair. London share prices entered new high ground in August, hitting a peak on the 27th. It seemed that the deputy fund managers were a little over-enthusiastic, though. When their bosses returned at the beginning of September the market cooled off. Still, the FT-SE 100 Index showed a gain of 4.7 per cent for the three months, its best quarterly showing of 1993 so far. Once again, however, the big blue-chips dragged their feet, with disappointing results coming from the likes of Tesco, Guinness and P&amp;O. Fearsome levels of competition hit many of the consumer sectors, dashing hopes that companies would be able to put up prices and restore their profit margins as the recession came to an end and economic recovery began. Forecasters have been polishing up their numbers for the UK economy in 1993. It now looks as though GDP growth may hit nearer 2 per cent than the 1-1 1/2 per cent expected earlier. Yet this is still far from the vigorous bounce-back from recession that was once typical of the UK's economic cycle. No sooner had the motor industry celebrated a year-on-year rise of 18 per cent in 'K' car registrations in August than a series of announcements of autumn production cutbacks came out, because Continental demand had slumped. In the US, too, where the recovery has being going on longer, its strength is still rather disappointing and erratic. A slow but steady recovery has its compensations. It makes for low volatility and a stable trend in the securities markets. To make their fortunes in 1993, investors have had to chase risky recoveries in the advanced countries (in Italy, say) and hair-raising booms in the developing world. Nearer home the rewards have been more meagre, but it has been easy to sleep at night. The world now looks quite a deflationary place, at least as far as the advanced economies are concerned. They are flooded with cheap imported goods from the Far East, holding prices down, and high levels of unemployment are keeping pay inflation under tight control. On the one hand, this is excellent news for the bond markets, subject only to the fear that too many governments maybe unable to restrain their budget deficits in the recession. Low levels of interest rates and inflation are also positive for equities. However, if companies are unable to generate at least a modicum of profits growth and dividend expansion, equities may at some point look dangerously ahead of the game. Up to the end of the third quarter, most of the recent trends remained intact. In particular, small companies continued to outperform, with the FT-Actuaries SmallCap Index running 2 1/2 percentage points ahead of the Footsie during the three months (and 23 per cent ahead after nine months of the year). The small-company theme is becoming ever more mature, however, and the average p/e ratio of the constituents of the SmallCap has risen to an awesome 35. That looks more like Tokyo than London. Such ratings are, not surprisingly, attracting dozens of new listings as entrepreneurs and management buy-out teams seek to cash in. Can an investment in Tiddler plc or Titchy plc pay off at these prices? The argument runs: first, there is a recovery and those companies that have survived the recession are lean and fit; and second, small companies usually operate nimbly in niche markets, whereas too many big companies are painfully exposed to overcapacity. Food retailing, for instance, has been the latest to be devastated by the fear of over-expansion: the sector index underperformed by 17 per cent in the third quarter, and the sector now offers a market average dividend yield. Much the same, for slightly different reasons, has happened to the pharmaceuticals sector. The stock market, like the economy at large, is therefore a rather more dangerous place than it appears to be on the surface, where the indices have shown a fairly steady trend. There is churning and upheaval  - the experts call it sector rotation  - and you should not take it too much for granted that whatever stocks did well in the third quarter will still be the stars of your portfolio by Christmas. As for the pension schemes, they face the consequences of the discovery that Robert Maxwell had apparently stolen over Pounds 400m from the pension schemes in his various companies in the months before he was found dead in the sea just about two years ago. The Goode Committee has recommended the setting-up of a new pensions regulator, and the introduction of a minimum solvency standard to ensure that schemes can meet their obligations if their sponsoring company suddenly goes bust. A compensation scheme will bail out victims if there is fraud or misconduct. The catch is that a watertight system is expensive to run, and it is much cheaper to leave some loopholes. When companies failed to protest vigorously at the impositions of the Goode Report, there were bound to be suspicions that the committee had bent too far towards compromise. The government still has to respond. But in pension schemes any degree of risk at all is surely unacceptable.</p>

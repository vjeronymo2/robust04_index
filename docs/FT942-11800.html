			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Observer: Nom de plume Citroen's UK subsidiary is having a spot of bother with the parent company's brainwaves on the vehicle naming front. With scant regard for prime minister Edouard Balladur's campaign to defend the purity of the French language, Citroen is calling its latest two-and-a-half tonne van the Citroen Jumper. Company executives mutter obliquely about 'Jolly Jumper' being the name of the horse belonging to 'Lucky Luke', some cartoon figure. But the company's UK management is less than taken with calling a vehicle after a woolly garment that may be comfortable but tends to be familiar, old, tired . . . So it has plumped for Relay instead. That still leaves the new multi-purpose vehicle - a competitor for Renault's Espace - that the big bosses are christening the Citroen Evasion. The French connotations may be of escape and adventure, but Pierre Boisjoly, managing director of Citroen UK, reckons the Brits will think of tax evasion. Anyone care to help him out?</p>

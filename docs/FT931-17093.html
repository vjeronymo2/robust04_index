			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Pounds 268m ITN contract just makes deadline A FIVE-YEAR news contract for Independent Television News, worth a total of Pounds 268m, was finally signed on New Year's Eve after a year of negotiation. Two of the new ITV broadcasters, Meridian and Westcountry, held out for better terms almost to the last moment. Lord Hollick's Meridian Broadcasting, which has replaced TVS as the ITV company for the south and south-east of England, was last to sign late on Thursday afternoon. If Meridian had not signed a new supply agreement before midnight, it would technically have been in breach of its licence because it could not have provided a quality national and international news service. ITN was determined to supply a news service only to those companies which had signed the five-year agreement before the new year. The brinkmanship arose because of the suspicion among ITV companies which will not be ITN shareholders, that the Pounds 53.6m per annum deal might lead to large profits for the seven companies which will own ITN in future. Five companies will each have 18 per cent; they are Carlton Communications, London Weekend Television, Central Television, Granada and Reuters, the international information group. Scottish Television and Anglia Television will each have 5 per cent. A group of rebels including HTV, Yorkshire-Counties, Westcountry and Meridian wanted an open-ended review of the contract after two years, in case costs were dramatically cut at the news organisation and ITN was making large profits for its new shareholders. The Carlton-led negotiators opposed this on the grounds that it would have amounted to a break in the contract and a renegotiation. Instead stiff conditions have been set before a review is triggered involving a precise definition of excessive profits on capital employed. A review is now only likely if there is a fundamental change in ITN's costs and the way it does its job. The final signing of the agreement means that the reconstruction of ITN and the move to a tighter group of owners will now go ahead. Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton, is expected to become the new chairman of ITN in succession to Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames Television which gave way to Carlton Television as the London weekday ITV company at midnight on New Year's eve. One of the first problems the new ITN shareholders will have to solve is a potential annual deficit of Pounds 5m on its lease costs because of unlet space in the company's London headquarters.</p>

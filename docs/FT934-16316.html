			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Lilley to cut housing for foreign 'scroungers' CURBING the availability of council housing was a better way of combating the breakdown of the family than changing the welfare system, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, signalled yesterday. In a populist speech, featuring pledges to cut down the social security benefits available to foreigners and to tighten up ways of preventing fraud, Mr Lilley highlighted spending on lone parents as one of the three fastest-rising areas of social security expenditure. Today Sir George Young, the housing minister, is expected to announce a review of the legislation which imposes on councils an automatic duty to provide accommodation for people defined as 'homeless'. Most ministers believe that restricting entitlement to council housing by tightening that definition is more likely to have an impact on the numbers of lone parents, than making changes to income-related benefits. In contrast to Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, who used a fringe meeting on Tuesday to float the idea of limiting the benefits available in respect of second or later children, Mr Lilley said ministers were conscious that social security benefits did not have much to do with the growth of lone parenthood. He made only a passing reference to one of the most controversial issues at the conference this week - compensation for those most affected by the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. However a speaker during the debate was warmly applauded for urging ministers to address the plight of pensioners who were only just disqualified from income-related benefits. Instead, Mr Lilley won an enthusiastic reception by devoting much of his speech to cutting back on the benefits for which non-UK citizens are eligible. From next spring, housing benefit will no longer be available to foreign claimants. There are also plans to impose a residency qualification of some months on EC nationals claiming benefits in the UK. The restriction on housing benefit is estimated to save Pounds 50m. 'We have all too many home-grown scroungers,' Mr Lilley said, 'but it's beyond the pale when foreigners come here expecting our handouts'. He added that since other EC countries insisted on a period of residence before benefits became available, he foresaw no difficulties in changing the UK's rules to introduce one, but added that the 'legal niceties' were still being dealt with. In a speech clearly directed at the right of the party, he linked the UK's improved economic performance with sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism, and argued that the worst aspect of the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty would have been the way it would 'surrender control over our laws'. Mr Lilley also announced new measures intended to contribute to saving up to Pounds 1bn by to tackling fraud. Housing benefit administration will be reformed, and there will be greater use of new technology to prevent duplicate or false claims.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Clinton meets Rushdie Mr Salman Rushdie, the British author, yesterday met President Bill Clinton in what the White House described as a clear expression of US support for 'someone who has been the victim of a government-legitimised death threat', Jurek Martin writes from Washington. The meeting, according to US officials, was at the request of Mr Rushdie, who is under a 'fatwah' issued by the late Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran over his book The Satanic Verses - considered blasphemous by Islamic fundamentalists. Afterwards Mr Rushdie said he was 'touched and impressed by his (Mr Clinton's) expressions of support and friendship.' The White House said he spent about 10 minutes with the president, after longer conversations with Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, and Mr Anthony Lake, the national security adviser. US policy under Mr Clinton has been increasingly critical of the regime in Tehran, not least because of its alleged sponsorship of terrorism. Reuter adds: The State Department, in advice issued through the US embassy in Wellington, New Zealand, has warned US citizens abroad to be on the alert for 'terrorist or mob action' following President Clinton's meeting with Mr Rushdie.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Polish economy declines despite private growth THE state-dominated Polish economy declined sharply again last year despite rapid growth in the private sector. The annual report from the state statistical office (GUS) showed an estimated 8-10 per cent decline in gross domestic product (GDP) and an 8 per cent fall in investment. It also recorded a near doubling of unemployment to 11.4 per cent of the labour force and sharply lower inflation of 60.4 per cent. Industry showed the sharpest decline with an 11.9 per cent drop in sales, following a 24 per cent collapse in 1990, while construction lagged 6.8 per cent from a similarly low base and farm output dropped 2 per cent. In dollar terms, exports grew by 18 per cent from 1990's record level to Dollars 14.21bn (Pounds 8bn) while imports, boosted partly by higher Soviet oil prices, rose 72 per cent to Dollars 14.24bn. Sharply rising imports eliminated the Dollars 3.4bn hard currency surplus which Poland built up in 1990 following the introduction of its stabilisation plan and internal zloty convertibility. The private sector accounted for 20 per cent of total exports but 46 per cent of imports last year, reflecting the rapid growth in privatised trade and retailing. At the same time output of privatised industry rose 48.6 per cent from a low base while output in the state sector declined 19.5 per cent. The private sector, outside the already 80 per cent privatised farming area, now employs 25 per cent of the Polish employed labour force against 62 per cent in the state sector. Co-operatives employ the balance. Rising unemployment and a sharp increase in disability and other pensions, however, reflect a sharp overall contraction in job opportunities. Last year the number of pensioners rose from 7.55m to 8.31m, a form of disguised unemployment which has added to budgetary pressures.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rises on evidence of strong economic data The US currency continued its good showing on the foreign exchanges yesterday, buoyed by the expectation of further interest rate rises, writes Philip Gawith. A raft of strong economic data on income, spending and prices lent fuel to those expecting the Federal Reserve to tighten policy again sooner rather than later. The dollar rose to DM1.5770 in European trading, before slipping back to close in London at DM1.5722, up from DM1.5703 on Wednesday. Against the yen it finished at Y99.34, from Y98.95. New York trading ended with the dollar at DM1.5735 and Y99.345. Sterling also had a good day, with the trade weighted index closing at 80.4, from 80.2. The pound was little changed against the dollar, at Dollars 1.5672, but ended higher at DM2.4639, from DM2.4578. Both US and UK interest rate futures have lost ground steadily this week, discounting ever higher interest rates. Elsewhere the D-Mark remained fairly weak, with the prospect of a further cut in interest rates still not ruled out. Mr Helmut Schieber, a Bundesbank director, said on Wednesday that it was harder to foresee a situation where German rates could rise than one where they could fall. The Italian lira firmed to L1,028 against the D-Mark from L1,031 after a pensions deal between the government and unions saw a planned general strike called off. The Australian and New Zealand dollars both continued their recent strength against the US dollar. The 'Aussie' finished at 76.82 US cents, after breaking above 77 cents for the first time since March 1992 in Asian trading. The 'Kiwi' closed at 63 US cents, a level not seen in five years. The behaviour of Eurodollar contracts in recent days and weeks tells the story of what markets are expecting for US interest rates. The futures curve is now discounting three-month rates of 7 per cent in March, 40 basis points higher than the position at the beginning of the week. While the prospect of higher interest rates is hitting the bond market, it appears to be supporting the dollar. For most of the year, the two markets traded in tandem. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan, commented: 'Now that the interest rate environment is more credible, the dollar is looking forward to rate hikes.' Today the focus will be on November US jobs data. A higher than expected outcome could prompt renewed speculation that the Federal Reserve might again decide to raise rates after its next policy meeting on December 20. 'Whereas in the past that would have been negative for the dollar, I think it could be positive now,' added Mr Gunner. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS in London, said there was a lot of interest to buy the dollar, although this was still limited mostly to short-term interbank traders. Pointing out that the dollar had risen from DM1.5077 at the end of October, to around DM1.57 now, he said: 'The market is coming to terms with the fact that the Fed is prepared to act if the economy is growing at an unsustainable rate.' Further evidence of Fed concern about the pace of growth came from Ms Cathy Minehan, president of the Boston Fed, who said that a tight economy could prompt price pressures. She added that the economy was 'humming along', showing 'very strong growth'. Sterling is also riding higher on the expectation of a rise in interest rates, buoyed too by the UK's sound economic fundamentals, underlined this week in the Budget. It has also been helped by the possibility of German rates falling. The March short sterling contract settled 10 basis points lower at 92.82. Analysts said the market remained very nervous about the prospect of higher interest rates, with speculation that if rates did not rise by 50 basis points next month, a 75 basis-point increase might be required early in the new year. Although Mr John Major's government has shaken off some of its recent woes, analysts said lingering political uncertainty would make it difficult for the pound to rise above DM2.47. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 415m of late assistance, and Pounds 123m at established rates, after forecasting a daily shortage of Pounds 650m. Three-month LIBOR stayed at 6 1/4 per cent.</p>

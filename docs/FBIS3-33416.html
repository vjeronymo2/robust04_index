			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] General Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, chief of the  Honduran Armed Forces, did not conceal his displeasure yesterday  with questions by certain reporters, whom he accused of reliving  the era of "witch hunts" and of allowing themselves to be used  for political purposes.    Discua Elvir arrived late in the afternoon at the Foreign  Ministry's "Jose Cecilio del Valle" Building to attend an  interview with representatives from the Organization of  Northwest Atlantic Fisheries who have filed a complaint against  Honduras for the incursion of Honduran-flagged ships in other  states' waters.    When he arrived at the Foreign Ministry, Gen. Discua Elvir  answered the reporters' questions quite politely, but when they  asked about the fisheries problem he said: "We have always had  problems with unauthorized boats and complaints of illegal  fishing."    Nevertheless, when asked questions he did not like Gen.  Discua Elvir became visibly annoyed, especially when they  involved Colonel Alvaro Antonio Romero Salgado, his schoolmate  from the sixth graduating class at the "General Francisco  Morazan" Military School. Romero was recently recommended by  President Carlos Roberto Reina for the post of commander of the  Presidential Honor Guard; furthermore, the president himself  hinted that Romero would be promoted to general in order to  occupy the post.    Gen. Discua downplayed the importance of the honor guard  chief's appointment, arguing that "he is an officer like any  other officer and that such changes are normal. Any Tom, Dick,  or Harry could hold the post; it is totally unimportant," he  stressed. "I repeat, I do not know what you intend to  accomplish with questions like these," he said in an angry  voice, thereby casting doubt on Col. Romero's promotion by the  National Congress. "If it materializes it will be just another  promotion," he said.</p>

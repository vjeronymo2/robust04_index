			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - France (8): Tomorrow will be better - Prospects for the stock market JEAN-FRANCOIS Theodore is a confident man. The president of the Societe des Bourses Francaises leans back in one of the black leather chairs in his rue Cambon office and oozes optimism about the prospects for the French stock market. 'Everything is in place,' he says. 'The necessary reforms have been made. We have one of the world's most sophisticated computer systems. There is legislation in the pipeline - privatisation and pension reform - which will bring more business to the market and we're ready for it.' The same confidence is voiced by almost everyone associated with the French stock markets. All are convinced that, over the long term, the gradual privatisation of France's big state-controlled companies, coupled with the creation of a new breed of private pension funds, will stimulate the investment sector. This rosy scenario is rather different from the present picture. In the 1980s the French stock markets underwent a period of radical reform in an attempt to prepare them for life in the intensely competitive markets of the 1990s. The reforms may have succeeded in modernising the mechanics of the Paris markets. They also created the successful MATIF futures market which is now one of the largest worldwide. But many of the stock markets' traditional problems persist. The new rules on block trading, transactions in large amounts of shares, are so tight that Paris has continued to lose business to London. Moreover Paris still suffers from its old problem of poor liquidity. The French government's influence over industry, which means that 20 per cent of output comes from state-controlled companies, has created a dearth of equity. This problem has been aggravated by the anachronistic ownership structure of France's private sector companies, where large chunks of stock are held by friendly banks and 'sweetheart' shareholders. The state's stranglehold over the pension system means that pension funds represent just 10 per cent of the Paris stock market, compared with 60 per cent in London, thereby creating a shortage of investment. This lack of liquidity has also contributed to the financial problems of the Paris stockbrokers. The 55 French broking firms made collective losses of FFr600m in 1991, according to the Association Francaise des Societes de la Bourse, a slight improvement on their combined deficit of FFr666m in 1990. This scenario has already catalysed a rash of cost cutting. There were 480 job losses across French broking last year, according to the AFSB, with the workforce shrinking from 5,340 to 4,860. Most practitioners maintain that there are still too many companies chasing too little business. Mr Theodore is convinced that the industry has reached the bottom of the cycle and that conditions can now only improve. 'It's just not true that there are too many players on the Paris market,' he said. 'There are 45 stockbrokers in Paris and 580 in New York, but the New York market is only 10 times bigger than Paris.' The global securities groups seem to agree. In recent months a number of international names have opened or extended their banking or broking operations in Paris, including Kleinwort Benson and Baring Brothers of the UK, Morgan Stanley of the US and Japan's Nomura. These companies are pinning their hopes on the long-term prospects for the Paris market. One reason for their confidence is the sustained support of France's socialist government. Throughout the 1980s the government, spearheaded by Mr Beregovoy, squashed every stereotype about socialist opposition to the investment sector by championing the modernisation of the Paris markets. One of the few areas where the government has not been as supportive as the brokers wished is in its failure to abolish the bourse tax on share transactions which, they claim, puts them at a major disadvantage to London, particularly for large transactions. The proposed reform of the rules on block trading has been put on ice until its abolition. However, the markets are really much more interested in the prospect of privatisation and pension reform which, they believe, will also accelerate after the elections, whichever political party wins. 'The Paris stock market has already made a lot of progress,' says Mr Jean Saint-Geours, president of the Commission des Operations de Bourse. 'It is not as international as London, but it has the potential to become one of the main European markets as part of a network with Frankfurt, Milan and Madrid.'</p>

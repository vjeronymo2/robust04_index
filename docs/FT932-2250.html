			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Tin prices rally from 20-year lows THE TIN market yesterday continued its dogged recovery from the 20-year lows reached earlier in the week. The three months position on the London Metal Exchange, which in after hours dealings on Tuesday had dipped to Dollars 5,067.50 a tonne, closed yesterday at Dollars 5,240 a tonne, up Dollars 97.50 on the day and Dollars 10 on the week. Dealers described the stronger performance in the second half of the week as a 'corrective bounce'. But they said sentiment was still shaky as market was awaiting the rise in arrivals that had been signalled by an evident slackening in the resolve of members of the Association of Tin Producing Countries to continue their efforts to bolster the market through export restraint. ATPC members, who account for some 60 per cent of world tin production, have been disheartened to see their self-denying policy undermined by increased exports from China, which is not a member of the association, and by the emergence of Russia, previously a small net importer of tin, as a net exporter. 'There is now widespread frustration among members of the ATPC at the futility of the export scheme,' said Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group. 'The feeling is growing that export curbs should be scrapped and everyone should go out there and produce and export all they can.' That would push prices down to a level where higher-cost producers would be forced out of production. Other LME metals were also higher on the week. The biggest rise was in the copper market, where the three months position recovered Pounds 38 of last week's Pounds 54 fall to close yesterday at Pounds 1,246.25 a tonne. Aided by a narrowing of premiums on forward deliveries and caution ahead of the expiry of US and Chilean labour contracts at the end of this month, the price broke overhead resistance at the equivalent of Dollars 1,850 a tonne in midweek. A fresh resistance area was encountered around Dollars 1,870, however, and yesterday's closing price was near the Dollars 1,850-a-tonne mark. The aluminium market's three-week rise was halted on Monday, when the three months price fell Dollars 11.25 to Dollars 1,171.25 a tonne. But most of the fall was quickly recouped and a Dollars 29.50 rise yesterday left the price Dollars 22.25 up on the week at Dollars 1,204.75 a tonne. Dealers noted that yesterday's price rise came despite the announcement of the biggest rise for some time in LME aluminium stocks. But they explained that the 50,500-tonnes rise, which took the total to a fresh record of 1,868,925 tonnes, probably reflected the arrival of Russian material delayed by bureacratic problems and the registration of new compound and warehouse areas in Antwerp. In contrast LME stock movements provided support for the nickel market. After the announcement of a third successive fall the three months price gained Dollars 15 yesterday to end Dollars 7.50 up on the week at Dollars 5,625 a tonne. Traders suggested that the stocks downturn mainly reflected delays in Russian shipments. But Mr Nick, analyst at Ord Minnett, said he was nevertheless encouraged by the prospect that June might see a net monthly outflow from LME nickel stocks, which would be the first since November 1991. He also noted, in Ord's Daily Metal Market Monitor, that the economy was recovering in Japan, the biggest nickel consumer, and that sales from the former eastern bloc were running lower. 'The nickel price will not recover until LME stocks start to be eroded,' Mr Moore said. 'Perhaps this is not too far away.' The gold market began the week by crashing through the Dollars 370-a-troy-ounce support level that had been so stoutly defended during the previous week. But after shedding Dollars 7.20 to Dollars 363.95 on Monday the price began a steady recovery that saw it back at square one by Thursday's close. At yesterday's close it was Dollars 372.25 an ounce, up Dollars 1.10 on the week. This was seen as a reasonably constructive performance in view of the dollar's strength and signs of an easing in inflationary pressure in the US. Lacking any clear direction of its own, the platinum price followed gold's early fall, reaching Dollars 376.35 an ounce on Tuesday. But it lagged behind in the subsequent upturn and ended the week Dollars 7.75 down on balance at Dollars 379 an ounce. Platinum continued to be outshone by its sister metal, palladium, used mainly by the dentistry and electronics sectors and as a motor exhaust catalyst. Continuing supply tightness, good physical demand and bullish chart patterns combined to push the metal's price to a 38-month high of Dollars 129 an ounce at yesterday's morning fixing. It fell back in the afternoon to Dollars 127.90, up 90 cents on the week, but traders were still talking of Dollars 130 an ounce as the short term target, with Dollars 140 possible in the medium term. London's coffee and cocoa futures markets put in stronger performances. The former was aided yesterday by news of Brazilian private sector proposals for a production retention scheme, while the latter succeeded at last in breaking through the Pounds 700 barrier. September coffee position closed at Dollars 929, up Dollars 25 on the week, and September cocoa at Pounds 715 a tonne, up Pounds 35. In Chicago soyabean traders responded to growing concern about rain-induced US planting delays by pushing new crop November futures up to Dollars 6.05 a bushel in late trading yesterday, up 24 cents on the week.  ----------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ----------------------------------- Aluminium    +50,400  to  1,868,925 Copper       +6,250   to  449,375 Lead         -200     to  258,975 Nickel       -2,598   to  90,492 Zinc         +2,550   to  677,675 Tin          +165     to  20,200  -----------------------------------</p>

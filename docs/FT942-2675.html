			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (33): Group F - Fixtures and facts Group Fixtures Sunday, June 19 - Belgium v Morocco 12:30 local (16:30 GMT) Orlando - Citrus Bowl Monday, June 20 - Netherlands v Saudi Arabia - 19:30 local (23:30 GMT) Washington - RFK Stadium Saturday, June 25 - Saudi Arabia v Morocco 12:30 local (16:30 GMT) New York - Giants stadium Saturday, June 25 - Belgium v Netherlands - 12:30 local (16:30 GMT) Orlando - Citrus Bowl Wednesday, June 29 - Morocco v Netherlands - 12:30 local (16:30 GMT) Orlando - Citrus Bowl Wednesday, June 29 - Belgium v Saudi Arabia - 12:30 local (16:30 GMT) Washington - RFK Stadium Star Player: Vincenzo Scifo Country: Belgium Club: Monaco - (also: Anderlecht, Torino, Auxerre, Bordeaux) Age: 28 Scifo the prodigy is now in his prime. He played in his first World Cup in Mexico at 20. His club form has often been inconsistent but in the 1990 World Cup he was often masterful. In Bologna he gave Paul Gascoigne a two-hour lesson in midfield play before Gazza's long punt forward created Platt's miraculous late winner. He is an excellent passer of the ball but he can also beat a player and shoot from long distance. His neat, unspectacular style often serves to disguise his gifts but, in a World Cup rather short of old fashioned playmakers, he will be well worth watching. Key Game: Belgium v Netherlands (June 25 - Orlando) This is high noon for the low countries. The Dutch are unhappy about having to play twice at mid-day in central Florida in June. The Dutch know that the heat will give Morocco their best hope of victory in the final group match. Even so, and in spite of the heat and humidity, the match offers the two teams the only true chance to test their pretensions against serious opposition before the demanding matches of the later rounds. - A victory for either team here will secure a place in the second round - assuming both sides win comfortably against Saudi Arabia - and will also go some way to appeasing fans at home regardless of what happens next: the shape of the draw means both the winner and runner-up in this group will face difficult second round matches.</p>

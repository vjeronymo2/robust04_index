			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Mr. Zatulin Said What He Said, and the NG </F> Reporter Did Not Distort Anything"]    [Text] On 11 May 1994 NG [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] published a  letter by Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State Duma  committee on CIS affairs. In it he accuses NG observer Igor  Rotar of deliberately distorting his words (5 May 1994). The  letter was written with a fair amount of emotion, and contains  no specific examples of distortions of direct speech.  Nonetheless, in our day when the editors have tape recordings of  the text, we can state that the text published in NG corresponds  to the original almost perfectly. Mr. Zatulin himself can  confirm this by dropping in at the editorial offices.    We will also present refutations of those of Mr. Zatulin's  accusations which, stretching the point, could be called  concrete.    1. "I categorically object to the fact that I. Rotar, who  acted as guide and interpreter for his Japanese guest at the  meeting one and one-half months ago, has gathered intelligence  at my expense, juggling a text that I have never seen."    At the start of the conversation Igor Rotar introduced  himself to Mr. Zatulin as an NG reporter. The chairman of the  Duma committee also "forgot" that most of the questions were  asked by the NG reporter, not the Japanese political scientist.    The conversation took place in Russian; during the 90 minute  interview not a single word was spoken in English or Japanese.    2. "It might also be noted that the word satellite in modern  Russian philology has a deprecatory meaning, which the word ally  does not at all, and the author of the work should certainly be  aware of this."    Here is Mr. Zatulin's exact text: "By this I mean to say,  with all respect to the current status of these states (the CIS  countries--NG), many of them, they are doomed either to a very  close alliance, to the role of satellite, or to extinction."    Zatulin: "I leave on his (I. Rotar's) conscience my  'revelations' of the type: 'A little country should be happy  when it is in the sphere of influence of a large state,' and  also the abundance of military field terminology ('conquer,'  'die,' and so on)."    The word "conquer" is found one time in Mr. Zatulin's  interview in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. Zatulin's exact words are:  "Abkhazia cannot conquer Georgia without someone's support." The  word "die" also occurs one time, in the chairman of the Duma  committee's above-cited passage about satellite states.    It is true that the phrase, "A little country should be  happy  when it is in the sphere of influence of a large state," does  not occur in that exact wording. But Zatulin did say something  very close to it in meaning. The exact text is: "I am a  supporter of empire, if we speak of empire and understand this  to mean imperial peace...a way of keeping the peace...Their  coexistence side by side with an empire allows them (the CIS  republics and republics within Russia) to guarantee somehow, for  one, the advantages of such coexistence--which means economic  ties, and for two, enables them to place the concerns of general  security and defense on the stronger state. As it was for a long  time in relation to Japan and Western Europe; the United States  assumed the obligations of defending what they called the free  world...Because Japan did not spend money on arms the economic  miracle became possible...ultimately to appear as an economic  superpower."    Yutaka Akino, advisor to the Japanese Government  (Department of Politics and International Relations) on  questions of the CIS, and political scientist at Tsukuba  University, Japan: "About a week ago my Moscow friend, the  journalist Igor Rotar, telephoned me at home. From my talk with  Igor I learned that Mr. Zatulin is accusing him of libel, saying  that the journalist distorted his words terribly in his article  in NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. I was extremely surprised, not least  because I was with Igor during the conversation with the  chairman of the State Duma committee on CIS affairs and ties  with countrymen, but also because we worked together on the text  of the interview, taking care not to permit any distortion in  the words of our highly-placed interviewee.    "During my trips around the former Soviet Union I was  already  accustomed to encountering things that seemed strange and  unusual to me, a Japanese man. But what happened seems amazing  to me even in the Russian context: a well-known politician very  enthusiastically shares his quite unexpected views, then a month  later has already completely forgotten them.    "Incidentally, the interview with Zatulin that I published  in  late March in the Japanese magazine SEKAI SHUHO caused a  sensation among our political scientists: if the Russian  centrists hold such views, what is there to say about the  rightists! But the latest unexpected action by Zatulin will  perhaps surprise my countrymen even more than the originality of  his political credo."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Viktor Litovkin: "Russian Chief of General Staff </F> Describes Piece in Japanese Weekly as `Nonsense'"]    [Text] Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, Russian Armed  Forces chief of general staff, described in conversation with  your correspondent a secret report published in the Japanese  weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN and entitled "Russian Federation Military  Policy in the Asian-Pacific Region in the New Military-Political  Conditions" (IZVESTIYA No. 16) as "utter nonsense from beginning  to end."    "The references to General Staff issue numbers, the  publication date of the document, and the Defense Ministry form  are not valid," the general said, "and only a very gullible and  incompetent person could be taken in by them, not a  professional."    "I have before me," Kolesnikov said, "a list of all the  Russian General Staff and Defense Ministry index numbers we put  on our working documents. Those named by the weekly are not on  it. The letters "SM" were part of the old USSR Council of  Ministers index nunmber, but it was abolished in 1991, and I do  not know what these letters mean now. As for the Defense  Ministry form, it is clearly a forgery. The form is no big  secret, so the document could have been easily put together on a  computer or photocopied. At the same time, Kolesnikov said, our  documents are not stamped "top secret." But perhaps this is not  a very accurate translation. Furthermore: Under the general  staff there is no Military-Strategic Analysis Center, which  allegedly prepared the "report."    But the most important thing is the lies in the body of the  report. "I cannot say anything about the scientists, since we  do not keep track of where they go and why, it is not our  concern and not our headache," Kolesnikov said, "but the claim  that Pyongyang has one or two nuclear warheads and several more  will come off the conveyor belt by the end of this year is total  rubbish. I can definitely say that the DPRK does not have any  of this. Neither does it have the mythical missiles such as  Nodong-1 and Nodong-2 and several hundred other nuclear warhead  delivery vehicles."    Incidentally, the Russian chief of general staff said, we  received several South Korean military delegations last year.  They talked of their anxiety about DPRK military might, about  their suspicions that it was working on something, but there was  no mention of the "facts" presented by the Japanese weekly in  any discussion with serious-minded people. Evidently they knew  that they did not exist.    I feel sorry for the Japanese journalists and their  publication, Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov said. Perhaps  they were simply taken in by the forgery when it was slipped  under their door. But such, it seems, is the public state of  mind in Japan that they will believe any claptrap about Russia,  its General Staff, and Armed forces. A pity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] It began on 30 December 1993 when the Japanese  company NewJec submitted reports on a feasibility study and on  initial construction site data related to a nuclear electric  power plant [PLTN] to Djali Ahimsa, director general of the  National Atomic Energy Agency [BATAN].    The consultant to Indonesia on PLTN construction concluded  that economically a medium-sized PLTN would be very competitive  and could be operational in the Java-Bali electric power network  beginning in 2004. Of the three prospective sites on the Muria  Peninsula of central Java, Cape Lemahabang would best  accommodate a 7,000-megawatt PLTN, followed by Cape Grenggengan  and Cape Watu.    "I am confident that NewJec's recommendation will receive  support from the government in its subsequent consideration of  building a PLTN in Indonesia," Djali said when the reports were  submitted.    Djali also said that the government's approval is sufficient  for this PLTN construction. Japan and Britain did not involve  their parliaments, either. "NewJec's recommendation also did not  state a need for opinion from the Indonesian public," he said.    KOMPAS contacted several prominent community figures to ask  their positions on the building of this PLTN.    Abdurrahman Wahid, nicknamed Gus Dur, chairman of  the NU [Muslim Scholars League:    Are you referring to the plan to build a PLTN in the Muria  Peninsula area of central Java?    Muria, like the northern coastal area of the island of Java,  from Karawang to Cirebon, to Kendal, to the eastern end of the  island, and to Madura, is NU's base. I have an interest in  taking part in discussion. If there should be an accident, NU  members would be affected.    From the beginning I have stressed that the risk of nuclear  accident must be calculated before construction. Do not make  just an abstract study: The mountain is safe, and such things.  It must be concrete with quantitative data.    To be 100-percent convincing, the risk of nuclear accident  must be seriously calculated. There must be "full proof." Not  even a hair's breadth can be missing. The Muria area is  surrounded by water. There are mountains. The area is in danger  of earthquakes.    The arguments of the government and officials on the urgency  of building a PLTN have not yet convinced me. The urgency is not  yet great.    Therefore, the government must consider a "public hearing."  To say that government approval is sufficient for building a  PLTN is arrogance and conceit on the part of bureaucrats. One  group that absolutely should be heard from is environment  lovers. They have "concerns" and have studied the PLTN.    The government must bear humanitarian responsibility if an  accident should occur, because the decision to build a PLTN is a  political decision. I recommend that considerations should be  based on caution. The NU always uses caution as a basis for its  considerations.    Let me give an example. If a judge has a little doubt about  the death penalty, he must give jail punishment instead.    In the case of building a PLTN, if there is still a little  question about danger to people, construction of the PLTN must  be canceled. Anyway, without a PLTN, Indonesia is not going to  be 100 years behind.    What will I do now? I am still studying the matter. The  pouring of concrete is still a long way off. If construction  takes place, I want to hold a fast there before concrete pouring  is started. Muria is one of the NU's bases. I have an interest  there.    Y.B. Mangunwijaya, Catholic priest and cultural  expert:    The building of a PLTN in Indonesia cannot be viewed as good  or bad, feasible or unfeasible, scientific or unscientific. The  PLTN is a project that will be developed because of prestige and  power. Therefore, looking at it and commenting on it must be  through political glasses.    In this case, I cannot comment as to power or prestige  outside my area. I cannot take part in stating approval or  disapproval of the construction of this PLTN. I am merely a  member of the general public without any power.    Furthermore, if we are talking about power, a community  structure does not exist. The one with the right to speak is the  "power owner," who will manage and maintain it and who possesses  power. I do not have any voice.    Because PLTN construction is a matter of power, the result  of  the feasibility study is certain to be "feasible." In fact, even  before it was made, the study was already "feasible." The  feasibility study was needed only for seeking credit and funds  for building and financing it, and so on.    Mochtar Lubis, reporter and cultural expert:    The construction of the PLTN must be left to the people or  to  the DPR [Parliament], which represents them. Nuclear technology  is very dangerous. It is not appropriate for merely one minister  to decide on the building of a PLTN for a nation. Djali Ahimsa's  answer and attitude demonstrates the arrogance of power, as  though he knows best what this nation needs.    I am anti-PLTN 200 percent, in fact, 1,000 percent. There is  no further doubt about its danger.    From the aspect of culture, I do not believe that the  technological discipline of Indonesians is sufficient for  handling PLTN technology. There is still human negligence even  in France, the United States, and Russia, where there is  discipline. I also do not believe Indonesians are able to handle  modern technology. What I know is that Indonesian engineers can  only connect cables and wires.    I recommend that the people be the ones to decide the need,  or lack of it, for PLTN construction. This should be done  through a referendum. Whether the people approve or not is up to  them.    Aburizal Bakrie, businessman, president  commissioner of the Bakrie Group:    I have two contradictory views in reaction to the building  of  a PLTN. As general chairman of the Indonesian Association of  Engineers, I agree. Nuclear power is a clean technology, and we  have mastered the technology. The price, too, is reasonable.    However, my question is, for what are we going to use the  large coal assets in Kalimantan?    As a businessman, I naturally prefer coal-fired PLTU's  [steam-powered electric power plants]. The point is, I have a  coal mining business. Ha, ha, ha.    There are other concerns as to PLTN operation. The cheap  electricity will interest industrialized countries in relocating  their industries to Indonesia. Those industries that will be  relocated reportedly will be those that pollute the environment.  That can be overcome by environmental protection, however.    Environmental protection can also be applied to coal-fired  PLTU's. Why, then, not do it to coal-fired PLTU's? Besides being  an abundant natural resource, it is readily available and does  not need to be imported.    Kwik Kian Gie, a director of the PDI [Indonesian  Democratic Party] DPP [Central Executive Council]:    "I have delegated discussion of the PLTN to Kwik. He  represents me, as well as the PDI DPP," PDI DPP General Director  Megawati Sukarnoputri told KOMPAS.    Therefore, Kwik was the one to respond.    With regard to the PLTN, the PDI DPP focuses attention on  its  safety. I am very doubtful. Just look at the case of the  Cernobyl disaster.    There has never been a detailed and open explanation about  PLTN technical questions or economic aspects, either. Therefore,  I am not able to make much comment. I can only express opinion  as to the danger.    Hamzah Haz, chairman of the DPR FPP [Development  Unity Faction]:    Is the PLTN to be built by 2004? Not feasible. The current  account deficit and the national balance of payments are in a  serious condition because development still depends on foreign  loans. Also, our exports are not yet as we had hoped,  particularly considering that our annual export growth target  has to be about 18 percent.    Although the condition of the APBN [National Budget] is  improving, it will not change significantly by the year 2004.  The PLTN can be classified as a "megaproject" requiring large  funding from overseas. Do we want to repeat the action of  cutting off half-completed megaprojects through tight-money  policies in order to improve the APBN?    If the government proceeds with its intention to build a  PLTN  megaproject, it should reestimate the prospects for national  industry through the end of REPELITA VI [Sixth Five-Year  Development Plan]. Will industry continue to expand and be all  the more competitive, or not? Will construction of the PLTN have  a direct impact on investment and our non-oil-and-gas exports,  or not? If the answer is yes, the DPR perhaps should restudy the  possibilities for construction.    The decision to build a PLTN installation or not should be  based on technoeconomic calculations and the desires of the  people. The government should not make the people an "object" of  development. Although it may be technoeconomically feasible to  build PLTN, if the people then feel that it will interfere with  social and environmental security, the project should merely be  canceled.    Krissantono, member of DPR Commission I from the  FKP [Functional Group Faction]:    From the aspect of financing as well as future consequences,  the PLTN is a megaproject. Politically, several projects that  were built in the public interest still have a negative impact.  Examples are Kedungombo and Nipah.    In such cases, the victim is always the community around the  project. They become "objects" of development, despite the fact  that the GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy] clearly states  that the Indonesian people must be the "subject" of development  and not the "object."    Cases like Kedungombo and Nipah must not be repeated.    It is my understanding that the GBHN states that the people  are the main players in development and the government merely  encourages from the rear. What confuses me is that the statement  by the BATAN director general is contradictory to the intent of  the GBHN. The role of the people as the principal player in  development is not seen in his statement, because the government  wants to be in front. If that is the case, truth is only as seen  through the glasses of the government. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Chemical workers reject 1.4% offer THE Chemical Industries Association yesterday offered an annual pay rise of about 1.4 per cent to most of the 25,000 process and craft workers covered by its agreement. Lower-paid workers were offered about 1.7 per cent. The offer was rejected by the union side but officials said they would report it to their members. The unions had asked for a substantial pay rise, an increase in holiday pay, and for working parties on temporary workers and contractors. The employers agreed to a working party on temporary workers but rejected the idea for contractors.</p>

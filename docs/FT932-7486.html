			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / EBRD lending falls far short of budget targets THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development made commitments to provide just Ecu70m (Pounds 55m) of loans and investments in the first quarter of this year, according to internal bank documents. The slow rate of lending and investment, also a feature of 1992, is highlighted in an internal EBRD report by the bank's Swedish director, Mr Claes de Neergaard, which criticises the bank's use of private jets and its failure until recently to disclose that it has a Paris office. The bank was set up two years ago to stimulate growth of the private sector in eastern Europe. It has recently been criticised by some of the countries which own it for investing too little while spending too much on its head office, travel and entertaining. A meeting of the board of directors, who represent the bank's owners, is scheduled for today. It is expected to appoint accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand to investigate allegations of overspending on the bank's Pounds 55.5m project to furnish its London headquarters. The Ecu70m committed in new EBRD investment projects falls far short of the rate required if the bank is to meet its budget target of commitments of between Ecu2bn and Ecu2.6bn in 1993. Funds disbursed in the first quarter were Ecu44m, compared with a budget for the year of at least Ecu694m. Disbursements and commitments in 1992 were also below budget. Mr de Neergaard is chairman of the bank's audit committee, which will oversee Cooper's probe. The audit committee will itself carry out an investigation of the Pounds 748,000 spent by the bank in 1992 on private jets. It will focus in particular on why every private jet flight taken by the EBRD president, Mr Jacques Attali, in that year was in an aircraft hired from Air Entreprise, a company based at Le Bourget, near Paris. A report by Mr de Neergaard, dated May 7, is an account of the views of the seven directors who are members of the audit committee. It said the audit committee was not satisfied that flights in private jets were justified on grounds of 'cost efficiency'. The committee welcomed Mr Attali's decision to stop using private jets for the 'foreseeable future'. The committee also asked for a paper on the bank's office in Paris, ahead of any possible renewal of the rental arrangement in June. The rent is currently paid by the French government. The committee members complained at the lack of information given to them about the office. One board member 'regretted that the annual report (which makes no mention of the Paris office) could not be considered correct with respect to EBRD offices'. The committee also noted that Mr Attali's wife, Elisabeth, flew with him on one Concorde flight last year, and that his contract says his 'travel expenses shall include the travel and hotel expenses of your (Mr Attali's) wife in attending overseas annual meetings of the Board of Governors and in accompanying you on official travel whenever you consider this to be in the interests of the bank'. The committee members have been given a separate report, dated May 14, on the bank's financial performance during the first quarter by a group of directors' technical assistants. It criticises underspending in some areas of the bank's operations to offset overspending elsewhere. Flights face scrutiny, Page 8</p>

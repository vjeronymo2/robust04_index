			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Further education results trigger controversy: Patten admits national league tables are incomplete - Many claim comparisons are impossible / Independents perform strongly Schools appear to achieve stronger results than further education colleges in both A-levels and vocational qualifications, according to government figures published today. The figures are likely to provoke controversy as many colleges said the differing goals of schools and colleges, and the limited information available on vocational qualifications, made comparisons impossible. Two statistics caused surprise. One was the performance of Sheffield, a Labour-controlled authority with significant inner-city deprivation, which had the highest overall A-level point score per entrant of any local authority in England - where only pupils taking two or more A-levels were considered. The other surprise was the extent of the disparity in performance between independent schools and others. Independents managed an average of 17.97 A-level points for candidates taking two A-levels or more (a grade A is worth 10 points and an E is worth two), while state schools managed 12.85 and further education colleges 10.19. In other words, pupils at independents could expect at least one grade more in each of three subjects. Independent schools are usually much more selective than state schools can be, and this will account for much of the disparity. The results for many relatively affluent southern authorities may have been harmed by large numbers of pupils being sent to independent schools. The performance figures for further education colleges have also aroused controversy. They show that even for vocational qualifications, in which many of the colleges specialise, they appear not to perform quite as well as schools - with a pass rate in Btec and City and Guilds qualifications of 82.12 per cent, compared with the 85.84 per cent of state schools. The Association for Colleges objected that the figures did not include National Vocational Qualifications - directly work-related courses - which account for the bulk of the colleges' work, or any indicators of the success achieved in the adult literacy and numeracy programmes which they are legally obliged to provide. Any ranking system is open to question. In the tables below the FT has first ranked colleges by success rate in Btec and City and Guilds qualifications. Where two score equally, the college with the superior A-level performance is ranked higher. This method must carry the serious 'health warning' that it produces unfairly low rankings for sixth-form colleges, because they concentrate on A-levels. For now, it is better than nothing. Mr John Patten, education secretary, admitted the tables were incomplete. He said the government would next year publish tables that included performance in the new General National Vocational Qualifications ('Vocational A-levels').</p>

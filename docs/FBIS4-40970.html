			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 22 TASS -- The Moscow-based press  focuses on the 53rd anniversary of Nazi Germany's attack on the  Soviet Union, opinion polls taken among Muscovites on attitude  to it, and carries reports on Russia's Federation Council  decision to bring Russian peacekeepers to the area of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, the forthcoming signing of the  framework document of NATO's Partnership-for-Peace Programme in  Brussels on Wednesday, on growing unemployment in St.  Petersburg, and comments on presidential anti- crime decrees.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) runs an article headlined "The  Memories of June 22, 1941, Prompt Us To Keep Our Powder Dry".    "However bitter it sounds but we ourselves in many respects  provoked the enemy into attacking. Not by aggressiveness or  by plans of a preventive strike against Germany, as our foes  maintain, but by our unpreparedness, lack of mobilisation, and,  to quote Marshal A.M. Vasilevskiy, by fear to cross the line  which separates normal caution from a criminal expectations.    "Herein is the major lesson of June 22, 1941. This is where  history merges with contemporaneity and the events of the past  with the most pressing present-day problems of the Russian state  and its armed forces".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA also carries an article on the tragedy of  Soviet intelligence service whose reports that Germany was going  to attack the USSR on June 22 neither Stalin nor his entourage  believed.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI runs a series of articles on the subject  of  the tragic and heroical days of the beginning of the war.    According to the findings of an opinion poll taken the  newspaper's correspondent nowadays among people on Moscow  streets from various age and social groups of the population  about their attitude to the anniversary, young people said that,  in their view, the Soviet Union's and Russia's contribution to  the victory over Hitler and German fascism is being belittled in  the West nowadays, while their parents are now more preoccupied  with problems of survival and feeding their rather politicised  children".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA states that the aggregate number of  people who were killed or died during the Great Patriotic War is  43.3 million.    "Stalin was preparing an attack on Hitler, and the latter,  unknowingly forestalled him by weeks if not days...    "Should Stalin get his blow in first, the course and outcome  of the war would not have changed. The war remained unjust for  Stalin and his top entourage who practised expansion and  perpetrated many crimes against their own people and the whole  of mankind".    The newspaper also runs excerpts from verbatim report about  the Fuehrer's remarks under the headline "Adolf Hitler: `When We  Shall Assimilate Russian Expanses..."    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Bismarck's  grandson, Count Heinrich von Einsiedel-- a German ace pilot who  was shot down in the skies over Stalingrad and taken prisoner.  While in captivity he became the vice-president of the National  Committee Free Germany.    "Hitler was a great misfortune for the German people and  Stalin constituted the same for the Russian people and the  peoples of the Soviet Union. The two made up a critical mass  which lead to the outbreak of war. Among other things, Hitler's  guilt is that he, resorting to a venture by attacking the Soviet  Union, made Stalin the savior of mankind, although, of course,  it was the Soviet people who saved the world," Count von  Einsiedel said in the interview.    TRUD singles out a commentary by Stanislav Shatalin,  academic  secretary of the Russian Academy of Sciences' Department of  Economics and president of the Reform Foundation, on the latest  decrees issued by President Boris Yeltsin.    Shatalin said "the decrees attained their goal, stirring the  lop [as received] of economic stagnation in which Russia has  found itself. However, the untargeted nature and ambiguity of a  number of positions gave rise to contradictory opinions about  the expediencey and effectiveness of the decrees.    "As far as the government is concerned, although it  constantly states of late that it has an economic programme,  still there are so far no strategy or tactics of reforms that  would be understandable to the people. Without that, it is not  very logical to issue a series of decrees to this effect," he  said. Shatalin believes that the government, not the president,  should be the initiator of reforms.    PRAVDA singles out a report on mounting unemployment in St.  Petersburg and on the current auctioning of enterprises there  cheaply to foreign firms. The Svetlana Amalgamation, which was  once the country's largest enterprise and the pride of national  electronic instrument-making, is now up for sale.    The government newspaper ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA    -- reports that the names of millions of co-citizens --  servicemen, partisans, members of the volunteer corps, and  underground fighters -- will be entered in an all-Russia book of  memory which is to be published by the 50th anniversary of the  victory. The book will consist of 700 volumes which are to be  turned over for perpetual storage to the Poklonnaya hill  memorial complex.    -- Frontpages a statement by Aleksandr Belyakov, governor of  Leningrad region, that Russian governors will "insist on a  meeting with President Boris Yeltsin in the coming days" to set  out their views on ways to take the country's economy out of the  crisis.    -- Laments that the recent working visit by Russian  parliamentary delegation, led by State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin,  to Germany, "was passed over in silence" by German news media.    -- Points out that Hungarian-made medicines produced by the  Gedeon Richter plant may disappear from sale in Russia's drug  stores in view of an instruction issued by the Russian Ministry  of Health in March that medicines that appear on sale in Russia  should undergo quality tests. The Hungarian enterprise is not  against yet another series of tests of its medicines but the  Ministry did not yet establish a network of laboratories to  enact its decision.</p>

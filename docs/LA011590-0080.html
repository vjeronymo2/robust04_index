			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET RIOTS KILL 25 ARMENIANS;  </P> <P> AZERBAIJAN: RUSSIANS IN THE CAPITAL OF BAKU TELL OF ATROCITIES AGAINST MINORITY  GROUP. MOSCOW FLIES IN A DIVISION OF TROOPS.  </P> <P> Rioting mobs killed at least 25 people Sunday in the Armenian quarter of Baku,  the capital of the southern Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, bringing warnings  from leaders in neighboring Armenia that the volatile region is close to civil  war.  </P> <P> "Gangs of hooligans have been committing atrocities," the official Soviet news  agency Tass reported from Baku, describing the attacks as "pogroms" aimed at  the Armenian minority in Azerbaijan. "Preliminary information puts the number  of dead at 25."  </P> <P> Lenin Street, one of Baku's main avenues, was described as drenched with blood.  Russians living in the Azerbaijani capital spoke with horror of seeing Armenian  neighbors shot at point-blank range, hurled from balconies, burned alive and  even dismembered by the rampaging mobs of Azerbaijanis.  </P> <P> "We have seen murders here of the cruelest sort," a veteran Soviet journalist  said by telephone from Baku. "Men, women and children, the young and the old  alike, were attacked and often killed because they were Armenians. That alone  -- to be Armenian in Azerbaijan -- was a virtual sentence of death."  </P> <P> Radio Moscow said late Sunday evening that the unconfirmed death toll stood at  more than 30 in Baku -- all of them believed to be Armenians or the spouses of  Armenians. Several soldiers in the internal security force were also reported  killed in the weekend fighting.  </P> <P> As the attacks spread to outlying areas of Azerbaijan on Sunday afternoon, with  official reports of dozens of further casualties, the central government in  Moscow flew a division of riot troops into the republic to restore order, and a  senior military commander called for the imposition of a state of emergency.  </P> <P> But the official Soviet news media, reporting from Baku and elsewhere in the  region, described scenes so reminiscent of the start of the Lebanese civil war  15 years ago that 20 divisions of the Red Army might be required to end the  growing conflict. Tass acknowledged in one report that police had no hope of  restoring order themselves.  </P> <P> Armenian leaders, speaking at a rally Sunday of an estimated 300,000 people in  Yerevan, the Armenian capital, angrily urged the formation of an Armenian army  to avenge the deaths of their kinsmen in Baku, dismissing the central  government's efforts to restore order as ineffectual and too late to halt  escalation of the strife.  </P> <P> Ashot Manucharyan, a member of Armenia's nationalist Karabakh Committee, called  for Armenians to volunteer for new "self-defense units" and to bring their guns  to the committee's offices to arm the special force. Preparations were also  made to airlift squads of Armenian police and medical personnel to Baku and  Nagorno-Karabakh to help Armenian residents there.  </P> <P> "If our government will not carry out its duties, we must organize to defend  ourselves," Manucharyan told the people at the Yerevan rally, thousands of whom  wanted to march immediately to Baku. "Our hopes must rest only on ourselves. We  must trust no one but ourselves."  </P> <P> The clashes in Baku were the bloodiest in nearly two years of feuding between  the Azerbaijanis, most of whom are Shiite Muslims, and the Armenians, who are  predominantly Christian. Thirty-two people, most of them Armenians, were killed  during three days of rioting in the Azerbaijani oil center of Sumgait in  February, 1988; at least 150 more have died in fighting there since.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kremlin Aides Sent In  </P> <P> The Kremlin on Sunday dispatched top officials at the head of special Communist  Party delegations to resolve the crisis. Yevgeny M. Primakov, one of President  Mikhail S. Gorbachev's closest advisers, went to Baku, while Nikolai Slyunkov,  a member of the ruling Politburo, went to Yerevan.  </P> <P> And what began as a territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh -- an Armenian  enclave within Azerbaijan, which remains besieged, under virtual martial law  and the focus of great tension -- has grown into a conflict that threatens the  central government's ability to maintain order and to rule the country.  </P> <P> "We march, we fight and, if necessary, we die," another Karabakh Committee  speaker said at the Yerevan rally. "But, if we die, we will take not one, not  10 but 100 or more Azeris with each one of us. . . .  </P> <P> "Now is the time for the Armenian nation to make its stand. We call upon our  brothers in the diaspora to come home, and quickly, for this is it -- we  survive or we die as a nation."  </P> <P> Thousands of Azerbaijani guerrillas, reinforced by even more men from other  districts, were reported by Soviet authorities on Sunday evening to be  attacking Armenian villages in Nagorno-Karabakh, with dozens of people killed  or wounded.  </P> <P> Describing the situation there as "extremely tense," Tass said that the  skirmishes had continued for three days and had spread to adjacent districts  with dozens of people killed, wounded and missing.  </P> <P> Azerbaijanis had kidnaped the entire government and Communist Party leadership  of one Armenian district, according to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, and  Armenians had then taken Azerbaijani hostages in reprisal.  </P> <P> Internal security troops, supported by military helicopters carrying  paratroopers, were fired upon Sunday but succeeded in landing in a virtual  combat assault in an attempt to stop the Azerbaijani assault on Armenian  villages, according to Tass.  </P> <P> At least two Interior Ministry soldiers, one an officer, were killed over the  weekend and five were wounded in separate attacks, apparently by Azerbaijani  guerrillas, on the military barracks in Nagorno-Karabakh, according to Tass.  Four other Interior Ministry soldiers were reported to be missing after their  patrol was attacked while responding to an Azerbaijani attack on an Armenian  village.  </P> <P> But clashes that were once confined to Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous district  of 180,000 people far from urban centers, spread over the weekend to many other  districts of Azerbaijan where small Armenian communities remained.  </P> <P> Officials in the predominantly Armenian district of Shaumyan, close to  Nagorno-Karabakh, sent a telegram to Gorbachev warning that open warfare is  close. "The possibility of the outbreak of civil war is quite real," the  telegram said.  </P> <P> The conservative newspaper Soviet Russia on Sunday described the region around  Nagorno-Karabakh as a virtual "war zone," and Red Star, the armed forces  newspaper, reported in detail the escalation in fighting between the Armenians  and Azerbaijanis to the point where each side now has its own helicopters as  well as fully equipped light infantry.  </P> <P> In Baku, armed groups of Azerbaijanis were patrolling the streets, searching  for Armenians, according to journalists from the Soviet central press. Squads,  using lists of Armenians residents from local government officials, were going  door to door in search of those who had escaped the first assault.  </P> <P> One Armenian woman in Baku told friends in Moscow by telephone that she was  warned early last week to leave before she got "an olive" -- slang for a  bullet.  </P> <P> She could only buy a ticket for today -- and then only by using a friend's  identity documents. Her fate is unknown.  </P> <P> The current fighting apparently began in Baku on Saturday when two  Azerbaijanis, members of the Azerbaijani Popular Front, told an Armenian family  to leave the city, according to accounts on Radio Moscow and in Izvestia, the  government newspaper.  </P> <P> The Armenians resisted, and they had an ax for a weapon. The Azerbaijanis were  badly hurt in the ensuing struggle -- one died and the other remains  hospitalized in serious condition.  </P> <P> The news of the Armenian resistance and the Azerbaijani casualties enraged a  rally of more than 150,000 people who gathered in Baku, a city of 1.7 million.  At the Azerbaijan Front's urging, speakers proposed the creation of a "council  for national security to protect Azerbaijanis."  </P> <P> They also demanded the resignation of the republic's government unless it takes  drastic measures to reassert its authority over Nagorno-Karabakh, and others  recounted the recent Azerbaijani "success" in breaking across the  Soviet-Iranian border by tearing down the fences and forcing Moscow and Tehran  to agree to all-but-free movement across their frontier for Azerbaijanis.  </P> <P> But there were calls as well, according to correspondents for the central  Soviet news media, for the forcible expulsion of the remaining Armenians from  Baku, a remnant of no more than 20,000 after two years of anti-Armenian  violence there, and from the rest of Azerbaijan.  </P> <P> "Calls were made at the rally to drive Armenians out of the city," the Radio  Moscow correspondent reported from Baku in one of the frankest dispatches heard  on Soviet radio. "Among the crowd, anti-Armenian slogans were shouted, and then  the most terrible thing of all began -- the pogroms."  </P> <P> The Azerbaijanis, whose leaders appeared to have lists, set out in pursuit of  Armenians still living in the city, the correspondent said.  </P> <P> "It was not possible to avert many sad and tragic cases," he continued. "But in  dozens of others, the militia (police) managed to save people."  </P> <P> In others, he added, Azerbaijanis sheltered their Armenian neighbors,  preventing an even greater slaughter.  </P> <P> "Operational bulletins constantly contain reports about hostages being taken,  both Armenians and Azerbaijanis, about exchanges of gunfire, about tragic  events," he continued.  </P> <P> "This republic is on the boil. Hearts are bleeding, and the police are trying  to do everything they can."  </P> <P> Although reinforcements are arriving, "What guarantee is there that the  frightful thing that took place last night will not be repeated?"  </P> <P> Esther Schrader, in Yerevan, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

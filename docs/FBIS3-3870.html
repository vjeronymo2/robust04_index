Last year, Shenzhen spent 186 million yuan (HK$165.2  million), about five per cent of the SEZ's total expenditure, on  public security, the judiciary and procuratorate.    This figure, a tiny amount compared with the SEZ's budget  for  infrastructure which stands at 1.3 billion yuan, is already an  87.87 percent increase on 1992. In his report to Shenzhen's  anticorruption meeting last week, Mo Huashu, secretary of  Shenzhen's Commission for Discipline Inspection urged party and  government officials of all levels to place more emphasis on  anti-graft work.    "In Shenzhen's anti-corruption drive there are aspects which  are still far from satisfactory," he said.    And in his report to Shenzhen's People's Congress which  opened on Tuesday, Mayor Li Youwei underscored the importance of  clean government. He said yesterday that the number of  government officials and heads of enterprises who had run off  with public money had dropped sharply in the wake of the  crackdown. More than 21 had been arrested last year alone and  the Public Security Bureau had caught a total of 40 in the past  two years, he said. About 80 had fled in that time.    "It doesn't matter whether they have been on the run a long  time. nor how far they have gone. Even if they have gone to  countries with which we have no diplomatic relation, we can get  them back," Mr Li said with confidence. Among the 40-odd  arrested were a former head of the finance and trade department  of Shenzhen's Planning Bureau. The money involved in some cases  amounted to millions of yuan.    Mr Mo said that in the last four months of last year a total  of 2,832 complaints of corruption were made an increase of 102  percent over the same period in 1992. Of the 167 cases that had  been closed, 67 percent were classed as serious.    Authorities were also investigating 52 cases involving  senior  officials, about five times more than in the previous year, he  said.</p>

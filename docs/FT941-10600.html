			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Main aim is to increase consumption The centrepiece of the Japanese government's package is a Y5,850bn (Pounds 35.29bn) tax cut in order to boost consumption funded by deficit covering government bonds. This year, the government will implement a Y3,840bn cut in income tax, a Y1,630bn cut in residential tax, a Y70bn passenger sales tax cut (through a reduction in the rate from 4.5 per cent to 3 per cent), and a Y310bn cut in corporate taxes. This is to be done by abolishing a special corporate tax, originally implemented to finance Japan's Dollars 9bn contribution to the Gulf War, at a rate of some 1 per cent of pre-tax profits. In addition to the central tax cut of Y5,850bn, there is a further Y170bn reduction in inheritance taxes, making the total tax cut Y6,020bn. Residential and income tax cuts will be reviewed at the end of the year, together with a scheduled reform of the whole tax system. The fiscal spending portion of the package announced yesterday totals Y9,400bn. A third of this will be spent on measures increasing public and private buying of land to provide liquidity to the country's stagnant property market and assist corporations wanting to unload their property holdings. The spending element includes a Y780bn in advance acquisition of land for public works, Y1,500bn in advance property purchases by local authorities, and Y500bn in supplying low interest rate loans to a land-buying organisation, which will act as a broker between sellers and buyers of land in the private sector. Public works spending by the central government on infrastructure such as sewage systems and roads totals Y2,810bn, while Y610bn will be spent on improving educational and research and development facilities, and Y300bn on projects carried out by local governments. To promote further purchases of houses, some Y1,200bn is allocated to low interest rate housing loans by the Housing Loan Corporation. Increases in low interest rate loans for small and medium businesses totals Y1,360bn, while Y230bn will be spent on agricultural infrastructure ahead of the opening of the country's rice market. Tax incentives to promote investments in plants and equipment will total Y100bn, while Y10bn will be spent on employment subsidy schemes to help middle-aged workers facing an increasing threat of unemployment due to labour rationalisation.</p>

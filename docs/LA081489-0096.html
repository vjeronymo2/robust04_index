			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> GARDEN GROVE MAN ESCAPES SERIOUS INJURIES IN FIERY TRUCK ACCIDENT  </P> <P> A Garden Grove man escaped serious injuries early this morning when the truck  he was driving at a high speed went out of control and broke apart before  bursting into flames, Buena Park police officials said.  </P> <P> Henry H. Herrera, 52, was thrown from his tractor-trailer near of La Palma and  La Costa avenues, Police Lt. Gary Hicken said.  </P> <P> "He apparently fell asleep," Hicken said before the truck hit a palm tree and  flew into the air shortly before 1 a.m.  </P> <P> Police investigators estimated that Herrera had been driving the truck along  city streets in excess of 80 m.p.h. A test revealed that there was no alcohol  in Herrera's bloodstream, police said.  </P> <P> Officer Richard McMillen said the destruction resembled the aftermath of a  plane crash.  </P> <P> Herrera, who was found in a clump of nearby bushes, had a broken left arm and  was taken to UCI-Medical Center in Orange, said hospital spokeswoman Fran  Tardiff.  </P></p>

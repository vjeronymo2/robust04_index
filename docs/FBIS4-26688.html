			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by correspondent Zhao Wen (6392 2429): "Early </F> Agreement From the Sino-British Airport Committee Desired"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 23 Jun (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--The  Sino-British Airport Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting on  24 June on financial arrangements for the new airport. Hong  Kong society is hoping that this meeting can produce substantive  results and an agreement to enable the airport construction to  go ahead and to be completed on schedule.    Signs show that after rounds of in-depth negotiations, China  and Britain are narrowing their differences over the financial  arrangements for the new airport. Concerned personnel from both  sides are expressing optimism about the meeting. Therefore, if  both sides take the Airport Memorandum of Understanding [MOU] as  the point of departure, and continue to negotiate frankly and  sincerely and with an attitude of seeking truth from facts, it  is possible that the meeting can achieve a breakthrough or even  a package deal.    A member of the Airport Consultative Committee said in his  analysis that there are still three main differences between  China and Britain over financial arrangements for the new  airport: One, the amount of debt; two, whether the debts of the  airport corporation and airport railway corporation should be  counted as borrowings by the Hong Kong Government; and three,  whether the land along the Airport Railway should be  incorporated into the annual land sale scheme of the  Sino-British Land Committee.    The Airport MOU expressly sets the debt for the new airport  at 5 billion Hong Kong dollars, and consultation with China is  required if the debt exceeds this amount. To reach an early  agreement, China has stated more than once that the 5 billion  was not an absolute ceiling, showing fully its flexibility and  pragmatic attitude. If the financial arrangement proposed by  Britain is not too wide of the mark, it should not be difficult  to bridge the difference here. On whether the debts of the  airport corporation and airport railway corporation should be  counted as Hong Kong Government borrowings, there should not be  any question that they are, because both companies are  organizations dependent on and wholly funded by the Hong Kong  Government, which should shoulder all their debts. It is  doubtful whether the two companies could even obtain consortium  loans if statements were put out that the Hong Kong Government  had nothing to do with their debts.    The answer to the question of whether the land along the  airport railway should be included in the annual land sale  scheme of the Sino-British Land Committee is in the affirmative.  Anson Chan, chief secretary of the Hong Kong Government, said  earlier that Britain had never suggested disposing of all this  land in one sale and agreed to incorporating it in the land  committee's annual land sale scheme. Therefore, there is not  much difference between China and Britain on this issue.    To sum up, if at this meeting both sides are more sincere  and  continue to negotiate with an attitude of seeking truth from  facts and in a conciliatory and concessionary spirit, they  should achieve substantive results and reach an agreement, and  lay the foundation for the administrative structure and other  systems of the new airport.</p>

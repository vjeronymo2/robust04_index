			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / SFO seeks to stop public hearings on Maxwell THE Serious Fraud Office has asked a Commons select committee to halt public hearings into the theft of funds from the Maxwell company pension schemes because many of those to be called are material witnesses in forthcoming trials. Among those scheduled to testify were Lord Walker, Lord Rippon and Lord Stevens as well as officials of Lehman Brothers International, Capel-Cure Myers and Bank of America. Mr Frank Field, chairman of the select committee on social security, yesterday called off the scheduled questioning of Mr Basil Brookes, former Maxwell Communication Corporation finance director, after receiving a letter on Monday from the SFO. The SFO said MPs were likely to question witnesses about matters that the SFO itself was pursuing in criminal proceedings. So far, Maxwell's sons Kevin and Ian, Mr Larry Trachtenberg and Mr Robert Bunn have been charged in connection with the theft of more than Pounds 440m from the pension schemes. Members of the committee are to meet the SFO tomorrow to discuss how to proceed. Some select committee members privately expressed frustration with the request, but said they would have little choice but to co-operate. Several suggested that the SFO was concerned about damage to its own reputation if court proceedings failed to produce convictions. 'We had always said we did not wish our proceedings to prejudice court proceedings,' Mr Field said. MPs fear that those charged in connection with the theft may try to claim that adverse pre-trial publicity prevented a fair hearing. Mr Field said he hoped the committee would be able to continue hearing evidence in public without prejudicing proceedings. Mr David Shaw, a Conservative committee member, said if evidence had to be taken in private, then a review should be held of the sub judice rules on how what is said in parliament affects court proceedings.</p>

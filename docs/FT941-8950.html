			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Accountancy Column: Another method of stopping the writs - Large auditing firms want the law to limit their professional liability. But there is a different option Those with good memories will know that the accountancy profession has allegedly been enduring a liability crisis for nigh on two decades. The evidence is that the affliction has so far proved not to be terminal. It is not surprising that the major international firms have consistently led calls for reform of the auditing liability laws, since it is their claims history that gives the greatest cause for alarm. But lest their pleas be dismissed after so many years of crying wolf, it has to be acknowledged that their exposure to claims is now significantly greater than at any time. Their internal risks reduction procedures are also more rigorous. Regrettably, there is a knee-jerk reaction to implicate auditors every time a large collapse or financial scandal causes widespread loss. The fact that it is improbable that the initial writ will lead to a successful trial does not seem to deter plaintiffs. Many of the mega-claims fall into this category, and ultimately only the courts can serve as the sifting house of last resort for laying down firmer criteria for justifiable actions. However, in most cases the massive cost to defendants and their insurers of proceeding down the fraught path to court - in terms of lost management time as well as money - makes even substantial pre-trial settlements more attractive than prolonged misery. The UK's eight largest auditing firms now regard the risk of one or more of their number being wiped out by claims as so acute that they are seeking to enlist the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in their campaign for reforming the liability laws. A paper to be put to its the institute's council in March will call for section 310 of the Companies Act to be abolished, thus allowing auditors to agree liability limits with their clients as part of the audit contract. The reformers' final aim is to have the common law principle of joint and several liability removed from auditing legislation. Under this principle a plaintiff enjoys a choice of potential targets, each liable for the full extent of the alleged losses irrespective of relative fault. This gives rise to the 'deep pocket' syndrome whereby any defendants known to carry heavy insurance against claims are inevitably selected for the full treatment. It is unlikely that with so many major causes celebres involving auditors still unresolved the government will succumb to the institute's pleading on behalf of the large firms - no matter how that pleading is dressed up as being in the public interest. A more realistic reform, if reform there must be, is to extend the principle of contributory negligence to proceedings brought in contract. At the moment, the contributory negligence is restricted to actions in tort. Since the auditor's contractual relationship is with the company rather than its shareholders or officers, the amending legislation would have to state that negligent actions by the directors are to be construed as having been performed by the company, thus bringing them within the ambit of the contributory negligence framework. This reform would discourage a host of claims that are unreasonably waged against auditors when directors are the more culpable target. For example, when a company suffers massive loss through management or employee fraud, which the directors alone had a duty to prevent by establishing the relevant controls. The reform would also reduce the number of claims against auditors brought by liquidators of companies that have collapsed because of management rather than audit failure. For reasons already explained few cases proceed to trial. Yet in recent years most of those that have gone all the way have effectively stemmed the trend towards open-ended accountability. Indeed, properly analysed, recent judgments have achieved much of the reform that the large accountancy firms seek. The Caparo and Al-Saudi Banque judgments restricted the proximity available to third-party investors and lenders seeking to recover alleged losses from auditors. When the Caparo appeal reached the House of Lords, their Lordships' largesse favoured the profession to such a degree that much undignified embarrassment resulted. Ill-informed sources within the profession even went so far as to express the fear that the inability of third parties to sue on the basis of negligently audited accounts somehow rendered all financial reporting use-less. In December 1993 the recall to rational principles of liability determination was given a further boost by the Appeal Court's findings in Galoo Ltd &amp; Others v Bright Grahame &amp; Murray. The immediate and ultimate parent companies of a subsidiary lost substantial sums when the subsidiary was placed in liquidation, and all three companies commenced proceedings against the auditors of the failed subsidiary, alleging that the previous five years' audits had been conducted negligently. The auditors succeeded in their application to the High Court to have the claims struck out as disclosing no reasonable cause, and this judgment was upheld on appeal. The Appeal Court laid down the proper method for determining reasonable cause in such actions. First, to ascertain that the negligent act gave rise to the 'occasion for damage' to occur; and then to apply common sense in deciding whether the act was in fact the 'effective or dominant cause' of such damage. An act that merely provided the occasion for loss cannot per se be said to have caused the damage. Applying this principle to the Galoo case, the court found that trading losses suffered by the subsidiary after the issue of any negligent audit report (assuming it to be so only for the purpose of the argument) did not, on their own, establish that the losses were caused by that report. The report provided Galoo with the opportunity to continue to trade and incur losses, but those flowed from the trading rather than the provision of any negligent report. Similarly, the acceptance by Galoo of a loan following the issue of the report could not of itself have caused any loss. Leave to appeal to the Lords was refused. Both the causation and quantum issues underpinning many actions against auditors hinge on the tenuous proposition that the directors would have been able to reverse the company's fortunes or stem its losses 'if only the auditors had told them the true position earlier'. We can expect a sharp fall-out of such actions following Galoo. It seems, on the evidence of many such recent findings, that the courts provide a far more fruitful source of reform than the succession of pleas to the Lord Chancellor's office. All this should be put in perspective. The headlines understandably focus on large firm liability cases, yet firms comprising 50 or more partners number just 18 out of the 17,000 accountancy practices in England and Wales. The statistics on litigation against smaller firms are frightening. Any firm has a 1-in-4 chance of being sued in 1994, with the most regular heads of claim being negligent tax advice, non-detection of employee fraud, and issuing defective accounts to banks and other lenders. There is no mitigation here. Rising premiums reflect the very trend described in the institute's recent report to the Department of Trade and Industry, which is that, by and large, the standard of auditing is well below public expectation and professional standards. Putting it simply, in most cases auditors are sued for negligence for no reason other than that they are negligent. Emile Woolf is litigation services partner at Kingston Smith.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa to take 26.5% holding in Lauda Air LUFTHANSA, the German national airline which is suffering continued heavy losses, is taking a stake of 26.5 per cent in Lauda Air, the small Austrian airline founded 13 years ago by Mr Niki Lauda, the former champion racing driver. The deal offers the prospects of increased tourist business for both companies at a time of tougher competition. Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chief executive, told yesterday's annual meeting that the airline's losses in the first five months had already exceeded the figure for all of 1991 by around DM100m (Dollars 65.7m); last year's group net loss was DM426m. Lufthansa said last week its operating loss in this period was some DM600m in the January-May period. Lufthansa's holding in Lauda Air is being acquired for Sch200m (Dollars 19m) through Condor, the charter subsidiary of the German airline. It is also paying more than Sch50m for a 26 per cent stake in ITAS, a travel agency which markets Lauda Air's services in Austria. ITAS is owned by Mr Basile Varvaressos, a Greek travel operator who also has a stake in Lauda Air. The deal comes after a difficult period for Lauda Air following the crash of one of its aircraft over Thailand last June with the death of all 223 passengers and crew. The airline has six Boeing aircraft and has sought a partner to strengthen its position against Austrian Airlines, the country's main carrier, and secure its survival after air traffic liberalisation in Europe. At the annual meeting, Mr Weber said the deal would strengthen the German airline's position in Austria considerably. Mr Lauda said the partnership would give Lauda Air access to Lufthansa's reservation and maintenance network and reduce sharply the costs of further route expansion. He said Lauda Air and Lufthansa would offer jointly flights from Vienna to Miami and to Los Angeles via Munich. The deal with Lufthansa will increase Lauda's equity capital by 36 per cent and reduce its debt burden. The German airline does not have an option to raise its holding further; 21 per cent of the Lauda shares are traded on the Vienna stock exchange. Despite last year's setbacks, including the Gulf war, Lauda Air made a net profit of Sch11m and is forecasting Sch40m for 1992. While its charter business earns profits, its scheduled flights are in the red.</p>

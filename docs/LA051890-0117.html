			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO BROTHERS HELD IN KILLING OF NEIGHBORS;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: MAN AND WOMAN WERE SLAIN AFTER THE SUSPECTS HAD ARGUED WITH THEM OVER  LOUD MUSIC, POLICE SAID.  </P> <P> Two brothers were arrested after an argument with two neighbors over loud music  turned violent and one of the brothers opened fire with a handgun, killing the  neighbors and wounding the apartment building manager, police said Thursday.  </P> <P> After the shooting Wednesday, Duc Minh Lien, 36, and his brother, Phuoc Quang  Lien, 28, barricaded themselves in their north Long Beach apartment in the 6300  block of Paramount Boulevard -- one of them for nearly eight hours, police  said.  </P> <P> Duc Minh Lien surrendered after police fired tear gas into the dwelling. His  brother remained in the apartment for another hour, police said.  </P> <P> Police said the shooting occurred after the brothers argued with their upstairs  neighbors over loud music. The brothers had attempted to get Barajas Gregorio,  29, and Patricia Venegas, 23, to turn their music down, Long Beach Detective  Roy Hamand said.  </P> <P> The brothers had argued with the neighbors over loud music before, police said.  </P> <P> "It was a longstanding feud. . . . It came to a head, " homicide Detective  Larry Stoops said.  </P> <P> Shortly before Wednesday's shooting, which occurred at 5:12 p.m., Duc Minh Lien  "had banged on the ceiling for them to shut it down," Hamand said.  </P> <P> Gregorio left his apartment and he and the brothers got into an argument about  the music outside of the ground-floor apartment of building manager Joseph  Miller, police said. The shooting followed that argument, they said.  </P> <P> Police said Venegas was shot when she too went downstairs and said Miller was  shot when he went to investigate.  </P> <P> Duc Minh Lien allegedly fired numerous shots at the three with a .38-caliber  handgun, police said.  </P> <P> Miller, 64, was listed in serious condition at Long Beach Memorial Hospital  after undergoing surgery. He was shot three times in the stomach, police said.  </P> <P> The 1-month-old daughter of Gregorio and Venegas was turned over to the county  Department of Children Services. The girl was unharmed.  </P> <P> After the shooting, the brothers barricaded themselves inside their home,  police said.  </P> <P> A special weapons team was called to the scene and, after attempts to talk the  two men into surrendering failed, police fired tear gas into the apartment.  </P> <P> Duc Minh Lien gave up at 11:50 p.m. Phuoc Quang Lien surrendered at 1 a.m.  Thursday.  </P> <P> Both men were arrested on two counts each of murder and one count of assault  with a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Police said the brothers had lived at the residence for more than 13 years.  </P></p>

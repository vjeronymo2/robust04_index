			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEAT EASES -- BUT IT'S STILL NOT LIKE APRIL  </P> <P> Southern California's record-shattering heat wave loosened its grip Saturday,  but even relatively cooler weather meant highs in the 90s in inland areas,  another all-time high for the date at the Los Angeles Civic Center and a "smog  attack" at the beaches.  </P> <P> "It looks like the worst is over," said meteorologist Rick Dittmann of  WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. "It looks like the  high-pressure system over the Great Basin is breaking down."  </P> <P> The weather system moved eastward, lessening its ability to bedevil Southern  Californians with a flood of air that heats by compression on its way to the  coast. That Santa Ana condition produced four days of temperatures in the 100s  in Los Angeles and made El Toro in Orange County the hottest spot in the nation  with 112 degrees on Thursday.  </P> <P> Temperatures Saturday were still about 20 degrees above normal for this time of  year. At the Civic Center, the high of 91 was 2 degrees warmer than the  previous record high of 89 set in 1899 and tied in 1987.  </P> <P> Dittmann predicted that today would be more comfortable, with highs in the 60s  and 70s near the coast, in the low to mid-90s in the warmest inland valley and  in the mid-80s at the Civic Center.  </P> <P> The forecast through Monday calls for sunny days and fair nights, with a few  morning coastal low clouds.  </P> <P> At White Memorial Medical Center on the Eastside, a Boyle Heights woman, who  was hospitalized with an elevated temperature and fast pulse Friday evening,  died of apparent cardiac arrest, a hospital spokeswoman said Saturday.  </P> <P> Nursing Supervisor Mary Latner said that while the heat "certainly didn't help"  Barbara Zavaleta, 50, it was not possible to determine whether it contributed  to her death. An autopsy is pending, Latner said.  </P> <P> While Saturday's skies were generally sunny and blue, smog stained metropolitan  Los Angeles, the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, the Riverside-San Bernardino  areas and -- in a reversal of the usual pattern -- the beaches.  </P> <P> "We're having a smog attack," said Los Angeles County Lifeguard Capt. Don  Rohrer, who commands a beach area running from Marina del Rey to Topanga. "All  that smog that's blown off the city is hovering over the beach here. It's a  condition that we don't face often. Visibility is down to about a mile and a  half."  </P> <P> Despite the smog, however, Rohrer said more than 100,000 beach-goers had  thronged into his area to enjoy 80-degree temperatures and water temperatures  in the low 60s.  </P> <P> To the north, Lt. Roger Smith estimated that 100,000 more people had crowded  beaches from Topanga to the Ventura County line. To the south, Capt. Steve  Voorhees expected 200,000 to jam the oceanfront from Playa del Rey to Cabrillo  Beach.  </P> <P> Patients were cooler at the UCLA Medical Center, where a fire Thursday night  knocked out air conditioning for the hospital. Spokesman Rick Elbaum said the  patient areas were "almost back to normal" on Saturday.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alok Mehta: "Arjun Singh's Disapproval of Prime </F> Minister Rao Continues"; all quotations marks as published]    [Text] New Delhi, 31 March. Despite attaining a clear  majority in the Lok Sabha and having a marginal victory in the  vidhan sabha elections, central minister Arjun Singh's rebel  attitude against Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's policies and  leadership has not changed. The latest proof of this attitude is  Mr. Singh's opposition to the government policies related to  GATT and refusing to speak in the defense of the government on  this subject in the Parliament.    After the division of the Janata Dal and the results of the  Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Rao's supporters have been saying for  the last 3-4 months that Mr. Arjun Singh had met with Mr. Rao  and yielded to him politically. Mr. Singh's group getting an  important victory in Madhya Pradesh and agreement of the two  leaders over several public programs are also being considered  as good signs. However, Mr. Singh has once again given the  impression of his going in an opposing direction to the Congress  Party now that the Narasimha Rao government is once again on  trial like in 1992. Interestingly, the leadership of the  five-member cabinet sub-committee formed according to the prime  minister's wishes to respond to the political attacks on GATT by  the opposition was given to Arjun Singh. However, instead of  protecting it, he ``drove a nail in the bosom of the strong  government.'' In addition to Mr. Singh, Finance Minister Dr.  Manmohan Singh, Commerce Minister Pranab Mukherji, Agriculture  Minister Balram Jakhad, and Science Minister Ramlakahn Singh  Yadav are members of this sub-committee.    Mr. Singh started to touch on the sensitive issues related  to  the GATT agreement in the first two meetings of the  sub-committee and created new problems for Dr. Manmohan Singh  and Pranab Mukherji. Mr. Singh showed his agreement with the  views of the opposition and expressed the fear that by signing  the new GATT agreement we were mortgaging our freedom. "This  decision is like inviting the East India Company again," he  said. We cannot play the role of the last ruler before the  British empire began. Pranab Mukherji and Dr. Manmohan Singh  tried to explain each issue and said that the government has not  ignored India's interests. Every step is being taken very  carefully. However, Mr. Singh was not satisfied. As the result  of this, the other four ministers started to kold separate  discussions.    During that time, on the prime minister's advice,  Parliamentary Minister Vidyacharan Shukla, while acting as the  leader of the Congress Parliamentary group, asked Arjun Singh,  Pranab Mukherji, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and Balram Jakhad to write  a letter in defense of GATT. The remaining three ministers kept  the order of the party leadership in mind and tried their best  to defend the government's stand. However, Mr. Singh sent an  oral message saying that he was not ready to defend the  government on this subject. The political circles consider this  action of ignoring the responsibilities as a member of the  central cabinet and disregarding party leadership's directive  very significant.    Arjun Singh's supporters claim that Mr. Singh took this step  after a lot of thought. In December 1992, Mr. Singh had  expressed open disagreement with the central cabinet's policies  before the disputed structure was torn down and had left for  Ayodhya. Now, by staying out of the GATT agreement, Mr. Singh  can determine a new political equation.</p>

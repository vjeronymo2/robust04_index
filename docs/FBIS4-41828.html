			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Ukrainian Central Electoral Commission is still  counting the results of the elections held on Sunday [26 June].  However, officials in Kiev are by now convinced that Leonid  Kravchuk is in the lead in the vote count. INTERFAX has learned  this from the head of the Ukrainian president's information  service, Vladimir Shlyaposhnikov.    Unofficial data for 1000 today, as received by INTERFAX,  show  that the gap between the present head of state and his main  rival in the elections, Leonid Kuchma, is about two million  votes. The situation is as yet unclear only in Donetsk and  Ivano-Frankovsk oblasts.</p>

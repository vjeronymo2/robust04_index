			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / International Company News: Hudson's Bay takes over Canadian retailing rival in deal worth CDollars 100m HUDSON'S BAY, Canada's biggest department store group, is taking over troubled Woodward's, the oldest name in western Canada retailing. The deal is estimated to be worth nearly CDollars 100m (USDollars 80.3m). The Bay intends to turn some of Woodward's best store sites into Bay and Zellers units. Bay's national market share will rise from 22 per cent to almost 25 per cent. 'We will buy Woodward's shares and gain all its assets, including accumulated tax losses,' said Mr Gary Lukassen, the Bay's executive vice-president for finance. The Toronto-based retailer, now 25 per cent owned by the Kennes Thomson family, will dramatically raise its market share in western Canada and gain valuable properties. Woodward's had filed for court protection after heavy losses and mounting debts. It had closed its Vancouver flagship store and laid off 1,500 employees. The group has 14 stores in British Columbia and 11 in Alberta. In the nine months ended December 31 last, the company lost CDollars 80.6m on revenues of CDollars 245m. The Bay said it would close some Woodward's stores and lay off more employees. Under the Bay deal, senior creditors of Woodward's, including Cambridge Shopping Centres, will be secured in full. Cambridge holds 23 per cent of Woodward's stock, and loaned CDollars 20m to the retailer last year. Unsecured creditors will get 35 cents on the dollar, unsecured noteholders 30 cents, and common shareholders between 35 and 45 cents a share.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Peter Boross named to succeed Hungarian premier The Hungarian Democratic Forum, Hungary's governing conservative party, last night named Mr Peter Boross, interior minister, to succeed Mr Jozsef Antall, the late premier, Nicholas Denton reports. Mr Boross won the nomination by a surprisingly comfortable margin and it now remains for President Arpad Goncz to formally propose him for premiership and parliament to approve the choice. Political continuity is indicated by the fact that Mr Boross, aged 65 and formerly an executive at a catering company, came to high political office under the sponsorship of Mr Antall. But the nominee's blunt rhetoric places him to the right of his predecessor.</p>

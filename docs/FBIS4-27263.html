			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 1 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  returned to the trade negotiating table Wednesday [1 Jun] on a  note of guarded optimism after a hiatus of three and a half  months.    Negotiators picked up the talks on the insurance sector,  which both sides have said is nearest to resolution, with the  American side hinting at compromise.    "I gather there's an atmosphere of optimism that we are  going  to move forward," a U.S. official said of the insurance talks  that are to run through Thursday in Tokyo.    "The U.S. is going to be more flexible but we're not going  to  throw everything overboard," said the official who asked not to  be named. The American negotiators are sticking to their basic  positions but be more open to Japanese suggestions, he said.    But Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii has indicated  Tokyo has no new offers and both sides were cautious on the  immediate prospects.    A Japanese official said Wednesday's talks would likely just  reconfirm progress made before the bilateral trade "framework"  talks ruptured in February over how to gauge progress in opening  Japanese markets.    Another Japanese official said he did not expect to flesh  out  Tokyo's proposal to institute an insurance broker system, a key  U.S. demand, as a major newspaper reported Wednesday.    The U.S. official said, "we'll just have to see how things  go  in this first round -- whether we move forward or just get  stuck."    Asked if both sides could wrap up an agreement on insurance  in two days, lead U.S. negotiator Ira Wolf, assistant trade  representative for Japan and China, smiled and said, "we'll see."    The Japanese team is headed by Eisuke Sakakibara, deputy  chief of the International Finance Bureau at the Finance  Ministry.    The trade framework talks broke down Feb. 11, when then  Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton could not  agree on the "objective criteria" called for in the framework  accord signed last July.    But both sides say the insurance sector -- unlike the other  priority areas of government procurement and automobiles and car  parts -- are less likely to revert to bickering over whether  U.S. demands amount to "numerical targets."    Indeed, the U.S. is urging Japan to go slow in opening the  foreign-dominated "third sector" of insurance that includes  accident, nursing care and disease coverage.    A U.S. diplomat said in Tokyo recently that there are  problems applying objective market access criteria to heavily  regulated areas such as insurance. And a senior Japanese  Finance Ministry official said the U.S. agrees such yardsticks  are not appropriate for the sector.    The two countries are to resume the auto and parts talks  Thursday in Washington and the talks on Japanese Government  procurement of medical equipment and telecommunications Friday  in Tokyo.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 'HERE WE ARE AGAIN!' -- CREW OF DISCOVERY READY FOR LAUNCH  </P> <P> The shuttle Discovery's crew flew back to Florida on Sunday for blastoff  Tuesday on a critical flight to carry the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope  into orbit, 14 days late because of hydraulic problems.  </P> <P> "Well, here we are again!" Discovery skipper Loren J. Shriver said shortly  after the crew arrived.  </P> <P> "We feel very confident that things are going to go well this time."  </P> <P> Air Force meteorologists predicted a 70% chance of good weather at launch time  Tuesday, although an approaching frontal system could cause problems should it  slow down or stall today as it moves through the area.  </P> <P> With Discovery's countdown ticking smoothly toward a second launch attempt,  engineers Sunday hauled another shuttle, Columbia, from the cavernous Vehicle  Assembly Building to pad 39A for liftoff May 16 to ferry a battery of more  modest telescopes into space.  </P> <P> Discovery is making its 10th flight. If all goes well, Shriver, 45; co-pilot  Charles F. Bolden, 43; Steven A. Hawley, 38; Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn  D. Sullivan, 38, will blast off on the 35th shuttle mission at 5:31 a.m. PDT  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Vice President Dan Quayle, chairman of the National Space Council, may attend  the launching if his schedule permits, sources said.  </P> <P> Discovery's first launch try was called off just four minutes prior to liftoff  April 10 after one of three auxiliary power units, or APUs, malfunctioned. The  APUs pressurize the shuttle's hydraulic system for steering during launch and  their operation is crucial for a safe flight.  </P> <P> The crew is scheduled to deploy the Hubble Space Telescope on Wednesday. Once  the instrument is checked out and operating on its own, the astronauts will  devote the remainder of their five-day mission to a series of relatively minor  experiments before gliding to a touchdown at Edwards Air Force Base on Sunday.  </P></p>

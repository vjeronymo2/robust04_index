			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Shares in Boots rise 19p after optimistic statement BOOTS' share price rose 4 per cent yesterday following a cheerful trading statement from Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, at the annual meeting. Sir Christopher said sales of the diversified retailing group were up 11 per cent since the beginning of its financial year on April 1 - in spite of the weak market background. 'We are bucking the trend,' he said. The company's statement contrasted sharply with the weak retail sales for June released by the Central Statistical Office earlier this week, which showed a 0.2 per cent drop on the preceding month. Shares in Boots closed up 19p at 447p. Boots the Chemist, which forms the group's core, reported sales up 13 per cent over last year. It said it had benefited from strong sales of hay-fever medicines and sun lotions because of the warm weather in May. However, all of Boots' other retail chains, which have performed more weakly during the recession, also recorded good sales increases. Halfords, the car parts business which has struggled since being bought as part of the Ward White acquisition three years ago, recorded an 8 per cent increase in sales in spite of the closure of several small stores. Meanwhile, sales at Childrens World and Boots Opticians rose by 14 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Fierce discounting affected the company's DIY businesses, but the paint and wallpaper business AG Stanley, which runs the Fads high street chain, lifted sales by 3.5 per cent and Do-It-All, the joint venture with WH Smith, achieved a 10 per cent advance. The pharmaceuticals division managed to increase sales by 11 per cent. Its Manoplax drug, developed for the treatment of congestive heart failure, is in the late stages of registration in several markets. Some shareholders criticised the 54 per cent increase in the collective pay of the directors, but others argued that it was merited given the solid financial performance of the group.

Mr Kadi was "necklaced".    The ANC said in a statement: "the tribal chief of Motswedi,  Ramokopane Lentswe, has issued a statement saying that (Mr) Kadi  was murdered by angry villagers and not members of the ANC.    "The ANC Western Transvaal region is categorically  distancing  itself from this murder and condemns in no unce?tain terms the  callous murder of (Mr) Kadi.    "Although we understand the anger of the people who have  been  enslaved by (former Bophuthatswana President Lucas) Mangope for  the past 16 years, we won't condone any murder of any kind".</p>

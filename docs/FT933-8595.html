			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / International Company News: Daiwa Bank rescues brokerage DAIWA BANK has stepped in to rescue Cosmo Securities, a second-tier Japanese broker which yesterday reported an extraordinary loss of Y69.8bn (Dollars 677m) due to tobashi, or manipulation of its clients' accounts. Daiwa will become the first bank to hold a stockbroking subsidiary, even though Japanese banks are not yet permitted to own brokerages. Osaka-based Daiwa, a leading creditor of Cosmo, will inject between Y70bn and Y80bn through an emergency third-party share allotment. It will in effect acquire over 50 per cent of the broker, whose liabilities exceeded total assets by Y7.1bn, paralysing its operations. Concern among the financial authorities was highlighted by a hastily-called press conference by Mr Hirohisa Fujii, finance minister. Mr Fujii stressed the importance of Cosmo's rescue to prevent any confusion on the stock market and to protect Cosmo's employees. However, the revelations may hit the Tokyo stock market, which has stabilised after a three-year decline that stemmed partly from scandals involving brokers' links with gangsters, stock price manipulation and compensations to favoured customers. Ministry of Finance officials admitted they had not known of transactions which started in 1987, and of the extensive losses Cosmo suffered when it could not find new homes for the accounts of some 20 clients. Last year, the ministry reprimanded Cosmo in a separate case involving tobashi, transferring loss-making stocks from client account to client account in an attempt to avoid booking the loss. The finance ministry has drawn up plans to investigate the country's 48 brokers, although it maintained Cosmo was likely to be an isolated case. However, it is unlikely that Cosmo will be able to distribute dividends on its stocks, and the move is expected to be a financial burden on Daiwa, which plans to use its own funds for the bail-out. Moody's, the investment rating agency, said it placed under review for possible downgrade both long- and short-term ratings of Daiwa Bank and its guaranteed subsidiaries, in response to the bank's announcement that it would acquire Cosmo Securities, AP-DJ reports. About Dollars 1.4bn of long-term debt is affected, the agency said.</p>

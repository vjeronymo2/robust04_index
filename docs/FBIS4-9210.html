			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Bucharest Radio Romania Network in  Romanian at 0811 GMT on 21 April carries a 76-minute live relay  from the Mihail Kogalniceanu Hall of the Parliament Palace in  Bucharest of the official opening of the Crans Montana Forum.    The opening session is attended by Catherine Lalumiere,  acting secretary general of the Council of Europe; Jean Paul  Carteron, chairman of the Crans Montana Forum Foundation; and  Romanian President Ion Iliescu. Also attending, the announcer  notes, are six heads of state, nine prime ministers and deputy  prime ministers, five speakers and deputy speakers of  parliaments, 12 foreign ministers, 12 general secretaries of  international organizations, 20 other ministers, ambassadors,  members of the diplomatic corps, political personalities, and  businessmen. The session is also attended by PLO Chairman Yasir  'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres.    At 0815 GMT the session is opened by Jean Paul Carteron, who  speaks in French with simultaneous translation into Romanian.  He thanks the guests for attending this "important forum, whose  activity is devoted to developing and boosting international  cooperation," and the Romanian leadership, President Ion  Iliescu, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, and the chairmen of  the two chambers of Parliament, for the "extraordinary work they  have done, without which we would not be able to meet here now."  After praising Bucharest and Romania as the "beacon of  Latinity," Carteron greets "Chairman 'Arafat and Foreign  Minister Peres," who have "used this occasion to continue their  negotiations to further the peace process." He outlines the  main issues on the agenda, including the "Black Sea, the  Balkans, Central Asia, and the North-West and South-West  relationship in the Mediterranean basin" as well as the "free  trade exchange and its contribution to overall political  stability, regional cooperation, the European Union, the  Partnership for Peace scheme, and preventive diplomacy."  Referring to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, he says "hope  has not yet been vanquished, since hope is so necessary now, if  do not want to fall prey to despair." He invites President  Iliescu to take the floor.    At 0830 GMT Romanian President Ion Iliescu begins his  address  in Romanian. He welcomes in particular "Chairman 'Arafat and  Mr. Shim'on Peres, who have been negotiating since last night.  The negotiations were resumed this morning, and we hope that  this is a positive sign."    He proceeds to review Romania's history, reiterating the  country's "long standing European vocation and awareness." In  this context, the emphasizes the importance of Transylvania as  "the cradle of the Romanian nation's formation, culture, and  civilization," adding that, throughout history, "Romania's  disadvantage has been its geographical placing at the confluence  of the interests of various empires competing for domination in  this region."    Returning to the present, Iliescu says that Romania is going  through a "historical stage of profound and complex changes on  all planes," adding that "the bases were laid for a democratic  society and the state of law, which are reflected in the  country's new Constitution." He points to the "difficult  process of the restructuring of the national economy -- a most  complex and painful process, with social costs, which is taking  place against the background of economic crisis." He says that  the interest of all political forces in Romania in this  "difficult transition period" is the same, namely to  "consolidate democratic accomplishments and ensure the  development of the Romanian economy, on new, efficient, and  dynamic bases."    Referring to the "deepening economic gaps at the world  level,  which are hampering the access of all countries to the benefits  of the contemporary technological progress," he says that this  is bound to lead to tensions, "including social tensions in the  developed countries themselves" and to a "further polarization  of wealth and poverty at the world level, which can provoke a  new mass migration of hundreds of millions of poor people from  Africa and Asia toward the rich countries of Europe and North  America."    Iliescu emphasizes that the "fate of Europe, of those from  the west, center, and east of the continent is the same,  provided that we achieve an optimal framework of partnership  among equals, not of subordination of the weak to the powerful."  He adds that the "political and military barrier that separated  our continent should not be replaced by an economic one."    Referring to the Partnership for Peace, he says that Romania  is "looking with interest" to this scheme, which is meant "to  ensure equal security for all states in the region and avoid  discriminatory approaches, capable of generating new sources of  tension at a regional level."    At 0843 GMT Catherine Lalumiere, acting secretary general  of the Council of Europe, begins her speech, in French with  superimposed translation into Romanian, by thanking the Romanian  authorities for having organized the forum and praising the  "long distance covered by Romania" in the past four years along  the road of democracy. "You have even managed to tame this  enormous palace, the megalomaniac's palace, which is a  masterpiece of the Romanian people's toil." She then proceeds  to discuss the "deep changes" currently taking place in Europe  and their "particularly positive impact" on the rapprochement  between East and West Europe, designed to achieve the  "establishment of a common European home, as President Gorbachev  called it, which should stretch all the way from the Atlantic up  to Vladivostok." After assessing various trends currently under  way in Europe, Lalumiere points out a number of "unavoidable"  problems related to the transition period in East Europe that  still need to be solved, such as the Western assistance granted  to those countries, the democratization of their societies, the  establishment of the rule-of-law state, and the fundamental  changes in the people's mentality. She also refers in passing to  other negative aspects, such as the "Zhirinovskiy phenomenon" in  Russia, the hardships faced by Ukraine, various obstacles raised  to "political and economic reform" in the former communist  countries, galloping unemployment, low living standards, popular  discontent, and so forth. On top of all this comes a "crisis of  values" determined by the loss of the "system of reference,  which the vanquished Marxist-Leninist ideology represented," and  the "fascination with the consumption society," which causes a  run for "easy money." She stresses that the changes are not  over yet and that there will be "many turning points this part  of Europe will have to face yet." For instance, "Russia's  opening to Europe is an accomplished fact, but the question  remains what will happen in Russia after the latest elections,"  because that country seems to "oscillate between opening to  Europe and returning to its own self." Catherine Lalumiere  condemns the rise of nationalism in its extremist forms, noting  that "almost no country has been spared this trend," which is  manifest not only in Eastern and Central Europe but also in  Western countries, such as Italy, Great Britain, Belgium, Spain,  and France. Lalumiere emphasizes the need for "social justice  and human rights," criticizing the widening gap between East and  West, saying that "it would be a catastrophe if the iron curtain  is replaced by a financial and economic curtain." She then  proceeds to outline, in general terms, the efforts made in  recent years by the Council of Europe to help solve these "huge  problems, compared to which our means are totally insufficient."  After pleading for the establishment of "coherence" among  European countries and their international institutions and  expressing her gratitude to the Romanian people, Lalumiere  concludes her speech at 0926 GMT. She hands over the medal of  the Council of Europe to President Ion Iliescu. The live relay  ends at 0927 GMT.</p>

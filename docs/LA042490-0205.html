			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT DO THE WOMEN DO?  </P> <P> If the coffee shop is the sole dominion of the male in Egypt, it is not because  women are confined to home -- at least, not always.  </P> <P> While her husband sips and smokes at the corner cafe, the modern Egyptian  professional woman is likely to be lunching with her girlfriends at a five-star  hotel or meeting her sister downtown for a pastry and a cup of tea.  </P> <P> After hours, the more westernized Egyptian woman can be spotted at nightclubs  and discotheques all over the city, dancing to Madonna and Prince in skirts  hiked up to there. But only in the company of her husband or boyfriend.  </P> <P> Traditional Egyptians still frown on Muslim women prancing around town  unescorted, and the typical social setting for most women remains the home,  sharing coffee and gossip with friends or relatives, or calling, with their  husbands and children, on family for Friday afternoon lunch.  </P> <P> Even in cosmopolitan Cairo, women from the most traditional families never  emerge from the house unveiled and are seldom seen in the family reception room  when their husbands are dining with male friends.  </P> <P> Only during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan can women be seen venturing  across the hallowed threshold of a coffee shop -- and then, for the most part,  only safely in the company of a husband or brother.  </P> <P> But Egypt, with its reputation as the sin center of the Middle East, is if  anything less restrictive than most other Arab countries, where segregation of  the sexes, at least in public and most especially in the coffee shop, is most  often the rule.  </P> <P> Tunisian and Algerian coffee shops are constantly bubbling over with scores of  rowdy young men, and in Saudi Arabia, women seldom venture into restaurants  with men -- even their husbands -- let alone the sacred dens where Saudis drink  their coffee.

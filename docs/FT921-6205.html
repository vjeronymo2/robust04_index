			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Summit agrees action on cocaine PRESIDENT George Bush and leaders from six Latin American nations yesterday concluded a two-day drug summit in San Antonio, Texas, by announcing measures to promote co-operation in their war against drugs, writes Damian Fraser from San Antonio. However, the US refused to give any new money to the Latin nations, despite repeated requests from Peru for more aid. President George Bush said 'we are dealing in a time of sparse resources. We don't have all the money to spend on all the programmes we think are worthwhile.' The seven nations did agree to set up a permanent structure for an annual meeting to co-ordinate the fight against drugs. They will also seek to curb the trade in chemicals necessary for the processing of cocaine, and help each other in spotting and seizing aircraft used for drugs trafficking. They announced their intention to seek further financial aid from Japan and Europe to support the campaign.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / International Company News: Arab bank buys stake in Perrier ARAB Banking Corporation, the Bahrain-based bank, yesterday disclosed it had acquired a 1.4 per cent holding in Perrier, the French mineral water company being fought over by the Agnelli family of Italy and Nestle, the Swiss food group. Arab Banking acquired more than 130,000 Perrier shares over three days and emerged with a stake of 1.4 per cent. The disclosure of the holding fuelled speculation in Paris that it had been buying Perrier stock on behalf of one of the protagonists in the Agnelli/Nestle fracas. However, Arab Banking said it had bought the shares for its own account. In spite of this, Perrier's shares rose from FFr1,569 to FFr1,575 yesterday. Its shares resumed trading in Paris last Monday having been suspended since mid-December in the wake of the Agnellis' FFr5.6bn (USDollars 1.01bn) bid for Exor, the mineral water company's controlling shareholder. The shares gained 13 per cent during the week - having begun at the suspension price of FFr1,396 - on rumours of a counter-offer to the FFr13.42bn bid by Nestle and Indosuez, the French bank. Perrier ended the week trading far higher than the FFr1,475 offered by Nestle and Indosuez. Next week the Perrier battle moves into the legal arena. The critical question is whether the French commercial courts will decide in favour of Nestle's application to annul the purchase of 13.8 per cent of Perrier by Saint Louis, the French sugar company allied to the Agnellis. On Wednesday, the Nimes commercial court is due to announce its ruling on the legality of the Saint Louis share purchase. The first of the Paris court rulings is expected next Friday with the final judgment to be delivered on February 25.</p>

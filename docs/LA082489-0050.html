			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Arco Wins Oil Tanker Decision: A federal appellate court upheld the right of  the U.S. Transportation Department to allow two oil tankers owned by Atlantic  Richfield Co. to continue delivering Alaskan oil to the lower 48 states, Arco  announced. The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia  came in a lawsuit by independent tanker owners against the DOT challenging the  use of tankers built with U.S. subsidies and intended for foreign service only.  Such ships are normally barred from domestic service, but two Arco tankers were  allowed to sail in the United States after Arco repaid about $87 million in  subsidies used to build them.  </P></p>

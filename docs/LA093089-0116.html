			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IMPERIAL EXPECTS LOSS IN QUARTER; JUNK BONDS CITED  </P> <P> Imperial Corp. of America, the parent of Imperial Savings of California, said  it expects its third-quarter results to reflect an $80-million after-tax loss  taken on the value of its $1.1-billion junk bond portfolio.  </P> <P> However, ICA declined to estimate what its net loss for the quarter ending  today will be.  </P> <P> The expected loss is a result of provisions in the savings and loan bailout  bill passed by Congress in August that require all S&amp;Ls to sell their junk  bonds by 1994.  </P> <P> ICA spokesman Tim Larrick said the company's interpretation of the legislation  is that the S&amp;L must mark down to market value its entire high-yield,  high-risk junk bond portfolio, which is now worth $130 million less than ICA  paid for it. The after-tax impact of the loss provision will be an $80-million  loss, Larrick said.  </P> <P> In August, before ICA decided that it had to mark down its entire portfolio, it  disclosed in a regulatory filing that the market value of the bonds had  decreased and that they were then worth $88.6 million less than the S&amp;L had  paid for them. Since then, the junk bond market has deteriorated further and  ICA's portfolio has slipped in value to $130 million below its cost, he said.  </P> <P> ICA is in the midst of a restructuring announced in July shortly after the  resignation of President Kenneth Thygerson. In his four years at ICA's helm,  Thygerson led ICA into a variety of non-traditional S&amp;L activities,  including junk bond investments, car loans and mobile home loans.  </P> <P> The restructuring, done at regulators' urging, was prompted by mounting losses  and dwindling capital. ICA's losses for the first six months of this year were  $33.1 million, contrasted with a $16-million profit for the first half of 1988.  The losses have been caused by loss provisions so far this year of $82.2  million, including $28.4 million for junk bond losses.  </P></p>

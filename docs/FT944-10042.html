			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: NW Water considers customer rebates North West Water yesterday joined the growing band of water companies seeking to address the sector's tarnished public image by indicating it was considering customer rebates on water bills. Any such move would be more than a year away, however, as rebates would depend on North West beating operating efficiency targets set by the industry regulator in the recent price review. The indications came in a long-awaited operational review by the new chief executive, Mr Brian Staples, who joined the privatised utility in March from Tarmac, the construction group. Mr Staples yesterday criticised the water sector for giving too many of the 'benefits of outperformance to shareholders and to the balance sheet' during the first five years of privatisation. 'The companies have not done enough to recognise customers,' he said. North West intended to redress the balance initially by investing half the Pounds 230m savings it expected to achieve on capital investment in issues such as foul flooding of customers homes. Shareholders would not be ignored, either. North West said it was confident of surpassing the 5.3 per cent real dividend growth it had achieved since 1989. However, the company would not be drawn into a dividend race, said Mr Staples. Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell of brokers NatWest Securities estimates that North West will achieve average dividend growth above inflation of between 6 and 7 per cent.</p>

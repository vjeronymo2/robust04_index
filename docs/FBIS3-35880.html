			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Parliamentary Speaker Anatolijs Gorbunovs, in an  interview to the Baltic News Service, today expressed the view  that it is premature to take the decision to hold a referendum  on the issue of the Skrunda radar. Gorbunovs does not consider  the holding of the referendum the best political means to tackle  the problem of the Skrunda radar at the moment, because in that  case the inter-state talks with Russia on troop withdrawal could  come to a halt. The discontinuation of the talks in the present  Latvian situation would be very undesirable, Gorbunovs stressed.    The visit of the Saeima delegation to the United States  shows  that possibilities of tackling issues related to the withdrawal  of the Russian army have not been exhausted, Gorbunovs said.  According to him, at the moment Latvia's main opportunity for  tackling the issue of the army withdrawal is to continue  interstate talks with Russia.    The Latvian National Security Council has not passed a  specific resolution on holding a referendum on the Skrunda radar  issue, because a law on referenda has not been passed.  According to Gorbunovs, the drafting of such a law would take  about one month.</p>

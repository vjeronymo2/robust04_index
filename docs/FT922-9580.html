			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Philips up 29% in first term PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics company, posted a 29 per cent rise in net profit in the first quarter of 1992, although operating profit showed a much smaller increase because of the continuing malaise in the company's key consumer electronics sector. Net profit climbed to Fl 174m (Dollars 94m) in the first three months of 1992 from Fl 135m a year earlier. The rise was substantially aided by a Fl 65m decline in financing charges, which helped to compensate for the more modest 5 per cent increase in operating profit to Fl 685m from Fl 655m. Sales were up 4 per cent at Fl 12.96bn. Philips' biggest product group, consumer products, saw operating profits plummet to Fl 106m from Fl 298m, as losses in colour televisions and other types of consumer electronics more than outweighed the advances achieved by domestic appliances and PolyGram, the group's 80 per cent-owned London-based music company. Mr Henk Appelo, group finance director, described the operating losses in consumer electronics, at less than Fl 100m, as 'satisfactory', given the fierce, world-wide competition which led to a 5 per cent decline in the price of consumer electronics early in 1992. A year earlier, consumer electronics had posted operating profits of around Fl 100m. Apart from consumer electronics, the company's other three main businesses turned in strong profit improvements. Philips' lighting division - the world's largest manufacturer of light bulbs  - posted a 74 per cent rise in operating profits, while professional products and semi-conductors/components improved 85 per cent and 50 per cent respectively. The 'Centurion' cost-cutting programme launched by Mr Jan Timmer, Philips president, in late 1990 is producing results. The workforce of 240,000 was, on average, 27,000 lower than a year earlier, producing savings of Fl 450m. However, half of these savings were eliminated by average wage rises of 5 per cent for the remaining employees. Mr Appelo repeated the group's forecast of 'limited' increases in sales and net profits from normal business activities for the full year 1992.</p>

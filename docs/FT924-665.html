			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Major loses his jovial 'Mr Fixit' MR Tristan Garel-Jones, the minister for Europe who announced his imminent resignation yesterday, is not only part-architect, part-pilot of the Maastricht treaty who passionately pushes the case for Europe. He is also a hate figure for Tory Euro-sceptics, the target chosen by Maastricht's opponents when direct attacks on the prime minister smacked of spite and disloyalty. He has withstood the jibes and whispering campaigns with relish. Now he has decided to make a break. Last night there was nothing to suggest that his reasons for going from next spring - time to see the Maastricht bill through its Commons stages - were not genuine. He has a Spanish wife, five children, business interests, a passion for painting and a house in Spain. The loss of a senior minister responsible for a central part of government policy will not help Mr John Major after a bruising six months. The two have been close allies since they entered politics; the prime minister has depended on Mr Garel-Jones's skills during a troublesome EC presidency. He spent eight years in the Whips office before becoming a foreign minister. He rose to deputy chief whip, his 'wet' Conservative instincts more than outweighed - in the eyes of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister  -by his cunning and badgering prowess. In 1990 he offered to resign, saying he was fed up with the hours and with being the only whip who thoroughly understood parliament's complex procedures. But Mrs Thatcher gave him a job at the Foreign Office that matched his enthusiasms. The same year, he was accused by the Tory right of plotting to bring Mrs Thatcher down. A crucial meeting of ministers was held at his London house during the leadership bid of Mr Michael Heseltine, now trade and industry secretary; his version is that the meeting was just drinks with friends. His joviality does not always compensate for a frantic lifestyle jetting across Europe. At night he reads the 'red boxes' of official documents in bed, scribbling witty - sometimes deeply undiplomatic - asides in the margins. In spite of the jesting, he does not like Euro-sceptics' charges that he is 'a Euro-freak'. The European Community, he told a fringe meeting at the Conservative party conference in October, 'is the most frustrating, pusillanimous organisation you have ever come across'. He campaigned for Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to replace Mrs Thatcher as prime minister. He says it was an act of loyalty - but he is clearly at ease under Mr Major, whose down-to-earth style matches his own. Mr Garel Jones first told the prime minister he wanted to step down last summer, but his love of cut-and-thrust politics makes it hard to see how he will manage to distance himself completely from the Whitehall machine.</p>

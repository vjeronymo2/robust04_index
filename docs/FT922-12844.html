			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (7): The renaissance filled his sails - The Europe in which Columbus launched his great adventure NO-ONE should belittle Spain's determination to make the world recognise 1992 as a turning point in its modern history. The Spanish regard their homeland as Western Europe's last frontier. Five hundred years ago it still remained undecided whether their portion of the Iberian Peninsula formed the northernmost outpost of Africa or the south-western extremity of Christendom. Spain was located on the wrong side of the Pyrenees. More, it had been occupied by the Moslems too long, in parts for almost 800 years. And who ruled Spain? Kings or cardinals or robber knights or the Hermandad, the powerful organisation of 'brotherhoods' that originated as a militia policing the regions and doubled as a national tax-collecting agency? But times were ready for change when IsabelIa of Castile married Ferdinand of Aragon in 1469, against strong popular feeling in both states and while neither was as yet a crowned head. The financing of Ferdinand's suit, quite beyond the capacity of his bankrupt father King John of Aragon, was provided by Jewish financiers in the royal employ, acting in collusion with a Catalan official of the Vatican, the future Borgia Pope Alexander VI. IsabelIa was 18, Ferdinand a year younger. Unlike Portugal, which prospered by espousing the Atlantic as a second province, Spain was an unmade bed. Much of Andalucia in the south still remained Moslem territory. The Reconquista, called a crusade, was not yet completed in 1491. Concentration on the mission had created an inward-looking Spanish people of passionate intensity. This was accompanied by intermarriage on a scale to make it difficult to discern whether an individual was of Christian or Hebrew or Arab descent. A mountainous land dry as dust bred a dogged population attached to their patch. This national introspection goes some way to account for the ferocity of the Civil War in the 20th century which cost three quarters of a million lives, and the fact that Spain kept out of this century's two great European conflagrations. The voyage of Christopher Columbus as a Spanish enterprise owed nothing to the young monarchs' empire-building desires. They had no such ambition. The man from Genoa had peddled his proposition to a succession of rulers, but without success. He first appealed to King John of Portugal, only to be rebuffed. Columbus next approached Isabella and Ferdinand, again being refused. Then, in desperation, he besought the brilliant Regent of France, Anne of Beaujeu; and finally Henry VII of England. None was interested. They exhausted their wealth in battles over ownership of a town, or a river, or a forest within Europe. But they were deaf to the concept of a second shore to the Atlantic where, according to Columbus, realms beyond dreams were available for the taking. He returned to Spain, waiting impatiently outside the royal headquarters during the protracted campaign against Granada. Years passed before the Queen's advisers, notably the baptised Jew Luis de Santangel, persuaded her to grant Columbus her patronage. What had she to lose, they urged, with a negligible gamble of three tiny caravels? They had just hoisted the royal standard, together with a huge silver cross given by the Pope, on the Alhambra, the defeated Moorish kingdom's architectural masterpiece. Because Columbus stole the historic moment for his perilous adventure into the unknown, the immense strategic achievement in closing the Straits of Gibraltar against exit by Ottoman fleets remained for a time unremarked. It was as crucial to the future of the European races as the annexation of America. The Catholic monarchs had thereby locked the Sultan of Turkey within the Mediterranean. Had the Sublime Porte been able to pass its ships into the Atlantic it could well have encircled this continent. Turkey was already master of the greater portion of south-eastern Europe. Western countries lay unprotected on their oceanic side, the Portuguese being too few to engage a major enemy. France was preoccupied with internal consolidation and in eternal dispute with others over the Low Countries, while England had not yet recovered from the wounds of the Hundred Years War or the Wars of the Roses. To be sure, Turkey may not have succeeded in replacing Christianity with Islam in Europe, but physical control was all the Crescent aspired to, as in the Balkans. Ventures deep into the Atlantic would then have been automatic, with the New World doubtless given another conqueror and a different history. Moslem mariners were no less skilled than the European, as witness their navigation of the Indian Ocean as far as the Malabar coast. Portuguese ships hugged the western shores of Africa but had not as yet properly rounded the Cape. Amazingly, Europe itself, when Columbus planted Isabella's banner on the Arawak island he baptised San Salvador on October 12, 1492, counted no more than as a mere promontory hanging precariously over the ledge of Asia. Europe comprised a jigsaw of statelets torn by perennial strife. Eastwards, Europe was ever dangerously exposed to a resolute predator. Following the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 there seemed no stopping the Turk. He would reach the outskirts of Vienna in 1519, to hold the Austrian capital in siege for a further century and a half. He had swallowed Hungary and threatened Poland, while Muscovy had only recently shaken off Tatar tutelage. Only in 1571 did Spain, now the greatest European power, manage to clip the Sultan's sails at Lepanto in Greek waters, where Cervantes lost an arm. The long retreat and decline of the Ottomans on land had not yet begun. Returning to the annus mirabilis of 1492, we find the young Ferdinand mostly apathetic to Columbus and the consequences of a new continent joined to Spain. Ownership of the colonies came specifically to Isabella's Castile. Ferdinand was busy scheming his way into the possession of the southern half of Italy. A minor princeling on his marriage, he founded a dynasty destined for the ultimate tiara available to a European monarch - the crown of the Holy Roman Empire. Of the offspring from his union with Isabella two girls survived - the demented Joanna and the unhappy Katharine, first wife of Henry VIII. Joanna proved the vessel in which the great design was consummated. Her marriage to a Habsburg produced Charles V, the king-emperor reigning over half of Europe and extensive dominions across the world. The last of his line, Dr. Otto von Habsburg, has renounced all claims to a throne and today sits in the European parliament as a representative of Bavaria. So is this the picture to set the scene for the Quincentenary? Crowns lost, empires rising and declining, a theatre of global proportions with entire populations observing the spectacle? Hardly. The year 1492 heralded the Europeans' domination of the rest not only by the prerogative of conquest but also through the sinews of trade and the spirit of the Renaissance. Commerce reached global dimensions with the overseas acquisitions of the two Iberian powers east and west. The world's abundance funnelled into Lisbon and Seville, eclipsing Venice in the process. Lombard and Flemish bankers lubricated the system and promoted Antwerp to Europe's premier metropolis. Capitalism came into its own. Peruvian silver soon flooded into Europe to create new money markets and destabilise currencies. Within 100 years both Portugal and Spain faltered, losing their capability to sustain their distant possessions. The field cleared for successor empires, English, French and Dutch. Simultaneously, Europeans began exploring new frontiers of the mind. The Renaissance might be described as a rediscovery by man of his own emotional creativity. Out of Italy, impotent plaything of Franco-Spanish rivalries, the shoots grew into a dazzling cultural and intellectual harvest. This began in Tuscany, more exactly Medicean Florence, then spread throughout western Europe. European philosophers, artists and theologians dared to challenge a doctrine that pronounced every human endeavour to be directed by God's will, unless foiled by the Anti-Christ. Thomas More's Utopia, published in 1516, was inspired by news of a virgin civilisation across the Atlantic to advance the idea of a state based on social justice, tolerance of all religions. The work exerted a profound influence on some clerics, among them Bartolome de Las Casas, a friar domiciled in Mexico, who had the ear of the Emperor Charles V. In consequence of Las Casas' agitation against his fellow-colonists for their inhuman treatment of their slaves, Charles ordered stringent rules to protect the surviving Indian tribes - too late, unhappily, to avoid a genocidal catastrophe. Current attitudes induce a cynicism regarding the intentions of Columbus, and Spain, in bringing European religion, with its social and cultural mores, to corrupt the innocents of the new territories. We protest too much. Three hundred years after the Discoverer sailed, and with the American War of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man already history, Britain began a colonisation of Australia. The result for the aboriginal population there equalled that earlier epoch of expropriation drenched with slaughter.

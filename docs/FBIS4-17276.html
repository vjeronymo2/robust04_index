			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Friends of `Accord'"] </F>   [Text] The publication of an appeal by the initiators of  the "Accord for Russia" movement has elicited a wide response in  practically all parts of the Russian Federation. This is borne  out by the mail addressed to Valeriy Zorkin, Gennadiy Zyuganov,  Mikhail Lapshin, Aleksandr Rutskoy, Sergey Glazyev, and the  other cofounders. They receive more than 500 individual and  collective letters every day.    The call to unite patriotic forces has already been  supported  in official statements by more than 6,000 labor collectives,  villagers, students, and even groups of senior pupils. They are  all prepared actively to promote the movement's noble aims and  to set up organizing subdivisions in the provinces. The ideas  of accord and of strengthening the Russian State are becoming a  consolidating factor for people of not only different ages but  also professions and political orientations, even including  voters who recently supported "Russia's Choice."    The largest number of proposals to set up "Accord for  Russia"  organizing groups has come from Altay and Krasnoyarsk Krays and  Volgograd, Leningrad, Moscow, Nizhniy Novgorod, Novosibirsk,  Samara, Saratov, Smolensk, and Chelyabinsk Oblasts. The  movement's ideas have also been supported in the Russian  Federation republics. The influential public organization  "Citizens of Mordovia for Social Justice, Legality, and Economic  Stability" plans to examine the question of joining the movement  at its next congress.</p>

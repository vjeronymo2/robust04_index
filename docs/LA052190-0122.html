BRIEFING;  </P> <P> 1 SCRANTON PAPER BUYS THE OTHER  </P> <P> Scranton's oldest newspaper, the Scrantonian Tribune, was purchased by its  longtime rival, the Scranton Times, and ceased publication today.  </P> <P> Employees arriving for work at the newspaper were told that today's edition  would be the last.  </P> <P> In the Tribune newsroom, someone scrawled "30" -- the symbol traditionally used  by reporters at the end of a story -- on a locker.  </P> <P> MediaOne Inc., which bought the Scrantonian Publishing Co. from the Goodman  family of Scranton in 1987, announced the newspaper's demise in a brief  release.  </P> <P> "The deteriorating economic conditions affecting the Northeast no longer made  it economically viable to publish a second newspaper in the Scranton market,"  MediaOne said.  </P> <P> The Scranton Times, which published an afternoon newspaper for many years,  launched a morning edition, the Morning Times, in 1988 to compete directly with  the Tribune.  </P></p>

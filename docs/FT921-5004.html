			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Letter: Italian Treasury minister explains position on monetary creation Sir, In a correspondence from Rome, published in your international edition ('Italian public sector deficit overshoots', February 28), you note that the Italian Treasury 'continues to use its overdraft facility with the Bank of Italy, though this credit window is due to be closed', as you discuss at length in a previous article ('Italy's monetary parting of ways', February 19). As a matter of fact, in the past two years the Treasury has reduced its debt position vis-a-vis the Bank of Italy: by L1,383bn in 1990, and L9,404bn in 1991. Thus, the reality of the 1980s - when central bank financing of the budget deficit was, although at a decreasing pace, the major source of money creation - has been reversed in the past two years. As the data in the table indicate, in 1990 the growth of the monetary base was due almost entirely to the balance of payments surplus; in 1991, to open market operations by the central bank. In both years, the Treasury's contribution to the growth rate of base money has been negative. Of course, this is no excuse for delaying the closing of the credit window. It suggests, however, that at least as far as the direct monetary financing of the Treasury is concerned, Italy has been satisfying the Maastricht criteria for quite some time. We wish we could say the same about the budget figures your article correctly points to.

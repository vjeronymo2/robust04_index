			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Danish row over Maastricht No vote warning DENMARK would face a serious fall in living standards if the electorate voted No to the Maastricht treaty in the country's second referendum, on May 18, according to a report by the Ministry of Finance. The report's conclusions were promptly denounced by Mr Kai Lemberg, a representative of the main anti-Maastricht organisation, the June Movement, as being based on 'outrageous assumptions'. But Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the finance minister, said that there was little doubt about the accuracy of the economic predictions outlined in the report. The report assumes that if there is a second No vote, Denmark will have to leave the European Community and accept the same status as the Efta countries by signing the European Economic Area agreement. This would exclude Denmark from participation in the EC's common agricultural and fisheries policies, force Denmark to leave the European monetary system, and have an adverse effect on foreign direct investment in Denmark. The impact on agriculture and fisheries would be especially serious. Exports of agricultural and fisheries products, including industrially processed foods, were worth about DKr62bn (Dollars 9.8bn), or 26 per cent of total merchandise exports, in 1992. Without access to EC markets, or EC subsidies for agricultural exports to third countries, exports of agricultural and fisheries products could be halved, the report claims, resulting in the loss of some 100,000 jobs in agriculture, fisheries and the food processing industries. When compared with likely developments if Denmark remains a member of the Community, real disposable national income in the short-term would fall by 7-8 per cent and 150,000 jobs - about 5 per cent of total employment - would be lost, the report concludes. The remaining job losses would arise because Danish interest rates would be higher than in other European countries if Denmark left the EMS and as a result of lower investment by both foreign and domestic companies. Initially, however, the country's balance of payments, which is in substantial surplus at the moment, would not be seriously affected, as imports would fall even faster than exports, the report predicts. The Danish central bank reduced its key money market interest rate, the repro rate, by a half point from 12.5 to 12 per cent yesterday. The step follows the easing of speculative pressure on the Danish krone in February, when the official discount rate was raised from 9.5 to 11.5 per cent. The discount rate was reduced to 10.5 per cent on February 22. The central bank used DKr16bn to support the krone in February.</p>

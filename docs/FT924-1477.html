			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Move on terrorism cover broached THE Association of British Insurers yesterday made a move towards a possible compromise in the row over insurance cover for terrorism damage, Richard Lapper writes. The insurance industry's trade association announced that it would consider working with the government to cover such damage. Such a move might provide a solution to the crisis caused when the association announced that terrorist damage would be excluded from new commercial policies. The association had previously insisted that the government should directly compensate bomb and other terrorist damage, as it does in Northern Ireland. Last week the ABI was unsympathetic to compromise solutions advanced by industrial risk managers and insurance brokers, but yesterday Mr Tony Baker of the ABI said the 'insurers must be as accommodating as possible'. He said: 'A compromise must be worked out in the interests of the economy and business.' The shift in the ABI's position increases the pressure on the government to support any joint initiative. Mr Baker said:'There is no way the insurance industry can move without government support.' The ABI said terrorism cover could be provided as a voluntary 'buy back' or an addition to commercial policies for extra premium. That would be possible only if insurers could limit their own exposures by obtaining reinsurance from the government. Letters, Page 19</p>

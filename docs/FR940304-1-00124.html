			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Design options. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The comments on the fluorescent lamp ballast design options consisted largely of suggestions of additional designs for the Department to consider. Certified Ballast Manufacturers stated that it feels there are only two design options, electromagnetic and electronic. (Certified Ballast Manufacturers, No. 47 at 2). Four comments proposed improvement of magnetic ballasts through the use of lower resistance conductors and low-loss silicone or amorphous steel core material. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5; Valmont Electric, No. 16 at 1; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7; and Northwest Power Planning Commission, No. 32 at 5). A number of comments suggested that design options which reduce energy use of magnetic ballasts through cathode (heater) cutout, including use of electronic controls (hybrid ballasts), be considered. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5; Public Citizen, No. 7 at 3; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 17 at 29; Valmont, No. 16 at 1; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7; and Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 5). The California Energy Commission stated that instant start should be considered as one of the design options for magnetic ballasts. (California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7). There were several comments regarding the consideration of levels of efficiency of electronic ballasts as design options such as instant start and use of integrated circuits. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5; Public Citizen, No. 7 at 3; Sierra Club, No. 16 at 2; Natural Resources Defense Council, No. 17 at 29; Valmont, No. 16 at 1; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7; and Northwest Power Planning Council, No. 32 at 5). Finally, three comments proposed that dimming capability (task tuning) be considered as a design option of electronic ballasts. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 5; California Energy Commission, No. 24 at 7; and Northwest Power Planning Commission, No. 32 at 5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dimming capability (task tuning) is addressed above in the product class discussion. The analysis treated cathode cutout and instant start for magnetic ballasts, as well as lower resistance conductors and low-loss steel cores, as design options. The Department also analyzed one efficiency level for instant start and one for rapid-start electronic ballasts. The Department concluded that the use of integrated circuits as a substitute for discrete components is common enough to be included in the initial electronic ballast design option. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Other comments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two comments recommended that energy-efficient magnetic ballasts be used as the baseline for all product classes. (Valmont, No. 16 at 1; and Magnetek Universal, No. 35 at 1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with these recommendations and used energy-efficient magnetic ballasts for the baseline units for all classes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments advised against the Department's considering standards to reduce the harmonic distortion of fluorescent lamp ballasts. (Valmont, No. 16 at 3; Advance Transformer, No. 25 at 4; Magnetek, No. 35 at 2; and National Electrical Manufacturers Association, No. 41 at 1). These comments contended that the harmonic distortions caused by fluorescent lamp ballasts, presently less than 30 percent, are not a serious problem, and that options designed to reduce such distortions would not be cost-effective. (Both magnetic and electronic ballasts generate harmonic distortion.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department treated the harmonic content for electronic ballasts as acceptable for conventional, i.e., non-compact, ballasts and did not assign any additional cost to achieving reduced harmonic distortion. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

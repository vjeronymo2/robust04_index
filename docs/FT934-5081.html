			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Single regeneration budget intact - Local authorities The chancellor's attack on government spending left what is now called the single regeneration budget largely intact, Paul Cheeseright writes. This Budget brings together inner-city spending from the departments of environment, employment, education, trade and industry and the home office under one heading for the first time. The provision in 1994-95 at Pounds 1.44bn has been reached by adding totals for the various departments. The overall figure - untouched by Mr Clarke's search for economies - will decline to Pounds 1.33bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 1.32bn in 1996-97.</p>

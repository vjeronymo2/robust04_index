			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Plans involved in the transactions for which the Bank requests exemptive relief are numerous Plans for which the Bank has acted or will act as fiduciary and has exercised or will exercise investment discretion with respect to all or a portion of the assets of such Plans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For this reason, certain specific information relating to each individual involved Plan does not appear in the application. However, it is anticipated that the Plans include or will include various employee benefit plans, as defined by section 3(3) of the Act, and certain plans or trusts, as described in section 4975(e)(1) of the Code. These Plans are sponsored or maintained by parties unrelated to the Bank. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Such Plans include, among others: (1) pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, and other retirement plans which are qualified for tax purposes under section 401(a) of the Code, (2) voluntary employees' beneficiary associations and other welfare benefit plans, and (3) individual retirement accounts and simplified employee pension plans, as described in section 408 of the Code. The Bank serves as fiduciary to these Plans through the management of the CIFs in which the Plans invest or through providing individual management or advice to the Plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department herein is not proposing relief for transactions afforded relief by Section 404(c) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department, herein, is not proposing relief for transactions involving any plan sponsored by the Bank or its affiliates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is represented that the Bank, as of October 23, 1992, had under management approximately $760 million in assets from approximately 400 Plans. The Bank receives compensation for serving as fiduciary with respect to these Plans in accordance with standard published fee schedules or as otherwise agreed upon by the Bank and the sponsors of such Plans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department expresses no opinion as to whether the provision of services by the Bank or its affiliates to the Plans satisfies the requirements for statutory exemption, as set forth in section 408(b)(2) of the Act and 29 CFR 2550.408(b)(2) of the Department's regulation. To the extent that such provision of services to the Plan by the Bank or its affiliates does not satisfy the requirements of section 408(b)(2) of the Act, the Department, herein, is offering no relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. The Bank or its affiliates also provide services to numerous Funds. The Funds are open-end investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Because the Bank would like the exemption to apply prospectively to any Fund to which the Bank or any of its affiliates may provide services, the Bank represents that it cannot supply detailed information on each such future Fund. However, the Bank has provided a detailed description with respect to a certain Fund, the HighMark Group (HighMark), which is currently operating and to which it provides services. The Bank represents that all future Funds will assume similar structures and Plan investments therein will be subject to the terms and conditions of this exemption. The structure of HighMark is summarized in paragraph 4 below. To the extent Plans for which the Bank serves as fiduciary are currently invested in HighMark, the Bank represents that such investments were made in compliance with Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption 77&hyph;4 (PTCE 77&hyph;4). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> PTCE 77&hyph;4 was granted April 8, 1977, at 42 FR 732 and was proposed November 16, 1976, at 41 FR 50516.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. HighMark, a Massachusetts business trust organized on March 10, 1987, is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a diversified, open-end, management investment company. HighMark is governed by a board of trustees (the HighMark Trustees), all of whom are independent of the Bank. MERUS, a division of the Bank, acts as investment adviser to HighMark. In the context of registered investment companies, the term ``investment adviser'' generally refers to the entity that has investment management authority with respect to the assets of the investment company. In this regard, subject to the general supervision of the HighMark Trustees, MERUS manages each of the separate investment portfolios within HighMark in accordance with the investment objectives, and policies of each portfolio, makes decisions with respect to and places orders for all purchases and sales of securities, and maintains records with respect thereto. In addition, the Bank serves as custodian, sub-administrator, sub-transfer agent, and sub-accountant to HighMark. It is represented that the Bank may in the future seek to serve in additional capacities for and to provide additional services to HighMark.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HighMark consists of separate investment portfolios with combined total net assets of approximately $1 billion. It is represented that currently there are eight (8) portfolios in HighMark. Three of these portfolios are invested in money market instruments (the Money Market Portfolios), and three are invested primarily in non-money market debt or equity securities (the Non-Money Market Portfolios). The remaining two portfolios of HighMark are the California Tax-Free Fund, and the Tax-Free Fund. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to these portfolios, HighMark is in the process of establishing two additional portfolios, the Balanced Fund and the Growth Fund, and may establish other portfolios.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> It is represented that the Tax-Free Fund has been the subject of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) concerning a municipal bond backed by Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company held in the Tax-Free Fund. In July 1991, when Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company was seized by its regulator, the Bank was serving as accountant for the Tax-Free Fund. It is represented that due to a clerical data entry error and the failure of an employee to follow established procedures, the impact of the seizure on the value of the bond was not brought to the attention of the management of the Bank until August 1991. At that time, the Bank represents that it informed the SEC, purchased the bond from the Tax-Free Fund at par plus accrued interest, and informed shareholders by mailing to them a special prospectus, dated September 5, 1991. As the situation was corrected promptly, the Bank believes that this should not affect the merits of the application or the availability of the Tax-Free Fund for investment by the Plan, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances as authorized by the Second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fibuciary, and if based on criteria set forth in section 404 of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the future HighMark may modify, reorganize, or terminate any or all of its portfolios. All existing portfolios and any portfolios established or modified in the future will be available for investment by the Plans, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances, as authorized by the Second Fiduciary, and if based on criteria set forth in section 404 of the Act. However, it is represented that the Bank does not expect the Plans ordinarily to be invested in tax-free funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

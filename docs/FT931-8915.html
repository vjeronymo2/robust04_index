			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Bowater In recent years Bowater has demonstrated a deft touch in the takeover game. Its proposed Pounds 305m acquisition of the US-based Speciality Coatings International appears just the latest in a string of well-conceived and constructed deals. With the addition of SCI, Bowater will significantly strengthen its hand in the coated films and papers market, which boasts high margins and good growth prospects. It will continue to drive into higher value-added markets while disposing of its commodity-style operations along the way. Despite sterling's depreciation, Bowater has achieved a keen price for SCI, paying just over 14 times historic earnings, so the deal should enhance earnings next year. The company also has scope to squeeze more juice from its existing businesses as yesterday's healthy profits estimates make clear. Add in the highly cyclical nature of many of Bowater's markets, and it becomes easy to justify the company's heady premium rating. Even so, shareholders may begin to blanch at the speed of progress. Yesterday's Pounds 295m rights issue will be the third in four years bringing the total of equity finance raised to Pounds 770m. In that time, the range and complexity of Bowater's businesses has multiplied greatly. The market's adoration may cool while investors convince themselves Bowater's management really does have a firm grasp on its recent purchases.</p>

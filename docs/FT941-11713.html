			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Plans may boost GP fundholding The government is considering making it easier for family doctors to become fundholders, in a move intended to inject fresh momentum into this element of its health reforms. The proportion of the population which is served by fundholders - family doctors with budgets who buy hospital care for their patients - will rise to around 33 per cent by April and 40 per cent by April next year. But ministers are anxious to push this figure above 50 per cent before the next general election, which must be held before April 1997. With Labour pledged to abolish fundholding, ministers see the issue as a way of eroding the electoral advantage Labour has traditionally enjoyed on health issues. Ministers are convinced of their ability to persuade voters that Labour's stance poses a severe threat to an innovation they maintain has brought about improved standards of patient care. A Labour document confirming the party's commitment to the abolition of fundholding is expected shortly. The main proposal being considered by ministers will give prospective fundholders more choice over the range of treatments and services they would be responsible for purchasing. At present the budgets they are allocated cover a defined group of hospital and community nursing services, such as health visiting and psychiatric nursing. Legislation may be introduced to enable fundholders to adopt more of a pick-and-choose approach, controlling budgets only for some of the services on the present list. Such a move would be particularly likely if the range of services now covered by the fundholding scheme is expanded, as many anticipate. The government may also decide to lower from 7,000 to 6,000 the minimum number of patients which GP practices or groups must have to qualify for the fundholding scheme. Ministers believe that this threshold is unlikely to fall below 6,000 for the foreseeable future, however, because of the start-up costs which are associated with becoming a fundholder. The government has for some time been encouraging smaller GP practices to band together in order to reach the minimum threshold. A new batch of smaller practices intending to make this change is expected to be announced shortly.</p>

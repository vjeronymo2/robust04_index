			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Ashdown to promote young MPs MR PADDY ASHDOWN, leader of the Liberal Democrats, will today announce a limited reshuffle of his parliamentary team in which he will promote younger MPs. Mr Matthew Taylor, the 29-year-old MP for Truro, is to be given a new post covering campaigning and communications after what was seen as a strong performance, particularly on television, during the general election. Also set for a change of role is Mr Charles Kennedy, MP for Ross, Cromarty and Skye and the party's 30-year-old president. He is to surrender his health portfolio and support Sir David Steel, the foreign affairs spokesman, on European topics. A full post-mortem into the Liberal Democrats' election result will not be held until after this week's council elections, the party said. In spite of Mr Ashdown's widely praised general-election campaign, the party saw its number of Commons seats drop to 20 compared with 22 won by the Liberal/SDP Alliance in 1987. Its share of the vote fell from 23 per cent to 18 per cent.</p>

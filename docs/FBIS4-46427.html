			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Wiesbaden/Bonn -- Nearly one year after the  unsuccessful antiterrorism operation in Bad Kleinen, Interior  Minister Manfred Kanther (Christian Democratic Union) has  initiated the announced restructuring of the Federal Office of  Criminal Investigation [BKA]. [passage omitted]    BKA department head Manfred Klink will be responsible for  the  Terrorism and Protection of the State Main Department, which  will be based in Meckenheim near Bonn in the future.    Kanther's reform plans met with skepticism and rejection  among the police trade union [GdP]. The new level of hierarchy  that is to be introduced between the BKA president, the vice  president, and the old department heads is in contradiction with  all modern findings concerning control and organization, the  chairman of the GdP group in the BKA, Arno Falk, stressed. The  appointment of the new main department heads is the "wrong  consequence from Bad Kleinen." [passage omitted]</p>

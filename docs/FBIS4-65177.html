			<p>BFN     [Text] Munich (DPA) -- Christian Social Union [CSU]  Chairman Theo Waigel rejected the call of Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD] Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen for an  action alliance against the Republikaner by calling it an  "obvious propaganda proposal." As long as the SPD only deals  with right-wing extremists, but not also with left-wing radicals  and the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS], the CSU does not  see a basis for a joint course of action, Waigel said before  journalists after a session of the CSU Executive Committee in  Munich. Moreover, the CSU does not need an exhortation. Unlike  any other party, it is struggling against the Republikaner  "politically and with all legally available means."</p>

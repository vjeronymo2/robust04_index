			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Paints and the Environment (2): A question of balance - The decorative market Since 55 per cent of all paint sold goes on walls, ceilings, doors, window frames, skirting boards and masonry, they are bound to have a significant impact on the environment. This - the decorative market - is itself divided into two large segments - do-it-yourself paints people buy increasingly from retail sheds; and trade paint sold from specialised centres to professional decorators. Sales are large. ICI puts the European DIY market at about 730m litres a year. Britain leads with 156m litres - inevitably, when businesses such as B&amp;Q, Texas Homecare, and Do-It-All have developed the concept of the retail shed more intensively than anywhere else. Germany follows with 151m litres, then Italy with 150m litres and France with 89m litres. The relative size of the trade and DIY segments is illustrated by Akzo Nobel's figures for decorative sales overall, which make France the biggest market with nearly 570m litres in both segments combined. Germany comes second with more than 440m, followed by Britain with more than 400m and Italy with 375m. The split matters because different solutions to environmental concerns are being demanded and applied in each market segment. The effects in the marketplace are now becoming marked in Germany, Europe's largest environmentally-conscious national market. Environmentally friendly paints have made significant impact in German consumer DIY markets, but their impact has been poor among professional decorators, according to Mr Chris Joyce, technical manager for ICI's decorative products in Europe. 'These types of product were launched in Germany 10 years ago and they now have between 25 and 30 per cent of the national retail market. But they haven't got anywhere in the German trade market because of price and difficulties in guaranteeing quality of work,' he says. The problem is that the more environmentally friendly decorative paints become, the higher their price, while performance declines. The right balance has yet to be struck - and professional decorators are refusing to adopt products that demand return visits to put work right, or which do not last long enough to satisfy their customers. Since few decorative paints are toxic - and these cannot be bought in DIY markets - the main area of environmental concern is emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) used as solvent. 'We cannot control how millions of people use decorative paint,' Mr Joyce says. 'All the paint we sell evaporates. Although the VOC emission from decorative paints is only two per cent of total emissions, we sell a lot of decorative paints, so none of us can sit back complacently and do nothing.' The problem is less acute for paints used on walls and ceilings than for the gloss paints needed on woodwork. The former now nearly all use water as their principal solvent. Germany already insists that wall paints for internal use should contain no VOC solvents, while ICI has already eliminated them from its DIY products. Professional decorators, however, prefer a little VOC in the formulation to help the paint spread smoothly and dry to an even finish. Indeed, VOC solvents are essential in gloss paints if they are to have the properties of shine and durability people expect. Traditionally, VOC solvents accounted for 70 per cent of a gloss paint's formulation. Reducing requires more pigment in the paint, or a mix of water and VOCs as solvent, or a combination of both. Getting it down to 35 per cent will qualify for eco-labelling when standards are finally introduced. This, however, will not do. Mr Joyce points out that in Austria, the maximum permitted VOC solvent level will be 10 per cent from next year. This compares with 30 per cent the industry thinks reasonable to aim for by 2000  -'the danger is an imposed solution. We need to be pro-active as an industry. Europe should also try to move forward together,' he says. One idea is a ratchet system, with general agreement to reduce in discrete steps at two-year intervals. This would phase the pain, especially since the new coatings may push up prices by 50 per cent. This phased approach may also be necessary to carry public opinion. Mr Chris Harris, general manager of ICI's UK and Ireland decorative business, says: 'Every time you offer alternatives, there is a trade off between performance and price. People are very concerned about the environment until they have to pay. Only the most ardent greens are prepared to pay more or sacrifice quality for the environment.' He also says there is another argument about paint and the environment which needs to be vigorously advanced. 'Paint protects surfaces and maintains the life of buildings, which in turn is a contribution to sustaining resources. Paint is about protection from decay. What is the point of paint that is so environmentally friendly it costs more, does not perform well and needs repainting every two years instead of four?' he asks. There is evidence that a balance is beginning to assert itself with some local authorities - all of them big buyers of decorative paints - rethinking previous decisions to 'go waterborne' as ensuing maintenance times have shortened. The conservationary benefits of paint are also becoming more visible all over Britain. Concrete tower blocks of council housing - which had become hideously disfigured by acid rain, stains, corrosion of reinformcement bars, mould and decay - have in recent years been transformed by new masonry paints designed to protect concrete after repair. Good colour schemes has also broken up the stark outlines of tower blocks and made them sit more happily in the visual environment. If these coatings had been waterbased, they would have been washed off in this winter's torrential rains.</p>

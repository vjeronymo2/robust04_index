			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Business and the Law: Long arm of American law - A US anti-trust case with worldwide implications A long-awaited US Supreme Court decision in an insurance anti-trust case was delivered yesterday but it has failed to provide the hoped-for guidance to foreign governments and businesses on the extra-territorial reach of US regulatory law. The case involved complaints filed by 19 US states alleging the defendants - four US primary insurers, two US trade associations, a US reinsurance broker and Lloyd's of London reinsurers - had violated the Sherman Act, America's main piece of anti-trust legislation. The defendants were accused of a conspiracy over a three-year period from 1984 to 1987 aimed at forcing certain other US primary insurers to change the terms of their standard commercial general liability insurance polices to conform with policies the defendants wanted to sell. The US district court dismissed the actions holding that the defendants were entitled to anti-trust immunity under the terms of the McCarran-Ferguson Act which exempts from federal regulation 'the business of insurance' except 'to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law'. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court decision, ruling that although the conduct involved was clearly 'the business of insurance' the foreign reinsurers at Lloyd's did not fall within the exemption because their activities could not be 'regulated by state law', and that the US insurers had forfeited their exemption because they had conspired with the non-exempt British insurers. The circuit court also rejected the district court's conclusion that the principle of international comity barred it from exercising jurisdiction under the Sherman Act in relation to the claims against the London reinsurers. The principle of international comity provides that where two countries' jurisdictions are in conflict, each country must examine its own and the other country's interest in exercising jurisdiction and defer where the other county's interest is clearly greater. At one level the case was extremely important to US businesses nearly all of which are required to carry commercial general liability insurance. At another, however, the case had just as much significance for European businesses and governments. In deciding whether the US courts had jurisdiction over the involvement of Lloyd's underwriters in the alleged anti-competitive conduct, it was hoped the Supreme Court would address the vexed question of the appropriate extra-territorial reach of US anti-trust laws. Yesterday the court concluded that the Sherman Act did apply to the conduct complained of and that the US courts did have jurisdiction over the Lloyd's reinsurers. But by confining its decision to the particular facts of this case and ruling that there was no conflict between US and British jurisdiction (because Britain does not regulate the kind of conduct complained of) the court failed to provide the fundamental statement of the law on the extra-territorial application of US anti-trust laws which businesses and governments on both sides of the Atlantic had been hoping for. According to Mr Gary Born, a partner with US law firm Wilmer Cutler &amp; Pickering, the extra-territorial application of US laws has long produced significant diplomatic frictions between the US and its trading partners. This is not only true of anti-trust laws but also of export controls and securities laws as well. The extra-territorial application of US laws has also aroused substantial concern in the international business community, he says. 'Extra-territorial applications of national laws often create substantial uncertainty and the risk of conflicting legal requirements. This chills international commerce and investment and can sometimes impose considerable injustice on private parties caught between national legal regimes.' For almost 200 years up to the second world war US courts relied on what became known as a 'presumption of territoriality' to determine the reach of federal legislation. Unless there was a clear indication from Congress that a statute should apply outside US territory, federal legislation would be presumed to apply only to conduct within US territory. After the war, the basic rule changed. In the Aluminum Co of America (Alcoa) case of 1945, the Supreme Court adopted what became known as an 'effects test' for determining the extra-territorial application of the US anti-trust laws. Abandoning strict adherence to the presumption of territoriality, the court said the anti-trust laws would in future apply not merely to anti-competitive conduct on US territory but also to conduct outside US borders that has 'effects' in US territory or on US commerce. This remained the law until 1976 when, in a case called Timberlane, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals placed a restriction on the Alcoa 'effects test' which had been heavily criticised because it allowed expansive extra-territorial application of US law. The court tempered the effects doctrine by adding a so-called 'rule of reason' which equated broadly with principles of international comity. The rule of reason provided that US law would not be applied extra-territorially to foreign conduct if the balance of foreign interests in exercising jurisdiction outweighed US interests. Given the history of the extra-territorial application of US regulatory statutes since 1945, most observers would until recently have expected the court to follow Timberlane or adopt some modification of the Alcoa effects test in the present case. But in 1991 the court resurrected the presumption of territoriality in three cases, the most significant being the Aramco case, in which the court ruled that US anti-discrimination laws did not extend to discrimination against workers outside the US. That decision left the precise extent of the extra-territorial application of US laws uncertain and business and governments were looking to the court in the present case to clarify the position. 'The court's decision on the extra-territoriality is unsatisfactory and very disappointing, ' says Mr Born. First, the court refused to address directly the question whether the Timberlane rule of reason or principles of international comity restrain the extra-territorial reach of US anti-trust laws. That will perpetuate the uncertainty which confronts international businesses and their legal advisers, he says. Second, the court said that assuming that principles of comity do apply in the anti-trust sphere, comity only applied where a direct legal conflict between US and foreign laws existed. That is an exceedingly narrow and probably unsound view, Mr Born says. Few foreign states and businesses will be happy with the court's unanimous conclusion that the anti-trust laws have extra-territorial application. The only conceivable silver lining, Mr Born says, is that Justice Souter's majority opinion can be read to suggest that the anti-trust laws apply extra-territorially only where foreign conduct 'was meant to produce and did in fact produce some substantial effect in the US'. That standard, if rigorously enforced in the lower courts, could provide limits to the extra-territorial reach of US law that some foreign observers might find acceptable. In general, he adds, the court's opinion is badly out of step with contemporary understanding of what comity requires. 'It is a result which will cause no little distress to both international businesses and the international legal community.'</p>

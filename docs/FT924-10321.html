			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Malaysia cuts public spending MALAYSIA is cutting public spending in an effort to control inflation and bring down a current account deficit projected to reach MDollars 7.9bn (Pounds 1.93bn) this year. Mr Anwar Ibrahim, finance minister, presenting the 1993 budget, said that despite achieving growth of more than 8 per cent in each of the last five years, the country could not afford continuously to increase annual expenditures. The size of the public service would be reduced and emphasis placed on tighter financial management. The budget raised the level of compulsory savings contributions for both employers and employees, extended the scope of an existing 5 per cent services tax to include telecommunications and other services and signalled the introduction soon of a sales and service tax of up to 10 per cent. Mr Anwar made concessions in the form of lowering the corporate tax rate from 35 per cent to 34 per cent and reducing income tax levels by between one and two per cent. Analysts said Mr Anwar had not been tough enough in curtailing both public and private spending and warned of continuing inflation problems. They also felt the full effects of the slowdown in Malaysia's main export markets had not been fully taken into consideration in the budget.</p>

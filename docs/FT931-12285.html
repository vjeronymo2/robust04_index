			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Effort to unblock EC hours directive MR PADRAIG FLYNN, the new EC Commissioner for Social Affairs, is examining ways to unblock the controversial draft directive setting a 48 hour maximum working week. He is also prepared to examine whether there is a case for amending the EC directive which protects the pay and conditions of workers in company mergers and which is currently causing uncertainty in the contracting-out of public services in the UK. The working time directive, a centrepiece of the EC Social Charter, has been stuck in the legislative pipeline for nearly three years, mainly as a result of UK opposition. But since an agreement in principle resolving most British objections was brokered last June, the draft law has not moved forward. 'I would like to see this directive, and some of the others that have been blocked, moving on under the Danish presidency,' Mr Flynn said yesterday. Denmark, currently in the EC chair, has made social policy a priority. According to senior European Commission officials, Mr Flynn has been considering whether to redraft the directive. But following a meeting of social affairs ministers in Copenhagen yesterday, he said he would await the report of the working group set up last June to resolve outstanding 'technical' differences between France and Germany. The British EC presidency of the second half of last year showed little enthusiasm to resolve such differences. The UK would be most affected by the directive, having to provide legal protection for workers unwilling to work more than 48 hours. The UK government, which is threatening to take legal action against the directive even in its diluted form, argues that the measure would reintroduce rigidities into the labour market and add to costs in industry. However the fact that Mr Flynn appears to be leaving open the possibility of an amendment to the 1977 Acquired Rights Directive, which has cast a shadow over contracting-out in the UK, will please the UK government. That directive was intended to offer workers protection in company mergers but recent legal judgments seem to extend the protection to a broad range of public service workers whose functions are contracted out to the private sector.</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Kinnock to quit after election defeat MR NEIL KINNOCK, the UK opposition Labour party leader, will today announce that he will not seek a further term as leader. Mr Roy Hattersley, his deputy, has also decided not to stand again. Their decision, in the wake of the party's fourth successive general election defeat, is expected to pitch Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor and favourite, against Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, in a battle for the leadership. Several other possible contenders are understood to have opted not to run after it was clear that Mr Smith had already received firm pledges of support from many leading Labour MPs and trade unions. A fierce battle may arise for the deputy leadership, which Mr Gould may also contend alongside Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, and possibly Mr John Prescott, the party's leftwing transport spokesman. In the aftermath of the election, Mr John Major, the prime minister, has put government support for British industry at the centre of his strategy with the appointment of Mr Michael Heseltine to head an enlarged Department of Trade and Industry. Mr Heseltine's move, part of a weekend cabinet reshuffle which saw Mr Norman Lamont confirmed as chancellor of the exchequer, was described by Whitehall officials as an attempt to make Mr Major's administration more 'industry-friendly'. The reshuffle, the first real opportunity Mr Major has had to stamp his authority on the cabinet since taking over from Mrs Margaret Thatcher 16 months ago, saw a large-scale redistribution of cabinet responsibilities. Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary, and Mr Tom King, the former defence secretary, were among four ministers losing their jobs. Among the newcomers, Mr Michael Portillo, an unapolgetic Thatcherite on economic policy, takes charge of public spending as the new chief secretary to the Treasury. The new cabinet line-up, with Mr Kenneth Clarke promoted to home secretary and Mr John Patten to education, signals Mr Major's intention of giving the government a more responsive image while sticking to the core of its economic strategy. The prime minister has balanced promotions for thos on the left and centre of his party with comparable moves for the most prominent figures on the right.  Mr Michael Howard, a leading free-marketeer, takes over an expanded Department of the Environment. Some ministers had expected the prime minister to move Mr Lamont from the Treasury, but Mr Major was said to have been impressed by the chancellor's determination to curb inflation in the approach to the election. Mr Lamont will also be a key figure in piloting through the House of Commons legislation to give effect to the treaty on economic and monetary union agreed at Maastricht. Mr Major's decision to reward Mr Heseltine for his vigorous role in the election campaign will give the DTI much greater influence in shaping policy towards business.  He will take over the Department of Employment's previous responsibilities for small businesses and the DTI will also take charge of the oil and coal industries. Mr Heseltine will have the political weight to pull together the various Whitehall responsibilities for industrial policy to meet criticism that the government provides far less support for industry than many of its European counterparts.

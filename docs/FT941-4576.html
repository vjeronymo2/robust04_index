			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / International Company News: Nova on the acquisitions trail Nova, the western Canada energy and petrochemicals group, may spend up to CDollars 500m (USDollars 368m) on acquisitions later this year after completing its reorganisation into regulated and non-regulated businesses. A new Nova Corporation will hold four new operating units: Nova Gas Transmission, the regulated Alberta gas pipeline; Nova Gas Services, the North American gas service business; Novacorp International (gas services outside North America); and Novacor Chemical, the petrochemicals group. The plan goes before shareholders on May 8 in Calgary, together with a shareholder protection plan. Nova recently bought out its 49.9 per cent partner in Pan Alberta Gas, Canada's biggest gas exporter. This will raise annual profits by about CDollars 6m. The company plans aggressive expansion in gas services in North America and overseas and total acquisitions this year could reach Dollars 500m, said spokesman Mr Bill Rowe. A Dollars 500m equity issue was completed last month, of which Dollars 250m is earmarked for acquisitions. Talisman, a big gas producer, had 1993 net profit of CDollars 25.8m, or 43 cents a share, up from CDollars 11.2m, or 22 cents, in 1992. Revenues were CDollars 339m against CDollars 196m. Gas output rose sharply and prices were higher. A lower Canadian dollar and rising output offset lower oil prices.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains on stronger financial sector STRONG buying of financial stocks pushed up other shares, and the Nikkei average rose amid active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue index gained 168.81 to 18,555.30, rising 3.2 per cent on the week. After a brief fall to the day's low of 18,425.73 on profit taking, heavy futures-linked buying and short covering lifted the Nikkei to a day's high of 18,833.50 before it shed some of its gains on afternoon profit taking. Volume rose to 750m shares from 531m. Foreign investors and investment trusts led the activity, while institutional investors were inactive. Advances led declines by 700 to 331, while 113 issues remained unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 23.59 to 1,420.38, closing over the 1,400 level for the first time since March 31. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 5.75 to 1,153.98. Banks, brokers, and non-life insurers drew active buying. Traders pointed out that the financial stocks were among the most heavily sold in the previous market plunge. 'One third is genuine buying but the rest is investors, such as hedge funds trying to cover short positions,' said one fund manager. Industrial Bank of Japan surged Y220 to Y2,990 and Mitsubishi Bank advanced Y110 to Y2,500. Nomura Securities gained Y130 to Y1,770 and Tokio Marine &amp; Fire gained Y50 to Y1,290. Speculative issues eased on profit taking. Meiji Milk Products fell Y20 to Y1,130 and Green Cross fell Y30 to Y1,740. NTT also declined Y15,000 to Y605,000 on profit taking, while Isuzu Motors lost Y4 to Y386 and Nippon Steel retreated Y4 to Y303. In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 275.27 to 20,121.50 in volume of 29.4m shares. The authorities said that the trading volume of stock index futures in August fell 25 per cent from July, due to new restrictions on quotations. However, stock index options volume rose 1.7 per cent to post this year's highest level. Roundup THE region produced a limited response to gains in the UK, and in Tokyo. SYDNEY picked up slightly after four days of losses, the All Ordinaries index closing 4.0 higher at 1,651.4, down 1.5 per cent on the week, in turnover up from ADollars 250m to ADollars 291m. Traders said that the positive tone was set overnight in London, when ADollars 32m of Australian shares were traded. Among oil and gas producers, the Santos bid for Sagasco lifted the oil and gas sub-index by 1.1 per cent. NEW ZEALAND blue chips lifted the NZSE-40 index by 19.84, or 1.4 per cent to 1,491.58, 0.7 per cent higher on the week, as turnover nearly doubled from NZDollars 14.4m to NZDollars 27.9m. In KUALA LUMPUR, afternoon profit-taking tempered modest earlier gains on the continued Tokyo rebound, the composite index ending 3.46 higher at 581.17 for a week's rise of 1.1 per cent. HONG KONG also saw profit-taking, but this combined with jitters over China's expression of anger toward Washington's proposed sale of fighter aircraft to Taiwan to leave the Hang Seng index 14.95 lower at 5,707.51, up 1.4 per cent on the week in turnover down from HKDollars 2.01bn to HKDollars 1.83bn. SINGAPORE ended softer, the Straits Times Industrial index easing 2.83 to 1,364.88 while MANILA consolidated, the composite index slipping just 0.27 to 1,392.00. Both were fractionally up on the week. SEOUL had risen nearly 20 per cent since the government's support package on August 24, but a spate of profit-taking left the composite index 19.86, or 3.7 per cent lower yesterday at 544.08, still 4.9 per cent higher on the week. BOMBAY saw heavy investment and speculative buying as the BSE index shot up 86.57, or 2.8 per cent to 3,166.10, mainly on reports that direct equity investment by foreigners would soon be permitted.</p>

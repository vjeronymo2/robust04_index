			<p>BFN     [Text] Weimar (DPA) -- In the opinion of Christian Social  Union [CSU] Chairman Theo Waigel, the Party of Democratic  Socialism [PDS] has to be combated with the same determination  as the extreme-right Republikaner. One cannot isolate Franz  Schoenhuber as chairman of the Republikaner if other standards  are applied to the PDS, Waigel said at the beginning of the  annual conference of the chairmen of the Christian Democratic  Union [CDU]/CSU Bundestag Group in Weimar on Monday [20 June].    On 12 June, the successor party of the Socialist Unity Party  of Germany established itself as the third political power in  the new laender and gained between 15 and above 20 percent of  the votes. Waigel now calls for an increased confrontation with  the parties on the left and the right fringe.    The FRG finance minister assessed as a good sign the fact  that, for the first time, the new laender's need for transfer  payments will not further increase next year. In the first  quarter of this year, a growth rate of 10 percent was achieved  in eastern Germany. It still cannot be said how long the  recovery process will take. However, the upswing has obviously  begun, he said.</p>

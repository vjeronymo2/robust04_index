The prospective exclusive license may be granted unless, within 60 days from the date of this published Notice, NIH receives written evidence and argument that establishes that the grant of the licenses would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nitric Oxide (NO) has been implicated as an important bioregulatory mediator in a variety of processes including the normal physiological control of blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation/adhesion, bronchodilation, neurotransmission, immunologically induced cytostasis and penile erection. National Cancer Institute scientists have discovered that compounds of the structure X-[N(O)NO]-, which will be designated as ``NONOates'', have the ability to sustain the release of nitric oxide into a biological medium. Various compounds of this family have been synthesized and shown to have different kinetics of NO release. Several of these compounds have been tested  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vitro <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in model systems and have shown potent biological effects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requests for a copy of these patent applications, inquiries, comments and other materials relating to the contemplated license should be directed to: Ms. Carol Lavrich, Office of Technology Transfer, National Institutes of Health, 6011 Executive Blvd., Rockville, MD 20892. Telephone: (301) 496&hyph;7735, ext. 287; Facsimile: (301) 402&hyph;0220. A signed confidentiality agreement will be required to receive copies of patent applications. Properly filed competing applications for a license filed in response to this notice will be treated as objections to the contemplated license. Only written comments and/or applications for a competing license which are received by the NIH Office of Technology Transfer within sixty (60) days of this notice will be considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: July 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barbara M.

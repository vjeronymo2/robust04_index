At 0800 that morning, Jiang Chunyun travelled to the Zibo  deputies' group to discuss the government work report made by  Governor Zhao Zhihao. In his speech, Jiang Chunyun said: We  must correctly understand and handle the dialectical relations  among reform, development, and stability. Reform and  development constitute the foundation of social stability, and  stability constitutes the pre-conditions for reform and  development. We should achieve the goal of grasping reform to  promote development, grasping development to embark on a new  stage, and grasping stability to ensure a good overall  situation. Successfully grasping these three issues means  successfully grasping crucial issues that will enable us to gain  the initiative in leadership work.    Jiang Chunyun pointed out: In carrying out reform, we should  focus on reform packages, make breakthroughs in major aspects,  and make a big step around the general objective of establishing  a socialist market economic structure. At the same time,  attention should be paid to reforms in the spheres of planning,  finance and taxation, banking, investment, foreign trade,  enterprises, rural areas, and circulation. The pace of shifting  to the socialist market economic structure should also be  accelerated.    Jiang Chunyun stressed: Development is the last word. We  should firmly grasp the central link of economic construction at  any moment without the slightest degree of slackness or  deviation so that we can ensure that the national economy will  embark on a new stage every few years. In accelerating  development, we should not only effect an increase in quantity  but also effect an improvement in quality. We should go all out  to readjust structures, strengthen management, effect  technological progress, improve quality, and increase economic  returns. Considering this to be a major guiding ideology for  the province's economic work, this should be assigned to each  level for implementation in order to ensure sustained, sound,  and rapid development of the province's economy.    Jiang Chunyun also went to visit deputies of Qingdao and  talked about his opinions on Qingdao city's reform and  development.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Ennemix cuts float price by up to 30% Ennemix, an east Midlands aggregates company, has been forced to cut its flotation price by more than a quarter after institutions failed to back its original proposal. This unusual plan involved raising almost Pounds 9m from a rights issue offered to existing shareholders of Anglesey Mining, a quoted north Wales mining group. Mr Christopher Stainforth of merchant bank Guinness Mahon, which is advising both companies, said that institutions had used the deal's complexity as an excuse for not backing it. He said there were signs that the new issue market was recovering but because Ennemix needed new funding to complete an acquisition it could not wait. It is therefore going ahead with an orthodox flotation but the price has been cut by '25-30 per cent'. Faced with the lower price, Nash Sells, the venture capital company, has decided not to sell any of its 23 per cent stake. Mr Stainforth said the amount raised for Ennemix would be the same as under the former plan though the total raised would be between Pounds 6m and Pounds 7m. The original proposal would have seen Ennemix inject a much needed Pounds 600,000 into Anglesey in return for a 15 per cent stake. Anglesey believes its creditors will continue to support it for the time being and it has been given assurance from Imperial Metals Corporation, its largest creditor which owns 41 per cent of its shares.</p>

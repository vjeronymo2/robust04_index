			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / NatWest expects interest-rate fall INTEREST RATES will come down in April with further cuts likely throughout the year, according to Mr David Kern, National Westminster Bank's chief economist. In this month's issue of NatWest's Economic and Financial Outlook he says: 'The risk of higher rates to defend sterling has diminished considerably and the next move will be a 0.5 (percentage point) cut in April. Thereafter, gradual base-rate declines are expected, to 9 per cent by the end of 1992 and to 8.5 per cent by 1993.' Mr Kern predicts that gross domestic product will stagnate in the first half of this year, but a slow upturn will start in the second half.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has stated that  Turkey expects more determination from the United Nations  regarding the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue and asked the embargo on  Bosnia be lifted if NATO's recent decisions are not effective.  Cetin issued statements at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport after  returning from New York, where he had gone to attend the meeting  of the Islamic Conference Organization's [ICO]  Bosnia-Herzegovina Contact Group.    Cetin said that the urgent measures necessary to stop the  tragedy in Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed at the meeting and  stated that the issues agreed upon were compiled into a 22-item  statement. Cetin indicated that this statement was announced to  the world and also submitted to the UN Security Council.    Cetin noted that the statement issued by the ICO Contact  Group stresses once more the international failure regarding the  attacks on Gorazde, which is declared a safe haven by the United  Nations. Noting that the Belgrade administration and its  extensions are wholly responsible for the genocide in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement requests the International  Court -- established to judge war crimes -- to start work at  once. The statement further notes that the ICO supports all  international efforts aimed at stopping the cruelty in Bosnia  and points to the necessity of having international protection  for the people of Sandzak and Kosovo.    Cetin explained that he delivered a speech at the UN  Security  Council pointing out the necessity of having more determined and  urgent actions taken by the United Nations. Indicating that 700  lives were lost in Gorazde because of the lack of this  determination, Cetin said that he had expressed this view at the  UN Security Council. Cetin said:    [Begin Cetin recording] I have once more expressed that  Turkey expects more determination from the United Nations. I  also clearly stated that it is necessary to lift the arms  embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina if NATO decisions are ineffective  and the Bosnians given the right to self-defense. [end  recording]    Cetin also stated that, while in New York, he held a meeting  with the U.S. representative to the United Nations on the  Turkey-Iraq oil pipeline. Cetin said that he explained to the  U.S. representative that Turkey is not after an implementation  which ignores the UN embargo. Pointing out that Turkey's direct  and indirect losses from this issue amounted to $20 billion,  Cetin said that, notwithstanding, Turkey abides by the UN  resolutions. Explaining that new and greater losses may incur  from the inactive pipeline, Cetin said Turkey's aim is an  initiative to use the pipeline within the framework of UN  resolutions.    Stating his views on the Cyprus issue, Cetin said that  Turkey  is not under pressure from any country and added that Turkey  more than anybody wants a solution to the Cyprus issue. Stating  that this solution should be a realistic and a just solution  which will not take Cyprus back to pre-1974 conditions, Cetin  stressed that a solution can be achieved only if the leaders of  the two communities reach an agreement. Stating that reopening  the Iraq-Turkey pipeline should not be confused with finding a  solution to the Cyprus issue, Cetin said these two issues are  separate and should be regarded as developments independent of  each other.</p>

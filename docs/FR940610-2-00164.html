Through its single-class GNMA I and GNMA II mortgage-backed securities (``MBS'') programs, GNMA guarantees the timely payment of principal and interest on securities issued by private institutions and backed by pools of federally insured or guaranteed mortgage loans.

The GNMA REMIC securities will be issued through single-purpose trusts created by GNMA-approved sponsors which will assemble GNMA-guaranteed single-class mortgage-backed securities to constitute the corpus of the REMIC trust. The sponsors will be private-sector entities such as investment bankers. Upon issuance, the General Counsel of HUD will render an opinion that GNMA's obligations under the GNMA guarantee of its REMIC securities will constitute absolute and unconditional general obligations of the United States, for which the full faith and credit of the United States is pledged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The authorizing Federal statute <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  provides that the GNMA REMIC program be implemented by GNMA's publication of a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and that GNMA subsequently publish regulations within twelve moths of the publication of the initial notice, based upon the comments received and the experience of GNMA in carrying out the program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 306(g) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. 1721(g), as amended by sec. 3004 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, 107 Stat. 339. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA will implement its REMIC program in two stages. During the initial stage, GNMA will restrict participation in the REMIC program to a small number of participants (consisting of sponsors, co-sponsors, trustees, trust counsel, and accounting firms) and a limited number of REMIC issuances. The initial stage will commence upon the closing of the first transaction, after publication of the notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and is expected to last several months, during which time GNMA will establish standard documentation, and guidelines and procedures applicable to the full implementation of the REMIC program. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> GNMA has not yet announced the date on which the initial stage of the REMIC program will commence. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While GNMA has not yet determined the characteristics of the GNMA REMIC tranches, for processing purposes it is assumed that the GNMA REMIC classes will have the same basic processing requirements as the VA REMICs, which PTC has had on deposit for approximately the last two years. It is assumed that, as in the case with the VA REMIC securities, all classes of the GNMA REMIC securities except the residual class will be established and maintained in book-entry form through the facilities of PRTC, although holders will have the right to request certificated securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission believes that PTC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act, <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  and in particular, section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act. Section 17A(b)(3)(F) requires that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. The Commission believes that PTC's proposal to designate certain securities guaranteed by GNMA as eligible securities for deposit with PTC is consistent with this goal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As previously stated, REMIC issuances will be limited during the initial stage of the program. Once the REMIC program is fully established, however, GNMA anticipates that a substantial percentage of its annual production of GNMA single-class securities will be securitized in GNMA REMICs. GNMA has stated they anticipate approximately $75 billion is the average deal size, this will result in approximately 150 REMIC deals issued each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

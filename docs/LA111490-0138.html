			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> SHOT DOWN LAST SEASON, WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM SEEKS TO REGAIN PRIDE  </P> <P> Somewhere along the road to a 1-27 record last season, Kathy Lizarraga says, UC  Irvine's women's basketball team lost its vision of what it was supposed to be.  </P> <P> The players and the coaches couldn't see eye-to-eye. Squabbles and jealousies  broke out. And if you want to talk about losing sight of goals, go straight to  Lizarraga, who literally did.  </P> <P> Lizarraga is the Anteaters' designated three-point shooter. She wears contact  lenses, which were giving her trouble before one game and became unwearable.  </P> <P> The way things were going, Lizarraga didn't want to cause trouble. Afraid to  tell Coach Dean Andrea what had happened, she tried to play without them.  </P> <P> She shot the ball in the general direction of the goal, aiming roughly for the  white box on the glass.  </P> <P> She was awful.  </P> <P> But shooters are supposed to keep shooting, and Lizarraga did. By halftime, she  hadn't made a basket, and when Andrea learned what was going on, he sat her on  the bench for the rest of the game.  </P> <P> It was that kind of season.  </P> <P> The Anteaters are back for another go at it this year, and Lizarraga is back  with extra lenses.  </P> <P> "I have three pairs now," she said.  </P> <P> Andrea says the team is working together to avoid a repeat of last season as  Irvine heads into its first exhibition game against the Bulgarian national team  at 2 p.m. Sunday in Bren Center.  </P> <P> Lizarraga, a junior who made 37 three-pointers and averaged 8.8 points per game  last season, is back, along with nine other letter-winners. Also returning are  Jenny Lee, a senior point guard, and Yvonne Catala, a sophomore forward who led  the team in scoring last year with an 11-point average.  </P> <P> Will this season unfold any better than last? They'll have to wait and see.  </P> <P> They lost by a sliver, but it doesn't matter a smidgen.  </P> <P> The Irvine women's cross-country team lost the NCAA Region 8 meet to Oregon by  a single point Saturday, but because the top two teams in each region qualified  for the NCAA championships Monday at Knoxville, Tenn., the difference was  meaningless.  </P> <P> "We'll drop from fifth to sixth in the rankings," said Coach Vince O'Boyle,  whose team was ranked fourth for a time this season, the highest ever for an  Irvine team. "If (the NCAA championships) were seeded like basketball, it might  be a problem, but the way it is, it doesn't mean a thing."  </P> <P> The NCAA water polo championships begin a week from Friday at Belmont Plaza  pool in Long Beach, with Irvine, the defending national champion, as host.  </P> <P> But don't expect Irvine to be in the water. The Anteaters are about to conclude  the first losing season in the program's 26-year history and are not expected  to get a bid. Hosting the tournament won't be much fun.  </P> <P> "I'd like to go hide somewhere, in all reality," Coach Ted Newland said.  </P> <P> Irvine will take a 13-15 record into its final game Saturday against UC Santa  Barbara at Heritage Park.  </P> <P> "I think we'll be much better next year," said Newland, who says after 25  seasons that retirement is still not imminent. "I enjoyed this year," he said.  "I was embittered at times, but these are basically neat human beings. They  worked hard at improving, and their attitude is good."  </P> <P> Timber! Another former Anteater has fallen in with the Minnesota Timberwolves.  This time it is Bob Thornton, acquired in a trade last week from the  Philadelphia 76ers for a second-round draft pick in 1991. He joins former  Anteaters Scott Brooks and Tod Murphy. Johnny Rogers had been with the team but  was cut.  </P> <P> Anteater Notes  </P> <P> Elzie Love, a 6-6 swingman from Perris High School who earlier said he has  committed to Irvine, is expected to sign a national letter of intent with the  Anteaters during the signing period that begins today. Coach Bill Mulligan said  there's a possibility that one or two others will sign early. Two standout high  school girls have said they plan to sign with Irvine -- Brea-Olinda's Jinelle  Williams and Christina Adams of El Cajon Granite Hills. . . . After two meets,  freshman swimmer Liz Koch has the fourth-best 200-yard backstroke time  (2:17.66) in school history. The women's swim team will compete against  Pepperdine and Cal State Bernardino at Pepperdine Saturday, while the men's  team is off for two weeks. . . . The women's volleyball team will finish its  season Tuesday in Crawford Hall against Cal State Long Beach, a team the  Anteaters have not beaten since 1983.  </P></p>

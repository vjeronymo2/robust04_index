			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report THE RALLY in COCOA prices that began on Tuesday morning continued yesterday and accelerated in late trading, pushing the September position on the London Futures and Options Exchange to Pounds 585 a tonne, up by Pounds 15 on the day and by Pounds 30 from Tuesday's low. Dealers said the late move enlivened an otherwise extremely dull day with the market appearing to have entered a period of comparative stability after the recent run-up and retracement. They said the quickening of the rise was partly because of the triggering of stop-loss buying orders set by operators who had speculated on the recent fall continuing. At the London Metal Exchange early gains were generally pared back, but all base metals finished with net gains on the day. Apart from zinc (see story above) the strongest LME contract was TIN, which ended Dollars 167.50 up in the cash position at Dollars 7,047.50 a tonne. Once again stop-loss orders were instrumental in the advance, which was later halted by profit-taking. Talk of delays to Chinese shipments were also supportive. Cash COPPER ended Pounds 18.50 up at Pounds 1,354 a tonne with the market underpinned by the continuing Polish mine strike. Compiled from Reuters</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LONG JOURNEY THAT BROUGHT FOUR LIVES TOGETHER UNDER AN ITALIAN SUN  </P> <P> The crowded bus squeezed through the city gates of Florence and jolted to a  stop.  </P> <P> An elderly woman pushed her way inside. Her gray hair was pulled tightly into  an uncompromising bun. A dark dress covered her matronly figure.  </P> <P> Because she looked about the same age as my mother, I stood up and gave her my  seat. A gold tooth flashed as she smiled her thanks at me.  </P> <P> My mother also smiled as I lurched across the aisle of the crowded bus to stand  beside her. Age was the only thing that she had in common with the Italian  woman. Age and the perspiration that shone on everyone's face.  </P> <P> Mother's white hair was fashionably short, her knit shirt and golfing skirt as  distinctly American as my blond pageboy and summer khakis. On a local Italian  bus, we looked as out of place as we felt.  </P> <P> Drops of sweat itched new paths down my back as the bus curved around the dusty  hills surrounding Florence. Through the windows, the unfamiliar landscape  slipped by: small villages, farms, the occasional cemetery with exuberant  statues marking the graves.  </P> <P> We didn't talk much.  </P> <P> Any visit to a relative's grave is hard. Even 45 years after the actual death,  memories flood back.  </P> <P> It was easier for me. I never knew my father. But my mother was going to visit  her husband's grave. She had avoided everything associated with death for as  long as I could remember. At 13, she had buried her mother; at 23, her first  husband. Weary of the pain of funeral rites, she had not been to a funeral or a  grave since.  </P> <P> Neither had I. Yet when I planned to vacation in Europe, I knew I had to go to  Italy to visit my father's grave. To my surprise, Mother wanted to come with  me.  </P> <P> The American Battle Monuments Commission sent a brochure with directions to the  cemetery. They were simple and clear on paper: "Florence Cemetery is located on  the west side of Via Cassia, about 7 1/2 miles south of Florence . . . The SITA  bus station provides frequent bus service. . . ."  </P> <P> It was easy to find the huge bus station in the center of Florence. But no one  could tell us where to catch the bus we needed until a young woman at the  tourist information window outside the station managed to locate a bus route to  the Via Cassia.  </P> <P> The bus left from a square named Santa Maria Novella, blocks away. So map in  hand, we set out to find it. We would have walked past it, if I hadn't  remembered the patterned elegance of the church that gave the square its name  from a slide I'd seen, long ago, in a college art history class.  </P> <P> Even though the windows of the bus were open, the heat kept rising as the sun  drew nearer to the center of the sky. Mother's white hair was beginning to mat  to her head.  </P> <P> I reached down and squeezed her shoulder; she patted my hand. I gave the  desperate, silent prayer of the traveler who doesn't speak the language:  "Please, God, let us be on the right bus."  </P> <P> We kept looking for the unmistakable symmetry of an American military cemetery.  </P> <P> "There is a bus stop conveniently located just outside the gate," the pamphlet  had said. But what if the folds of the hills hid the cemetery from view? Where  would we end up if we missed it?  </P> <P> We were empty-handed. We'd planned to buy flowers at one of the many flower  stands by the bus station, but had been too confused to add another task to our  journey.  </P> <P> Firenze . . . what the Italians call Florence, the city of flowers. Few flowers  bloomed by the dusty roadside on this hot July day.  </P> <P> My father must have known these hills, this heat. In July of 1944, the U.S.  Army had reached the outskirts of Florence as they fought their way north from  Rome. He died on the 13th. I was not yet a year old; he was 23. But I had grown  older and he had not.  </P> <P> The bus emptied as we drove farther and farther from Florence, but the elderly  Italian woman still sat across the aisle in the seat I had given her. I envied  her for the comfort of her routine. She knew where she was going.  </P> <P> Maybe she would also know where we were going.  </P> <P> "Cimitero Americano?" I asked her.  </P> <P> She frowned in puzzlement and shook her head with an apologetic smile. She  couldn't understand my pronunciation, but our hotel clerk had written down our  destination. I handed the paper to her. She read it and looked quickly from me  to my mother, then, in a few gestures, indicated that she would tell us when to  get off the bus.  </P> <P> There was, after all, little choice. The bus reached the small town at the end  of the line and dropped the three of us, the last of its passengers, before it  swung off the main road and turned to go back to Florence.  </P> <P> We stood together in the glare of the July sun. Pleasant stucco homes painted  in soft pastels lined each side of the road. The woman pointed in the direction  the bus had been traveling before it turned, moving her arms to show it was a  long walk. She looked troubled.  </P> <P> "Taxi?" The word means the same thing in English and Italian.  </P> <P> So did her answer. "Solo Firenze" (only in Florence).  </P> <P> That was when I noticed Mother angrily wiping her eyes, furious with herself  for losing control. With a fierce determination, she set off down the road in  the noonday heat.  </P> <P> "Scusi, mio papa . . . " I didn't know enough Italian to say more than "Excuse  us, my father . . . " But the woman understood, better than I could. She would  have been in her teens or early 20s during World War II. She must have known  many men who died too young.  </P> <P> I tried to thank her for her help but she wasn't ready to leave us. She caught  up with my mother, motioned us across the street to a pale blue house, and  urged us to enter. In that hot, foreign town, she had become our guardian  angel. It was impossible not to follow her.  </P> <P> We entered a kitchen -- cool, dark and high-ceilinged. A younger woman stood at  the counter, fixing lunch. At her mother's quick explanation, she made us  welcome.  </P> <P> The four of us -- two mothers, two daughters -- sat around the kitchen table. A  kitchen table is a familiar place. I don't know who began to cry first, my  mother or the elderly Italian woman. But as they sat and shared the unspoken  pain of their memories, their daughters cried with them.  </P> <P> When the crying stopped, the responsibility for our journey had somehow shifted  from us to the two Italian women. They began an urgent discussion that ended  only when the daughter got up and left the house. We knew that she was  arranging help, but we had no idea what form that help would take, until she  returned five minutes later with the joyous sound of car keys jingling in her  hand.  </P> <P> It was a short ride to the cemetery, less than 10 minutes by car. They let us  out at the gate and my mother and the elderly Italian woman embraced.  </P> <P> They came from two different parts of the world. They could not speak the  other's language. They would never see each other again. But they had  everything in common. In their youth, they had shared the horrors of a world at  war.  </P> <P> Inside the cemetery, everything became easy. Suddenly, we found ourselves on  American soil, speaking in English. Everyone was solicitous. As next of kin, we  would be driven back to Florence. If only we had called, we could have been  picked up at our hotel. The proper grave site was identified and we were driven  to it.  </P> <P> Row after row of graves lined the slope of a hillside. The cemetery was  arranged with military precision, carefully organized by alphabetical section,  neatly bordered with trees. Into each soldier's headstone was carved his name,  rank, military unit, home state and the date of his death. The rows of crosses  were broken occasionally by the Star of David or the crescent of Islam.  </P> <P> In Section F, Row 9, Grave 35, I met my father for the first time since I was a  week old. He lay between a staff sergeant from New York and a Tec 5 from  Oklahoma. What journeys they took to reach that spot, I'll never know.  </P> <P> After a few minutes, I walked over and sat down in the shade of one of the tall  trees that bordered the graves. My mother needed private time with her  memories. I didn't share them, as my father had never been able to share my  life.  </P> <P> As I sat there, playing with a blade of grass, I decided to send flowers when I  got back to the States. For Christmas and Easter and my father's birthday. I  wanted to share them with him.  </P></p>

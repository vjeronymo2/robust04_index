			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sun Micro posts record revenues but income falls SUN Microsystems, the leading US manufacturer of computer workstations, unveiled an unexpected 43 per cent drop in fourth-quarter net income in spite of posting record revenues in the period. Sun has been one of the fastest-growing companies in the computer industry. Its net income for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 37.7m, or 37 cents a share, against Dollars 66.4m, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose 3 per cent to Dollars 972.7m from Dollars 942.5m last year. The company's share price has been subject to spurts of volatility this year reflecting some concern that Sun would not be able to live up to expectations of very strong growth. Several analysts reduced their earnings projections for the company earlier this year, but most had expected fourth quarter earnings of about 51 cents a share, with essentially flat earnings for the year. Instead, Sun posted annual net income which slid almost 9 per cent to Dollars 173.3m, or Dollars 1.71, compared with Dollars 190.3m, or Dollars 1.85, in fiscal 1991. Revenues advanced to Dollars 3.59bn from Dollars 3.22bn. Mr Kevin Melia, Sun's chief financial officer, said the company had established a new price-performance curve with new products that included substantial price reductions on its existing products. 'While the price reductions did reduce our gross margins, much of the margin impact was offset by improvements in our operating efficiencies.' One factor driving Sun to reduce prices is the increasing overlap between high end personal computers and low end workstations. The steep decline in personal computer prices is now being seen in the workstation segment. Operating income tumbled 51 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 49.3m from Dollars 100.8m. For the full year, operating income was off 11 per cent to Dollars 261.1m from Dollars 294.9m.</p>

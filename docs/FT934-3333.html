			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Re-inventing US banking When the Federal Reserve set out to recapitalise the US banking system after the collapse of the 1980s credit boom, few foresaw that a by-product of this policy would be the transformation of the structure of the banking industry. There lies the irony in Mellon Bank's proposed acquisition of the Dreyfus mutual fund management group, which could prove a significant landmark in the development of US banking if it goes ahead as planned. The Dollars 1.85bn (Pounds 1.2bn) share swap announced this week is a logical response to the erosion of the deposit base of the commercial banking system and the flight of money into mutual funds, which has resulted from the Fed's management of interest rates. With short rates well below long bond rates, US banks have made large profits by borrowing cheaply from depositors to invest in higher-yielding government IOUs. Yet there has been a longer-term cost. Since short rates yield next to nothing in real terms, depositors have fled the banking system for potentially higher returns in bond and equity funds. The Fed, admittedly, has done no more than to accelerate a trend that was already well under way. But the shrinkage in the banks' core businesses has been astonishing. The US household sector's holdings of bank deposits and money market funds have fallen from 50 per cent of total discretionary savings in 1975 to little more than 30 per cent today. Mutual funds have been the chief gainers. On present trends their assets, which are equivalent to about 80 per cent of bank assets, could leapfrog the deposit base of the banking system by mid-decade. More creditworthy This process has coincided with the much-publicised loss of lending business resulting from the third world debt crisis. Since the early 1980s, large companies have borrowed more cheaply from the markets because they are more creditworthy than their own bankers. Any flattening in the yield curve, whereby short-term rates move upwards to narrow the gap against long rates, might put a damper on the outflow of deposits from the banks. But the erosion of the banks' deposit base is a deep-seated trend. The banks' response has in large part been to promote their own in-house mutual funds. Yet this piecemeal approach is desperately slow in the face of the tidal outflow. Hence Mellon's ambitious moves - first, to acquire the Boston Company private banking and mutual fund group last year, and now to pitch for Dreyfus. Novel form The attraction is not merely that former bank depositors are recaptured under another guise. The mutual funds have also been busily underwriting new issues in the equity and bond markets, thereby giving the banks an alternative way of extracting fee income from the corporations that no longer borrow from the banking system. The result, as the economist David Hale of Kemper Financial Services has pointed out, is that the US is moving to its own novel form of mutual fund-based universal banking. Such a system is not without risks. Many former bank depositors mistakenly believe that their investment in bank-managed mutual funds carries a government guarantee. Others have yet to recognise that they can lose much of their capital if markets plunge. Yet with more risk falling on individuals rather than financial intermediaries, the financial system itself is unquestionably more robust. A further remarkable irony is that, by helping drive deposits out of the banking system into mutual funds, the Fed has almost accidentally helped create precisely the banking structure that many experts and legislators had wanted to bring about by other, more cumbersome means: a two-tier system where only very low-yielding deposits enjoy the luxury of government-backed deposit insurance, while higher-yielding assets are unprotected. Moral hazard, which cost the US so dear in the savings and loans fiasco, is thus discreetly being reduced to more manageable proportions. This outcome, which is none the worse for being so unexpected, should be heartily welcomed, even if there is some transitional pain for investors along the way.</p>

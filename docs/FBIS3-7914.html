			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Socialist Party, by an unidentified announcer -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Announcer] You still do not  have a prime ministerial candidate. At the same time you do have  a candidate for president of the Republic. This is a fairly  peculiar situation. To top it all off, you have a candidate for  president of the Republic at a time when the liberal parties, to  the best of my knowledge, have not yet said who is their  candidate for president of the Republic.    [Horn] That is their affair. We thought that not only is  Arpad Goncz a generally respected figure, but the country has a  great deal to thank him for, from the point of view of the fact  that it has been possible to safeguard peace in the very  difficult and complex process of the transformation. It is our  conviction that there is no alternative to Arpad Goncz in this  position today.    As far as the candidate for prime minister is concerned, it  really is not a case of tactics. But we are of the view that  first of all we shall have to see the election results - because  at present they are unpredictable; and on the other hand, at the  congress yesterday we adopted a package of demands, a system of  conditions, whereby if the HSP finds itself in that sort of  situation, it would negotiate with the possible coalition  partners. Now, if we were to commit ourselves in advance on the  issue of the prime minister candidate, let us say, then that  would make the negotiations more difficult. We are open in this  respect, and what we say is that those people should get into  government posts who are decent and the most qualified  professionally, regardless of what party they belong to.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 26 (YONHAP) -- The government and ruling  Democratic Liberal Party decided at a joint meeting Sunday to  cope sternly with the illegal strike by railroad and subway  workers, saying that the ongoing strike takes the form of  political struggle rather than pure labor dispute.    Police, meanwhile, raided a church hall in downtown Seoul  Sunday afternoon to haul away over 250 striking railroad workers  who have been staging a sit-in at the hall since they began the  strike last Thursday.    It was the second time in a day that the police raided  sit-in  protest sites of striking railroad and subway workers. Earlier  in the day, police broke into Kyung Hee and Dongduck Women's  Universities to arrest and disperse striking workers and  sympathizing students.    In the joint government and ruling party meeting, the two  sides agreed to come up with measures to fundamentally head off  the possibility of railroad paralysis while trying to mobilize  military manpower to minimize adverse impacts of the ongoing  strike on the country's economy.    The joint meeting attended by relevant high-ranking  government officials and lawmakers including O Myong,  transportation minister; Nam Chae-hui, labor minister; Yi  Won-chong, Seoul city mayor; and Yi Se-ki, the ruling DLP's  chief policymaker, also agreed to sternly deal with any sympathy  strikes which the National Council of Union Representatives or  Chonnodae encompassing the nation's major manufacturing  companies threatened to stage Monday.    Transportation Minister O said in the meeting "We expect the  ongoing strike to enter a recovering phase starting tomorrow,"  adding the ministry will make it sure that the strategic  material, in particular, be moved without fail.    "As of 10 A.M. this morning, the ministry finished accepting  applications of the striking workers to return to their works  and the ministry will not extend the deadline," said O. "From  now on, the ministry will continue to accept those who want to  return to their works but they should be subjected to  disadvantages in personnel management."</p>

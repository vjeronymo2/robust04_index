			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Observer: Out of touch It may be called the New York Metals Exchange (Nymex), but don't expect it to deal in metal. Such at least is the impression just gained by Impala Platinum. The beleaguered South African producer has had to buy a total of 70,000 ounces of platinum in the market because of production shortfalls caused by labour unrest. A proportion of this was obtained by taking physical delivery on outstanding futures contracts. Impala's chairman, Brian Gilbertson, now reports that the company has received a 'snotty' letter from the chairman of Nymex. If Impala continued to insist on taking delivery of metal, it said, Nymex would have to consider blacklisting the company. Apparently the Nymex argument is that the exchange is merely in the business of supplying a price. But Gilbertson reckons it is very frustrating to have the price set by someone who will not take or deliver metal. 'If ever there's an argument for producer pricing, this is it,' he maintains.</p>

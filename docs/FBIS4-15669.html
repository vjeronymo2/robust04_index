			<p>BFN     [Text] Estonia is ready to start the dismantling of the  nuclear reactors belonging to the Russian Navy Education Center  in the Estonian city of Paldiski, Advisor from the Estonian  Foreign Ministry and head of the military working group for  negotiations with Russia Agu Tiiman announced at a press  conference today.    Tiiman stressed that the dismantling could be completed  within three years. Earlier, the Russian party had proposed  that the work be completed by 1999.    The first stage of the dismantling, considered the most  dangerous, consists of the withdrawal of fuel bars and can be  started in the next few days, Tiiman said. This stage is  expected to be finished before June 31, 1994. During the second  stage Russian specialists will withdraw the secret technical  equipment of the reactors after which the last stage begins. It  consists of the dismantling of the walls of the reactors.    Tiiman spoke against temporary or permanent conservation of  the reactors' bodies in Estonia. He pointed out that all of  them must be withdrawn to Russia.    In accordance with the Russian-Estonian agreements Russia  will carry out all the work on dismantling and Estonia will be  responsible for security in the city and its outskirts and will  participate in possible emergency works. Russian  representatives at the international conference in Stockholm  earlier this year agreed to let foreign observers to the last  stage of the work.</p>

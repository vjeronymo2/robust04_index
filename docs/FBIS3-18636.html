			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] As we announced earlier, we have  contacted Defense Minister Fabbri by telephone. Hello, Minister  Fabbri. In a few words, is it realistic to think that our  troops might now go to Bosnia?    [Fabbri] I do not like calculating probability -- let us  stick to the facts. As far as we know, the UN position -- that  they do not want troops from bordering countries to participate  -- has not changed. We realize that there is a real need to  reinforce the numbers of blue helmets in former Yugoslavia. If  we receive a request from the United Nations, the government, as  a whole, will calmly study the request, giving it all the  consideration the case demands. We will take all aspects of the  situation into consideration. Among other things, I want to  stress that it would be important to know what stance was being  taken by the warring parties in former Yugoslavia. How would  they react to the possible future presence of armed Italian  forces? This does not mean that we are laying down hostile  conditions about our possible involvement. We are already  playing our part by ensuring logistic and operational support  for all operations headed toward former Yugoslavia. Moreover,  the Italian Armed Forces have already demonstrated in Mozambique  and Somalia that they are able to carry out peacekeeping,  peace-enforcing, and humanitarian aid missions in a professional  manner.    [Announcer] One last thing, are you saying that the UN  Security Council would have to effectively reexamine the matter,  along with the conditions concerning the involvement of  neighboring countries and then make a formal request?    [Fabbri] That is right. The decision already made by the  United Nations would have to be revised and a request then made  to the Italian Government.    [Announcer] Thank you, Minister.</p>

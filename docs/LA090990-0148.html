			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GYPSUM CANYON IDEAL LOCATION FOR MUCH-NEEDED, NEW O.C. JAIL  </P> <P> How much longer is our safety going to be endangered by a few local opponents  of the jail Orange County desperately needs?  </P> <P> The environmental impact report has been certified, the Centralized Jail  Initiative has gone down in flames, and the desert jail has been proven to be  an illusory boondoggle. How many more delay tactics are we going to put up  with?  </P> <P> Everyone in Orange County will benefit from a jail in Gypsum Canyon, including  people living nearby. Without it, criminals will continue to go free.  </P> <P> It's time to pony up for our safety.  </P> <P> ELLEN R. MURRAY  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

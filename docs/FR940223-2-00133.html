Where there is no substantially similar U.S.-certified vehicle, a vehicle that does not conform to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards may be admitted into the United States if the Secretary determines that the safety features of the vehicle comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, those standards based on destructive test data or such other evidence that the Secretary determines to be adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 108(c)(3)(C)(i) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(i), authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to make import eligibility determinations ``(I) on the petition of any registered importer or any manufacturer, or (II) on the Secretary's own initiative.'' The Secretary's authority to make these determinations has been delegated to the Administrator of NHTSA under 49 CFR 1.50(a). The Administrator redelegated to the Associate Administrator for Enforcement the authority to grant or deny petitions for import eligibility determinations submitted by motor vehicle manufacturers and registered importers (49 CFR 501.8(g)(3)). Thus far, a number of import eligibility determinations have been made on the Administrator's own initiative, and the Associate Administrator has granted many petitions for such determinations submitted by registered importers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 108(c)(3)(C)(iv) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(iv), requires the annual publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of a list of all such determinations. That list is set forth in Annex A and is current as of December 31, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each vehicle on the list is preceded by a vehicle eligibility number. The importer of a vehicle admissible under any eligibility determination must write that number on the Form HS&hyph;7 accompanying entry to indicate that the vehicle is eligible for importation. ``VSA'' eligibility numbers are assigned to all vehicles that are determined to be eligible for importation on the initiative of the Administrator. ``VSP'' eligibility numbers are assigned to vehicles that are determined to be eligible under section 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the Act, based on a petition from a manufacturer or registered importer which establishes that a substantially similar U.S.-certified vehicle exists. ``VCP'' eligibility numbers are assigned to vehicles that are determined to be eligible under section 108(c)(3)(C)(i)(II) of the Act, based on a petition from a manufacturer or registered importer which establishes that the vehicle has safety features that comply with, or are capable of being modified to comply with, all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Vehicles for which eligibility determinations have been made are listed in Annex A alphabetically by make. Eligible models within each make are listed numerically by ``VSA,'' ``VSP,'' or ``VCP'' number. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 108(i) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 1397(i), provides that ``any motor vehicle that is 25 or more years old'' is not subject to the Act's importation restrictions. Such vehicles may therefore be imported into the United States without regard to their compliance with applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards. Since the importation of a vehicle more than 25 years old is not conditioned on the existence of an eligibility determination, NHTSA has amended its eligibility determinations so that they no longer apply to such vehicles. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  15 U.S.C. 1397(c)(3)(C)(iv); 49 CFR 593.8; delegations of authority at 49 CFR 1.50 and 501.8. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: February 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William A.

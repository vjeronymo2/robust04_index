			<p>CSO     [Text] Jakarta (ANGKATAN BERSENJATA)--President Suharto  stressed that no country has the right to dictate to other  countries its own concepts or views on basic human rights, let  alone force those concepts or views as conditions for  international economic cooperation.    In his speech at an official dinner in the honor of Dutch  Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers on Tuesday, 5 April, President  Suharto again stressed the united position of Indonesia,  Nonaligned Movement countries, and other developing countries.    "I stressed that basic human rights and liberties, as  embodied and spelled out in the charter and various other  declarations and documents of the United Nations, do indeed  include things that are universal in nature. Basic human rights  should be protected and promoted by all nations. This needs to  be done through international cooperation on the basis of  equality," the president emphasized.    Attention needs to be given to the very close connection  between basic human rights and other rights, such as civil,  political, economic, social, and cultural rights, the president  continued.    The balance between individual rights and the rights of  society and the nation also needs to be guarded.    The United Nations itself, the president said, acknowledges  that the authority and responsibility for implementing those  rights nationally lies with each government and fully notes the  differences among countries with regard to culture, religion,  customs, and levels of economic growth.  <H5>  No Signs </H5>   Earlier, the president said that there are as yet no signs  that the international economic disparity can be resolved.  Growing economic globalization has drastically changed  production, trade, and monetary patterns and has had the impact  of producing large economic groupings among industrialized  countries in ways that tend toward protectionism,  discrimination, and a climate of unhealthy competition.    "In this situation, Indonesia is convinced of the need to  bridge the economic disparity between the North and the South  through international cooperation, consultation, and  consultative dialogue," the president said.    The president also said that he has never seen the fortunes  and interests of the North and the South as closely connected as  they are now.    Therefore, the president said, it is natural and logical for  both sides to expand cooperation on the basis of true mutual  dependence, mutual interests, and mutual benefit.    The president said that countries now face uncertainty in  various aspects of life. The end of the cold war and East-West  enmity has opened opportunities for building a new era for  international relations.    Growing mutual dependence and economic globalization have  provided hopeful opportunities. Nevertheless, the hopeful world  situation is not without obstacles and challenges.    "Several new problems and dilemmas have emerged on the  political and economic scene. In some areas, there have arisen  new tensions and conflicts, aggression and foreign interference,  conflicts rooted in ethnic and religious controversies, new  forms of racism, and the resurrection of narrow nationalism,"  the chief of state said.    In a world situation full of uncertainty, Indonesia and  other  developing countries are conducting their respective national  development in order to catch up.    "We fully realize that the responsibility for the  development  of a nation is entirely on the shoulders of that nation itself.  On the other hand, we also realize that success will remain  difficult to achieve if international and regional spheres are  not supportive. That is the reason why the Indonesian people  always take part in encouraging the creation of a world economic  order based on partnership, equality, and fairness," the  president said.    The president said that, remembering their very long ties of  history, relations between Indonesia and the Netherlands have  significance for both countries. Nevertheless, the president  said, we can now give new meaning and objectives to the ties of  the past.    "We establish these ties as countries on the same level who  respect each other, avoid interfering in each other's internal  affairs, and provide benefit to each other," the president  stated.  <H5>  Opportunities </H5>   In their talk on Tuesday afternoon, President Suharto told  Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers that there are opportunities  for Dutch businessmen to take part in developing various aspects  of the economic infrastructure, such as the construction of  electric power plants, telecommunications facilities, and a  container port under the BOT (build, operate, transfer) system.    "President Suharto also opened opportunities for Dutch  businessmen to invest their capital here. Their products can be  marketed not only in the European Community, but in the Asia  Pacific area, too," Murdiono said as he described to reporters  the results of the talks between President Suharto and Prime  Minister Lubbers at Freedom Palace on Tuesday, 5 April.    According to Murdiono, the opportunity to develop the  various  aspects of the economic infrastructure was offered to Dutch  businessmen because of the state's limited financial ability to  develop that infrastructure.    In response to the president's offer, Prime Minister Lubbers  said the Netherlands is ready to expand cooperation in the  economic sector because Dutch businessmen have considerable  investment capability.  <H5>  Naval Cooperation </H5>   According to Murdiono, Prime Minister Lubbers specifically  offered cooperation between the Netherlands and Indonesia in the  naval sector for acquisition of ships, use of Dutch technology  (which is considered to be quite high), and, possibly, joint  exercises.    The minister of state and state secretary [MENSESNEG] said  the president responded that those matters can be discussed at  the senior official level.    Nevertheless, Murdiono said, the president also stressed  that  the Indonesian people are determined to give priority to  economic development.    "This does not mean that Indonesia has accepted the proposal  from the Dutch Government," he added.    Murdiono explained that defense and security development  does  in fact have priority, although the priority is not as high as  that of economic development. "Therefore, we must see first what  it is they are offering and what we need, and before they offer  we must see whether we are able to pay for it," the MENSESNEG  said.    The president also took the opportunity to explain the  thinking behind strategic development in both PJP [Long-Term  Development] I and PJP II, in addition to explaining matters  related to the Nonaligned Movement and APEC [Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation]. On his part, Prime Minister Lubbers  explained various developments in Europe.    The president also urged the Netherlands to participate in  cooperation within the three-way South-South concept. The  problem, said Murdiono, is that South-South cooperation is often  difficult to carry out because the funds of Southern countries  are limited. In this situation, it is hoped that a third party,  in this case industrialized countries, will participate.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Twelve fix steel duties for east THE EC has fixed definitive anti-dumping duties of up to 21.7 per cent on seamless iron and steel tubes imported from Hungary, Poland and Croatia, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. But officials said yesterday the duties were 'theoretical' as almost all steel producers in the countries had given price undertakings, exempting them from duties. The Commission fixed provisional duties in November after EC producers complained the industry was being undermined by cheap imports. The duties have now been fixed, with immediate effect, at 21.7 per cent for imports from Hungary, 17.4 per cent from Croatia and 10.8 per cent from Poland. The EC has also decided to set tariff-quotas on a wider range of Czech and Slovak steel products as part of measures aimed at protecting EC industry from the cheap imports.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Minister defends truancy tables PERFORMANCE tables of school truancy rates are essential to the government's 'back to basics' campaign, Baroness Blatch, the education minister, said yesterday. She said high truancy rates had contributed to the rising crime rate. 'Not every truant is a potential criminal. Some may be at home watching television,' she said. 'But where teenagers or even very young children are wandering the streets - as many do - they are all too vulnerable to criminal or anti-social influences.' She told a conference on truancy, organised by the University of North London, that the Department for Education, which will next week publish the first truancy tables, had received responses from 95 per cent of schools in England and Wales in spite of an attempt to boycott them by the National Association of Head Teachers. The government plans to extend the tables to include authorised as well as unauthorised absences, following complaints that some schools are less stringent than others. Dr Dennis O'Keeffe, director of the university's truancy unit, told the conference he was sceptical about a direct link between truancy and crime. But a survey by the university had suggested that 30.5 per cent of pupils in their last two years of compulsory schooling played truant at least once.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Guo Liqun (6753 0500 5028)] </F>   [Excerpt] Beijing, 22 Mar (XINHUA) -- Agriculture, rural  areas, and peasants have remained a hot topic of discussion  among deputies from Jilin, a major agricultural province, to the  Second Session of the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC].  Over the last few days, how to develop Jilin's rural economy to  enable peasants to become better off at an earlier date has  remained one of the central issues discussed by deputies from  Jilin. Deputy Gao Yan, who is governor of Jilin, said: Enabling  peasants to become better off is another leap in the vast rural  areas following our success in eliminating poverty and providing  enough food and clothing to them. Once we succeed in this work,  we will be able to solve new and old problems and make further  progress.    To enable peasants to become better off, the first thing we  need to do is to develop agriculture. Deputies from the  province said Jilin should establish agricultural bases, develop  famous brand name agricultural products, and promote  agriculture-related high technologies, in order to ensure the  province's agricultural development.    A few deputies said the low efficiency in grain growing had  dampened peasants' production enthusiasm and hampered their  efforts to live a better life. They said the situation must be  changed. Peasant deputy Hao Fuxia from the Dongxia Village in  Meihekou City's Zhonghe Town said: "However the rural areas may  develop, farming is the job of peasants. But now we really need  to study some way to develop the agriculture." [passage omitted]</p>

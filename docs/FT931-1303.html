			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Arts: Feelgood metaphysics - Cinema WITTGENSTEIN Derek Jarman FOREVER YOUNG (PG) Steve Miner THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN (15) Jonathan Lynn WIND (PG) Carroll Ballard INDOCHINE (12) Regis Wargnier In this week's newest Hollywood blockbuster, the young philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein (Mel Gibson) is deep-frozen by Cambridge scientists for 50 years and wakes up on the morning of the 1989 Americas Cup final in Newport, Rhode Island. Reunited with his Indochinese girlfriend Catherine Deneuve, he sets out to win the famous cup, but is sidetracked by an ambition to become America's first independent black Congressman . . . 'Wake up, sir. You are having a nightmare]' It is my butler, holding the morning cup of tea. It was all a dream; but for film critics these dreams are becoming ever more indistinguishable from waking. Just how much damage do regular doses of twice-daily filmgoing do to the brain and imagination? First: I greatly enjoyed every film this week. Second: that is exactly the problem. The pleasure derived from Derek Jarman's Wittgenstein seems to me indistinguishable from that derived from Mel Gibson busking for tears and laughter in the cryogenics epic Forever Young; and the week's other films we will implicate in due course. Feelgood movies are feelgood movies wherever they come from. And feelgood metaphysics likewise; whether signed by a Viennese-Cambridge philosopher and enacted with bargain-basement props against a black wall (Jarman) or blown up to umpteen-millimetre while every violinist in Hollywood underscores the magical, time-slicing plot that kicks off in 1939. Girl meets boy, girl has coma, boy gets frozen, hello 1989, out with the handkerchiefs. With art cinema on the retreat, and Western culture's populist current pulling even higher criticism with it, no one today wants to work hard in front of a movie screen. 'Serious' cinema, from today's Wittgenstein to last week's Orlando, has become as all-singing, all-dancing as popular cinema. If Bergman or Godard were beginning their careers in the 1990s rather than the 1950s, they would be making films like Swedish Angst Is Fun and Two Or Three Things I Know About Macaulay Culkin. Wittgenstein is, make no mistake, enormous fun. Co-scripted by Jarman with Professor Terry Eagleton, the movie turns the life of the Austrian-born, Cambridge-naturalised philosopher into a lantern slide lecture with intervals for wacky comedy. Around Karl Johnson's sweetly stammering hero assemble, inter alia, Michael Gough as Bertrand Russell, Tilda Swinton whooping it up in silks and feathers as Lady Ottoline Morrell and John Quentin snapping out the Bloomsbury one-liners as J. Maynard Keynes. Have we omitted the green Martian who challenges Wittgenstein's theories in conversation? Or the rhinoceros under Bertrand Russell's table? Or the neo-classical garb sported by Ludwig's upper-Viennese family, whom Jarman envisions as poised forever on the starting blocks of some cosmic opera seria. 'Class' is a major theme, as it would be in any Eagleton script. We scream inwardly at some of the radical-propagandist hyperboles. Because Ottoline was a Lady, need she be stricken with quite such an impenetrable drawl or air of Marie Antoinettish disdain? 'I must send him some cocoa tablets, he sounds rather depressed' she flutes of Wittgenstein, now stuck in an Italian P-o-W camp writing his Tractatus. But later, when our hero dons a boiler suit and departs for volunteer manual labour in Russia, Jarman and Eagleton have the decency to chuckle at that too. Then Ludwig comes back in time for a bit of love (gay) and a bit of dying while history draws the curtain on a noble soul and his contribution to philosophy. Oh] his philosophy - we almost forgot that. I understand from the film that it was something about the limits of language being the limits of one's world. But I had to go to my bookshelves to mug it up again properly. Wittgenstein is too busy being gay, skittish, highly coloured, dreadfully enjoyable and even (Oh Hollywood on the Cam]) shamelessly tear-jerking at the close to worry too much about thoughts and ideas. Forever Young, directed by Steve Miner from a Kleenex-intensive script by Jeffrey Abrams, carries on where Jarman's film leaves off. 1939 test pilot Mel Gibson, realising like Wittgenstein the limits of language or philosophy in the face of the unassimilable (his girlfriend's coma after a street accident), has himself frozen. Cryogenics boffin George Wendt sticks him in the ice tray; then he wakes in 1989 to find the US military on his tail, housewife Jamie Lee Curtis offering suburban haven and Curtis's young son Elijah Wood, who accidentally defrosted him after stumbling into a military warehouse, following terror with hero-worship. Like Wittgenstein - indeed like all today's pleasure principle cinema - Forever Young has an impatience with time and a honey-bee approach to mood. It moves about the decades, buzzing from comedy to pathos to thrills to tears. Finally it goes out in a blaze of manufactured pathos as love conquers all on a Pacific promontory. (Surely it is the same promontory where Julia Roberts loved and lost in the interchangeably-titled-and-plotted Dying Young?) Is Forever Young enjoyable? Yes, dreadfully. But in today's hedonistic cinema, what movie is not? Even the flops seem so anxious for your appreciation that you place a sparkle in your eyes in reel one and find it still there at the end. In The Distinguished Gentleman Eddie Murphy, Hollywood's grin on a stick, moves through Washington DC holding aloft his brand of popsicle populism. Murphy is a Florida con man who cons his way into Congress. He is soon founding bogus foundations and panhandling for honorariums. But then a little boy with cancer - yes] - wreaks a Capra-esque miracle and turns the scam artist into a people's hero. The script by former Walter Mondale speechwriter Marty Kaplan is knee-deep in Washington lore but only ankle-deep in wit. And Britain's Jonathan Lynn (Nuns On The Run) directs as if down on all fours trying to mop up every drop. The villains are somewhat dull - Capra would have given us silken Claude Rains and/or seismic Edward Arnold - and the maudlin subplot is an embarrassment. But let us not over-carp. Murphy is there to unzip his smile and flash his genius for mimicry, and I was still watching without consulting my watch as the end credits rolled. Wind is two hours of blithe drivel about championship yachting. It should carry an environment-friendly notice: 'Beautiful scenery. Please do not deposit movie dialogue.' The script by Mac Gudgeon and Rudy Wurlitzer (vacationing from the talent that gave us Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid) provoked unseemly giggles at the Press show. Americas Cup contender Matthew Modine spends half the film tacking to avoid lines like 'Sometimes we pay too high a price for our dreams' (yacht tycoon Cliff Robertson) or 'The most important thing is finding your own wind' (himself), the other half trying to make clear runs for the action channel. The yachting scenes are well shot by director Carroll Ballard and brilliantly 'sound-designed' by Alan Splet, with booms and crunches and wind-howlings that shiver your timbers. But what price such panache on the ocean when back on shore, life consists of waterlogged love-plots (Jennifer Grey) and dialogue written on the back of a binnacle. But as Wittgenstein once said, in one of his early untranslated works, even bad art has its serenity. Regis Wargnier's much-hyped Indochine, representing France at next week's Foreign Film Oscars, is the very incarnation of the age of Brainless Hedonism. Time was when we looked to the French for a cinema that was impudent (Godard), anarchic (Chabrol), mercurial (Truffaut) or experimental (Resnais, Rivette); in a word, challenging. Today we get a 2 1/2 -hour slab of steamed-up melodrama with Catherine Deneuve doing a Bette Davis in the tropics. Empires fall; lovers betray; adopted daughters get pregnant; and when all else fails there is a battle scene or some ooh-aah horror in an opium den. If only life were as daft and colourful as the movies. But if only the movies were less daft and colourful  -sometimes - and more intelligently related to real life.</p>

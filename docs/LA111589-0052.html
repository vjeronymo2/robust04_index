			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Hoylake Told to Disclose Takeover Terms: Arizona's director of insurance  ordered Sir James Goldsmith's investment group to spell out what it plans to  offer shareholders of BAT Industries of London even if it intends to sell BAT's  Farmers Group insurance unit to Axa Midi Assurances of Paris. A scheduled  hearing Dec. 4 on the proposed change of Farmers' ownership was canceled  pending a new filing by Hoylake, which must win approvals of insurance  regulators in the seven states, including California, where units of Los  Angeles-based Farmers have their headquarters. Hoylake said it will file the  information this week.  </P></p>

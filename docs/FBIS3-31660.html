Presidential spokesman Andras Farago said the president  congratulated Kozyrev on the joint Russian-Western success in  dealing with the the situation in Sarajevo.    In Hungary's view, NATO's Partnership for Peace is not an  empty initiative but a practicable scheme giving attention to  the human, legal, and social factors of security, in addition to  its military side.    Kozyrev conveyed greetings from President Boris Yeltsin to  Goncz. He assured Goncz that Moscow always examines how its  foreign policy moves contribute to Central-European stability.    He said Moscow supports cooperation and peace partnership  with NATO, but stressed the need to find concrete solutions to  individual problems in the region.    Russia also attaches great importance to the CSCE and its  summit, to be held in Budapest at the end of the year.</p>

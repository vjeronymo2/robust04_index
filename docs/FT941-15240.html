			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Arts: South Bank tunes up for the future - Off the Wall Think of the Royal Festival Hall and you think of orchestral concerts. If it is not the LPO playing Beethoven, Brahms and Tchaikovsky, it is the Philharmonia playing Tchaikovsky, Beethoven and Brahms. There is little wrong with that if that is what the punters want. But there are increasing signs that the audience for classical music is getting so elderly that it is falling off its ticket buying perch. Some estimates put 70 per cent of the audience in the over-50 age bracket and as they increase in years they reduce their visits. Attendances at the South Bank have slumped from 81 per cent to 60 per cent over the last 20 years, and although the LPO and the Philharmonia have attracted larger audiences than their competitors, no one is complacent about the long term future of classical music at the Festival Hall. Of course it will still be played there most nights, but the South Bank has hired David Sefton to seek out a younger audience and spice up the programming with a Pounds 200,000 pump-priming fund. The money can be used to offer new promoters a guarantee against loss on their events, while Sefton is secretly confident that, with good judgment, there will be a profit to divide up. The Festival Hall cannot quite shake off its cultural heritage and is reluctant to go down the classical 'pops' route, despite the success of impresarios like Raymond Gubbay. At the Barbican and the Royal Albert Hall, Gubbay packs them in for themed events like a Valentine's Day Love Classics concert at the Barbican (with every lady receiving a red rose), and Classical Spectaculars, with lasers and big bangs, at the Albert Hall. At the South Bank, Sefton is keener to develop concerts of movie music, often in conjunction with the adjacent National Film Theatre, which is also suffering an audience fall. The Liverpool Philharmonic is lined up to play Michael Nyman's music for The Piano and Philip Glass's new soundtrack for Cocteau's La Belle et la Bete will also be performed. The audience will often be able to see the movie and hear the concert. There are also plans to develop joint promotions with the Lincoln Center in New York, which faces similar problems. The Lincoln might take the South Bank's summer Meltdown festival, when an artist creates his personal programme (this year it is composer Louis Andriessen, next year Elvis Costello), while the South Bank could gain from the Lincoln's idea of a theatre whizz-kid masterminding a classical music performance (Robert Wilson directing Jessye Norman is the most likely import). Pop, jazz and rock promoters are being courted - after all, Jimi Hendrix once picked the guitar with his teeth at the Festival Hall. A typical compromise event being considered is Sting performing his songs with an orchestra. South Bank director Nicholas Snowman is even prepared to allow this more laid back audience to bring their drinks into the performance. The aim is the trendy avant-garde, the Steve Reich, kd Lang, Theatre de Complicite fan clubs, rather than Shirley Bassey's, although that Welsh diva will be belting out for a week in October. There are problems in broadening the repertoire, mainly the priority given to the resident orchestra, the LPO, and the first reserve, the Philharmonia, on bookings years in advance and rehearsal facilities. Sefton is negotiating a more flexible arrangement with the orchestras. In the autumn the South Bank will launch a new corporate identity and embark on a substantial marketing programme to tell the world about its wider appeal. But it must know that the fall in demand for its classical music is a symptom of a much wider problem - the feeling that a trip to the South Bank is a journey into the past, that the buildings are a decaying remnant of a brutalist architectural age, now inhabited by relics of the underclass. Money is being spent internally, on improving the acoustics, back stage areas, the lifts, lavatories, etc. but in the long term the South Bank needs to make a convincing case to the government for Lottery money to knock down its more oppressive features - the Hayward Gallery, the walkways - and seize the chance offered by the smart new Channel terminus at nearby Waterloo, the refurbishment of County Hall as a hotel, and the potential development of the riverside car park site as the home of the Tate Gallery of Modern Art, to make the South Bank the popular arts centre which it never quite became. * It can hardly be a coincidence that on the day that Lord Gowrie was confirmed as the next chairman of the Arts Council, the Department of National Heritage backed off in its efforts to ruin the Serpentine Gallery in Hyde Park by raising its rent to unreasonable levels. Gowrie was chairman of the Serpentine, one of London's main showcases for contemporary art. (He has naturally had to resign on taking over the Council). He was appalled at the idea floated by Iain Sproat, number two at the DNH, and a firm opponent of such art, that if the Gallery could not pay its way the site might be better used as an equestrian centre. Once again Sproat showed his uncanny ability to ruffle feathers when he strays from his sports brief into the arts. Sproat's boss, Peter Brooke, quickly stamped on the proposal and Gowrie was saved the embarrassment of resigning as chairman of the Council before he was appointed. * All those arts companies losing the services of the retiring Princess of Wales as patron can only look on in envy as the RSC (president the Prince of Wales) picks up a Pounds 3.3m sponsorship from Allied-Lyons. The company's chairman Michael Jackaman was among the businessmen attending a Buckingham Palace gala in the autumn hosted by the Prince at which the RSC showed off its paces in the grandest of surroundings. Although Allied-Lyons selected the RSC after a protracted marketing audit, the evening at the Palace must have helped to cement the relationship. As must the appearance of the twin children of Tony Hales, Allied-Lyons chief executive, in walk-on roles in a recent RSC production of A Winter's Tale at Hales's home town of Stratford-on-Avon.</p>

These rules have been formulated pursuant to the  provisions in Article 16 of the "Provisional Regulations of the  People's Republic of China on Business Taxes" (hereinafter  referred to as Regulations).    Article 2. Taxable services referred to in Article 1 of the  Regulations are services covered by the scope of taxable items  in the transportation, communications, construction, finance,  insurance, postal, telecommunications, cultural, sports,  recreational, and service sectors.    Processing, repairs, and replacement services are not  taxable  services as referred to in the Regulations (hereinafter referred  to as nontaxable services).    Article 3. Foreign exchange, negotiable securities, and  futures transactions referred to in item 5 of Article 5 of the  Regulations are transactions conducted by financial institutions  (including banks and nonbanking financial institutions) in those  commodities. No business taxes shall be levied on foreign  exchange, negotiable securities, or futures transactions  conducted by nonbanking financial institutions and individuals.    Futures referred to in item 5 of Article 5 of the  Regulations  are noncommodity futures. No business taxes shall be levied on  commodity futures.    Article 4. The provision of taxable services, the transfer  of intangible assets, and the sale of immovable property as  referred to in Article 1 of the Regulations are acts of  providing taxable services and transferring intangible assets or  the ownership of immovable property in return for compensation  (hereinafter referred to as taxable acts). However, taxable  services provided by employees hired by units or self-employed  business operators for their units or employers are excluded.    Compensation referred to in the preceding paragraph includes  currency, goods, and other economic benefits.    If units or individuals construct their own buildings  (hereinafter referred to as independent construction) and sell  them later, their act of independent construction shall be  considered a taxable service.    The transfer of limited immovable property rights or  permanent rights to use immovable property, as well as the  donation of such property by units to other people, shall be  considered a sale of immovable property.    Article 5. A sales act which involves both taxable services  and goods is a mixed sales act. The mixed sales acts of  enterprises, enterprise-type units, and individual operators  that produce, wholesale, or retail goods shall be considered  merchandise sales on which no business taxes shall be levied.  The mixed sales acts of other units and individuals, however,  shall be considered taxable services on which business taxes  shall be levied.    The State General Administration of Taxation shall determine  whether a taxpayer's sales act is mixed or not.    Goods referred to in the first paragraph are tangible  movable  property, including electric power, thermal power, and gases  [sentence as received].

Article 6. Taxpayers who concurrently deal in taxable  labor services and goods, or in nontaxable labor services,  should separately compute the sales amounts of their taxable  labor services and goods, or the sales amount of their  nontaxable labor services. In case separate computations are not  made or cannot be made precisely, value-added taxes instead of  business taxes are to be levied on the taxable labor services  and goods or on nontaxable labor services.    Whether value-added taxes should be levied on taxable labor  services provided by taxpayers as a side business is to be  decided by a taxation organ under the State General  Administration of Taxation.

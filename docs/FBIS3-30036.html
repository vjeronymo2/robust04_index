			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Editorial": "The Mobile Phone Issue Should be Settled </F> Through Private Sector Discussion"]    [Text] The U.S. Government asserts that the Japanese  market for car phones and other mobile phones is not open  enough, and that Japan has thus violated the 1989 agreement  between the two countries. It is now preparing sanctions  against Japan.    Put simply, the U.S. Government complaint, and that of the  private company involved, Motorola, is that while a U.S. company  has succeeded in entering the market, its market share is too  small. They profess particularly strong dissatisfaction with the  fact that, in the Tokyo metropolitan area, and Central Japan,  the biggest markets for mobile phones, Motorola is  overwhelmingly disadvantaged by rival Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corporation's (NTT) system, and they claim this  constitutes breaking the promise made in 1989.    There is a reason for the Motorola system's minimal share in  the above areas. In 1987, the mobile phone market, which used  to be monopolized by NTT, was opened, and the Cellular Telephone  Group (affiliated with DDI Corporation) and Teleway Japan  Corporation (later IDO) joined the market. At that time, due to  government policy which forbade more than two companies  operating in any one area, NTT was permitted to operate  nationwide, IDO in the metropolitan area and Central Japan, and  the Cellular Group in the other service areas.    IDO actually started its service under the Motorola system  in  November 1991, although it had already begun an NTT-system  service in late 1988. There was, therefore, a time lag of about  three years and capital investment in the Motorola system cannot  be compared with that in the NTT system. The NTT-system service  can be offered to an area covering 94 percent of the Japanese  population, while the Motorola system can only service an area  covering 60 percent of the population. In terms of the number  of mobile phone units contracted, the Motorola system accounts  for only 10,000 terminals, compared to the NTT system's  overwhelming 310,000 sets.    The United States sees the failure to set up from the start  a  mobile phone company servicing the whole country under the  Motorola system, and IDO's delay in actually operating the  Motorola system, even after it was adopted, as deliberate moves  on the part of Japan to obstruct the opening of the market.    An outright purchase system [as opposed to the existing  lease  system] for mobile phone terminals will be introduced next  April, as will a digital service. At a time when the market is  expected to expand vigorously, whatever the reasons put forward  by the Japanese, the United States seems to have become  increasingly irritated by the fact its serious disadvantage in  market share compared to the NTT system may prove a decisive  setback in future business operations.    The Japanese side reportedly plans to increase  Motorola-system relay stations by 130 in the next two or three  years, allowing the Motorola-system service to grow to the same  level as the NTT-system service. We do not intend to say we  cannot understand why the United States is irritated.  Nevertheless, the attitude of the U.S. Government is  unreasonable in urging Japanese private companies to accept its  demands and ignore business profitability. For example, the  United States has demanded that 130 relay stations be  established in fiscal year 1994 and that Japan procure 225,000  Motorola-made terminals.    The current mobile phone issue seems typical of the Clinton  administration's political strategy, and was deliberately raised  to coincide with the summit meeting between the two countries as  well as negotiations under the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks. Although the Japanese Government needs to take positive  steps to dispel U.S. misunderstanding, it should not overreact  to the issue. Both sides should stay calm, and the issue should  be settled through dialogue at the private sector level.  Excessive government intervention will only increase confusion.</p>

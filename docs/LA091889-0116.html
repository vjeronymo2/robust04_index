			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FEW ADVANCES IN GAS MILEAGE MADE BY '90 MODELS, EPA FINDS  </P> <P> Imported cars dominate both the best and the worst categories in the annual  survey of automobile gasoline mileage released today by the Environmental  Protection Agency.  </P> <P> Overall, auto makers made little gain in gasoline mileage in the 1990 model  year although the number of cars -- mostly expensive super-luxury imports --  that trigger the federal "gas guzzler" tax dropped from 40 car types to 30.  </P> <P> "There is no significant difference in the fuel economy of the top 10 1990  models compared to the top 10 1989 models. Likewise, overall fleet average fuel  economy of all cars and light trucks . . . projected to be about the same," the  EPA said in a statement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Renewed Attention  </P> <P> Fuel economy has gained renewed attention in Congress because of concern over  autos' role in causing global warming and air pollution.  </P> <P> Auto emissions, especially carbon dioxide releases, are a direct contributor to  urban smog, which has caused more than 100 metropolitan areas to fail federal  air quality standards. Carbon dioxide also is a major cause of the so-called  "greenhouse effect" that scientists say is expected to cause a warming of Earth  in coming decades.  </P> <P> According to the EPA survey, the mileage leaders were largely foreign-made,  with the Japanese dominating that end of the list.  </P> <P> For the fifth straight year the fuel-stingiest car was the Japanese-made Geo  Metro, sold by Chevrolet, followed by the Honda Civic CRX, Suzuki Swift and  Daihatsu Charade. The Geo Metro XFI model had 53 miles per gallon in the city,  58 on the highway, and 55 overall, the same as last year.  </P> <P> No U.S.-made car made the top 10 list. The Ford Escort had the best mileage of  any domestic car with 32 miles per gallon in the city, 42 on the highway and 36  overall.  </P> <P> The car with the worst mileage was the Lamborghini Countach, which got only six  miles per gallon in the city and 10 on the highway. Rounding out the list of 10  cars with the worst gas mileage were four models of the Rolls Royce, the  Ferrari Testarossa, BMW 750IL, Porsche 928 S4, Audi V8 and Maserati 228.  </P> <P> According to the EPA survey, all but two of the 30 car models subject to the  gas guzzler tax are luxury imports. The exceptions are two Cadillac models, the  Allante and the larger engine (350 cubic inches) Brougham, which have combined  city and highway mileage of 18 and 17 miles per gallon, respectively. They had  the worst gas mileage of any domestic car.  </P> <P> Several Chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last year escaped because of  mileage improvements in 1990 models. These included the Chrysler TC by Maserati  and the Chrysler New Yorker and Dodge Dynasty, successor cars to other Chrysler  models that fell under the guzzler tax in 1989.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Taxed European Models  </P> <P> European models that are subject to the tax come from Maserati, Rolls-Royce,  Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Volvo, Audi and BMW.  </P> <P> The excise tax amounts to a penalty of $500 to $3,850, with the amount  increasing as gasoline mileage declines. It was enacted in 1975 to encourage  people to buy more fuel-efficient cars.  </P> <P> Auto makers are required to have an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per  gallon for their fleets. Last year officials in the Reagan Administration urged  Congress to eliminate the fleet requirements. But the Bush Administration,  citing environmental concerns, has urged auto makers to continue pursuing  increases in the fleet averages and efforts to rescind the standards have  fallen by the wayside.  </P></p>

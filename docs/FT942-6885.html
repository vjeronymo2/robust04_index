			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Thai business daily planned Singapore Press Holdings, the owner of the Straits Times, is linking up with a Thai partner to produce a regional business newspaper called Business Day, which it plans to launch in Bangkok next January. The paper's editor and managing director, Mr Chatchai Yenbamroong, said: 'We expect 70 per cent of our readers to be local. Thai businessmen are not well equipped with knowledge of regional matters; they are at a disadvantage to their counterparts in Hong Kong and Singapore.' The Thai Premier Publishing Group will hold 51 per cent of the paper, Singapore Press Holdings 35 per cent and United Cinema Holding and Management, a subsidiary of the Crown Property Bureau, 11 per cent. The Population and Community Development Association, an independent group run by the anti-Aids campaigner Mr Mechai Viravaidya, will take a 3 per cent stake. The paper, which is in the process of recruiting 60 reporters, mostly Thai, and about 10 foreign subeditors, will attempt to keep costs low by contracting out printing. The falling price of desktop publishing equipment will allow the company to spend just Bt10m (Dollars 0.4m) in the start-up period. The 16 to 20-page product, with a target circulation of 15,000 to 20,000, should hit Thailand, Hongkong, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City and Manila next January.</p>

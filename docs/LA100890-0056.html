			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> DISTRICT, TEACHERS UNION ON SAME SIDE  </P> <P> Parents who attended back-to-school night last year were more likely to find  angry teachers carrying picket signs than information about the coming school  year.  </P> <P> But this year, both sides are ushering in what they hope is a new era of  cooperation, with a joint project by the teachers' union and school district  administrators.  </P> <P> The district and the Capistrano Unified Education Assn. split the cost of  printing more than 15,000 copies of "Parent Power," a pamphlet written under  the auspices of the National Education Assn., which represents teachers' unions  on the national level.  </P> <P> Over the next two weeks, the six-page publication will be distributed at  back-to-school nights throughout the district, at sites including Dana Hills  High School, where teachers staged a large demonstration last fall.  </P> <P> The leaflet contains reading, writing and math activities for parents to do at  home with elementary children and topics to discuss with older students.  </P> <P> The booklet also includes a school calendar, phone numbers for each school in  the district and the number for union headquarters in Laguna Hills.  </P> <P> "It may be the first time the teachers' association and the district have ever  worked together on such a project," said union president Ric Stephenson, whose  signature appears alongside that of Supt. Jerome Thornsley on the pamphlet's  cover letter. "The community is used to seeing negative activities between the  district and the school board, and we hope they see (the pamphlet) as a  positive gesture."  </P> <P> Thornsley said the publication is a way of showing the public that the two  bodies can work together.  </P> <P> "During the heat of negotiations, many things are said, but the fact is we  frequently cooperate, we're just doing it in a more visible way," Thornsley  said.

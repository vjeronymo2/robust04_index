			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON YOUR OWN: THE OUTGOING HAVE INCOME CONCERNS  </P> <P> I have been looking back over the past year's columns to see which had the  greatest response from readers. In May I printed a letter from Doug, 36, who  declared, "There are not enough single women to go around for all the single  men." He described himself in positive terms: "I was popular in high school and  college and had no trouble getting dates. My close male friends will attest to  the soundness of my character. At work my associates think I am witty,  intelligent and well-read. I think my looks are above average. Even though I  hold a responsible position as a technical writer, I admit my income is not  that impressive."  </P> <P> After he described his futile efforts to connect with women, he said: "I can  only conclude that when single women complain that there are not enough single  men, they mean single men who make more than $50,000 a year and look like  models in GQ. The rest of us guys appear to be a glut on the market."  </P> <P> I told Doug that I have heard this complaint from other men who say that a  man's income is an important consideration to some women when they select a  partner. At the same time, there are women who are more interested in a man's  personality and character than how much money he makes. I also told Doug and  other men with similar concerns that if they look around they will find men  with the same occupations and income range who have close and committed  relationships with women. I advised Doug and the others not to lose heart.  </P> <P> In response to that column, a woman reader said: "I can't tell you how angry  your response made me. Basically, you told Doug that for many women their  interest in a man is directly related to his income! I have never asked a man  how much money he earns. Frankly, I think that information is personal. All my  single friends feel the same way. We are all attractive, intelligent and  fun-loving. Most women are not such superficial opportunists. Many of us care  about a man's deeper qualities such as his sense of humor, sensitivity and  dependability."  </P> <P> And a woman from Indiana said: "Although Doug's sense of frustration is  understandable, please reassure him that there are many women who have learned  to value men as people and not just as providers. Because many of us do not fit  the ideal image of the 'perfect' woman (gorgeous, talented, etc.), we have  developed inner qualities and values that do not view men in such a shallow and  superficial vein. Could it be that Doug is so busy chasing after the top 5% of  women who fit that perfect bill that he has failed to see the other women who  can give him the very things he seeks?"  </P> <P> That may be, although Doug said: "Before you warn me about the dangers of  pursuing models or beauty queens, I would like to add that I am talking about  average-looking women. My standards are about as broad and flexible as I can  make them."  </P> <P> You might ask: What is the relationship between a man's income and his  desirability? Are men being cynical if they think that most women give a higher  priority to a potential mate's income than his other qualities? Are women being  naive if they think most women believe a man's income is of little importance?  </P> <P> Here is an experiment for you to try:  </P> <P> Pass out copies of the following description to a group of single women: "John  is 35. He is quite good-looking, keeps in shape at a health club and plays  tennis regularly. He is intelligent, has a good sense of humor and a wide range  of interests. He is warm and sensitive, and when he cares for a woman, he can  be very romantic and tuned-in to her feelings. Right now he is interested in a  relationship that will lead to marriage."  </P> <P> Give half the group the description in which the next sentence reads: "He  manages the haberdashery department in a large department store and has an  income of slightly more than $20,000 a year." Give the other half the  description in which the next sentence reads: "He is the executive vice  president of a chain of department stores and his income is well over six  figures."  </P> <P> The last sentence in both descriptions reads: "If you would like to meet him,  indicate below how he may contact you." If you try this experiment, do it  carefully. Do not give any hints that the descriptions are different. See what  kind of results you get and let me know.  </P> <P>  Questions and statements about the single life may be addressed to Howard  Halpern in care of Special Features, 130 5th Ave., New York, N.Y. 10011.  Unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.  </P> <P> </P></p>

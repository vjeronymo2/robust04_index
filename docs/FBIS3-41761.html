Serezhina: ``Fight Cholera and...Mushrooms''] </F>   [Text] As specialists have confirmed, the cholera outbreak  in russia is not unexpected. A sharp increase in this disease  throughout the world has recently been noted. International  statistics give the following figures: 118,000 persons in just  the first half of this year. Naturally, this disease has been  brought to us primarily from the countries of the Hindustan  Peninsula. But cholera has not just been ``imported'' into our  country. For many years, epidemiologists have found the cholera  causative agent, vibrio Eltor Ogawa, on Russian territory in  objects in the environment -- generally in open water  reservoirs. Only adherence to sanitary and hygiene rules can  protect us from this terrifying disease: Do not drink untreated  water (Moscow residents may because their tap water conforms to  public health standards), and wash your hands carefully with  soap before eating...    It is not just cholera, however, that currently presents a  serious threat to health. The overall epidemiological situation  is bad.    This was the subject of a recent press conference organized  by the Russian Federation State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight.    Each year, up to 1 million cases of acute intestinal  infections are recorded in the country. The cause is  poor-quality products and water. Specialists have serious  concerns about the increase in mushroom poisonings. Death-cup  amanitas are the most frequent but not the only cause.  Physicians believe that paxils are poisonous and unsuitable for  use.</p>

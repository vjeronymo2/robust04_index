			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KRICKSTEIN SURPRISES LENDL IN JAPAN OPEN  </P> <P> Aaron Krickstein shocked an erratic Ivan Lendl Saturday, beating the top-seeded  player, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4, to reach the men's singles final in the Japan Open at  Tokyo.  </P> <P> The fourth-seeded American faces defending champion Stefan Edberg of Sweden.  Edberg, seeded second, beat third-seeded Brad Gilbert, 6-1, 7-6 (7-5), in the  other semifinal match on the hard courts of the Ariake Colosseum.  </P> <P> Lendl, the world's top-ranked player, had 18 aces but lost to Krickstein for  the first time in five matches.  </P> <P> "He played very well and he served extremely well," Lendl said of Krickstein.  "I made a lot of errors and when I had the chances I just threw them away. I  hadn't been doing any training, and I was basically looking forward to the  grass and getting ready for Wimbledon."  </P> <P> Said Krickstein: "I've played well here and against Stefan it should be a good,  close and tough match." Krickstein has beaten Edberg three of the four times  they have played.  </P> <P> Krickstein, who had six aces, hit 61.8% of his first serves in, compared to  Lendl's 47%.  </P> <P> The women's singles final will pair top-seeded Catarina Lindqvist of Sweden  with Australia's Elizabeth Smylie, seeded sixth. Lindqvist beat Eva Sviglerova  of Czechoslovakia, 6-1, 6-2, and Smylie beat Japan's 17-year-old Naoko  Sawamatsu, 6-1, 6-2.  </P> <P> Top-ranked Steffi Graf split a pair of tiebreakers, then took advantage of  Natalia Zvereva's exhaustion in the final set to complete a 7-6 (10-8), 6-7  (7-4), 6-1 victory in the semifinals of the Bausch &amp; Lomb tennis  championships at Amelia Island, Fla.  </P> <P> Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated defending champion Gabriela Sabatini, 6-4,  6-0, in the other semifinal and said, "I feel very confident I can win the  tournament."  </P> <P> The triumph was the 56th in a row for Graf, who is trying to win this $350,000  tournament for the first time since 1987.  </P> <P> Sabatini beat Graf in the semifinals two years ago and in the final last year.  </P> <P> Graf improved her record to 4-0 against Zvereva, but the Soviet fared much  better than in their first meeting -- a 6-0, 6-0 blowout in the 1988 French  Open final that lasted only 32 minutes.  </P> <P> Fourth-seeded Andres Gomez of Ecuador powered past Andrei Chesnokov, 6-3, 7-5,  to advance to the final of the 38th Count of Godo tournament at Barcelona,  Spain.  </P> <P> Gomez earned the right to defend the title he won last year against Argentina's  Guillermo Perez-Roldan, who upset third-seeded Emilio Sanchez of Spain. The  10th-seeded Argentine held off the error-prone Spaniard, 7-5, 7-6 (7-1).  </P> <P> Jim Peterson of Orange defeated J.J. Jackson of Hendersonville, N.C., 6-2, 6-2,  to win the boys' 16 title at the Easter Bowl tournament in Miami.  </P></p>

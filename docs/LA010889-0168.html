			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REACHING THE SMOKERS  </P> <P> Smoking, says a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical  Assn., is increasingly becoming class-concentrated, with the poorer and less  educated far more likely to become or remain smokers than those who have a  college education. Writing in the journal on the 25th anniversary of the  surgeon general's first report on the health effects of smoking, researchers  report that in 1985 more than 34% of non-high-school graduates were still  smokers, compared with little more than 18% of people with college degrees. Dr.  Michael C. Fiore, one of the report's authors, thinks that a major reason for  this lopsided ratio may be that most information about smoking's dangers "has  been geared toward people with sophisticated medical knowledge." The need, he  suggests, is to begin refocusing informational efforts to reach the less aware.  </P> <P> What's unhappily clear is that even the strongest educational program won't  achieve Surgeon General C. Everett Koop's goal of a "smoke-free society" by the  end of the century. Each year about 1.3 million Americans quit smoking. But  each day about 3,000 take up the habit for the first time. This represents  progress of a sort, since between the quitters and those who die from  smoking-related diseases -- 300,000 annually, says the surgeon general -- a net  reduction does occur. It's still appalling that 1 million Americans, almost all  of them young and an increasing percentage of them female, become new smokers  each year.  </P> <P> Warning labels on cigarette packages have been shown to be of almost no  deterrent value, and messages about the perils of smoking that are directed at  better-educated readers, like this editorial, don't reach the nost needful  audience. The best way to inform the part of the population that so far has  been least affected by anti-smoking warnings is probably in the classroom, and  early. There was a time, when our society was less affluent and less educated,  when elementary schools were the accepted vehicle for providing basic  information about personal hygiene. Smoking remains the nation's primary  preventable cause of death and disease. The sooner young people are made aware  of that, the better the chances they will say no the enticements of tobacco  companies, and so have the chance to lead healthier lives.  </P></p>

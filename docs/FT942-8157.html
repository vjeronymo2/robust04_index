			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Fee rules change Investment costs are such a live subject that they are changing even while this series of articles is being published. This week, the Securities and Investments Board - watchdog for the industry - altered the rules on unit trust fees. Unit trust managers will now be allowed to deduct annual charges from the capital of funds they manage, and will no longer be limited to taking it out of the income stream from dividends. This is obviously particularly relevant for income funds. Some fund managers, such as Schroders, are considering taking advantage of the rule change. But preliminary discussions on how yields should be publicised are likely. And industry regulator Lautro plans to publish guidelines. Next week, our series moves on to the costs of direct investment in the stock market: brokers' charges, spreads, and why the size of a company can alter the cost of buying and selling shares.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. POLICE UNITED IN ATTITUDE, SURVEY SAYS;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: RESEARCHERS FIND THAT DESPITE AN INFLUX OF WOMEN AND  MINORITIES, MEMBERS OF THE FORCE THINK AND ACT ALIKE. CRITICS CONTEND  UNIFORMITY STIFLES SENSITIVITY.  </P> <P> Despite the recruitment of unprecedented numbers of female, black and Latino  officers over the last decade, members of the Los Angeles Police Department  still think and act with remarkable uniformity, according to a study by the  Claremont Graduate School.  </P> <P> The study, based on a survey of more than 1,000 officers, found that they have  similar opinions about their lives, jobs and ideals -- regardless of their sex  or race.  </P> <P> "Bringing all these women and minorities onto the force has not made any  significant change in the way the police perform," said George T. Felkenes, a  criminal justice professor at the college who led the project. "Once they get  into the department, they're shaped and molded into what the department wants  them to be."  </P> <P> Women and minorities responded just as white males did in saying they are very  satisfied with their careers, are loyal to the force and believe the values of  the department closely mirror their own, the researchers found.  </P> <P> On a four-point scale, in which 4 means they "strongly agree," officers  averaged a 3.49 when asked their reaction to the statement, "I am proud to work  for this department." Sex and race had almost no bearing on the response.  </P> <P> During their first year on patrol, officers of diverse backgrounds experienced  successes and failures that were much the same, the study showed. Commendations  were received by 85.4% of the officers, a number that was consistent among all  groups.  </P> <P> Citizen complaints were lodged against 28.7% of all officers. Women officers  fared somewhat better, with 22.1% drawing complaints. But officers who received  complaints compiled about the same number -- 1.62 each -- regardless of race or  sex.  </P> <P> "They're all clones," said James Lasley, a criminal justice professor at Cal  State Fullerton, who assisted in the project.  </P> <P> Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker, the Police Department's commanding officer for  personnel and training, hailed the findings as an affirmation of the  department's professional, egalitarian approach.  </P> <P> "It's like the adage in our recruitment campaign, that 'all our cops come in  one color -- blue,' " Kroeker said. "We're getting to the point where it really  doesn't matter what gender or race you are. We're just all cops."  </P> <P> But some critics of the department, while applauding the hiring of more women  and minorities, contended that such uniformity has stifled the sensitivity they  had hoped a diverse force would bring.  </P> <P> Although the Claremont researchers did not directly solicit officers' opinions  on race and police tactics, civil rights leaders said the study was an  indication that diversity does not necessarily translate into  less-confrontational policing.  </P> <P> "Of course we should have more women and black and Hispanic officers," said  Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of  Southern California. "But what we find is the tactics of the Police Department  are just as brutal. The tone hasn't changed at all."  </P> <P> Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles branch of the National Assn. for the  Advancement of Colored People, said there seems to be an "LAPD view of the  world" that is inculcated in most officers.  </P> <P> "The department teaches a certain kind of reaction toward certain groups of  people," Duff said. "There's many situations where minority officers should be  asserting their feelings and backgrounds . . . but there's a lot of pressure to  go with that prevailing sentiment."  </P> <P> Before the researchers began their study, all their questions were approved by  Los Angeles Police Department officials, who advised them against directly  probing racially sensitive areas.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, a few questions addressed officers' perceptions of their  relationship with the public, and these produced some of the study's few  distinctions -- however minor -- according to the sex and race of the  respondents.  </P> <P> When asked how cooperative they find the public, non-minorities and males  tended to view citizens as somewhat more eager to help than did females and  minorities.  </P> <P> Similarly, males and non-minorities almost uniformly said that police officers  have no greater understanding of human behavior than does the average person.  But women and minorities were slightly more inclined to say that police have a  "peculiar view" of behavior because of the "misery and cruelty" they see every  day.  </P> <P> "In a quasi-military organization, you've got to expect a certain amount of  conformity," said Hubert Williams, president of the Washington, D.C.-based  Police Foundation, a research group. "But I don't think that means you lose  your identity."  </P> <P> The study was funded by a $125,000 grant from the Los Angeles-based John  Randolph and Dora Haynes Foundation, which promotes academic research in the  social sciences, economics, government and history. The results are included in  a 369-page report published by the Claremont Graduate School's Center for  Politics and Policy.  </P> <P> The purpose of the study was to assess the impact of two 1980 consent decrees  that settled a federal lawsuit brought against the department seven years  earlier by a female sergeant, Fanchon Blake.  </P> <P> Under those agreements, the department agreed to accelerate hiring of women  until they constitute 20% of the force. Officials also agreed to increase the  number of blacks and Latinos to equal their percentage in the Los Angeles work  force.  </P> <P> Although it was thought that those long-term goals would take more than 20  years to implement, the study found the department has made substantial  progress toward meeting the quotas.  </P> <P> In the last 10 years, women have gone from 2.4% to 12.2% of what is now an  8,100-officer department. Blacks have gone from 6.7% to 13.2%. Latinos, whose  numbers have increased the most, went from 10.7% to 20.4%, the study showed.  </P> <P> In those same years, the percentage of white males dropped from 78.8% to 56.5%.  </P> <P> "It's really way better than any of us ever dreamed," said A. Thomas Hunt, one  of Blake's attorneys.  </P> <P> Blake, now retired and living in the Seattle area, said she was not surprised  to learn that the new officers have values similar to those of the old guard.  </P> <P> "Human beings are human beings," said Blake, who served 25 years on the force.  "If you're qualified, you can do the job."  </P> <P> Despite those dramatic changes in the demographics of the force, almost all  officers -- regardless of sex or race -- told the researchers they would turn  down better-paying jobs to stay with the Los Angeles department, would stay in  their present positions if given a second chance and would work harder to help  the department if needed.  </P> <P> In general, Los Angeles police believe that the average officer is dedicated to  high ideals and service, that newspapers give an unfavorable picture of what  officers do and that arrests are the result of hard work and dedication, the  study found.  </P> <P> "Are more diverse officer populations likely to produce change in existing  police administrations or are existing police administrations likely to produce  standardization in diverse officer populations?" the study asked in its  conclusion. "For LAPD . . . the latter answer fits best."  </P> <P> </P> <P> STUDY OF L.A.

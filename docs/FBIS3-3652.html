The establishment of this center, according to economists,  marks the initiation of a multi-layered financial market system  in this economically developed province.    To further the reform of the financial system, Zhejiang has  over the past few years established a host of fund-circulation  centers, foreign exchange circulation centers and securities  exchanges.    Meanwhile, a multi-layered financial market system, covering  inter-bank loan markets and foreign exchange swap markets as  well as securities exchanges, has started to take shape.    The province has some 45 securities exchange business  departments, where people can trade freely stock shares listed  on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges as well as  financial bonds, treasury bonds and time certificates.    Official sources said that the transaction value in those  departments reached more than 30 billion yuan last year.    According to official statistics, the business done at the  provincial funds circulation center and foreign exchange  circulation center hit a record 17.9 billion yuan and 1.94  billion U.S. dollars last year, up 67.7 percent and 41.2 percent  from the previous year, respectively.    To regulate the expanded and invigorated financial market  the  provincial government has drawn up a series of management rules  and regulations and has set up a competitive pricing system as  well as automatic price quotation system, aiming at  standardizing and systematizing the financial market.    In addition, the province has opened the financial sector  wider to the outside world in the last few years.    According to official sources, last year the province  approved its first Sino-foreign joint-stock bank (the Zhejiang  Commercial Bank) and a solely foreign-funded bank (the Ningbo  International Bank).    The Standard Chartered Bank of Britain has also set up an  office in Hangzhou, capital of the province.    At present, the province is making efforts to boost the work  of transforming its specialized banks into commercial banks, in  order to speed up the reform of the financial sector and  invigorate the financial market.    Approved by the People's Bank of China last year, the  province has stepped up the preparatory work of establishing two  commercial banks -- the Pudong Development Bank's Hangzhou  Branch and the China International Trust and Investment  Corporation (CITIC) Industrial Bank's Hangzhou Branch.    The flourishing financial sector has greatly accelerated the  economic development of the province. Official statistics show  that last year the provincial gross domestic product and fiscal  revenue hit some 164.5 billion yuan and 16.66 billion yuan, up  by 25 percent and 38.6 percent, respectively, over the previous  year.</p>

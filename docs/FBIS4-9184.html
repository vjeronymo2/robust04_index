			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "(vie)": "Crime Rate Has Not Yet Hit the Bottom"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] In the past two years, the  number of explained crimes declined sharply. No wonder that only  2 percent of the people trust the police corps, while it was 80  percent two years ago.    By providing large bribes, many gangs succeeded in getting  close to politicians, judges, and the police. At present, a case  of an "entrepreneur" who owes 800 million korunas in taxes from  oil deals is being closed.    Two weeks ago, a group of Slovaks living abroad tried to  offer an advantageous loan of $7.3 billion. Investigations have  shown that money laundering was involved.    Why has the democratic system brought such a monstrous  increase in crime?    "Before 1989, we were a police state, with 12,000 State  Security agents plus tens of thousands of police collaborators.  We will need three generations to really become a democratic  state," Interior Minister Ladislav Pittner said.    There are 18,000 foreigners living legally in Slovakia,  mostly former Soviet Union citizens and people from Yugoslavia  and Vietnam. Some 20,000 to 30,000 foreigners live here  illegally and are committing crimes. [passage omitted]</p>

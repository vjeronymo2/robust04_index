The minister came here on  Thursday afternnon to discuss the issue with the region's  military officers.    "The Kaliningrad region is different from all other Russian  regions because of its geographic and enclave position", Grachev  noted. "And the mobile grouping to be formed here is designed to  ensure reliable protection of this territory against military  threats from both the sea and land", he stressed. However,  there will be no sweeping reductions in the officers' corps, the  minister promised, therefore there are no grounds for concern.    Grachev informed officers about the progress of military  reform. He also reported that some 20 new laws on armed forces  were being drafted at the moment, "since many provisions of the  laws passed by the former Supreme Soviet do no meet the Army's  interests". Among the most important laws, the minister cited  those on martial law, on military police, on courts martial.    The defence minister answered questions from the audience.  After the meeting, well-known variety actors, who came from  Moscow together with Grachev, gave a performance.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST COAST CONFERENCE PREVIEW;  </P> <P> RACE IS ON TO FILL VOID, AND THEY COULDN'T BE HAPPIER  </P> <P> The players who dominated the West Coast Conference for so long, who put it on  the basketball map and created a corps of late night TV faithful around the  country, are gone.  </P> <P> There are no players in the wings with the name recognition of Hank Gathers, Bo  Kimble and Jeff Fryer at Loyola Marymount; Tom Lewis, Dexter Howard and Craig  Davis at Pepperdine; Jeffty Connelly at Santa Clara or anyone named McPhee at  Gonzaga.  </P> <P> Simply put, "The league has lost its marquee players," Pepperdine Coach Tom  Asbury said.  </P> <P> But WCC coaches and officials aren't shedding many tears. Thanks to those  players' accomplishments over the past few years, the WCC recently landed its  first television game-of-the-week package with SportsChannel.  </P> <P> And thanks to their departure, a tighter race is expected. Since the 1984-85  season, only one conference winner -- St. Mary's in 1988-89 -- has lost as many  as two games. Loyola Marymount went undefeated the year before and won the  title with a 13-1 mark last season.  </P> <P> This season, San Diego is seen as the slight favorite, in a poll of WCC sports  publicists, over Loyola and Pepperdine, but the haves and have-nots are closer  this season and the conference should be improved from a year ago, when half  the league lost 19 or more games.  </P> <P> "I think 10-4 could win the league," WCC Commissioner Michael Gilleran said.  "I'll be surprised if anybody goes 11-3. I can even see two teams tying at  10-4, and a few right behind at 9-5. I think San Diego, Loyola, Pepperdine, in  any order, are a half-step ahead of the league, but the others, you could pick  four through eight in any order. We're stronger top to bottom, and this year I  don't think you can eliminate as many teams (from contention)."  </P> <P> Here's how the league shapes up, minus Loyola and Pepperdine:  </P> <P> U. SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 16-12 overall, 9-5 WCC.  </P> <P> 1989-90 finish: Third.  </P> <P> As the only team in the league with seniors and juniors making up more than 50%  of the roster, the Toreros have the most experienced squad, a coach in Hank  Egan who has a proven track record with maturing teams, and several good  recruits.  </P> <P> Returners include Pat Holbert, a 46% three-point shooter, and Wayman Strickland  at the guard spots and shot-blocking center Dondi Bell. Junior Kelvin Woods  started 13 games last season and Anthony Thomas four. They will split time at  one forward.  </P> <P> To that list Egan has added swingman Michael Brown and 6-8 Reed Watson, both  highly regarded transfers from Mesa Community College in Arizona and potential  starters, and an assistant, Jack Avina, who was head coach at Portland for 17  years. The Toreros believe this group is ready to contend for the next two  seasons.  </P> <P> SANTA CLARA  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 9-19, 6-8.  </P> <P> 1989-90 finish: Fifth.  </P> <P> With the only veteran true center in the league in 7-foot-1 junior Ron Reis,  the Broncos should be a factor. Carroll Williams, the dean of WCC coaches  starting his 28th season, is coming off a rare losing season in which the  Broncos had so many injuries, there were 10 different starting combinations  just at guard. There's not a senior on the roster. Point guard Melvin Chinn and  part-time starter LaCoby Phillips should provide a stable backcourt. Talented  junior Rhea Taylor is a potential star at forward but has been injury prone.  Though Williams is wary of freshmen, he may start forward Andy Karich, his  prize recruit from Santa Ana Mater Dei.  </P> <P> At the start of last season, Reis was getting more publicity for his hobbies of  skateboarding and Go-Karting and his announced intention of becoming a  professional wrestler than for his game. Now the talk is of a future in  basketball as Reis led the conference in shooting and managed to haul his  (announced) 285 pounds around fast enough for 30 points and 10 rebounds against  Loyola.  </P> <P> "If I (forecast a winner) today I'd pick Santa Clara. They've got the most  dominating guy," Asbury said.  </P> <P> U. SAN FRANCISCO  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 8-20, 4-10.  </P> <P> 1989-90 finish: Sixth (tie).  </P> <P> The Dons could be one of several sleepers in the conference, thanks to Jim  Brovelli's best recruiting class since USF reinstituted basketball. Only two  key lettermen return -- forward James Bell and swingman Scott McWhorter -- but  Brovelli figures his team will rebound better than last season's and has better  athletes.  </P> <P> A resurgence may depend on 6-6 Darryl Johnson, who led the nation's junior  colleges with 17 rebounds a game last season, and freshman point guard Orlando  Smart, who will start. In their first exhibition against an Australian team,  Johnson got 27 points and 25 rebounds.  </P> <P> PORTLAND  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 11-17, 7-7.  </P> <P> 1989-90 finish: Fourth.  </P> <P> Last season's most improved team, the Pilots have three starters back and have  added several big men. How ready is Coach Larry Steele? Over the summer he had  corrective heart surgery on a Friday and was back to work Monday.  </P> <P> To go with veterans Ron Deaton, Erik Spoelstra and freshman of the year Matt  Houle, Steele added three center-forwards, among them 6-9 Australian Leigh  Wadeson -- who was also recruited by Indiana -- and Nebraska player of the year  Mike Mueller. Steele also hopes for some help from 7-5 senior Greg Ritter, a  28-year-old redshirt who has played 17 minutes of organized ball.  </P> <P> GONZAGA  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 8-20, 3-11.  </P> <P> 1989-90 finish: Eighth.  </P> <P> The Bulldogs will have a new look, and not just because there won't be a McPhee  on the roster for the first time in a decade. Where the team has traditionally  been plodding and methodical, Coach Dan Fitzgerald is injecting "quick" and  "up-tempo" instead.  </P> <P> Two starters are back, one of them point guard Jamie Dudley, whose main target  will be 6-7 forward Eric Brady, a transfer from Washington who was voted team  captain even though he redshirted last season. Fitzgerald hopes for more  offense from three-point shooter Jarrod Davis and a rare inner-city recruit,  guard Kenny Davis from Gardena Serra.  </P> <P> ST. MARY'S  </P> <P> 1989-90 record: 7-20, 4-10.  </P> <P> 1989-90 finish: Sixth (tie).  </P> <P> The Gaels remain a mystery in Paul Landreaux's second go-round, because he  cleaned house and stocked up on junior college transfers after inheriting a  woeful team last season.  </P> <P> Forwards John Levitt and Eric Bamberger are among the three lettermen. Ask for  a projected starting lineup if you really want to hear peals of laughter from  the athletic department.  </P></p>

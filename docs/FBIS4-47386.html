P. Shelekhov, Atmospheric Optics Institute, </F> Siberian Department, Russian Academy of Sciences; UDC  537.87;621.371]    [Abstract] A study was made of the behavior of the relative  variance of the turbulent fluctuations of photocurrent strength  of CW and pulsed coherent lidars when using different schemes  for the matching of wave fronts in optical heterodyning. It is  shown that photocurrent strength fluctuations of a coherent  lidar arise when there is a high spatial resolution of a  single-mode heterodyne detector. The level of these fluctuations  is proportional to the level of the turbulent fluctuations of  the intensity of the sounding radiation. The proportionality  factor is dependent on the angle of the detector field of view  and it decreases with its increase. Applying these findings, the  objective was the development of a coherent lidar with a high  spatial resolution. This is possible only with single-mode  detection. In comparison with methods for sounding the  parameters of atmospheric turbulence based on measurement of  intensity fluctuations of the scattered field, but using  incoherent detection, a coherent lidar is more promising.  Already with an entrance aperture of the receiving telescope R =  2.8 cm the spatial resolution of the lidar already is adequate  for registering the intensity of random photocurrent modulation  by about 50% on a path 1.06 km. A further increase in the  sounding range is possible by increasing entrance aperture size.  Without a considerable decrease in the signal-to-noise ratio  this is possible to R = 7.5 for coherent lidar systems which are  oriented on surface paths and up to R = 50 cm when sounding is  from space. These and other results obtained in the study can be  used in solving problems arising in practical use of coherent  lidar systems. Figures 2; references 7: 4 Russian, 3 Western.</p>

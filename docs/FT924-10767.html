			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Read Kohl's lips THE GERMAN economy is in increasing difficulties. Yet Chancellor Helmut Kohl appears unable to comprehend the risks his country and his continent now face, let alone act to forestall them. Germany and Europe cry out for better leadership. Mr Kohl has already reneged on his no-new-taxes pledge. But last year's solidarity tax and next year's rise in value-added tax are much too small to finance the vast rise in government spending that the collapse of the east German economy has necessitated. The economic slowdown may be exaggerating the size of the deficit, but the long-term demands of reconstruction of the east imply a structural budget deficit and a general government debt running out of control. Germany is paying for Mr Kohl's past inaction. The Bundesbank refuses to ease policy while fiscal policy remains loose. But Mr Kohl's inability to cut a budget deal has kept German interest rates much too high. The result has been stagflation: inflationary pressures in the subsidised service sector, alongside an approaching recession in the traded goods sector. Tight monetary policy risks pulling the German economy into recession, as the report from Germany's five leading economic research institutes makes clear. They expect west German gross national product to keep growing next year: but only if interest rates fall rapidly. The Bundesbank may eventually be forced to ease monetary policy anyway. Cutting official interest rates while the fiscal deficit remains so large, especially before monetary growth drops back into its target range, will undermine its credibility. But keeping interest rates so high will become incredible too, as the UK has learned. It is not in the interests of either Germany or Europe that the Bundesbank is forced to back down, with its tail between its legs. A partial retreat makes sense: its overly rigid commitment to a distorted broad money target has proved a mistake. But the Bundesbank cannot afford to ease policy until it is confident that fiscal policy will be tightened and wage inflation fall. Mr Kohl must act quickly. His coalition government must agree a credible package of tax increases and cuts in capital subsidies, the latter coming into effect at once, although the tax rise might be staged over the next two years. The solidarity talks with employers and unions also need to agree a real wage freeze in the west. Convergence of labour costs in the east and western Lander must be halted, preferably through a system of temporary wage subsidies. Then the Bundesbank will be able to cut interest rates aggressively, while retaining credibility. Only such boldness will enable Mr Kohl to restore his battered reputation as the great chancellor of German unity.</p>

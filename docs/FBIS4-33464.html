			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 Jun (NA) -- Buenos Aires Province  Governor Eduardo Duhalde stated on 4 June that he is convinced  that the provincial Constituent Assembly will approve the bill  allowing Buenos Aires governors to be reelected. He made it  clear, however, that if that is not the case, he is willing to  be Menem's running mate in the 1995 presidential elections.    Speaking in San Vicente, Duhalde said he does not want the  people of Buenos Aires Province to push for his reelection  because this issue will be negotiated at the provincial  Constituent Assembly.</p>

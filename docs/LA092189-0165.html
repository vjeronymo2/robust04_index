			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LPGA TOURNAMENT AT BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> PATCHY GREENS SHOULD MAKE THE GOING ROUGH  </P> <P> They will be playing in a city known for its amusement park, but when the  Ladies Professional Golf Assn. returns to Orange County today, the players will  find the course at Buena Park anything but amusing.  </P> <P> The field in this 72-hole event, called the Nippon Travel -- MBS tournament,  will be strong, but even the most skilled players on the tour will be tested at  Los Coyotes Country Club, a shapely patch of nature three miles from Knotts  Berry Farm.  </P> <P> The course, at 6,350 yards, is longer than the usual LPGA layout. Of the 33  courses on the tour's schedule, only 11 play longer than 6,300. But distance  alone is not what will make Los Coyotes challenging.  </P> <P> Earlier in the summer a fungus got into the greens and ate away the grass  roots, leaving bare patches scattered around the putting surfaces.  </P> <P> Even with the persistent efforts of the greenskeeper to rebuild and strengthen  the weakened parts of the turf, some blotches remain, although the greens are  now reasonably playable, according to the LPGA's on-site official, Jim Haley.  </P> <P> "They are a lot better than they were five weeks ago, and they should improve  each day," Haley said.  </P> <P> The players are coming off consecutive weeks in which they putted on fast  greens.  </P> <P> "Last week's greens (in Seattle) were so fast and so smooth, it's going to take  a couple of days to get a feel for these," Pat Bradley, one of the tournament  favorites, said.  </P> <P> "There are some rough spots and the ball is not going to roll true all the  time, I don't feel. As putts start to die at the hole, they will start to  jump."  </P> <P> Scores were high the last time an LPGA event was played at Los Coyotes. In  1971, when Kathy Whitworth, Sandra Haynie and Sandra Palmer were the leading  economic indicators of women's golf, Whitworth won the Suzuki Internationale  with a three-round score that was one over par. There were only three over-par  victories in 21 tournaments that year.  </P> <P> Whitworth, who is entered this week, is admittedly not playing well.  </P> <P> "I'll do well to make the (36-hole) cut," she said.  </P> <P> Whitworth says the long hitters -- Bradley, Nancy Lopez and Beth Daniel -- will  have an upper hand on this course, and she favors Lopez.  </P> <P> "Nancy is a very good slow-greens putter," Whitworth said. "She hits long  enough and is a good front-runner."  </P> <P> That will be important this week. The finishing holes are not set up for  come-from-behind heroics.  </P> <P> Lopez, this season's third-leading money winner and last year's player of the  year, has won twice this year, the LPGA Championship and the Atlantic City  tournament, and is seeking her fourth Vare Trophy, the award given for the  lowest scoring average. With a 70.77 average, Lopez is in third place but is  close enough to remain motivated.  </P> <P> Lopez also has handled the greens here well in practice, unlike in Seattle  where she was on medication for a thyroid condition and finished tied for 39th.  </P> <P> "I made more putts on these greens today than I did last week," she said  Wednesday. "The ball is rolling real well."  </P> <P> Said Bradley: "I think Nancy has really been a much stronger factor when the  greens haven't been to everyone else's liking."  </P> <P> The nines have been reversed for the tournament, which poses another difficulty  for the players. The four finishing holes are all par fours, none are easy  birdie holes, and two of them, No. 15 at 394 yards, and No. 17 at 384, loom as  bogey holes.  </P> <P> This won't be the players' only shot at Los Coyotes. The LPGA, which last  played in Orange County two years ago at Mesa Verde Country Club, has a  three-year contract with the Buena Park club.  </P></p>

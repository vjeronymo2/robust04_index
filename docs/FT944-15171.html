			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Strength in South Africa Johannesburg strengthened again yesterday as demand was reawakened. Dealers said the gold price, recent blue chip strength on Wall Street, the expectation of continued strong local company earnings, and a limited supply of quality stock were all factors behind the gains, which were expected to be extended in the short term. But traders added that firmness in the financial rand had depressed some major shares. The overall index climbed 27 to 5,682, industrials 65 to 6,468 and golds 22 to 2,322. Sappi set another high for the year as it gained R1 at R66 on continued positive reaction to its acquisition of a 70 per cent stake in SD Warren, and ahead of interim results. De Beers finished R1.85 down at R99.75 on foreign selling.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktoriya Rabotnova: "Second Round of Elections </F> to the City Assembly: Its Future Either Vacant or Murky"]    [Text] Results of the second round of elections, held 3  April in half of the districts, seem to come as a complete  surprise to most politicians. The chief sensational aspect is  the defeat of the electoral bloc Democratic Unity of Petersburg.  Democratic Unity led 19 candidates to the finish line--more than  all the remaining electoral associations combined, but only  three of the candidates nominated by the Belyayev bloc will get  seats.    Aleksandr Nikolayevich himself, destined by many to become  chairman of the coming assembly, was not among the victors.  After the first round of voting, Belyayev outdistanced his  rival--Aleksandr Shchelkanov, former chairman of the city  executive committee, by an almost twofold lead. Several days  prior to the runoff election, Shchelkanov assessed the directive  of the mayor on extending the 20 March voting as illegal, and  proposed to Belyayev that they mutually withdraw their  candidacies. Judging from the response of the Belyayev team,  this proposal was seen as an attempt to avoid the inevitable  defeat of "a politician who had not fulfilled himself." One can  today assert that Shchelkanov--who wrote "In the event this is  rejected, I will be forced to prolong my fight and will be  victorious"--assessed the situation more sensibly...    Turning now to other electoral associations. The bloc All  Petersburg passed through the second round with minimal losses,  gaining four seats. The blocs Our City--Our Home and Unity for  the Sake of Progress had one victor each. But Beloved City  achieved the greatest success--all five candidates in this  association who underwent the second round of voting were  victorious over their rivals. Independent candidates will get  the remaining seats.    As before, however, the results are not entirely conclusive.  The dispute on legality of the first round is not yet over. We  know that the majority of electoral associations are disputing  the mayor's decision to extend the voting time frame. Only  Democratic Unity and Business Petersburg supported the decision.  It cannot be ruled out that they will now change their opinion  and join others seeking to attain acknowledgment of the spring  elections as invalid.    It should be stated that a great many "oddities" took place  prior to the second round as well. At one of the polling  stations in District No. 9, for example, oranges were  distributed from a Mercedes to voters, along with an appeal to  vote for Yuriy Novolodskiy. The team of the respected chief of  the justice administration interpreted this fact as provocation  (albeit only after his competitor's authorized agents submitted  a complaint to the Central Electoral Commission). The  provocation story would be quite convincing had not a  Novolodskiy overseer reminded prisoners during the voting at  Kresty--"Did you get the free cigarettes? They are from us..."    Gifts were also promised to the voters at District No. 23.  True, not to all--only to those who supported Shukhrat  Sayfullayev, president of the joint-stock company Peter the  Great, in the second round of voting. They were promised monthly  sponsored assistance out of the company's specially established  assistance fund. True, it is not entirely clear how people  swallowing this bait could prove they voted for him--it is  hardly likely that precinct commissions would release their  certified documentation. It cannot be ruled out that  Sayfullayev's recent rival, Boris Pustyntsev, will contest the  voting results--such campaigning is entirely too similar to  outright graft.    The campaign in District No. 11 was also waged "freestyle."  One of the candidates, Valeriy Selivanov, was forced to  apologize to the voters during a radio presentation for the fact  that he was unable to respond to their questions during  television debates. The fact of the matter is that for some  reason it was not the presiding official, and not the chairman  of the electoral commission who sorted out the questions--but  rather Democratic Unity leader Aleksandr Belyayev, who came to  the studio to support the candidate of his bloc. Only after the  television debates were over was Valeriy Nikolayevich able to  find out what indeed his voters had asked. The effect of the  Selivanov radio broadcast was unanticipated. He received phone  calls recommending that he not make idle chatter about it--or  what would then happen would be his fault. If this was a  joke--it was not all that funny. After all, during the election  campaign two of Selivanov's authorized agents were subjected to  attack.    Disputes as to how honest the election was in one district  or  another and how legal the election was overall will go on much  longer than one month. Especially since the new Assembly will  still not be able to get down to work. Until such time as  three-fourths of the deputies are elected, the elections are not  valid. It is foolish to be guessing today what awaits us in the  fall--by-elections or a new campaign which will clearly take  place under different rules. In any event, political experts and  the leaders of political parties have time to analyze the frame  of mind of St. Petersburg residents. It is entirely evident that  the defeat of Democratic Unity candidates in the majority of  districts cannot be just a coincidence.</p>

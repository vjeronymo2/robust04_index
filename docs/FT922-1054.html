			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Birkdale in the black and dividends restored THE BIRKDALE Group, holding company of a range of marketing, advertising and public relations agencies, turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 202,000 for the year ended March 31 1992, following the previous year's loss of Pounds 1.53m. Group turnover was Pounds 21.2m (Pounds 25.8m), with operating profits of Pounds 221,000, against a 1991 operating loss of Pounds 645,000. Mr Neil McClure, chief executive, announced that the group would resume dividend payments, at a nominal 0.2p, after three years of no dividends. Earnings per share were 1.5p (losses of 15.6p). Birkdale, under its former name of Brunning, first went public in 1961. Mr Simeon Galpert, finance director, said that in its 30 years the group had never made pre-tax profits greater than Pounds 1m, but that there were strong chances of soon reversing that record. Mr McClure took over as chief executive in October 1989, when Birkdale was burdened with bank debts of Pounds 7m. While Birkdale now has a Pounds 500,000 overdraft facility with National Westminster bank, the group ended its financial year with net cash reserves of Pounds 354,000, he said. Since taking over Mr McClure has reduced staff numbers from 700 to 300. All Birkdale employees are now on one-year contracts and managers have profit share incentives. Operating margins are currently about 10 per cent at group level. Revenues per employee stand at about Pounds 30,000, far beneath comparable sector figures, but Mr McClure anticipates that the current year will see considerable improvements to those figures. Reductions in the cost base 'are a never-ending process as far as we are concerned,' he added. A key executive role will be provided for Mr Richard Humphreys, who joined Birkdale in May after being forced from his post as chief executive of Saatchi and Saatchi Worldwide in February.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone Interview with Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, member of the </F> Palestinian National Authority, in Jerusalem, by Fawzi al-Jundi,  in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From Afar" --  recorded]    [Text] [Al-Jundi] Dr. 'Urayqat, welcome to our program.    ['Urayqat] Thank you.    [Al-Jundi] Concerning the Palestinian detainees that Israel  pledged to release in accordance with the Cairo agreement, what  is the latest news?    ['Urayqat] The Cairo agreement clearly states that during  the  five weeks following the signing of the agreement the Israeli  Government would release 5,000 detainees. Some of these  detainees, the political detainees, were supposed to be freed  with no strings attached and allowed to go to their homes in the  West Bank and Gaza. Others were to be handed over to the  Palestinian Authority until their sentences ended. In our  understanding, the latter detainees are those held on criminal  charges.    However, currently the Israeli Government is releasing  political detainees and dumping them at the checkpoints around  Jericho, practically forcing us to keep them in Jericho and  preventing them from leaving. The Israelis freed 280 detainees  this way and plan to do the same with another 1,000. This  procedure contravenes the fourth Geneva Convention, which states  that the authorities who release a prisoner are responsible for  his safe transport to his home town. It also contravenes the  Cairo agreement and places the Palestinian Authority in a very  delicate position; it knows that the Jericho area cannot absorb  such great numbers because it lacks the necessary infrastructure.    [Al-Jundi] Dr. 'Urayqat, do you think that Israel, through  such measures, means to disrupt the work of the Palestinian  National Authority?    ['Urayqat] There is another matter. For the past eight days,  Israeli authorities have prevented tourists from coming to  Jericho. Jericho, as you may know, is a tourist area that  normally receives about 1,000 tourists per day. Tourism  provides the main income for most people, workers as well as  hotel and restaurant owners. For the past eight days, Israel  has prevented tourists from coming to Jericho, claiming that it  is unsafe. In doing so, Israel is fully aware of the  devastation it is causing to a major economic activity in this  area.    Furthermore, Palestinians face harassment at Israeli  checkpoints. The Israeli Government is still thinking of itself  as an occupier. It has not, for one moment, tried to think of  itself as a peace-maker or a neighbor. It hastens to seal off  Gaza and Jericho as soon as any incident occurs. In my opinion,  such acts mean that the agreement is not being given a chance  and the Israeli Government alone is to blame. Israel has left  us this area in economic shambles. Israel, which has occupied  this area for the past 27 years, must be aware of the burning  need to create a reliable infrastructure in it. We have begun  to build this infrastructure with our own resources, but these  resources, and the Israeli Government knows this, are  negligible. Israel knows that during the past month we have  begun operating more than 30 departments. If Israel continues  to pursue its current policies, this area will be left with a  bleak future. If Rabin's aim is to undermine the current  effort, he, in my opinion, is about to succeed.    [Al-Jundi] Has a specific date been set for the arrival of  Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to the self-rule areas?    ['Urayqat] This issue has nothing to do with the arrival of  President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]. It is related to  requirements that must be met so he may travel to the self-rule  area. In other words, the donor countries have not yet  implemented any of the projects they promised. The people judge  peace, and trust it according to the tangible changes they see  on the ground. They do not care for clauses, figures, or words.  The countries that agreed to implement projects have not done  so. The Palestinians have done all that they were required, on  all levels. We exerted great efforts to activate all  departments, and preparations are under way to establish other  essential departments. However, the issue is that before  president Abu-'Ammar arrives, basic requirements must be  available that up to now have been nonexistent. After 27 years  of occupation the infrastructure is destroyed. The Jericho  hospital in 1967 was much better than it is now. The same goes  for the irrigation system, water, electricity, roads, and all  other utilities. We maintain that 2,600 projects were approved  for the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The donor nations agreed  to implement these projects at their own expense and the  necessary funds were specified. The question posed now is why  these projects are not being implemented. I believe that the  Palestinian National Authority, no matter what its capabilities,  will begin its work 27 years late; that is, the natural  development in this area stopped 27 years ago. No matter how  hard or fast we work, for years we will lag behind. In other  words, the longer the donor countries take to implement these  projects, the more problems we will face. Therefore, these  projects must be implemented, so the Palestinian National  Authority may do its duty.    [Al-Jundi] The Palestinian effort is the main factor in  development along with the foreign aid?    ['Urayqat] Certainly. All I want to say is that we are  extremely poor people, particularly in Gaza, Jericho, and the  rest of the West Bank. So we cannot deliver with our own  resources. We have succeeded in activating 30 departments where  we process documents and papers. We have processed more than  1,000 documents in less than three weeks; but we need resources  to work out new systems and establish other departments. We  have done this with our own resources. The sons of our people  contributed time and effort to this. What we reached in Paris  was an agreement approving payment of salaries from now until  August. This is good, but what I mean is that the requirements  of the infrastructure and securing these requirements, are  necessary to turn the wheel of the Palestinian economy. We need  essential infrastructure projects to turn the wheel of the  economy. We need resources to create jobs, to encourage private  investments, and to create an integrated economic atmosphere so  that the wheel of the economy may turn. As I said, no matter  how fast or hard we work we will be lagging behind for many  years.    [Al-Jundi] Thank you Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat.    ['Urayqat] Thank you.</p>

Coimbra is being  pressured to leave her post.    Last week the newspaper O GLOBO reported that Coimbra's  husband, Carlos Henrique Siqueira, had tried to use his  influence to obtain a release of funds for construction work on  the Rio de Janeiro-Niteroi bridge. The work is being carried  out by the Noronhe Engineering Company, for which Siqueira works.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Thuermer, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Workers Party, by unidentified announcer; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Gyula Thuermer, chairman of the  Workers Party, is in front of the microphone to explained his  party's foreign political ideas. One of the main elements of  Hungarian foreign policy is to catch up with the West and to  join the various Western European organizations. Do you  consider it conceivable that we will be a full member of the EU  before the end of this century?    [Thuermer] The opinion of the Workers Party is that not only  the means of the foreign policy followed in the past four years  but also the objectives of that are wrong. This includes the  forced march into the European Union too. I cannot imagine,  neither politically nor economically, that Hungary would become  member of the European Union before the end of the turn of the  century.    [Announcer] What is the situation with NATO? Is our  membership necessary from a security point of view?    [Thuermer] While our opinion regarding EU membership is  somewhat ambiguous, for we think that we should not be in such a  hurry, but wait until conditions will be more favorable for us,  our views regarding NATO membership is totally unequivocal. We  think that Hungary has no place in NATO whatsoever.    [Announcer] Do you accept the Partnership for Peace?    [Thuermer] The Partnership for Peace is a deceiving matter.  It is totally without advantages. [passage omitted] We pledge  various obligations which only question Hungary's independence  even more.    [Announcer] As you reject the idea of joining the western  organizations, what sort of alternative do you offer?    [Thuermer] Our opinion is unequivocal: Hungary should be a  neutral country. We are in a situation today when large  international processes have not finished yet. [passage omitted]  If we cooperate with NATO, all possibility of neutrality will be  lost.    [Announcer] We have not talked about our eastern neighbours  yet. I am thinking of Russia and Ukraine. Would the Workers  Party change the relations vis-a-vis these countries?    [Thuermer] [passage omitted] We think that Hungary as a  Central European country needs balanced and good relations with  the great eastern powers, Russia and Ukraine and, at the same  time, of course, with the west. The most important thing is to  be on good terms with the neighbors.    [Announcer] How does the foreign policy of the Workers Party  deal with the rest of the neighbouring countries?    [Thuermer] I would offer a treaty to all our neighbors.  Three things should be laid down in this treaty. The sides  should mutually renounce any change of the borders. This is the  first thing. [passage omitted]. Second, we should spell out  that we mutually guarantee the rights of the national  minorities, taking into consideration the European practice and  each other's means. The third issue is that we should express  our intent that we will cooperate in every field. [passage  omitted]    [Announcer] Can the southern Slav crisis be solved and how?    [Thuermer] The southern Slav crisis could have been settled  a  long time ago if others had not interfered in it. We have  always said that the settlement should be left to the denizens.  [passage omitted] The Hungarian Government should say that we  are not to take part in any peacekeeping action which concerns  the neighbors. It should also be said -- let it be a war  situation or not -- that the AWACS planes need to be sent home.  [passage omitted]</p>

The security  forces intercepted the demonstration in front of the ROSE  AL-YUSUF building and succeeded in dispersing it. These forces  imposed strict security measures around the People's Assembly  and the adjacent ministries for fear of a resumption of the  demonstrations.    The Central Security Forces surrounded Cairo University and  engaged in violent clashes with the students inside the campus  and fired tear gas grenades and rubber bullets, injuring a large  number of students. Among those injured were Hasan  'Abd-al-Samad 'Asakir, a student at the law college; Sami  Muhammad Zaydan, a student at the arts college; Mu'tazz Mahmud,  a student at the law college, who was hit by three bullets in  his left foot; and Sami Ahmad Fadil, whose left leg was hit by  rubber bullets. A number of injured students were taken to the  al-Qasr al-'Ayni Hospital. In the meantime, thousands of  students continue to stage demonstrations in the universities of  'Ayn Shams, al-Azhar, and Alexandria. Nasirist and Islamic  students joined in leading the demonstrations. The students  carried placards condemning the Arab rulers' defeatist stances  and calling for an immediate halt to the peace negotiations and  the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in Cairo.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Collecting: Queen Victoria still rules - Antony Thorncroft thinks buyers are stirring from hibernation TWO OF the most famous of all Victorian images, Florence Nightingale standing among the Crimean war wounded at Scutari, and Queen Victoria visiting them in hospital in London, painted as a pair by Jerry Barrett, sold at Christie's in London yesterday. The dealer Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox acquired them on behalf of the National Portrait Gallery, which already owns sketches of the paintings. Florence Nightingale went for Pounds 188,500, at the top of its estimate, and Queen Victoria beat her forecast at Pounds 199,500. What is odd about the paintings is that they have not been seen in public since they were exhibited at Agnews in 1859 and were bought there by a forefather of yesterday's seller for Pounds 870. Their fame is totally dependent on the subsequent engravings, which entered millions of Victorian homes. Also surprising is that little is known about Barrett. His artistic reputation survives on just these two paintings which were commissioned by Agnews who paid for the artist to visit the Crimea. It proved an excellent investment. This has been a good week for Christie's which on Wednesday sold the celebrated miniature by Nicholas Hilliard of 'A man clasping a hand from a cloud' for Pounds 177,500, way ahead of the Pounds 50,000 estimate. The owner, the late Shakespearean scholar, Leslie Hotson, was convinced that the sitter was Shakespeare himself, but the expert on Elizabethan portraiture, Sir Roy Strong, has decided it is Lord Thomas Howard, later 1st Earl of Suffolk. Yesterday Christie's announced that it has concluded a private treaty sale with the National Gallery of Scotland which transfers a drawing by Raphael, 'The Madonna of the Fish', into its safe keeping. The National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Arts Collection Fund helped the Museum pay for the drawing by respectively giving Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 50,000. Slowly the salerooms are stirring back to life: the main auction rooms at Sotheby's and Christie's have been deathly quiet since mid-December. But Sotheby's too this week announced a major lot for disposal, one of the most celebrated, and last, watercolours by Thomas Girtin. 'St Vincent's Rocks, Clifton' was painted in 1802, the year of his death. It comes on to the market on April 1 and should make at least Pounds 80,000, helped by the renewed interest in British watercolours fostered by the two important exhibitions currently taking place at the Royal Academy and the British Museum. The Original Print Fair closed at the Royal Academy last Sunday and was a great success. It was always likely that prints, relatively cheap to buy but the work of great artists, would help lead the art world out of recession. There were 12 per cent more visitors than last year and all the 28 dealers made sales, often to overseas buyers. But, as a sign of the times, it was prints under Pounds 10,000 which changed hands most rapidly.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / International Company News: Approval for demerger at Marriott MARRIOTT Corporation, the lodging and food services group, won shareholder approval at yesterday's annual meeting for its controversial proposal to split the company into two. It wants to demerge its main operating interests - the lodging business and food services operations, to be known as Marriott International - from its property assets and the bulk of the group's debts, which will be grouped in a business to be known as Host Marriott. Just before yesterday's meeting Marriott also announced it had reached a settlement with a group which had opposed the plan: preferred shareholders who argued the split would hurt them financially. The settlement involves the dissidents converting their preferred stock into common stock before the demerger goes ahead, and a payment to them which the company described as 'immaterial'. The company has already seen off a bondholder revolt by agreeing to swap Dollars 1.525bn of existing bonds for new high- yielding debt.</p>

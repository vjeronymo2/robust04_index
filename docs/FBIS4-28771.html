			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Yonezawa, chairman-elect of the </F> Democratic Socialist Party, by an unidentified NIHON KEIZAI  SHIMBUN reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] You have called for inter  party talks on election ties-up as early as next weekend under  the coalition's joint floor group "Kaishin." Could you explain  your true intention?    [Yonezawa] To beat the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] under  the single-seat constituency elections, the coalition must be  united. I think the LDP is becoming well-prepared for general  elections compared with coalition parties. However, it is still  uncertain whether or not the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ] ties up with us. SDPJ members would react strongly if we  start preparing for election without them, but they may not take  any action if we keep waiting. We are in a dilemma.    After the Hata administration became a minority government,  the opposition began to seek a dissolution of the lower house  through a no-confidence motion against the cabinet. Under such  circumstances, the election may be held earlier than expected.  When we discuss election strategies, we have to consider  whether coalition parties should promote joint election  campaigns within the existing framework, or form a new party.  The coalition must have uniform policies even under joint  campaign to back multiparty candidates, or voters would say the  joint campaign is nothing more than a marriage of convenience  for election only. Hereafter, coalition parties will have more  opportunities to coordinate their policies, and I guess policy  debates for election ties-up may become the key to the next  stage of political realignment. In that case, political  realignment would be accelerated by policy debates. I think  members of the "Kaishin" can start policy talks anytime.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The SDPJ and the Democratic Socialist  Party [DSP] are expected to open policy talks at the initiative  by the Japanese Trade Union Confederation [Rengo]....    [Yonezawa] We are wondering if the SDPJ can return to the  coalition, if we can tie up with each other in election  campaigns, and if we can jointly seek political realignment.  Since the present situation is very delicate, it is good to  have frank talks between the two parties.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] As the condition for its return to  the coalition, the SDPJ is calling for a mass resignation of the  Hata administration. Does the coalition intend to compromise  with the SDPJ if it asks for a "full reshuffle of the cabinet"?    [Yonezawa] If the prime minister says he "voluntarily  dissolves the cabinet," he would immediately lose his  leadership. From a common sense standpoint, he cannot make such  a pledge right now because it would damage political power  balance. There may be various possibilities of the "full  reshuffle," but that should be discussed to strengthen the  coalition.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] The coalition's tax reform  negotiations are entering the final stage. Do you think the  coalition should indicate to what degree the consumption tax  should be increased?    [Yonezawa] I think the coalition must clearly indicate the  rate of tax hike. However, the timing, the scale, and  methodology of tax reform ultimately depend on results of  consultations with the LDP, SDPJ, and the Sakigake. When  certain accords are obtained, those must be clearly written in  our proposal.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you evaluate Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito  Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa?    [Yonezawa] I agree with their opinions but this does not  mean I agree with anything they say. The DSP supports their  ideas according to its own judgment. So, I do not understand  why some people say "the DSP flatters the Shinseito and the  Komeito." I think they are both capable men.    [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Are you resolved to become the last  leader of the DSP?    [Yonezawa] When the new party is formed, all participating  parties should take off old clothes. In this sense, everybody  else will share the fate with the DSP chairman. I want to  complete the new party during my term as the DSP chairman.</p>

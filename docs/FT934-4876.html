			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / S Korean industry leader arrested for fund diversion The South Korean government denied yesterday the arrest of the head of Hanhwa, the country's ninth largest business group, signalled a crackdown on leading conglomerates, or chaebol. Mr Kim Seung-youn, Hanhwa chairman, is the nation's first incumbent chaebol leader to be prosecuted. He is charged with illegally diverting funds to buy property in the US in violation of foreign exchange laws. He is the third prominent businessmen to be prosecuted since the reformist President Kim Young-sam was inaugurated in February. Mr Chung Ju-yung, the founder of Hyundai, was recently convicted of illegally diverting corporate funds for his failed presidential campaign against President Kim last year. Mr Park Tae-joon, founder of Pohang Iron and Steel, the world's third largest steelmaker, fled to Japan in March after he was charged with illegally using corporate funds to support Mr Kim's conservative political opponents. Hanhwa's Mr Kim also has close ties with the president's opponents within the ruling Democratic Liberal party. Critics have accused the president of engaging in a political vendetta against his foes by ordering investigations of the business leaders. President Kim has criticised the chaebol for benefiting from links with the country's former military dictatorship and proposed measures to reduce their dominant position in the Korean economy. The Hanhwa chairman's arrest surprised observers since the president has recently adopt a more conciliatory approach toward the chaebol.</p>

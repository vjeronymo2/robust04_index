Dhimitropoulou] </F>   [Text] Mitrofan Studenikin, chairman of the Russian  Friendship Association with Cyprus who is visiting our country  at the head of a three-member delegation, told our paper  yesterday that the association will propose to the Russian  parliament the establishment of a parliamentary group for  contacts with Cyprus.    Studenikin reiterated the support of his country and  association for the Cypriot people and stressed that the purpose  of their visit is to strengthen traditionally friendly relations  between the Cypriot and Russian peoples, which have recently  slackened because of the political developments in Russia.    Studenikin stressed, however, that the association continues  to act and work for the good of both peoples. Many Cypriot  students, workers, and businessmen who live in Russia have  frequent contacts with the association while a publications  exhibition on Cyprus was recently organized in Moscow, which was  successful.    During their stay the delegation has met with Foreign  Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis, Archbishop Khrisostomos, the  secretary and other leading members of the Cyprus-Soviet  Friendship Society, and representatives of the Association of  Soviet Higher Educational Institutes Graduates and exchanged  views aimed at further strengthening the relations between the  Cypriot and Russian peoples.</p>

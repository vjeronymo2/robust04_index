			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Ukrainian premier in stand off with hardliners Ukrainian Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma yesterday faced down hardliners who had challenged his economic reforms, Chrystia Freeland writes from Kiev. Mr Kuchma confronted Conservative deputies objecting to price liberalisation and a cap on wages at an informal session of parliament after his opponents failed to achieve a quorum for an emergency debate. Mr Kuchma's priorities are to cut the deficit by restricting industrial subsidies and welfare payments, to solve Ukraine's energy crisis, to promote private business and to create effective regional government.</p>

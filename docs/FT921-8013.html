			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (12): Worth reading - Books for business and leisure on hotels, on shopping, on eating out and nightlife, for example. They also publish excellent walking tour booklets. Among the best guide books are the APA guide; and Introduction to Hong Kong (Odyssey Guides; the Guidebook Company). Business: The Hong Kong Trade Development Council publishes a guide called Hong Kong for the Business Visitor, as well as a wealth of more specific material on different industries, and regions of China. Chambers of Commerce, including the HK General Chamber, publish helpful material, but the best by far comes from the American Chamber of Commerce based in Swire House (tel: 526 0165). You do not have to be American to be able to buy their publications, which include: Living in Hong Kong; Doing Business in Today's Hong Kong; Establishing an Office in Hong Kong; PRC Business Firms in Hong Kong &amp; Macao; Doing Business in Guangdong (The American Chamber also offers a Business Briefing service where, for the price of a 'power breakfast,' a panel of executives with relevant local business experience will brief you on their experience of operating in Hong Kong and China. The Chamber likes four weeks notice to arrange appropriate panellists.) The Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation publishes a valuable guide to doing business in the territory as part of its 'Business Profile' series that also includes many countries in Asia, and a large number of Chinese provinces and cities. Other business publications are listed in the section on key facts on Hong Kong. History:Foreign Mud: by Maurice Collins (Faber &amp; Faber); Borrowed Place, Borrowed Time, by Richard Hughes (Andre Deutsch); Myself a Mandarin, by Austin Coates (Heinemann Asia); Hong Kong: the Cultured Pearl (Oxford University Press); Hong Kong, by Jan Morris (Viking Penguin).

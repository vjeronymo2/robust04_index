			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Kohl sets deadline for solidarity pact: The chancellor is playing the foreign travel card as he seeks to concentrate minds CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl has finally set himself a deadline, of a sort, to tie up the details of his much-vaunted solidarity pact to finance German unification. The day is February 17, and the reason is that on February 18 he leaves on a two-week trip - already once postponed - to India, Japan and south-east Asia. The only question is whether the chancellor's travel plans will prove enough of an incentive to concentrate the minds of coalition and opposition leaders, trade unions, employers and the 16 federal states to agree on a coherent package in time. As D-day approaches, the differences not only between the negotiating partners, but within each camp, are multiplying. That may allow the wily German chancellor more room for manoeuvre to do a deal, which would set savings in west Germany against spending in the east, and exchange increased investment for wage restraint. Equally, it threatens to cause total confusion. The solidarity pact is important for two reasons. First, it will begin to find an answer to the ever-more intractable task of financing the flow of western subsidies to east Germany, which are forecast at around DM150bn (Pounds 62.5bn) or more a year for the next decade. It may not quite fill the gap - estimated at around DM110bn in 1995 - but it will make a start. More immediately, if a solidarity pact can show that the public sector - central government, the 16 Lander and local government - can seriously cut its budget deficits, and that the trade unions can restrain their wage demands, the mighty German Bundesbank will be much more likely to find the necessary 'room for manoeuvre' to cut its interest rates. Both government and trade unions urgently want those interest rates cut to prevent the recession from deepening. And it just so happens that the central bank has a council meeting on February 18. The pact is supposed to operate on two parallel planes. On one level it would exchange guarantees of increased investment in the east for wage restraint: a deal between government, employers and unions. The second level amounts to a deal between the central government and the 16 federal states, east and west, on how to step up spending in the east, and share the burden in the west. Little is yet agreed. For a start, Mr Kohl's own Christian Democrats (CDU) are divided about how much money they can switch from west to east. His eastern lieutenants - the premiers of four of the five Lander in east Germany - are calling for a further DM8bn to be made available this year alone, more than double what is on offer. From the western side, Mr Erwin Teufel, the CDU prime minister of wealthy Baden-Wurttemberg, insists that the bill is already too large to be borne without unacceptable cuts in services. It would mean an annual transfer of DM6bn from his state, or twice the state budget for hospitals, roads and houses. 'This is simply inconceivable,' he said in a television interview yesterday. The left wing of the party, led by Mr Norbert Blum, the labour minister, and Ms Rita Sussmuth, president of the Bundestag, are worried that planned cuts in social spending will hit the lower-paid too hard. They want new tax rises soon to cushion the blow. Mr Blum has floated the idea of rethinking the entire financing of employment and retraining schemes in east Germany, to spread the burden more fairly: to switch from financing through national insurance payments (borne by only 70 per cent of the population) to a form of tax surcharge, borne by all income tax payers, including the self-employed. Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel say no tax rises before 1995. They would be 'poison for the economy'. Mr Blum's ideas are, perhaps, conveniently close to thinking coming from the opposition Social Democrats (SPD). Therein may lie the seeds of compromise. The SPD is officially set against anything like the sort of spending cuts, including a reduction in unemployment benefits, proposed. Yet Mr Bjorn Engholm, the party leader, and Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, the parliamentary leader, both seem keen to do a deal in the end. As for the trade unions, one pillar of SPD party support, Mr Franz Steinkuhler of the powerful IG Metall engineering union, has been a key participant from the start. Mr Steinkuhler believes that he has won important concessions from the Chancellor to preserve the 'core areas' of east German industry. He doesn't want to throw that away for nothing. Few doubt that some sort of package will emerge. The only question now is whether it will end up as a unilateral plan presented by the chancellor, or a cross-party deal for which he can claim broad-based support. And in either case, will it be enough to persuade the Bundesbank to move?  ----------------------------------------    GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS TO PLUG THE GAP  ---------------------------------------- Spending cuts                      10bn  ---------------------------------------- Reduction in tax allowances         7bn  ---------------------------------------- Provisions in federal &amp; state budget plans               45bn  ---------------------------------------- Further savings in state &amp; local government budgets         **??bn  ---------------------------------------- Renewed 'solidarity surcharge'     ??bn  ---------------------------------------- **figures to be negotiated  ----------------------------------------</p>

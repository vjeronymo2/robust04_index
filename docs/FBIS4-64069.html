			<p>BFN     [Text] Investigators into last October's parliamentary  uprising made serious mistakes, a commission of the Prosecutor  General's Office concluded. This is precisely why Deputy  Prosecutor General Vladimir Kravtsev was dismissed.    Although the formula of indictment on former Vice President  Aleksandr Rutskoy, ex-Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov and former  Deputy Soviet Defence Minister Vladislav Achalov was ready in  January, this was delayed because of incomplete work on  plaintiffs and damage sustained. Other mistakes include lack of  coordination and duplication of work by separate investigating  teams. The files were kept apart and none of the teams had  enough information to substantiate the case.    The commission also indicated that a substantial part of  external investigating officers had little experience with 28  percent of prosecuting officers and 33 percent of police  investigators having work records of less than three years. As  many as 7,000 witnesses had been questioned and the identity  established of 151 dead victims and 913 wounded casualties by  February 22 when the State Duma declared an amnesty.    Apart from subjective reasons, the investigation was also  hampered because of delays caused by a number of government  bodies. Despite the PGO's [Prosecutor General's Office] repeated  requests, no estimates were provided of the damage done to the  buildings of the Russian parliament and Moscow mayor's office.</p>

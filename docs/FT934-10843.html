			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Citicorp aims to tap Russian bills trading CITICORP, the US bank due to open a fully-owned subsidiary in Moscow early in 1994, sees a big potential in Russia's fledgling Treasury bill trade, Reuter reports from Moscow. 'We believe there is potential for this market to grow and become very big. As soon as we open we will be registered as a government securities dealer,' said Mr Miljenko Horvat, who heads Citicorp's Moscow operation. 'We are very interested in seeing the securities market develop in Russia. The T-bills give our clients with rouble balances an investment opportunity,' he said. Bankers say the accounts of foreign multinationals in Russia, many of which have to fly in cash to fund operations in the absence of western-style banking services, are up for grabs for western newcomers to the Russian banking scene. In the absence of competition, Russian banks are charging commissions of up to 5 per cent per deal.</p>

			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Burger King to Offer Credit: Burger King is going high-tech to make it easier  to buy a Whopper with cheese on credit -- at least in 27 of its franchise  outlets in the Portland, Ore., area. Restaurant Management Northwest, which  owns 27 Burger King restaurants in the Portland area, said it will install the  Celerex "Faster Than Cash" electronic payment system in its franchises.  Designed for high-volume, low-dollar ticket retailers such as fast-food  outlets, the Celerex system will allow the Burger King outlets to accept credit  cards faster than cash.  </P></p>

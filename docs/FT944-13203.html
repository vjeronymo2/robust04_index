			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Turnround at Broadgate boosts Stanhope The position of Stanhope, the developer which is in refinancing talks with its banks, improved yesterday with the publication of figures which showed a healthy increase in the value of its main assets. Stanhope has been approached by a number of potential investors, including British Land, headed by Mr John Ritblat, which bought a 30 per cent stake in February. Full-year results from Broadgate Properties, in which Stanhope has a 50 per cent stake, showed that the value of its five buildings in the Broadgate office complex increased by Pounds 46.7m, or 6 per cent, to Pounds 778m, during the year to June 30. The value of the Ludgate development, on the western edge of the City of London, increased by Pounds 74.5m reflecting both higher property values and additional development work carried out during the year. Ludgate is now valued at Pounds 224.4m. With external debt falling from Pounds 799m to Pounds 788m, the value of Broadgate Properties to its shareholders increased to Pounds 232m (Pounds 148m). This is split between Stanhope and Rosehaugh, its partner which was put into receivership in 1992. Analysts estimated the figures would give Stanhope net assets of about Pounds 10m at its year-end, against negative net assets of Pounds 15.7m last year. Turnover fell from Pounds 87.1m to Pounds 69.1m, reflecting lower rental income following the sales of 175 Bishopsgate and 100 Ludgate Hill, which raised Pounds 199m to reduce bank borrowings. Operating profit declined to Pounds 57.7m (Pounds 67.2m) but after the release of Pounds 25m provisions to reflect the increased value of Ludgate and lower financing costs, pre-tax profits were Pounds 28.7m against losses of Pounds 72.5m. Despite additional lettings at both Broadgate and Ludgate, the company did not cover its cash financing costs from operational activities. The net cash inflow from operations for the year was Pounds 54.1m (Pounds 83m) against cash interest costs of Pounds 71.8m (Pounds 117.5m). Mr Paul Rivlin, finance director, said that while Broadgate now covered its financing costs, rent-free periods for tenants at Ludgate meant interest was rolling up on some loans. The company has let 393,000 sq ft of office space since June 1993, leaving vacant only 81,000 sq ft at Broadgate and 58,000 sq ft at Ludgate.</p>

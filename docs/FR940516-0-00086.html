Requests for waivers of this prohibition must demonstrate either a substantial problem with theft of basic tier service or a strong need to scramble basic signals for other reasons. As part of this showing, cable operators are required to notify subscribers by mail of waiver requests. The notice to subscribers must be mailed no later than thirty calendar days from the date the request waiver was filed with the Commission, and cable operators must inform the Commission in writing, as soon as possible, of that notification date. The notification to subscribers must state: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On (date of waiver request was filed with the Commission), (cable operator's name) filed with the Federal Communications Commission a request for waiver of the rule prohibiting scrambling of channels on the basic tier of service. 47 CFR &sect;76.630(a). The request for waiver states (a brief summary of the waiver request). A copy of the request for waiver is on file for public inspection at (the address of the cable operator's local place of business). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individuals who wish to comment on this request for waiver should mail comments to the Federal Communications Commission by no later than 30 days from (the date the notification was mailed to subscribers).

Cable system operators are advised that this requirement obliges them to actively enable the remote control functions of customer premises equipment where those functions do not operate without a special activation procedure. Cable system operators may, however, disable the remote control functions of a subscriber's customer premises equipment where requested by the subscriber. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Cable operators may not alter the infrared codes used to operate the remote control capabilities of the customer premises equipment they employ in providing service to subscribers. Cable operators may, however, use new equipment that includes additional infrared codes for new remote control functions that were not included in existing models of customer premises equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Cable system operators that use scrambling, encryption or similar technologies in conjunction with cable system terminal devices, as defined in &sect;15.1(e) of this chapter, that may affect subscribers' reception of signals shall offer to supply each subscriber with special equipment that will enable the simultaneous reception of multiple signals. This equipment could include, for example, set-top cable system terminal devices with multiple descramblers/decoders and/or timers, and signal bypass switches. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The offer of special equipment shall be made to new subscribers at the time they subscribe and to all subscribers at least once each year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Such special equipment shall, at a minimum, have the capability: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) To allow simultaneous reception of any two or more scrambled or encrypted signals and to provide for tuning to alternative channels on a pre-programmed schedule; and, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

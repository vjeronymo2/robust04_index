			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory Euro-rebels divided on tactics GOVERNMENT back-tracking over Maastricht last night left Euro-sceptic Tory MPs divided over tactics towards Labour's social chapter amendment  - but elated at the embarrasment caused to ministers. Mr James Cran, Tory MP for Beverley and prominent Maastricht opponent, said the Euro-sceptics would be seeking their own legal advice. 'We are reserving our position,' he said. The humiliation, however, may have been worthwhile from the government's viewpoint with several Conservative Euro-sceptics indicating that the threatened rebellion would evaporate now Labour's amendment was seen as meaningless. But others believed that there was still value in embarrassing the government and a faint prospect it could prevent Maastricht being implemented. Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East, said he still intended to vote for Labour's amendment to save money for Britain. Labour believes its amendment 27, removing the protocol on the social chapter and Britain's 'opt out', would force the government to incorporate the social chapter. Last night Mr John Smith, party leader, said the amendment would not be withdrawn and accused the government of 'a serious contempt of the parliamentary process'. Attention of Euro-sceptics is likely to turn to other possibilities for wrecking the bill - perhaps via fresh amendments on the social chapter, or a referendum. 'It is business as usual. We are going to continue to seek amendments to this bill and put pressure on in the House of Commons,' said Mr Cran. Lord Tebbit, former Tory chairman, said on Channel Four news: 'We may still find ways of tripping it up and destroying it'. Other Euro-sceptics believe that the fresh confusion justifies the use of delaying tactics and reinforces the argument for a referendum. In the Commons, opposition MPs and Tory Euro-sceptics reacted to Mr Hurd's performance with undisguised hilarity, commenting repeatedly on the 'convenience' of the new legal interpretation from the government's perspective. The mood was encapsulated by Sir Russell Johnston, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, who provoked laughter by asking whether the 'simple' point was not 'where there is a political will, there is a legal way.' Among Euro-sceptics, Mr William Cash, MP for Stafford, claimed the reason for 'all this confusion, chaos and mess' was that the Maastricht treaty was 'riddled with contradictions.' He called for the document to be consigned to 'the dustbin of history.' Mr Richard Shepherd, MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, asked how MPs could rely on any of the legal advice communicated by the government.</p>

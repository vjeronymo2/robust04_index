			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Zhuravlev in the "Parliament" column: </F> "President Yeltsin Invites the Duma To Grant an Amnesty; A  Communist Representative Calls for the Release of Members of the  State Committee for the State of Emergency"]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin has sent an edict,  dated 21 January, On the State Duma Draft Resolution on Granting  Amnesty, to the lower house of the Federal Assembly. Using his  power to initiate legislation and "taking guidance from the  principles of humanism," as the document says, and also  following the adoption of the Russian Federation constitution,  the president proposes that pardon be granted to those convicted  of committing crimes "that do not constitute a great social  danger."    As Duma Deputy Chairman Mikhail Mityukov (Russia's Choice)  told journalists, what is involved is "a limited range of  people" which is "understandable, given the present crime  situation in the country." Amnesty will not be granted to those  who have been convicted of grave crimes (the edict enumerates 53  articles of the Penal Code), especially dangerous recidivists,  those who maliciously break penal colonies rules, and also those  who were once amnestied or pardoned but have again found  themselves behind bars.    Under the draft, subject to be released are those who "did  their service in the active army or formations or took part in  actions to protect the Motherland," as well as women, men over  age 60, first and second category invalids, and persons serving  their sentences for committing inadvertent crimes and sentenced  to terms of up to five years (provided they have served not less  than one-third of their terms), those under age with terms under  three years, and those who have committed premeditated crimes  but were also sentenced to terms under three years. The amnesty  is also to apply to those convicted with suspended sentences or  put on probation.    Commenting on the presidential edict, Mr. Mityukov described  it as a reasonable initiative, once again stressing that the  proposed amnesty "is fairly limited in scale." The latter  assessment is also shared by Viktor Ilyukhin (Russian Federation  Communist Party), chairman of the Duma Security Committee, who  nonetheless told SEGODNYA's correspondent about his negative  attitude to wide amnesties in general. At the same time, Mr.  Ilyukhin spoke in favor of granting a "political amnesty" which  should, in his view, include the people arrested following last  year's (February and March) demonstrations in Moscow, the 3-4  October events, and also defendants in the case of the State  Committee for the State of Emergency.    The president's edict On the State Duma Draft Resolution on  Granting Amnesty is to be considered this week by the House  Council (the speaker and faction leaders), then transferred to  the committee on legislation and legal reform, and only then,  with the requisite comments, be submitted to a full session.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, May 21, BNS -- Latvian Prime Minister Valdis  Birkavs met with North Atlantic Assembly (NAA) President Loic  Bouvard and Secretary General Peter Corterier and discussed  Latvian security policy and mutual cooperation, the Government  Information Agency reported.    During the meeting, Birkavs acquainted the NAA delegation  with the signed Latvian-Russian agreements on troop withdrawal  and the beginning of their implementation.    Birkavs thanked NAA for support to the Russian troop  withdrawal from Latvia and urged NATO countries to monitor the  implementing of the signed agreements, especially what regards  the continued operation of the Skrunda radar facility.    Birkavs reiterated that Latvia's security policy was  unambiguously oriented toward joining the North Atlantic  alliance. Latvia views any form of military cooperation with  Russia as unacceptable, Birkavs added.    The officials also touched on NAA assistance in the  formation  of the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion.    Corterier and Bouvard also met Friday [20 May] with Latvian  Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis, parliament Chairman  Anatolijs Gorbunovs and government officials.    NAA is an interparliamentary organization that acts as a  legislative forum of the North Atlantic Assembly member states.  It aims at promoting mutual understanding and information  exchange.    The three Baltic states and nine other former Communist bloc  countries are NAA associate members. It means they may  participate in the assembly work and debate but may not vote.</p>

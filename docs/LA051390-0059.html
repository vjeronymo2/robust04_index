			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEFINING 'PRO-LIFE'  </P> <P> I read with interest the frequent commentaries and letters concerning abortion  published in your newspaper.  </P> <P> On April 13, an Operation Rescue demonstration was held at Doctors Family  Planning Clinic in Tustin.  </P> <P> As a pro-choice volunteer who took part in the clinic defense early that  morning, and other mornings, I wish to make a few observations.  </P> <P> The term pro-life is a misnomer when used to describe people who oppose legal  abortion because it implies that they have a greater respect for life than  those who support it. So-called pro-life people are, in effect, anti-choice.  </P> <P> Pro-choice people are certainly as pro-life as anti-choice people. The  difference is that they define the life in question as that of women who will  die from illegal abortion and children who will die from abuse, whereas  so-called "right-to-lifers" define it as the life of a fetus.  </P> <P> Pro-choice people are not pro-abortion. They are for the right of the  individual to make her own decision about abortion. They do not believe that  decision should rest with the government or any religious organization.  </P> <P> At the demonstration in Tustin, anti-choice people sang religious hymns, held  up rosaries and were led by a priest in cassock and a minister in clerical  collar. At the same time they were pushing clinic defenders, trying to dislodge  them in order to prevent patients from receiving legal medical treatment.  </P> <P> By their own actions, anti-choice people show us their intention -- it is to  impose on others their religious belief concerning abortion. That intention is  the essence of this controversy.  </P> <P> RUTH SULTZBACH  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

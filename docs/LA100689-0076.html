			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN SEATTLE BOOM, STRIKE AT BOEING IS 'JUST A BLIP';  </P> <P> AS WASHINGTON STATE'S ECONOMY DIVERSIFIES, FEW FEAR WALKOUT WILL TRIGGER  '68-STYLE DEPRESSION  </P> <P> SEATTLE-When the Boeing Co. took a nose dive 20 years ago, Seattle pretty much  went with it. Some wag even erected a billboard on the outskirts of town,  asking the last one leaving to please turn out the lights.  </P> <P> But growing Pacific Rim trade, tourism and a steady stream of disgruntled  Californians have helped the Puget Sound diversify in recent years.  </P> <P> Now, the projected $25-million-a-week dent Boeing's current strike will put in  the state's economy is being referred to as "just a blip."  </P> <P> And, although food banks are stocking up just in case, neither side is  predicting a long or bitter struggle between the world's leading airplane  manufacturer and its biggest union.  </P> <P> About 57,000 members of the International Assn. of Machinists and Aerospace  Workers continued their walkout for a second day Thursday with no new talks  scheduled.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overtime Issue  </P> <P> The strikers, who make up the bulk of Boeing's blue-collar work force, are  demanding their first pay hike in six years and a sharp reduction or  abolishment of mandatory overtime, which is currently 200 hours a quarter.  </P> <P> They rejected Boeing's last offer, which would have increased salaries 4% this  year and 3% in 1990 and 1991. Overtime would have been cut to 160 hours a  quarter.  </P> <P> Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz Thursday apologized in a telegram to Defense  Secretary Dick Cheney for any delays the strike might cause in delivery. Boeing  manufactures structural components for the B-2 bomber and other military  planes.  </P> <P> The walkout is the latest and biggest in a rash of strikes to hit Seattle in  recent months.  </P> <P> Thousands of grocery workers, nurses and carpenters also have walked the picket  lines during what turned out to be a summer of discontent.  </P> <P> "People are mad," said Karen Keiser, spokeswoman for the Washington State Labor  Council, AFL-CIO.  </P> <P> "They were very patient and very accommodating for a decade when the economy  was bad," she said. "There were a lot of concessions -- wage freezes, giveaways  . . . .  </P> <P> "Well, now the economy is booming and people feel it's their turn, that it's  time to make up what they gave up."  </P> <P> Boeing is in its fifth straight year of record sales and employment, and it  accounts either directly or indirectly for an estimated one-third of the  500,000 jobs the state has created since 1983.  </P> <P> It is the state's leading manufacturer.  </P> <P> And, although most agree that the company clearly still drives the region's  economy, what it drives amounts to more of a stretch limousine these days than  a Volkswagen.  </P> <P> "We're the No. 1 factor in the region's economy," said Boeing spokesman Harold  Carr, "but the general perception is that the area is less dependent on us than  it was 20 years ago."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Industries  </P> <P> Port activity, downtown development, biomedical technology, software  manufacturing and tourism all have helped make Seattle "a world-class city,"  said economist Dennis Fusco.  </P> <P> "We're all waiting to see the impact of the strike," said Fusco, chief  economist for the State Employment Security Department.  </P> <P> "It depends entirely on the duration," he said.  </P> <P> The aerospace industry is enjoying record prosperity, and the Puget Sound area  remains its capital. Economists don't fear a rerun of what became known around  here as the Great Boeing Depression of 1968-71. The infamous billboard went up,  and there were stories of Boeing engineers driving cabs to make ends meet.  </P> <P> Boeing laid off half its work force then, and the region had yet to build an  economic cushion of diversity.  </P> <P> "Seattle is booming now," Fusco said, "not just Boeing."  </P> <P> "The strike, within one or two months, represents just a blip in our economy,"  he added.  </P> <P> "We've just grown up."  </P> <P> At the AFL-CIO, Karen Keiser predicted it would take only "a week" for the  strike's impact to be felt.  </P> <P> "Remember, these people are consumers. We're not talking about people who sock  it away on mutual funds and bonds," she said.  </P> <P> "They're buying refrigerators and houses and school clothes."  </P> <P> On the picket lines, many workers agreed that the short-term strike they expect  would have minimal impact on the region's economy.  </P> <P> "The economy is helping us right now," said Robert Kazen, a maintenance man for  11 years at Boeing.  </P> <P> "Most of my creditors have already agreed to let me just make interest  payments," he said.  </P> <P> "I think it'll last a couple of weeks maybe," said Skip Buckner, a 10-year  Boeing veteran manning a picket line outside the company's giant 747 factory in  Everett.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 7-Day Weeks  </P> <P> "I earned this time off and I want it," he said. "For 2 1/2 years, I worked  12-hour days, seven days a week. You know how I spent my vacation?  </P> <P> "Flat on my back in bed with pneumonia."  </P> <P> Keiser said all Puget Sound labor leaders plan to meet Monday "for some fairly  high-level strategizing."  </P> <P> So far, the machinists have not asked for any sympathy strikes. Fellow unions  at Boeing are bound by no-strike clauses which would prevent such a show of  solidarity.  </P> <P> Although Carr said "very close to 100%" of the union members stayed off the  job, some strikers who entered the plant to pick up their tool boxes seemed  surprised by the amount of activity inside.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of people working," one striker bitterly told friends on the  picket line as he came out with his tool box. "Not just supervisors, either."  </P> <P> With an $80-billion backlog of 1,603 planes on order, Boeing commands 60% of  the world market and has enough work to keep its assembly lines busy  around-the-clock for five years, analysts say.  </P> <P> Although supervisors and other non-union workers can fill in to some degree,  Carr admitted it was "highly unlikely" that a plane could be built  start-to-finish under current circumstances.  </P> <P> Boeing faced penalties last year for late deliveries to airlines, but Carr said  contracts can be renegotiated and such fines avoided during labor disputes.  </P> <P> Boeing faced penalties from two other sources Thursday -- the state Department  of Labor and Industries and the federal Occupational Safety and Health  Administration.  </P> <P> The state said it has penalized Boeing $128,780 for 36 alleged violations, the  largest penalty ever proposed against a Washington State employer under the  state's Industrial Safety and Health Act. OSHA announced citations against  Boeing for 40 violations that carry penalties totaling $41,530.  </P> <P> The citations were primarily focused on Boeing Advanced Systems operations at  the Developmental Center in Seattle, where parts for the B-2 bomber are made.  </P> <P> Of the state's 36 alleged violations, 19 were related to safety and 17 to  hygiene.  </P></p>

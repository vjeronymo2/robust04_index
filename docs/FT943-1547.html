			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Headlam to Pounds 2.15m Headlam, the fabric and floorcoverings distributor, almost doubled pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30, after contributions from two recent acquisitions. On turnover up 46 per cent to Pounds 62.7m (Pounds 42.9m) pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 1.13m to Pounds 2.15m. However, the core floorcovering division experienced what was referred to as 'turbulent demand', with a poor second quarter reflecting the depressed UK housing market. Floorcovering sales increased by 26 per cent to Pounds 36.7m, but the return on sales stood at 2.9 per cent, compared to 8.5 per cent for its newly-created soft furnishings division. Mr Ian Kirkham, chief executive, said the group expected sustained progress in the second half, which includes the high demand traditionally experienced in the autumn. In May, the company launched its second rights issue within a year to help finance two purchases worth Pounds 2.98m. Gordon John Textiles distributes curtain lining and Wiltrex Readymades readymade curtain. They contributed to sales of Pounds 11.3m by the soft furnishings operations. The following month, Headlam spent Pounds 550,000 to acquire William O'Hanlon, the window furnishings distributor, which is expected to make a modest contribution to this year's results. Interest charges for the half-year rose from Pounds 249,000 to Pounds 455,000. Earnings per share rose by 1p 3.8p and the interim dividend was up from 0.85p to 1p. The shares closed down 11p at 200p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Vice President Guillermo Ford by </F> unidentified reporter on 8 May; place not given--recorded]    [Text] The people's decision is final, according to Vice  President Guillermo Ford. Panamanians must respect the people's  decision.    [Begin recording] [Ford] The elections have been a model of  civility and have displayed a great sense of homeland. The  international community should respect the Panamanian people.  Most important now are the results and the Panamanian people  abiding by the majority of the Panamanian people's will.    [Reporter] Do you think the political parties will accept  the  people's decision?    [Ford] All of the parties and all of us politicians must  abide by the National Vote-Counting Board's decision, which I am  sure will be endorsed by the various officials of the Catholic  Church, as well as by international observers. The question is  not whether we wish to accept the decision of the majority of  the Panamanian people -- we must.    [Reporter] What do you think about the young people who have  gone out into the streets, each in his own party's name, to  celebrate?    [Ford] Inasmuch as it is celebration, I praise it;  nevertheless, I hope such a celebration will not lead them to a  confrontation, because we will not permit that. I am asking the  young people and every Panamanian citizen to behave themselves.  Let's wait for the final results to decide the next Panamanian  president. [end recording]</p>

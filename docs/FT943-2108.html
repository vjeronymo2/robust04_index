			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Recruitment: Counting the cost of out-of-sight employees - Formulas for equitable expatriate employment packages need to address broader issues The expatriate employee from the UK can cost a company nearly three and a half times that of his home-based counterpart, according to findings published by the Economist Intelligence Unit. The EIU, the business intelligence arm of the Economist Group, has launched a new service designed to help human resources management in multinational companies reduce the costs of cross-border staff relocation and pay. The service, which is regularly updated, draws on computer-based systems collating tax and pricing information and living costs in 100 cities worldwide. The service will place the EIU in competition with other specialist information services covering the expatriate field. These include P-E Centre For Management Research, Organization Resources Counselors, Employment Conditions Abroad and AIR Inc, of Boston in the US. All these information services have identified a growing need among companies and individual employees to find suitable comparisons and data for creating overseas employment packages. The multiple of three and a half times UK assignment costs is for employees working in Tokyo, said the EIU. Other multiples it has published include Paris (a multiple of three), New York (2.2) and Frankfurt (2.1). 'Given the increasing globalisation of business, these costs are a real and growing issue,' said John Nichols, the EIU's human resources development manager. 'For example, a London based employee on an annual salary of some Pounds 50,000 a year could cost his company up to Dollars 500,000 over a two-year period when relocated to New York, assuming a traditional expatriate package,' he said. What does that typical package look like? The EIU, using an example of a two-year assignment in France, gives the percentage split of costs as: 31 per cent employee's tax and social security, 22 per cent employer's social security, 23 per cent expatriate benefits, 17 per cent net to the employee, 3 per cent in other benefits, and 4 per cent in one-off assignment costs. Nichols says that, traditionally, companies have been prepared to 'build up' pay for an assignment using the premise that the employee should be no worse off than had they stayed at home. The use of incentives to move and the addition of housing allowances, plus the rents employees can often get to cover their UK mortgage payments, means that the expatriates are often considerably better off. Today, however, companies are becoming more cost conscious on expatriate deals. 'These days they are requiring that the cost of living measurements truly reflect the high cost of living and not the cost of high living,' said Nichols. Before human resource managers nod too vigorously in agreement, they should note that employees with families in particular, are sometimes in danger of losing out financially if they go abroad. Organization Resources Counselors found that three-quarters of the 112 European, North American and Japanese multinational companies that replied to a survey of human resource practices said they had no policy that accounted for the loss of spousal incomes when paying expatriate employees, nor did they intend to develop one. On average, 15 per cent of companies said they were considering a policy and 10 per cent already had one. Breaking the survey down further, the greatest enthusiasm for such policies appeared to be in the UK, said ORC. Geoffrey Latta, vice-president of ORC's compensation services said: 'Companies recognise that this is a growing problem and are very concerned about the potential costs of replacing lost income. 'If an expatriate's spouse is a lawyer or an investment banker, does the company want to compensate for lost earnings? Doing so would make an already costly process exorbitantly expensive. Professional couples may increasingly opt out of international assignments, or we may begin to see more long-distance commuter relationships.' Rent-a-boss Evidence that the market for temporary executives and the pool of available experience is continuing to grow has emerged in a survey of 2,000 temporary executives registered with Executives on Assignment, a Slough-based company. Of the 1,200 who responded, nearly half of them had worked at director level in their last permanent job. Some 12 per cent of the respondents were former chief executives. Executives on Assignment estimates the market has grown by 20 per cent in the last year, although Bob Snell, managing director, admitted this was a guess based on increased activity reported in his and other companies. There is also evidence that companies are beginning to use interim management more imaginatively. Richard McKeown, a company secretary featured in this column a few months back, has so far successfully planned his career in interim management with no intention of taking full-time work. His latest posting appears to reflect a new trend among users of interim managers. Instead of filling a gap between appointments which has been the normal type of short-term post, he has been taken on to allow the full-time company secretary time out to take part in a specific project. Snell said that another trend among some chief executives was to use interim managers as a means of employing a senior manager without taking the risk of appointing the wrong person and the attendant cost of removal. Martin Wood, director of interim management at PA Consulting, a London-based consultancy, has found that companies are beginning to use interim management as a strategic tool. He quoted a large company in the food retailing sector which was taking on an interim manager to run a division which needed a rationalisation programme. When he leaves, the new full-time appointment will be a much less important and therefore lower paid job. 'The interim manager will be more objective about what needs to be done,' said Wood. He adds that small private companies with turnovers of between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m are also starting to use interim managers where there is a management succession problem or where an experienced manager has left to set up in competition. Earn as you learn What sounds like the closest any employer has yet come to utilising a degree course for an immediate gain has been developed by Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages (CCSB), the joint venture bottling company. The company has recruited 100 university aspirants aged between 18 and 22 as soft drinks merchandisers. At the same time they will be carrying out a four-year study course for a BSc degree in Management from London University. Students in the 'earn as you learn' scheme have been recruited on a starting salary of Pounds 7,500 a year plus a company car. While all needed to fulfil the A-level criteria for the university course, they were selected in a company assessment programme from 5,000 applicants. The students will be working in 12 merchandising teams across the UK. Keith Dennis, CCSB's personnel director who designed the programme at the instigation of Derek Williams, CCSB managing director, says the company plans to recruit a further 50 students next year. All are on four-year contracts and their job specifications entail a weekly input of about 35 hours on the job plus about 20 hours in study time for the degree. They will study from home, under a distance learning arrangement administered by the National Extension College. Dennis said: 'Beyond the four years I clearly hope that a number of them will continue with the company. At the end of that time, they should have a degree from a good university and four years experience with a blue chip organisation under their belt and no negative equity.'</p>

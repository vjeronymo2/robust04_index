			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Ostankino Television First  Channel Network in Russian at 1800 GMT on 5 February carries the  "Novosti" newscast, which includes a video report on the  conflict in Bosnia citing reaction to the UN Security Council's  decision to approve air strikes in support of UN forces. The  video report shows clips from the visit of Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia, in Serbia; a brief interview with Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic; and scenes of fighting and Geneva talks. The  program also includes short interviews by unidentified  correspondents with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev;  Colonel Sergey Voznesenskiy, the commander of a Russian  battalion in the UN forces; and Presidential Council member  Sergey Karaganov. No indication was given when or where the  interviews were recorded.    A correspondent asks Kozyrev what the chances are for a  peaceful settlement in Bosnia in the "foreseeable future."  Kozyrev replies: "First, there is no other way. Second,  foreseeable future is a fairly elastic concept. I think that  there is still a chance -- perhaps even in the immediate future,  perhaps after another round of exchanging blows -- the sides  will return to Geneva and, in general terms, 95 percent of the  plan could be agreed very quickly, and about 5 percent, we  believe, could be handed over to international arbitration.  This is one of the special features of the Russian initiative  on Yugoslavia, that is, for that 5 percent. That's not very  much in terms of territory."    Commenting on the possibility of air strikes against Serb  positions, Col. Voznesenskiy says: "The selective air strikes  planned in the interests of protecting UN forces won't, in  general terms, solve the conflict that has arisen in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Moreover, I believe that it will entail  stepped up activity by the sides against UN forces, which will  entail losses among UN forces and their being taken hostage.  And, of course, there will be retaliatory measures, mass  strikes that will lead to great human losses, and destruction,  and it cannot be ruled out that the conflict that exists in  Bosnia-Herzegovina will spread far beyond the borders of the  former Yugoslavia."    A correspondent asks Presidential Council member Karaganov:  "Where will the Bosnian crisis end and when?" He replies: "I  think that it will last another year or two, until the sides  exhaust their moral, economic, and other resources and then  perhaps the most unpleasant thing that can happen will occur.  The former Yugoslavia, and primarily Bosnia, will be divided by  force of arms. One of the main postulates of the new European  politics over the last few decades will be finally breached,  maliciously and irrevocably -- the inadmissibility of changing  borders by force of arms. Bosnia will be carved up by Croatia  and Serbia, and the Muslims will get what they are given -- but  this will be a deeply unjust solution. To my great regret I can  say that the world will reconcile itself with this."</p>

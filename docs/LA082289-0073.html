			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The chancellor of North Carolina State resigned, the first official to step  down since allegations were raised against the school's basketball program in  the book, "Personal Fouls."  </P> <P> Bruce Poulton, who in the 1986-87 academic year intervened on behalf of three  Wolfpack players -- Charles Shackleford, Teviin Binns and Kelsey Weems -- to  keep them from failing, resigned after seven years as chancellor.  </P> <P> The resignation comes before the release of a six-month investigation into  Wolfpack athletics. University of North Carolina system president C.D. Spangler  will present the report Friday to the 32-member UNC Board of Governors, who  will decide whether to take action against basketball coach and athletic  director Jim Valvano, the focus of the book.  </P> <P> Robert Jones, chairman of the UNC Board of Governors, said it was his  understanding that Spangler had not asked for Poulton's resignation, but  confirmed that the charges raised in "Personal Fouls" have merit.  </P> <P> "A lot of what's been written is factual," Jones told the Winston-Salem  Journal. "They are more than allegations. There are a lot of things that have  not yet been written."  </P></p>

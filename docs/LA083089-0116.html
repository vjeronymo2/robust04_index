			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEWPORT BEACH;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS MOVE AHEAD ON PLANS FOR NEW LIBRARY  </P> <P> Newport Beach officials are moving ahead with plans to build a $7-million  central library just north of the proposed site of the new Newport Harbor Art  Museum.  </P> <P> The City Council voted unanimously Monday night to go ahead with the project.  The building is planned for completion sometime in 1992 and will replace the  existing central library at 856 San Clemente Drive.  </P> <P> LaDonna Kienitz, city librarian, said the 50,000-square-foot building will be  built on a four-acre site at MacArthur Boulevard and Coast Highway, just north  of the museum site. The present library has only 14,000 square feet, she said.  </P> <P> "Now, we have books on the floors at one of the branches," Kienitz said. "And  we've had complaints from patrons that there's no place to sit down." Kienitz  said the fund-raising arm of the library plans to raise an additional $1  million for construction to upgrade the facilities.  </P></p>

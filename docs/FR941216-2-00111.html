The Complaint in this case was brought under Section 107(a) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (``CERCLA''), 42 U.S.C. 9601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  against several parties who are owners or operators of a facility at which hazardous substances are being released into the environment, or who owned or operated facilities at a time when hazardous substances were disposed of there. The United States' Complaint sought recovery of costs incurred and to be incurred by the United States in connection with the clean up of hazardous substances at the Smuggler Mountain Superfund Site (``Site'') in and adjacent to the City of Aspen, Colorado.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed partial Consent Decree settles claims brought by the United States against the County under Section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), and provides the County a covenant not to sue for past and future response costs or response actions under Sections 106 and 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9606 and 9607(a), and Section 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6973 as well as a limited covenant for natural resource damages on Operable Unit 1 of the Site. In return, the County has adopted and, within its jurisdiction will enforce, institutional controls which are designed to minimize the potential for human exposure to hazardous substances at the Site. Further, the County will perform remediation at specific locations on site which will result in the removal or capping in place of contaminated soils. Finally, the decree resolves potential counterclaims by the County against the United States for any activities conducted on-Site by any instrumentality of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of Justice will receive, for a period of thirty (30) days from the date of this publication, comments relating to the proposed Partial Consent Decree.

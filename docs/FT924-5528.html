			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Nigeria's crisis PRESIDENT IBRAHIM Babangida has decided to ignore the well-known advice to anyone who finds himself in a hole: stop digging. Instead he chooses to pursue a flawed transition to civilian rule, while neglecting the economic reform programme he himself launched in 1986. President Babangida's decision last week to delay the handover to a civilian government by eight months is understandable, given the vote-rigging that marred the presidential primaries. But the problems at the heart of Nigeria's search for democracy are not that readily resolved; and in the meantime the country's debt crisis deepens. If delaying the handover also means ducking tough economic decisions, Nigeria's prospects are bleak indeed. The president set himself a Herculean task when he launched Nigeria's transition to civilian rule in 1986, given the country's tumultuous post-independence record. He made it no easier, however, by imposing his version of democracy, banning former politicians and office-holders from taking part in the transition, and proscribing the 13 new parties that emerged. In their stead he presented Nigerians with two parties, created by civil servants, their manifestos written by bureaucrats. Last week President Babangida continued to dictate his terms, banning the 23 presidential contestants from the new search for his successor. On the political front, the die may be cast. At best, Nigerians can hope for the installation next August of a weak administration. The new government's chances of survival will be poor; they will be even bleaker if President Babangida fails to act on the economy. The structural adjustment programme he launched in 1986 has buckled as corruption increased, election spending soared, and Nigeria's share of the costs of West African military intervention in Liberia rose. An IMF agreement lapsed last April, and service payments on Nigeria's Dollars 30bn external debt are unmanageable. Without urgent rescheduling, the economic crisis will deepen. President Babangida's opportunity to act comes on January 1, when he presents the 1993 budget. He must redouble efforts to put the reform programme back on track, spurred on by the IMF and Nigeria's creditors. Both sides should resist the temptation to delay action and pass responsibility on to the president's successors. Seizing the opportunity has its own perils; failure to do so would court disaster.</p>

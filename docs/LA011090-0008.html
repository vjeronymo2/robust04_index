			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA BOULEVARD TRAFFIC GETS RELIEF, BUT IT MAY NOT LAST  </P> <P> Traffic along the entire 17-mile length of Ventura Boulevard within the city of  Los Angeles should flow more smoothly with the recent start-up of a computer  system that controls the timing of traffic lights, a city transportation  official said Tuesday.  </P> <P> But the relief may only be temporary.  </P> <P> City Department of Transportation engineer John Fisher said all 82  intersections with traffic lights along the boulevard were put on the  computerized system on Dec. 29.  </P> <P> Similar systems operating elsewhere in the city have increased the number of  cars a street can carry by 7% while reducing traffic delays by as much as 20%,  Fisher said. "It results in a smoother flow of traffic in the aggregate," he  said.  </P> <P> Unfortunately for boulevard motorists, completion of the computerized traffic  signal project along Ventura Boulevard comes as Caltrans prepares to begin the  final phase of its widening of the Ventura Freeway. That traffic-snarling  project will force many motorists off the freeway and onto Ventura Boulevard,  erasing many of the traffic flow gains realized by the computerized system.  </P> <P> "Once lanes are closed on the freeway due to the widening project and commuters  get on the boulevard, some of the benefits of the computerized system will be  lost temporarily," Fisher said.  </P> <P> Fisher's comments came after he testified before the Los Angeles City Council's  Budget and Finance Committee about the transportation department's request for  interim funding to pay for the design of a computerized signal project for more  than 320 additional intersections in the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> The full system for the Valley, which is scheduled for completion in February,  1992, at a cost of $20.7 million, would cover all intersections from Victory  Boulevard on the north to Ventura Boulevard on the south and from Valley Circle  Boulevard on the west to Lankershim Boulevard on the east.  </P> <P> The computer system, which relies on video cameras and traffic sensors embedded  in the roadway to monitor traffic flow, is officially called the Automated  Traffic Surveillance and Control (ATSAC) project. Similar systems are in  operation in downtown Los Angeles and around the Coliseum.  </P> <P> The final, 51-intersection leg of the Ventura Boulevard phase of the project  was completed two days before a deadline urged by Assemblyman Richard Katz  (D-Sylmar). Katz wanted the ATSAC system installed along Ventura Boulevard  before the freeway-widening project began and had been critical in the past of  city efforts to complete the system.  </P></p>

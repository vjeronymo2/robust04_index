			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / OECD warns Italy on debt and deficit Italy's budget deficit and national debt remain 'extremely high', despite recent progress, the OECD warns in its annual country report. The report points out that the 1993 budget deficit was 9.7 per cent of GDP, while public debt was 114 per cent of GDP and likely to rise. It concludes that substantial fiscal adjustment is still required, while 'several years of sustained efforts' will be needed to meet EU convergence targets. The latest annual report on Italy recognises, however, that since 1992 both the Amato and Ciampi governments have begun to tackle the country's public finances. In particular, the 1993 budget was a landmark, the OECD says, as the first in which structural deficit-reducing measures were given weight, compared with the 'recurrent one-off relief steps taken in the past'. The authorities' 'impressive action' to address the public debt problem has been assisted by falling interest rates and a sharp rise in export competitiveness, thanks to the lira's devaluation and labour agreements limiting wage rises. The report forecasts exports will continue to expand, thanks to low nominal wage growth, enlarging the trade surplus to 3 per cent of GDP by 1995. The buoyancy of exports may suffice to keep real GDP in 1993 at the previous year's level, the weakest output performance in nearly 20 years. GDP is set to recover slightly this year, up by 1.7 per cent at the most optimistic, but the report envisages only a gradual recovery in 1995. Given the modest level at which activity is projected to pick-up, employment may remain 'virtually flat, causing the rate of unemployment to climb to 11.7 per cent in the second half of 1995', it says. 'Larger employment losses and greater job security could stimulate precautionary savings, delaying the revival of private consumption and gross fixed investment.' Against that background the OECD says Italy's international credibility depends on a good budgetary record, which will also allow risk premiums in interest rates to ease further. The successful execution of the government's privatisation programme is another key aspect of such credibility. The report contains a special chapter on privatisation, which is critical of the slow and complex decision-making process. By using unorthodox privatisation procedures, Italy risks losing out in the competition to attract equity funds, it says. The authorities have also failed to come up with regulatory reform of public utilities.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                    ITALIAN ECONOMIC INDICATORS  -------------------------------------------------------------------                                  1992    1993    1994     1995 GDP in market prices*             0.9    -0.1     1.7      2.3 Industrial production*           -0.6    -2.2     2.9      2.9 Unemployment rate                11.6    10.2    11.1     11.6 Budget deficit as a % of GDP     -9.5    -9.7    -8.7     -7.3  ------------------------------------------------------------------- *Percentage growth over previous period  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD projections  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

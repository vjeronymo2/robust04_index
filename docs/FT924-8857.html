			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / DTI to support exporters as part of recovery plans THE GOVERNMENT intends to give greater support to British exporters as part of its plans for economic recovery. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said yesterday he was sympathetic to helping industry more with export credits, adding that the Department of Trade and Industry would recruit 100 people from the private sector to help exports. He told BBC Television's On The Record that it was a government priority to enable industry to seize opportunities created by sterling's devaluation and that the new personnel would 'dramatically increase' the DTI support for the export drive. Mr Heseltine, however, declined to give further details ahead of Thursday's announcement by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of the Autumn Statement and a package of measures to aid recovery. The package, described by one official as a 'handful of measures', will be targeted at specific problems, including the housing market. A cut in bank base rates from 8 per cent is expected this week. A poll of City analysts by MMS International, the financial information company, found that 80 per cent expect Mr Lamont to cut rates by a full point 'around the time of the Autumn Statement'. The government is also due to announce help for industry, including an easing of Treasury restrictions on private sector investment in infrastructure. These moves will be balanced by a tough fiscal package. The cabinet has agreed to hold the public spending planning total within the limit of Pounds 244.5bn in 1993-94 and subject public sector pay to a tight squeeze. Pay review bodies for groups such as teachers and nurses will not be suspended but their work will, in effect, be overruled. The Treasury is also determined to keep MPs' pay increases in line with the strict controls to be imposed on the public sector. The Treasury now supports a more expansionary policy because of growing worries about recessionary tendencies around the world. However, officials fear that some more radical proposals - such as a 2 point cut in interest rates - would risk pushing sterling into a free fall with negative long-term consequences for the government's inflation battle. At the weekend, government officials expressed concern that expectations had become exaggerated ahead of the statement. They pointed out that the government had already presided over a substantial policy relaxation, with 2 points off base rates and a 13 per cent devaluation of sterling since Black Wednesday. The high public sector borrowing requirement - Pounds 18.4bn so far this year and expected to rise to well over Pounds 40bn in 1993-94 - is a further constraint. The rising borrowing requirement has encouraged suggestions that the government might raise revenues to plug the hole in its finances. The Treasury last night dismissed reports that the top level of employees' National Insurance contributions might rise to 10.4 per cent from 9 per cent as 'pure speculation'. The Autumn Statement is the occasion when National Insurance changes are announced, usually to take effect the following spring. While consideration may still be given this week to National Insurance in 1993-94 it is thought ministers would be unwilling to order an increase in the levy when the economy may just be emerging from recession. Officials stressed yesterday that Mr Lamont was committed to holding inflation in the 1-4 per cent band over the life of the parliament and providing a stable economic framework in which businesses can make decisions.

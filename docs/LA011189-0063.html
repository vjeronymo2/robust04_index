			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAN AM TO SELL CONTRACT SERVICES UNIT;  </P> <P> ANNOUNCEMENT FOLLOWS $115-MILLION PLANE DEAL WITH BRANIFF  </P> <P> Once-proud Pan Am Corp. said Tuesday that it is putting yet another of its  properties up for sale in an effort to raise cash to support its money-losing  airline operations.  </P> <P> The company announced that it wants to sell its contract services division, Pan  Am World Services. The proposed sale comes less than a week after the carrier  announced that it was selling to Braniff for $115 million the rights to an  order of 50 European-made A-320 twin-jet airliners. Pan Am now has a fleet of  141 airliners.  </P> <P> In the past decade, portions of Pan Am have been chipped away to raise cash. It  sold its valuable office building in mid-town New York in 1980. It disposed of  the Inter-Continental Hotel chain in 1981. In 1986, it sold to United Airlines  its airline routes in the Pacific for more than $700 million.  </P> <P> Pan Am World Services, which had revenue of $550 million in 1987 (the company  has not yet reported 1988 results) and pretax profit of $23 million, provides  management, housekeeping and technical services for government and commercial  aerospace projects.  </P> <P> For example, it provides various support services, including security,  engineering, firefighting and logistics, at the Kennedy Space Center in  Florida. It operates several airports, including the Westchester County Airport  outside of New York City and the 30th Street Heliport in mid-Manhattan. It  participates in the operation of some U.S. military bases and performs pilot  training for the armed forces.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Commitment to Growth  </P> <P> Pan Am would not say how much money it wants or expects to get for the  subsidiary. But observers said it is worth about $150 million. Once it is sold,  Pan Am Corp. will remain the owner only of Pan American World Airways, which  has lost money throughout the 1980s, its New York-Boston-Washington air  shuttle, which is making money, and a regional carrier, Pan Am Express,  formerly Ransome Airlines, which serves 11 cities in the southeastern United  States.  </P> <P> Thomas G. Plaskett, Pan Am's chairman, said the proceeds from the sale and  those from the recent deal with Braniff will be used "to strengthen Pan Am's  financial and competitive position through further investment in the airline."  These include, he said, commitments for $61 million for improvements to Pan  Am's terminal at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York; $25 million for  refurbishing the interiors of its airliners and $20 million for information  systems improvements, customer service programs and a series of other related  programs.  </P> <P> "In taking this action," Plaskett added, "the board has recognized the progress  that is being made at Pan Am and has demonstrated its commitment to the growth  of Pan Am by providing internal sources of capital that will strengthen the  carrier as it moves ahead with its recovery plan."  </P> <P> But Edward Starkman, airline analyst with the New York investment firm of Paine  Webber Inc., decried the move.  </P> <P> "This is just what Pan Am should not do," he said. "It should not sell  money-earning assets to fund the money-losing airline. This is not appealing to  stockholders."  </P></p>

			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / US phone groups in video victory US local telephone companies have won a court victory in their battle to be allowed to offer video services to their customers. The US appeals court in Washington has upheld a Federal Communications Commission policy permitting companies to offer 'video dial tone' services to their customers without paying a franchise fee to the local government, as cable TV systems must do. Unlike a cable system, where customers can receive only a fixed list of channels, a video dial tone system would allow any programmer to send its signal over the telephone line. Although not as futuristic as video on demand, where customers could dial up and ask for a specific film, video dial tone is not yet an operating service. But the FCC has approved several applications to be allowed to offer the service and Bell Atlantic, the east coast regional telephone company, is expected to have a service in operation soon. Local phone companies would be allowed to offer video dial tone services without obtaining a franchise in each community under some versions of the telecommunications legislation under discussion in Congress, so long as they were open to all programmers. But some industry officials doubt whether that legislation will be completed before Congress breaks up for the election campaign. The legislation would, in any case, require phone companies to wait for a year after enactment. Franchise fees paid to local government by cable companies typically amount to 5 per cent of revenue but can go higher. Telephone company officials said the appeals court's decision would remove a significant potential deterrent to investing in the new technology. The court decision said that the FCC was right in its determination that a telephone company providing video dial tone would not be engaged in the 'transmission of video programming' as defined in the Cable Act, but was instead acting as a common carrier, rather like the Post Office. Cable companies complained that the ruling would put them at a disadvantage, since they not only have to pay a franchise fee but also have to comply with regulatory requirements under the Cable Act.</p>

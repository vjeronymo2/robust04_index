			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EXPOS BATTLE BACK TO EDGE PIRATES IN 10TH  </P> <P> The Montreal Expos keep trying to make it a three-team race in the National  League East. The way the youngsters are improving, they might just do it.  </P> <P> Wednesday night at Montreal, after blowing an early lead and giving up three  runs in the top of the 10th to the division-leading Pittsburgh Pirates, it  appeared the Expos would drop seven games behind.  </P> <P> Undaunted, the Expos battled back to win, 8-7. In the 10th, Andres Galarraga  singled in one run and Marquis Grissom hit a three-run home run with one out.  The victory put the Expos five games behind the Pirates.  </P> <P> The Pirates had taken a 7-4 lead in the 10th when Jose Lind and Andy Van Slyke  had run-scoring singles and Sid Bream added a sacrifice fly. Rookie Bill Sampen  (8-2), who was on the mound when the Pirates scored the last two runs, wound up  the winner.  </P> <P> The Pirates scored four runs in the last three innings of regulation to lead,  4-3, until the bottom of the ninth when Grissom, 23, singled and scored the  tying run on a double by another inexperienced player, Junior Noboa, 25.  </P> <P> Grissom, 23, hit a home run when he was brought up late last season, but he had  almost 200 at-bats this season without hitting one.  </P> <P> One thing in favor of the Expos is that neither the Pirates, nor the New York  Mets, who are only half game out of first, act as if they are ready to take  charge of the race.  </P> <P> "I like the way my kids battle back," Expo Manager Bob Rodgers said. "With each  win in this manner, we get more experience. We think we belong in the race."  </P> <P> San Diego 2-10, Cincinnati 1-4 -- The Padres, after being in a slump for more  than a month, have finally found a team they can beat -- the team that is  leading the West.  </P> <P> By sweeping this doubleheader at San Diego, the Padres beat the Reds for the  third time in a row. It has been more than a month since the Padres won three  in a row.  </P> <P> Ed Whitson went 7 1/3 innings to win the opener. In the second game, winning  pitcher Calvin Schiraldi hit the second home run of his career.  </P> <P> New York 10, Philadelphia 9 -- Dave Magadan and Darryl Strawberry hit two-run  home runs at Philadelphia and Kevin McReynolds and Gregg Jefferies each added  two-run triples.  </P> <P> Although they had a 10-3 lead going into the bottom of the ninth, the Mets  almost blew it.  </P> <P> Before a batter was retired in the bottom of the ninth, the Phillies had seven  consecutive singles, cutting the lead to 10-8. Then, with runners on first and  third, the Mets brought in John Franco.  </P> <P> Franco walked John Kruk to load the bases. Lenny Dykstra then hit into a double  play, with one run scoring and the potential tying run reaching third. But  Tommy Herr, who opened the inning with a single, hit a liner that shortstop  Mario Diaz snared to end it.  </P> <P> St. Louis 9, Chicago 0 -- John Tudor, given an eight-run cushion in the first  inning, pitched a five-hitter at St. Louis for his first shutout in more than  two years. He improved his record to 9-3.  </P> <P> Vince Coleman, who had four hits and four steals Tuesday night, started the  Cardinals off with a single and his 53rd steal. Coleman singled again in the  inning to give him six hits in a row.  </P> <P> Houston 5, Atlanta 1 -- Danny Darwin held the Braves to five hits at Atlanta,  won his third start in a row and struck out 10 to earn the Astros' third road  victory in their last 26 games.

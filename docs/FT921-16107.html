			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Sharp rise in number of profit-related pay schemes THE NUMBER of companies with profit-related pay schemes rose to 1,277 in the first quarter of last year, representing 350,000 employees, government statistics show. Increases in personal equity plans (Peps) and tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) and trends in taxable benefits are among the other elements highlighted in the Inland Revenue's annual statistical compendium. The number of employees covered by profit-related pay schemes rose 90 per cent between March 1989 and March 1990 after the threshold for tax relief on profit-related pay was increased to Pounds 3,000 in the 1989 Budget. It grew 51 per cent in the 12 months to April 1991, just after the threshold was increased to Pounds 4,000. Tessas, the five-year accounts which were launched a year ago, contained Pounds 6,427m held in 2.47m accounts by the end of June last year. That represents an average deposit of Pounds 2,528 in each account against a maximum of Pounds 3,000 permissible during the first year of operation. About two thirds of both the number of Tessa accounts and the money the accounts contained were held with building societies, and the remainder were held in banks. Personal equity plans, which waive capital gains tax and income tax on dividends within certain limits for investors in UK shares, had been taken out by 1.47m individuals to a value of Pounds 3.88bn by the end of the 1990-91 tax year. The number of companies benefiting from the government's Business Expansion Scheme, introduced in 1983 to provide tax relief on new equity investment in unquoted UK companies, rose to 6,050 in 1989-90, representing Pounds 1.41bn. Mortgage interest relief cost the Exchequer Pounds 6.38bn at current prices in 1988-89 and is projected to rise to Pounds 7.7bn for 1990-91 on behalf of 9.4m claimants. Taxable benefits were Pounds 3.86bn for the 1988-89 tax year, which incurred liabilities of Pounds 1.21bn. Cars were the most common benefit, representing 1.75m people, followed by private medical insurance (970,000 people), fuel (950,000) and home telephones (420,000). The number of income-tax payers for the current year is estimated to be 25.1m, with 355,000 paying corporation tax, 165,000 paying capital gains tax and 30,000 paying inheritance tax. Total tax collected by the Revenue rose 7 per cent to Pounds 82.32bn in the 1990-91 fiscal year, representing 59 per cent of all central government tax revenue. Most of the remainder came from Customs and Excise. This is expected to rise by 12 per cent to Pounds 62.2bn in 1991-92, reducing the contribution of the Revenue to 56 per cent of all government tax revenue.

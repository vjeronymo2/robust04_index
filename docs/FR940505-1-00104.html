			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second approach would make manufacturers responsible for vehicle repairs in those cases where vehicle failure rates for a particular model in an enhanced I/M program exceed a threshold level (e.g., greater than 5 percent within the first 5 years). This approach (i.e., an I/M-based, selective recall program) also provides an incentive for vehicle manufacturers to increase the durability and reliability of their designs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third possible program involves adoption of a requirement that the on-board diagnostic system of new vehicles be capable of communicating, to on-road sensors, the operational status of the emission control system (i.e., whether a fault has been detected). This approach would allow for the immediate detection of high emitting vehicles so that they may be submitted for repair. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Programs for Medium Duty Vehicles. California's medium duty standards for 1995 and later model years apply to all vehicles between 6000 and 14,000 pounds Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR). Manufacturers have previously been able to certify medium duty vehicles over 8500 pounds under the less stringent heavy duty standards and procedures. California rules require further reductions to be phased in between the 1998 and 2003 model years, through a California medium duty LEV program. EPA proposes to accelerate the medium duty LEV program phase in and to require additional emission reductions. EPA is also requesting comment on including all 1999 and later model vehicles certified under California's medium duty LEV program (as modified by the FIP) in an enhanced in-use compliance program similar to that described for light duty vehicles. An option to certify engines used in these vehicles under the stringent heavy duty engine program described below is also available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Programs for Heavy Duty Vehicles. Currently, heavy duty engines for highway vehicles are certified to national emission standards; no waiver is in place for the State of California to enforce different standards for engines sold in the state. EPA proposes that, beginning with the 1999 model year, more stringent standards would apply for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and HC exhaust from heavy duty engines sold in California, and strict evaporative hydrocarbon requirements would also be applied to prevent a shift from diesel to gasoline fuel which could make reductions in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  easier but would result in higher HC emissions. As with light duty vehicles, the FIP proposes additional measures to enhance in-use compliance for the engines' full operational life, including as-received recall requirements. The FIP also proposes to include some pre-1999 model year heavy duty vehicles in the I/M program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the emission reductions from the heavy duty engines are very important to the attainment demonstration, it is also necessary to ensure that the fleet operated in California continues to experience normal turnover. The introduction of tighter standards can work against turnover, however, if heavy duty vehicle owners perceive that costs will rise or that new technology is risky. To ensure a normal turnover in heavy duty engines, the FIP proposes a declining average NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  level for operating fleets starting in the year 2000. The decline in average NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  will reflect the historical level of new engine purchases and old engine retirements.. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many trucks operating in California are also engaged in interstate commerce. California Air Resources Board (CARB) data show that about 20 percent of the mileage accumulated for heavy-duty vehicles in California is from trucks registered in other States. If new emission standards are adopted for California trucks, the interstate trucks would likely remain certified only to the less stringent federal standards, and their use in California could increase, preventing the new California standards from achieving their full potential for emission reduction. Tighter emission standards only on California registered trucks could impose a cost burden on California shipping firms that would not exist for shippers based outside of the state. EPA wants to avoid such a competitive disadvantage for trucking firms based in California since it could result in even more operation by out-of-state trucks, and is requesting comment on two options for a policy to deal with federally certified interstate trucks driving in California. These programs could be implemented together or separately. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, starting in 1999, EPA proposes that any time a federally certified truck (i.e., not meeting the FIP standards and not included in a California fleet averaging program) with multiple-state registrations operates in the state, it could make no more than one stop in either the South Coast, Ventura, or Sacramento FIP areas. Any pickup or delivery would be considered a stop. Also interstate trucks making a stop in one of the FIP areas would not be permitted to make more than two stops statewide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, starting in 2005, EPA is proposing to require all trucks which do not meet FIP standards operating in the state to be certified to the federal emission standards for 1998 and later model engines. Preventing earlier models from operating in California would greatly reduce the emission contribution from the interstate portion of the heavy duty fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Programs for Nonroad Vehicles and Engines. EPA has begun the process of setting national emission standards for a wide variety of nonroad sources including, but not limited to, small spark ignition engines used in lawn and garden and other utility equipment, recreational vehicle and marine engines, and heavy duty farm and construction equipment. In addition to these national standards, special California-only standards are proposed in the FIP for certain subcategories of engines and equipment: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Nonroad Heavy Duty Engines (engines at or above 50 horsepower, 37kW). Phase 1 of the FIP proposal incorporates the national program for control of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  from new nonroad heavy-duty engines which will be published in final rulemaking by May 1994. The FIP also proposes standards for HC, CO, particulates, and smoke. These standards are consistent with the nonroad equipment standards which have been adopted in California. The effect of Phase 1 is to extend the application of the California standards to farm and construction equipment which California is currently pre-empted from regulating. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New engine standards would be phased in on a national basis by engine size over four years beginning January 1996. The national standards apply to all compression ignition engines at or above 50 horsepower (37kW) except engines used in underground mining activity, aircraft, marine vessels, or to propel locomotives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Phase 2 of the FIP proposal for this equipment category contains a program to ensure that nonroad engines over 50 horsepower used in the FIP areas meet stringent NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and HC standards over their full useful lives. The program includes a combination of low NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and HC standards, very stringent ILEV evaporative requirements, and other elements of an enhanced in-use compliance program. Requirements are also proposed for engine rebuilds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Ventura and the South Coast, the FIP proposes the same numerical NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard for nonroad engines as is proposed for on-highway heavy duty engines. It proposes a less stringent standard for nonroad equipment used in the Sacramento area, because less NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reduction is needed for attainment.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

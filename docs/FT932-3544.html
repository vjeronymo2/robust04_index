			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / ITV options reach Brooke today THE GOVERNMENT will today be offered a range of options for relaxing the rules on ITV ownership. Mr Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, will meet the chairmen of the 14 regional ITV companies to hear whether there is a case for lifting the ban on the nine largest ITV companies taking each other over. The five largest companies are all expected to argue for a relaxation - something that will equally be opposed by middle-ranking broadcasters such as HTV and Anglia which do not want to be swallowed by their larger ITV rivals. Mr Leslie Hill, chairman of Central Independent Television, who has been campaigning for the freedom to create a smaller number of more substantial ITV companies, will present four alternatives. He will argue that one large company should be able either to own: ITV licences controlling up to 25 per cent of the ITV advertising market. Up to 25 per cent of the total television advertising market including Channel 4, breakfast and satellite. One other large company. Under a fourth alternative, Mr Hill believes there could be a redefining of what is considered a large company. He said yesterday: 'For a single channel to be run by a minimum of nine companies has got to be absurd.' Apart from unnecessary duplication he pointed to the 'pathetically long time' it took to get decisions in such a federal system. Mr Michael Green, chairman of Carlton Communications, will back up his campaign for a relaxation of rules with a Carlton paper arguing that Pounds 100m a year could be saved by ending unnecessary duplication in areas such as administration. HTV and Anglia, supported by Lord Hollick, chairman of Meridian Broadcasting, the south of England ITV company, will vehemently oppose any piecemeal change in the rules. They will argue that concentration of ownership in ITV will mean less regional diversity, less competition and less network production in the regions. The middle-ranking companies will also emphasise that no ITV company is about to fail - in spite of increased sums going to the Treasury - so that there is no need for immediate intervention. The fact that ITV is hopelessly split on the ownership issue will probably make it less likely that Mr Brooke will decide to change the provisions of the 1990 Broadcasting Act so soon after their implementation.</p>

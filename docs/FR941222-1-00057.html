			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information on the percentage of these wastewaters currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pretreated and discharged to a POTW, and on the percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated in a biological treatment system and discharged to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface water under the NPDES system is not included at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present time due to business confidentiality concerns. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed earlier under Section II.D, Description of Health and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Risk Assessments, the risk assessment for these wastewaters was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed using treatment in tanks and surface impoundments as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the baseline and plausible management practices, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that the three wastewater samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected from the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigments are representative of the industry, in part, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater samples were collected from the two largest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triarylmethane dye producers in the country. Furthermore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical analyses conducted on this waste encompassed the most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important raw materials used in the manufacture of triarylmethane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dyes and pigments, and these compounds were not detected at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations that pose a significant risk. For example, N,N-dimethylaniline is a large volume raw material used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and pigment, and was analyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrophotometry analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method. In addition to the GC/MS analysis, specific analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were conducted in order to look for two additional toxic raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials for triarylmethane dyes and pigments; chloranil and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another raw material that cannot be identified due to business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality concerns. As shown in Table II&hyph;8, N,N-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dimethylaniline and the other raw material that cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified were not found in these wastewaters at concentrations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that pose a significant risk, and chloranil was not detected at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all in the wastewaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Table II&hyph;8 presents eight constituents, obtained from three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater samples which were collected at three out of 14  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities that manufacture triarylmethane dyes or pigments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These eight compounds are the constituents that were found to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable to the triarylmethane processes, and six of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eight compounds were dropped following the risk assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> screening (see the Listing and Risk Assessment for Dye and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pigment Waste Listing Determination Background Documents for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, located in the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section) for the process used in identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable constituents and for the process used for dropping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds after risk screening, respectively). Because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds are not expected to bioaccumulate, the maximum measured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of those constituents with HBLs in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream were compared to their HBLs, and the ratio of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations to HBL values was less than 1, indicating that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of these compounds in the waste are not expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to pose a risk to human health or the environment. The two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining constituents, 4-nitroaniline and a constituent that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be identified at the present time due to confidentiality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns, were detected at low concentrations and do not have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HBLs needed to conduct a risk assessment. The risks posed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these two constituents, however, were assessed using surrogate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds. Neither of the compounds are expected to be potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carcinogens. Furthermore, the Agency selected surrogate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds that are structurally similar to the compounds detected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the waste, and are estimated, by means of structural activity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationships (SARs), to be more toxic than the subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds. Nitrobenzene was selected as a surrogate for 4-nitroaniline. Surrogate information on the second constituent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cannot be included at the present time due to business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality concerns. The ratios of concentration to HBL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (HQ) determined by this analysis were also less than 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating that, if the contaminant concentrations found in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste were actually present in drinking water, the risks posed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ingesting the drinking water would be insignificant. More  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detailed discussions on the risk assessment screening and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrogate compounds are presented in the Dye and Pigment Listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Support Health Effects Background Document, which is located in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the RCRA Docket for this rulemaking (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, because the constituents in this waste were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed at concentrations that present low risk levels, and no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other hazardous constituents attributed to triarylmethane dye or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigment production were detected, the Agency is proposing not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list wastewaters from the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigments as hazardous. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.Wastes from the production of triarylmethane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigments using aniline as a feedstock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently are produced at two domestic facilities. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities each produce a single product which is manufactured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughout the year using aniline as the major feedstock. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two processes are markedly different from other dye and pigment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes in the industry. Most dye and pigment processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture numerous products on a batch basis, using different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raw materials for each product. The wastes generated from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typical dye manufacturing plants vary in composition over time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to the constant changes in raw materials. In contrast,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triarylmethane pigments using aniline as a feedstock are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated at facilities that are dedicated to the manufacture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one product continuously throughout the year, and use only two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raw materials, aniline and formaldehyde, at the site. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, aniline is used in excess in the process. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differences have a significant impact on the compositions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste. Such wastes were expected, and found, to contain high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of aniline. The listing Background Document,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in the RCRA docket (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section) for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rulemaking, contains details on the process for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturing triarylmethane (TAM) pigments using aniline as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feedstock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

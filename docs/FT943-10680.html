			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The near month Footsie futures contract broke through three recent resistance levels to finish strongly as talk of a big buyer and prospects of economic recovery brought active buying, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the September futures contract on the FT-SE 100 started at 3,122. Rumours that there was a buyer of 1,000 lots in each of the leading European futures markets swept through the sector, driving the contract strongly ahead. The rally by the US dollar and the strong overnight performance on Wall Street were factors adding to the positive mood of the market, encouraging further buying. September powered ahead, breaking through several resistance levels to trade comfortably above 3,150. The contract stretched its premium to cash as the session progressed and dealers reported strong arbitrage activity. It closed at 3,183, up 75 from its previous close and around 22 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6 points. Volume was 18,983 lots. Turnover in trade options improved to 32,518 contracts from Monday's 27,320. FT-SE 100 option volume was 14,989 lots and 2,613 contracts were dealt in the Euro FT-SE option. Guinness was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,030 trades.</p>

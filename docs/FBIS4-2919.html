			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The Iraqi authorities  have no knowledge of the incident today in Northern Iraq  involving the crash of two military helicopters of foreign  forces there, an official spokesman said.    A statement by the spokesman to this effect was carried by  the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY.    The spokesman said the Iraqi Air Force was not engaged in  any  activity in the region at the time of the incident.    Two U.S. Army helicopters were shot down over the "no-fly  zone" in Northern Iraq today.    Earlier Western news reports said the helicopters were shot  down by Iraqi warplanes.    Later the United States confirmed that they were shot down  by  two American F-15 fighter jets. The U.S. helicopters had been  mistakenly identified as Iraqi aircraft operating in the "no-fly  zone."    It was reported that more than 20 "high-level" people on  board were killed.    The "no-fly zone" was created by the United States and its  allies in Northern Iraq shortly after the end of the 1991 Gulf  war and allied planes have since been patrolling the zone over  Northern Iraq allegedly to protect Kurds from government attacks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Zbigniew Romaszewski, chairman of the </F> Solidarity parliamentary caucus, by correspondent Barbara  Madajczyk-Krasowska; place and date not given]    [Text] [Madajczyk-Krasowska] What type of political  system is proposed in the "social" draft constitution?    [Romaszewski] A cabinet-cum-parliament system, with the  president discharging a control function and elected by general  vote. The president will have supervision over all control and  monitoring institutions--for example, the Supreme Chamber of  Control and the National Labor Inspectorate.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Will the president's range of  competence will be narrower than in the Small Constitution?    [Romaszewski] The current division of the executive power  generates conflict between the president and the government. In  our view, we cannot have a situation where the three most  important government departments are outside parliamentary  control. Moreover, this division also causes tensions within the  government and results in a decisions blockade.    We have a choice between two political systems. In the  first, which is in practice in the United States, the president  is responsible for the entire executive administration, but even  there parliament has a very wide range of powers relative to  control of the executive administration, including the power to  recall the president. In the second system, the prime minister  is responsible for the whole executive sector. It is very  difficult to achieve a cross between these two systems, so we  decided to entrust the executive powers to the prime minister,  who answers to parliament.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] In this situation, is there any point  in electing the president in a general ballot?    [Romaszewski] That has, in its way, become a tradition now.  Moreover, it is important that the president's authority is  reinforced by the system whereby he is elected in a general  ballot.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Will it be a constitution according to  the model put forward by the Solidarity trade union?    [Romaszewski] No. It will be a constitution focused broadly  on the questions of human rights, civil rights, and civil  freedoms, in which emphasis will be placed on employees' rights.  It will contain a provision introducing a novel  institution--that is, a Tripartite Commission--which will  include representatives of employers, employees, and the  government. The commission will be responsible for such matters  as, for example, the setting of the minimum wage.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] The project accords an important  position to the Senate, does it not?    [Romaszewski] There are only two options here: Either the  Senate goes or it stays. In its present shape, the Senate is  superfluous because all it does is repeat the Sejm's work.  Because we decided to retain the institution of the Senate, we  recommend that an unambiguous formula be found for its function.  The Senate should provide a representation for local  administration. Its members should be elected according to the  electoral law currently in force, which gives equal rights to  such voivodships as Suwalki, Slupsk, and Chelm, each of which  elects two senators. This is most important because this gives  the so-called Poland-B [undeveloped, rural, poorer regions] an  equal chance to be represented. The Sejm, which is elected  according to the proportional representation principle, is  dominated by the large urban centers.    We believe that Polish parliamentary life suffers from the  disease of politicizing and partisanship. Accordingly, we  suggest that the Senate be placed outside political games and  strategies. That is why we want to make senators' seats  independent of their party allegiance. It will mean that all  senatorial candidates belonging to a particular party should,  once elected, suspend their party allegiance. Thus, political  party caucuses should cease to operate within the Senate. There  would be no direct equivalent in the Senate of the parliamentary  party clubs that operate in the Sejm. The Senate as a  parliamentary chamber would gather together genuine political  authorities rather than representatives of political parties.  The legislative initiative would rest with individual senators  rather than with the Senate as a whole. At the moment, the  Senate's legislative initiative is practically nonoperative.    The Senate would also appoint special commissions to  investigate individual cases.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Are you thinking here of special  investigative commissions appointed to examine malpractice  allegations against the government?    [Romaszewski] Yes. If such a commission is set up within  the Sejm, in which the government has the majority of votes, its  work will always be illusory. If we place such structures  within the Senate, we stand a better chance of obtaining  positive results. We are very much interested in separating the  Senate from the executive apparatus and from personal  competition over ministerial posts. The Senate should occupy  itself mainly with legislative work and with discharging a  special kind of control function.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] You want to write a range of citizens'  social welfare entitlements into the future constitution, but we  know that, for example, the right to free medical treatment is  in practice largely fictitious.    [Romaszewski] We have been very careful in this respect and  tried to formulate these provisions so that they would not lend  themselves to becoming empty phrases, to ensure that the  constitution is indeed the fundamental legal act. We have  included no unrealistic provisions with which people would be at  a loss as to how to apply them. We tried to follow the line of  making certain regulations more precise--especially those  concerning health and family protection laws.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Certain critics of your model of the  constitution accuse it of excessive right-wing orientation.    [Romaszewski] This does not mean a thing. After all, it  would be hard to find right-wing leanings in a document that  provides so extensively for union rights.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] But the preamble is formulated in a  most grandiloquent style.    [Romaszewski] It is modeled on the preamble to the 3 May  [1791] Constitution.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] And it does mention Christian values.    [Romaszewski] I believe that our proposed solutions in the  sphere of state-church relations are not controversial. We  assume autonomy for all religious denominations. Moreover,  relations between the state and the Catholic Church are  regulated by the Concordat.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Why do you insist on suggesting in the  constitution that two-thirds of the parliament's composition be  elected by a majority vote? Do you want to get rid of  parliamentary party caucuses?    [Romaszewski] It is most important to include the  declaration on electoral law in the constitution because  parliament will never do that itself. Our political parties are  rather small, and their members move in their exclusive circles.  Unless we introduce the majority-rule electoral law, they will  never gain strength and will not broaden their membership to  include wide reaches of people not immediately interested in  gaining positions in the power apparatus. The leaders will  always formulate the type of electoral law that will seem to  bring the most advantages to the parties themselves and to no  one else.    We are in favor of keeping political parties going, but we  also suggest that deputies be selected according to a mixed-type  electoral law, weighted in favor of offering a larger proportion  to the majority vote. Sejm deputies and senators would then be  elected in their wards according to the majority-vote electoral  law. In other words, those who gain the largest number of votes  will win the seat. There would also be an additional, national  candidates' list. Seats won on that list would be shared  proportionately by the political parties, depending on the  number of seats won in individual election wards. In this way,  the political parties would be forced to put up their best  candidates in their wards, even if the candidates themselves  came from outside the wards, because the number of seats to be  won by them from the national list would depend on the number of  votes obtained by these candidates. This type of electoral law  would create a genuine social representation in parliament  instead of bringing into parliament people interested only in  acquiring and wielding power. The current proportional electoral  Sejm law in force, which gives priority to political parties,  only discourages people from taking part in parliamentary  elections.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Why is it to our advantage to  endorse and support the draft constitution proposed by  Solidarity?    [Romaszewski] Because it offers a comprehensive project of  the fundamental law, reinforces unequivocally democratic values,  and arises from Solidarity and post-Solidarity circles.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Let us assume that some 500,000 people  sign a petition in favor of the proposed draft constitution.  Will the present parliament consider it then?    [Romaszewski] If the parliamentary commission fails to  consider a draft proposal that has obtained 500,000 or more  signatures, it should consider the possibility that any serious  departures from the version proposed in that draft may cause a  rejection of its own draft constitution in a national  referendum. On the other hand, if it chooses to be directed by  political realism, it will accept our proposal as the basic  material for the formulation of the constitution.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] So your proposal of your alternative  draft constitution is not a kind of "art for art's sake" move?    [Romaszewski] No, it is not. The draft constitution  proposed by post-Solidarity circles is most important for the  country in a situation where parliament is dominated by  postcommunist forces.    [Madajczyk-Krasowska] Thank you for talking with us.</p>

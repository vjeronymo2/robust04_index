			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Havas expects return to growth Havas, the French media and leisure group recently embroiled in the battle for control of the Canal-Plus television company, hopes this year to return to profits growth after sustaining a fall during 1993, according to Mr Pierre Dauzier, chairman. The group, in the throes of reshuffling its shareholder structure, was affected last year by the economic recession and net profits fell 14 per cent to FFr708m (Dollars 121.44m) from FFr823m in the previous year. However, Mr Dauzier told an analysts' meeting in Paris that Havas expects this year to be able to maintain stable profits on a strictly comparable basis and to achieve an increase in total profits through disposals and the benefits of strategic agreements. He said the group might be able to achieve a higher increase in profits during 1994 if its markets improved. Havas is reshuffling its shareholding. Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, its partner in CLT, the Luxembourg-based broadcasting group, recently acquired a 3.59 per cent stake. Mr Dauzier also signalled that Generale des Eaux, the French utilities group, might increase its recently acquired 2.5 per cent stake in Havas.</p>

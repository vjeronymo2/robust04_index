			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Difficult first year for Traub and Heckert - The union of two German machine-tool makers was never going to be easy Nobody said the marriage between two German machine-tool manufacturers would be easy. Not only had it taken place against the background of one of the worst recessions in recent years - late last month Deckel Maho, another machine-tool group, filed for protection from its creditors. But the marriage involved Traub, the west German tool-turning manufacturer in Stuttgart, and Heckert, the east German tool-milling enterprise in Chemnitz, once the heart of Germany's machine-tool industry before the second world war. When the two enterprises joined forces last September, both companies had undergone radical restructuring programmes. Traub, saddled with losses the previous year of DM47.9m (Dollars 28.75m) and a turnover which had fallen 8 per cent to DM270m, had cut its workforce from 1,800 to 1,000. 'Our labour costs were too high. The only way we could save money and become more efficient was through shedding jobs,' said Mr Theodor Zimmer, a board member of Traub. 'We are slowly coming out of the tunnel,' he said. Pressure from its banks also forced the company to adopt a leaner and tougher strategy. Last year, they agreed on a financial package aimed at reducing Traub's debt by DM80m, while the family-owned company would increase its share capital in 1993 by DM10m to DM47m. 'The business culture is changing. You can no longer rely on producing and expect orders to follow. You have to work harder to find your markets and keep costs down at the same time,' said Mr Manfred Hekeler, head of marketing. As part of the restructuring plan, Traub wanted to complement the turning-machine division with a milling-tool production unit. Heckert seemed to fit the bill. But the Chemnitz enterprise was also in trouble. For some time, the Treuhand privatisation agency, which in 1991 had taken over the giant Kombinate, or state-owned enterprise, had been searching for a buyer of a plant which since 1951 had had a monopoly in supplying the east European and Russian markets. Then called the Fritz-Heckert-Werk, it had employed 27,000 people spread over 17 workshops, and had been producing 2,500 milling-tool units a year with production running around the clock. It was east Germany's flagship. But the ship could hardly sail once these markets collapsed after the introduction of German monetary union. The Kombinate was broken up. The 4,300 workers in the milling-tool section was reduced by a tenth to 430, while the Treuhand pumped money in, picking up losses, environmental liabilities and redundancy costs totalling DM100m. Like Traub, it was now lean. All it required was a new owner. 'We had been looking for a company like Heckert for some time,' said Mr Zimmer. 'We wanted to have turning and milling under one roof, without any overlap.' With the acquisition of Heckert, along with that of Hermle, which manufactures milling machines for use in mould-making and small series production, Traub's new strategy was in place. 'We now have an attractive site for production purposes and sales activities,' explained Mr Zimmer. But the marriage has had difficulties. Mr Wolfgang Sittig, the manager at Heckert, says one of the greatest problems facing the Chemnitz plant is finding ways to finance sales to the former Soviet Union which continues to have a huge demand for Heckert's products. 'Because of (Russia's) financial problems, we have to finance the whole production until we receive payment on delivery. Our problem is not cash flow. It is revenue,' he explained, adding that he either depends on Hermes, Germany's export guarantee mechanism, or on counter-trade. 'The point is that we cannot throw away the markets in eastern Europe or Russia. They will have purchasing power sooner or later. This firm has built up contacts over the years and we want to maintain them.' More than 35 per cent of Heckert's turnover, which last year amounted to DM70m, is backed by Hermes. The remaining sales are now targeted at western markets. Losses, which last year totalled DM17m, are expected to stabilise, while turnover this year will reach DM97m. Inevitably, there will be a time lag before Heckert can reap the benefits of Traub's capital investments of DM60m. Since Traub acquired five of the 11 manufacturing halls last September, three have been completely modernised. 'Heckert's union with Traub has many advantages. Heckert gains management know-how and can ride on the back of Traub's worldwide marketing network,' said Mr Sittig. Exports account for 35 per cent of Traub's turnover. In return, Traub gains more production and capacity space, potential markets in the east and - for the moment - lower wage costs. However, the workers in Stuttgart, still reeling from the affects of the redundancies, show little solidarity with their east German brothers. 'We are afraid of internal competition,' said Mr Manfred Suss, 50, a member of the workers' council. 'How can we be sure that Traub will not shift some of the production from Stuttgart to Chemnitz, especially since the wages over there are about 30 per cent lower than over here?' The workers at Heckert, who regard themselves as fortunate to have a job, are not surprised about such views. 'We know the Stuttgart people are a bit worried,' said Mr Dieter Kupsca, a 40-year-old engineer. 'But through working for this western firm we just have to be flexible. The old days of sticking to the monthly production plan are over. We have to respond quickly to new orders and a new way of doing things.' The marriage between the workers' councils in Stuttgart and Chemnitz may take time to consummate. But for Messrs Zimmer and Sittig, the union of two of Germany's machine-tool manufacturers, forged after difficult restructuring programmes, may help both ride out the recession and emerge stronger when it is over.</p>

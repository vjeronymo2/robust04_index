			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Observer: Prescott's man Further evidence that John Prescott will be fighting an uphill battle if he decides to challenge Tony Blair for the Labour leadership. Richard Caborn - prominent Prescott aide and a likely choice as campaign manager - is planning to spend the second week of the race in South Africa in his role as chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee. Nice to see pleasure coming before duty for a change.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the State Duma, expressed  his hope that the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly, the  Federation Council, will confirm the federal budget for 1994 if  it receives comprehensive information about the changes  introduced into its initial version.    During his conversation with journalists Thursday he  reminded  that while working over the draft the State Duma and the  government found an internal reserve in the budget totaling 8.5  trillion rubles. The funds have been primarily channeled to  support the Army (3.5 trillion rubles) -- for the construction  of houses for servicemen and for conversion. Rybkin underlined  that this article is viewed as "a protected one", that is, it  will not depend upon the level of revenues collection.    The amount intended to finance the transfer of social  facilities from the budget of enterprises to the budget of RF  [Russian Federation] constituent members has been doubled.  Rybkin noted that they had found an opportunity to increase  financial support for science and education.    He also reminded that the State Duma passed a decision to  create a special supra-budget fund into which additional incomes  from privatization will be forwarded (from July 1 privatization  will be done with money as opposed to cheques). The government  foresaw that a total of 1.2 trillion rubles received from  privatization would be channeled into the budget, meanwhile  experts of the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy estimate  that this sum should be no less than 15 trillion rubles. All  money from this supra-budget fund will be forwarded to build  houses for servicemen, Rybkin stressed.    "If the Federation Council has this information at its  disposal and if they want to participate in the law-making  process then the success will be ensured," believes Rybkin. "The  nation has no more money than there is in the country in  reality, one should cut one's coat according to one's cloth,"  Rybkin said.    He expressed the supposition that "someone wants to destruct  [as received] the budget in order to spend when and how much he  wants, including both the currency incomes and foreign economic  activity." At times, according to his estimate, "somebody  skillfully exploits the dissatisfaction of the deputies" and  this is "disgraceful politicizing," he believes.    At the same time Ivan Rybkin has no doubts that the State  Duma will vote for the draft budget in its third reading which  will probably take place in a week. This will be a formal  voting, he said, because the third reading implies only  juridical clarification of the law's wording.</p>

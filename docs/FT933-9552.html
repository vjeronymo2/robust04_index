			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Holvis Holzstoff Holvis Holzstoff, the Swiss non-wovens group, said net profits in the first half rose 6.8 per cent to SFr19.6m on sales up 7.7 per cent to SFr393.9m, 'in spite of unfriendly economic circumstances'. The group, in which the British Rail Pension Fund has a 15 per cent stake, forecast that net income in the full year would be between SFr31m and SFr33m, broadly unchanged from last year's SFr32.7m. Last year's figure was flattered by a SFr9m extraordinary gain on a property sale, and this year the group has already made a SFr7.5m book profit on the sale of Italian subsidiaries. Holvis warned it was examining the technical state of its production equipment. However, possible valuation adjustments 'should be covered through available provisions for restructuring', it said.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Company News: Macquarie Bank turns in 17% rise with equities division boost Macquarie Bank, the Sydney-based institution in which Hill Samuel holds a minority stake, yesterday reported profits after tax of ADollars 31.2m (USDollars 20.6m) in the six months to end-September, a 17.4 per cent improvement over the same period of 1992. Mr Allan Moss, managing director, said the performance of all the group's main activities had been 'above budget'. Macquarie does not break down results by division, but the bank added that about one-third of group earnings came from fees, a similar amount from trading activities, and the final third from interest margins. The bank, whose structure is closer to that of an investment bank, said that its equities division had a particularly buoyant first half, 'well exceeding' the same six months in 1992. Macquarie Equities claimed the number one position in terms of market share on the Australian Stock Exchange in September and October, and the group's underwriting business also benefited from the surge in new issues. Non-accrual loans were ADollars 44m or 2.6 per cent of loan assets, compared to ADollars 28.1m, while net losses on bad and doubtful loans totalled just ADollars 0.58m, compared to ADollars 1.03m. Total assets at the half-year were ADollars 3.67bn, up by 15.9 per cent and the total capital adequacy ratio was 12.94 per cent. St George Bank, an Australian regional bank, yesterday reported an operating profit of ADollars 82.8m (USDollars 54.7m) after tax and abnormal or unusual items for the 16 months to September 30, AP-DJ reports from Sydney. St George said it would pay a dividend of 20 cents a share for the six months to end-September, making a total of 50 cents for the 16 months.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Bangemann pours scorn on TV quotas EU attempts to limit further the amount of non-European films and programmes European broadcasters are allowed to screen would damage the industry, Mr Martin Bangemann, the commissioner responsible, said yesterday. It would not even be the best way to protect European culture. The existing approach of imposing quotas on EU-based television channels to protect the audiovisual industry, as well as European languages and culture, from a Hollywood onslaught was misguided, he said. 'I am totally in favour of creating the right conditions for programme-makers at a European level, but that cannot be done by restricting their economic activities. . . . I believe we should try to support a policy which separates economic and technological aspects from cultural aspects.' However, it is understood that Mr Bangemann will not be present to defend his position when commissioners meet next Wednesday to discuss tightening broadcasting legislation. He may therefore ask for the discussion to be postponed. The 1989 Television without Frontiers directive requires 51 per cent of material shown to be of European origin, and 10 per cent to be set aside for independent European producers  - requirements that have infuriated foreign producers, particularly in Hollywood. However, the quotas only apply 'where practicable', a loop-hole that Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, outgoing audiovisual commissioner, proposes to plug. Further, he wants to extend restrictions to new screen-based services such as tele-shopping and video-on-demand. This would have the effect of banning advertising on shopping channels and restricting American content on interactive TV. Mr de Deus Pinheiro  - backed strongly by the French - is extremely eager to secure support from the rest of the Commission by the end of the year. However, Mr Manuel Oreja, who takes over responsibility for audiovisual policy, next year does not want to be lumbered with what he sees as controversial and impractical revisions. Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, is also opposed, believing any moves to tighten quotas would send a bad political signal to EU trading partners. Mr Bangemann yesterday stressed there was still a case for protecting European culture. 'It is not right, or even fair that the Americans are always attacking the Europeans for being protectionist in this field,' he said. 'In the US, if you want to own more than 25 per cent of a radio station you have to be American. That is not the case over here.'</p>

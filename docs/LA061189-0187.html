			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVE DISTEL: SOCKERS HAVE NEW FACES, NEW SCENARIO, SAME RESULTS  </P> <P> Those teases. That had to be what the Sockers had been doing. Teasing.  </P> <P> They had their fans in a funk and the Baltimore Blast fans on fire. They had  been playing so poorly, looking so flat, looking so lifeless.  </P> <P> And all of this at the worst of times, all of this needing only one more win to  take their seventh indoor soccer championship.  </P> <P> Did the Sockers really have a chance to win Game 7 of the Major Indoor Soccer  League's championship series Saturday night in Baltimore?  </P> <P> Are you kidding?  </P> <P> No one who watched them lose Tuesday night at home and then suffer that 7-0  embarrassment Thursday night here would have given them a ghost of a chance.  Mr. Ed would win the Belmont before these guys would win Saturday night.  </P> <P> It turns out the Sockers had been kidding. They had to be.  </P> <P> What happened Saturday night was that the Blast got hit by a giant dose of  reality. The Blast got hit by the real San Diego Sockers. The Blast scared the  Sockers out of their wits, but came up short in what was probably the most  electric game the Sockers have ever played.  </P> <P> The final score was 6-5.  </P> <P> Goodby, Blast.  </P> <P> Hello, seventh Socker championship.  </P> <P> And No. 7 was heaven, because it had seemed so unlikely.  </P> <P> "We win at home and we win on the road," said Kevin Crow, a veteran defender at  all of 27. "We win coming back and we win sweeping."  </P> <P> And that they won this one at all was . . .  </P> <P> "Unbelievable," said Waad Hirmez, whose fourth-period goal was the game-winner.  "It's amazing how we did it."  </P> <P> And, for the Blast, it all seemed to happen so swiftly. The score was 1-1 late  in the first half and 11,220 fans were waiting anxiously for the hometown  heroes to break it open and kick the celebration into gear.  </P> <P> Then it happened.  </P> <P> Blast goalkeeper Scott Manning's hand ball outside the box gave the Sockers a  penalty kick, and Branko Segota scored with 3:13 left to break the tie.  </P> <P> Early in the second half, the Sockers went from tiebreakers to heartbreakers.  First Segota scored and then Brian Quinn and then Steve Zungul, all in the  first 2:33 of the second half.  </P> <P> Suddenly, the Sockers, left for dead Thursday night, were up, 5-1.  </P> <P> "We wanted to stay tight in the first half," said Hirmez, "and then come out  fired up and win the first seven minutes of the third quarter.  </P> <P> The Sockers won those first seven minutes in the biggest of ways, playing  vintage Socker soccer. They blocked and counter-punched and threw attackers in  waves at the out-manned Manning.  </P> <P> When Hirmez banged a goal home 33 seconds into the fourth quarter, it had the  makings of a rout. Little could anyone image that this insurance policy would  ever be cashed in.  </P> <P> When Blast Coach Kenny Cooper installed David Byrne as a sixth attacker with  12:50 to play, it smacked of desperation . . . albeit very understandable  desperation.  </P> <P> Even then, no one imagined the score would be 6-5 with the longest 4 minutes 28  seconds the Sockers have ever experienced ahead of them.  </P> <P> Goal keeper Victor Manuel Cabral DeBarros Nogueira, perhaps the only man in  professional sports with all five vowels in his last name, had the hottest seat  in the house for that frantic, frenzied final 4:28.  </P> <P> "We were getting pretty scared," said Nogueira. "They were scoring like crazy."  </P> <P> Not quite crazy enough. The Sockers held on and V.M.C.D.N. added three more  initials -- MVP.  </P> <P> "It's kinda weird," said Nogueira, an indoor veteran but a champion for the  first time. "The San Diego Sockers are always champions. There are different  players every year, and I'm just another different player."  </P> <P> New faces abounded in the champagne-soaked locker room. Paul Wright, the  20-year-old kid from Grossmont High School, was the smiling face who had the  winning assist. Chris Chueden was new. Ralph Black was new. Cacho was new. Alan  Willey was new. None of them had won championships before, because none had  been Sockers before.  </P> <P> "Everyone wrote us off at the beginning of the season," said Crow. "We lost a  lot of players for financial reasons and some people weren't sure we kept the  right players. This team can win with anybody."  </P> <P> One constant, of course, is that Ron Newman is the coach. He has been part of  each of these celebrations, and a very big reason why they keep happening.  </P> <P> "It's a miracle," he said, "continuing to win like we have."  </P> <P> This one may have been the biggest miracle at all. This team was dead and all  but buried. No one believed in them but themselves.  </P> <P> But then, who else could have known that they were just being teases . . .  right to the end.  </P></p>

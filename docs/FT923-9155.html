			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Hungarian plant closes as alumina deal falls through A FAILURE to reach an agreement with Russian alumina importers has triggered the closure of a Hungarian alumina factory with an annual capacity of 180,000 tonnes, reports Reuter from Budapest. Alumina, or aluminium oxide, is the intermediate material refined from bauxite ore for smelting into aluminium. 'The closure is a decided fact. We stopped feeding the works with bauxite on Monday,' said a factory official. The factory, called Ajka-I, will come to a standstill by September 30, costing 700 of the 2,400 workers their jobs, the official said. The Ajka-II plant, with an annual capacity of 300,000 tonnes, will continue its production. A dispute over prices wrecked a planned barter deal between Hungary's HungAluker and Russia's Raznoimport last month. In a traditional alumina-for-aluminium barter, Hungary has exported 600,000 tonnes of alumina annually to the Soviet Union in exchange for aluminium. It planned to import up to 120,000 tonnes of aluminium this year. But rising costs of electricity and steam energy made Hungarian alumina prices high compared with Australian competition. Australian alumina was Dollars 20 to Dollars 30 a tonne cheaper than Hungarian, HungAluker's general manager Mr Ferenc Windisch told the economic weekly Napi last week, although Russian ports were not technically capable of receiving shipments from Australia, he added. However, Mr Windisch said only plans of a barter deal were wrecked. The two sides still hoped to reach a cash deal. The equipment at Ajka-I will be mothballed, ready to restart production if necessary, the plant official said. '(But) knowing the Russian market, I don't think production will start again. It stopped for good.</p>

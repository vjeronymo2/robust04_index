			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / International Company News: Regulators move in at US insurer INSURANCE regulators in New York State yesterday took control of Executive Life of New York, the smaller of the two main operating units of First Executive, the troubled Los Angeles-based life insurer. The action by the New York Insurance Department followed a similar seizure by the Californian regulators of Executive Life, First Executive's larger operating unit last week. First Executive is the biggest insurance company debacle the US has ever encountered. Overall, the California-based company was reckoned to have almost Dollars 50bn worth of insurance in force at the end of 1990, and hundreds of thousands of policyholders. The smaller New York unit alone has some 103,000 policyholders and certificate-holders, and reported earned premiums of Dollars 94m last year. Publicity about First Executive's enormous 'junk bond' portfolio - it is believed to be the largest holder of junk after the Resolution Trust Corporation - in the wake of the Drexel Burnham Lambert bankruptcy a year ago, lead to a wave of policy surrenders at the company. The insurer's problems were compounded when its sales network disintegrated. Action by the New York regulators against the Executive Life New York unit was widely expected. The insurance department said last week it was completing a study of the unit's financial condition, and expected to make a decision on the operation's immediate future earlier this week. Earlier this month, as worries about First Executive's financial condition mounted, the New York department told Executive Life to stop writing new business and to bolster its reserves by Dollars 125m. Yesterday's move against the unit involved the insurance department petitioning the New York State Supreme Court for the authority to take possession of the insurer and directly oversee its operations. While the court considers a permanent order, it issued a temporary restraining order, placing the company under the authority and control of Mr Salvatore Curiale, the New York superintendent of insurance. The New York regulators immediately suspended all policy surrenders and policy loans at Executive Life New York. They stressed that the unit was not insolvent, but said they were worried that speculation about the company's future might lead to a 'severe cash-flow strain and dissipation of the company's assets'. Surrenders have risen from 25 a day a few weeks ago, to over 400 a day. The regulators' aim is to 'rehabilitate' the unit. Mr Curiale said yesterday a group of New York companies, headed by Metropolitan Life, the second largest US insurer, had stepped forward to help manage the company and advise the department. However, none of these companies have offered to buy Executive Life New York outright.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: ECC/Camas While English China Clays' decision to demerge its aggregates division makes strategic sense, the timing now looks less inspired. The building materials sector has under-performed the stock market by 20 per cent since the peak in mid-March. While it was never the intention to raise additional capital through demerger, Camas might have wished for more auspicious circumstances in which to make its debut as an independent company. Profit-taking rather than a sober reappraisal of the growth prospects seems to be to blame for the sector's slide. Earnings forecasts have not in general been lowered. But aggregates companies never promised an immediate profits recovery. While building products prices will probably rise in the UK this year, volumes remain weak due to restrained public spending. Camas is especially vulnerable to any cuts in the government's roads programme. Its US aggregates business is also earning decent margins already, which might lessen the recovery prospects. These factors argue for caution in valuing the shares. A share price of around 80p would give a yield of 5.8 per cent on the promised 3.75p dividend. Bardon, the closest in the sector in terms of business mix, yields a shade more but has a weaker balance sheet. Such a share price is doubtless lower than Camas hoped for a few weeks ago. Even so, a market capitalisation of around Pounds 250m would be better value for ECC shareholders than could have been realised through a trade sale.</p>

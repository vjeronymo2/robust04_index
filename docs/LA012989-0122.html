			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AMBULANCES DIVERTED;  </P> <P> CRISIS SHUTS EMERGENCY ROOM DOORS  </P> <P> The scramble to provide care for the seriously ill in the San Fernando and  Santa Clarita valleys has escalated recently as more area hospitals have  routinely closed their emergency rooms and trauma centers to ambulances.  </P> <P> Several of the Valley's largest hospitals have been shutting their emergency  rooms to paramedic runs this month. And Wednesday, the Valley's three trauma  centers shut down -- an almost unheard-of occurrence, health officials said.  </P> <P> The emergency room at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita has  been closed for most of the past two weeks. The emergency facilities at St.  Joseph Medical Center in Burbank have been diverting ambulances for at least 24  days. In December, the availability of the emergency room at AMI Tarzana  Regional Medical Center was touch-and-go for 19 days, according to county  records.  </P> <P> "We keep our fingers crossed nobody gets badly hurt when we are in the state of  maximum stress and overload. That is not an uncommon scenario, unfortunately,"  said Dr. John McConnellogue, emergency department director at Northridge  Hospital Medical Center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No One Has Died Yet  </P> <P> Hospital officials emphasize that even when several emergency rooms are closed,  patients in the Valley are still reaching hospitals within 10 or 15 minutes. No  one has died in an ambulance as a result of the extra time it takes to reach a  hospital, paramedic officials said. In a crunch, helicopters can whisk a  patient across town when the closest hospitals are full.  </P> <P> And even when an emergency room technically is closed, it is always open to  walk-in patients. Anyone who passes through an emergency room's sliding glass  doors, whether for a broken leg, the flu or a heart attack, will not be turned  away.  </P> <P> Local hospital administrators blame the problem primarily on the flu epidemic,  a nursing shortage and timing -- January is traditionally a busy time for many  hospitals. When a hospital's intensive-care beds upstairs are filled, it does  not want to accept additional critically ill patients down in its emergency  room. Consequently, an emergency room can sometimes look like a ghost town and  still be closed to new patients.  </P> <P> One Los Angeles County health official speculated last week that some Valley  hospitals are closing more frequently to send a tough message to Gov. George  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> "It makes me wonder whether there is some sort of concerted effort to make a  point, to raise the level of awareness that the hospitals want more money from  the governor and to start putting money into the failing system," the official  said, asking not to be named because he must maintain a good relationship with  the hospitals.  </P> <P> The crunch in emergency care has frustrated and angered paramedics. On  occasion, it has also overwhelmed emergency room personnel when the closures  are overruled by county health officials downtown. There is a built-in  safeguard to ensure that medical emergency care is always available: When all  the hospital emergency rooms in an area have declared themselves closed, county  health officials have the authority to reopen them all.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not the Best of Care'  </P> <P> During those times, "it's not the best of care when you have numerous critical  patients arriving all at once," said Paul Hensler, president of Holy Cross  Medical Center in Mission Hills.  </P> <P> Arthur Morin, the Los Angeles Fire Department's paramedic supervisor in the  West Valley, agreed. "I don't think there has been a terrible diminishing of  patient care," but "the fact they are overburdened at times could have some  impact," he said.  </P> <P> The situation becomes most serious when the Valley's three trauma centers -- at  Northridge, Holy Cross and St. Joseph -- are overwhelmed. Trauma centers are  geared to treat victims of violent crimes and those severely injured in traffic  and other accidents.  </P> <P> Unlike emergency rooms, trauma centers cannot be ordered reopened once closed.  Therefore, anyone who needed to be rushed to a Valley trauma center on a day  like Wednesday -- when all three were shut down -- would have been transported  to an emergency room unless he or she could have been flown to a trauma center  outside the area.  </P> <P> At an emergency room, trauma victims might not receive the treatment provided  by a trauma center's specially trained surgeons and equipment.  </P> <P> "People who could have used a trauma center to save their life didn't have  access to them," said Chief Alan R. Cowen, head of emergency medical services  for the Los Angeles Fire Department, referring to Wednesday's closures. "Would  you want a member of your family that needs a surgeon to go to a local  emergency room?"  </P> <P> According to county health guidelines, trauma patients must reach a hospital  within 20 minutes. Paramedics try to deliver patients to emergency rooms in 10  to 15 minutes. With the hospital pool shrinking, helicopters are being used in  the Valley more frequently to beat the clock.  </P> <P> That's what happened early last week after a truck driver experienced severe  chest pains in Castaic. His illness touched off a frantic search that stretched  from Bakersfield to Northridge.  </P> <P> Physicians at the closest hospital, Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial, were tied up  treating three victims of a bad car crash on the Antelope Valley Freeway. Holy  Cross was also closed to more patients. A quick decision had to be made to  transport the trucker by helicopter to either Northridge or Bakersfield.  </P> <P> Hypothetically, this is what would have happened last week if, for example, a  motorist were severely injured in an accident at Valley Circle and Victory  boulevards in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Had Northridge's trauma center been closed, Holy Cross would have been the  second choice. If it too was closed, the paramedic would have driven to St.  Joseph, provided traffic was light enough to permit an arrival time within 20  minutes or less. If that had been impossible, paramedics either would have  flown the victim to UCLA's trauma center or driven to the nearest Valley  emergency room.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Money Troubles  </P> <P> Compounding the uncertainty over when the gridlock will ease are the hospitals'  funding problems.  </P> <P> The governor aroused panic among county health officials recently when his  proposed budget indicated that the hospitals would not be receiving added funds  from Proposition 99, the tobacco-tax initiative passed by voters in November.  </P> <P> The tax, expected to produce $650 million annually, was partly intended to  subsidize hospitals for treating uninsured patients. But Deukmejian wants to  reduce the state's funding of hospitals from other sources, thereby deflating  the financial benefits of Proposition 99.  </P> <P> Hospital administrators said they were disappointed by the governor's decision  and hope that pressure from the hospital industry will change his mind.  </P> <P> "The state is where a lot of responsibility lies," Hensler said. "We have been  lobbying the governor for some time, but the governor is pretty adamant on his  views, especially since he is not running for reelection."  </P> <P> Both Holy Cross and St. Joseph lose $1.5 million a year maintaining their  trauma centers, according to the hospitals' executives. Without relief from  Proposition 99, both are examining how costs can be cut.  </P> <P> Dan Fahey, St. Joseph's senior associate administrator, said the hospital hopes  that the county will relax some of its costly trauma-care standards, such as  requiring that a surgeon be on staff 24 hours a day. If pressures don't ease,  St. Joseph might explore pulling out of the trauma-care business, Fahey said.  </P> <P> Regardless, the on-again, off-again bed shortage in the Valley does not begin  to approach the depth of the crisis in the inner city. There, hospitals have  been closing or threatening to close their overworked trauma centers for  financial reasons. The inner-city hospitals handle the majority of the trauma  cases -- a seemingly endless stream of stabbing and gunshot victims, most of  whom have no insurance.  </P> <P> In addition, the Valley has more hospitals than the inner city, and their  resources are not as taxed by indigent patients.  </P> <P> Olive View Medical Center appears to be the only Valley hospital negatively  affected by the crisis in the inner city. When beds are filled at County-USC  Medical Center, overflow patients go to Olive View in Sylmar. Since July, Olive  View's emergency room has experienced a 34% jump in patients.  </P> <P> "I would say that Olive View will continue to see increases in the emergency  room, and we'll probably see more days of closures," said Jaron Gammons, the  hospital's associate administrator.  </P></p>

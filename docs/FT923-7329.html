			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: America West seeks approval for financing AMERICA West, the bankrupt US carrier, is asking the bankruptcy court to approve a new tranche of financing, which could bring the Phoenix-based airline up to Dollars 60m of funds. The money is being put up by a consortium of Arizona investors, assembled by a Phoenix businessman  - Mr William Franke  - at the request of Arizona's governor, and by GPA International, the Irish aircraft leasing company. GPA has been keenly involved in the America West bankruptcy, as the lessor of 16 of its aircraft. America West said GPA had committed to provide Dollars 35m of new financing. A US bankruptcy court judge granted Continental Airlines a 45-day extension during which the carrier has the exclusive right to file a reorganisation plan, Reuter reports. It was the sixth extension in over two years.</p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Commons approves legal aid restriction MPs last night approved new regulations restricting eligibility for legal aid, and rejected alternative proposals by the Law Society. The regulations, which take effect from April 12, were approved by a government majority of 45 (304-259). But the measures were attacked by Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs and by Sir Nicholas Fairbairn (C Perth and Kinross), a former solicitor-general for Scotland. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, the junior Scottish office minister, promised that the regulations would be reviewed in due course, but said: 'I cannot hold out any hope with regard to the representations by the Law Society'. Responding to protests that people with modest resources unable to qualify for income support would be hardest hit by the regulations, he said such complaints would be made wherever the line restricting eligibility was drawn. The minister emphasised the escalation in the cost of legal aid throughout Britain - on current trends estimated to reach Pounds 2bn by 1995-96 - and insisted 'something had to be done'. Pointing out that it was envisaged that legal aid expenditure would rise by 10 per cent a year for the next three years he said Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, had not been 'ungenerous' in framing the regulations. Lord James Douglas-Hamilton forecast that the numbers receiving legal aid would increase steadily by the mid-1990s. Sir Ivan Lawrence QC (C Burton), chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, denied that 14m people would be denied legal aid as a result of the regulations. He joined other MPs in calling for reforms in the administration of the courts to provide greater value for money.</p>

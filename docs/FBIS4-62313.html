			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by RIA Novosti correspondent Vitaliy Dymarskiy: </F> "Daniel Tarschys' Trump Card. Russia Could Join the Council of  Europe in Early 1995"]    [Text] Strasbourg, Paris -- The spring session of the  Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, which has ended in  Strasbourg, turned out to be stormy and memorable. Perhaps for  the first time, mention was made of a more or less concrete  schedule for Russia's admission to this organization, as yet the  only pan-European organization to unite countries from both the  Eastern and Western parts of the continent. Although an exact  entry date was not officially stated, in the corridors "reliable  sources" were very specific: 30 January 1995. The Council of  Europe leadership, and Vladimir Shumeyko, who was on an official  visit to Strasbourg at the time, and the members of the  permanent Russian parliamentary delegation were, as behoves  them, more diplomatic, unanimously placing the final decision on  Russia's admission in the first quarter of next year -- are  there not plenty of things that could happen?!    Nonetheless, even compared with the January session of the  Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, a change of position  with regard to Russia was clearly perceptible. And this is not  because of the replacement of the secretary general, a post for  which elections were held at this session. France's Catherine  Lalumiere, who has done much to boost the prestige of the  Council of Europe, until recently a little-known organization,  hoped to be elected for a second consecutive term and was, to  this end, counting on the representatives of Eastern Europe,  most of which she brought into the Council of Europe in her  five-year term. Russia's admission was another trump card in  Lalumiere's hands, but she was stabbed in the back -- by her own  French deputies, who were settling old scores of their own. It  was by their two or three votes that the now former secretary  general fell short.    The Swede Daniel Tarschys, who unexpectedly overtook  Lalumiere, played the "Russian card" even more. Not only does  he speak Russian, but his "track record" as a professor includes  analytical works on the former USSR and Russia, on the downfall  of totalitarianism, and on other related topics which he  studied, in part, in Leningrad, where he did a six-month course  in the eighties. For Tarschys, Russia's admission to the  Council of Europe is topic number one, since this could be the  first and biggest result of his term in the post of secretary  general. In fact, he made no secret of this in an interview  with your correspondent.    Of course, Tarschys expressed all the necessary  reservations.  True, the adoption of a new Constitution and free parliamentary  elections -- this is the first and most important condition of  admission to the European family, and it has already been  fulfilled. But the Council of Europe and its commissions and  experts must in the coming months make a more scrupulous study  of Russian laws, the effectiveness of the judiciary, and the  situation regarding human rights and national minorities. Only  after that will there be a final decision on Russia's compliance  with European standards.    Are these standards uniform? Vladimir Lukin, head of our  delegation, asked himself that question repeatedly during the  session, and answered in the negative. In the opinion of the  chairman of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs,  Russia should, of course, join the Council of Europe, but it is  unacceptable for special demands to be made on it which are by  no means always observed by the existing members of the Council  of Europe. This applies, in particular, to the position of  national minorities (in the Baltic countries, for instance), the  presence of troops on other states' territory, etc. Vladimir  Lukin insisted on an even-handed approach, especially since the  Council of Europe needs Russia as much as Russia needs the  Council of Europe.    Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, who is now a member of the official  Russian delegation to the Council of Europe, sought to fan the  flames in all the debates. Admittedly this, his first visit to  Strasbourg, will apparently also be his last, if we are to  believe the LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader's statement  prior to his departure. Taking the "national patriotic" line to  absurd extremes, as always, Zhirinovskiy informed the public  that Russia does not belong in the Council of Europe or the NATO  Partnership for Peace, or even, moreover, in...the United  Nations, which, he said, it should immediately quit. What upset  the "liberal democrat" most of all, however, was the theft of  his cap during an official reception with Daniel Tarschys  (incidentally, the Swede is also a liberal democrat, but without  the quotation marks). Stating that "the price of my headgear at  auction will soon go up, of course," Zhirinovskiy then left  Strasbourg, which he found inhospitable and where, among other  things, he was involved in a clash with demonstrators who had  gone to the Russian Consulate building to protest the LDP  leader's presence in France. As for his headgear, our  delegation was immediately reminded of the old joke: "The  October Revolution is canceled -- the leader's cap has been  stolen!" According to that logic, fascism will not win the day  in Russia....    So, forceful passions seethed at the session, but now, after  the stormy debates, everything shoould fall into a calm,  workaday routine. Calm is required on both sides -- in the  Council of Europe and in Russia. And then, probably, all the  dates cited for Russia's entry will become real.</p>

			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY DESSERTS;  </P> <P> A RASPBERRY SAUCE WELL WORTH SAVORING  </P> <P> Spooned over or under a dessert (and especially a low-fat one), raspberry sauce  is an enormous enhancement. And since it freezes well, it's easy to keep on  hand for use at a moment's notice.  </P> <P> Here are two quick sauce recipes. One version is made with fresh berries and no  sugar. The other version can be made year-round with frozen raspberries in  syrup.  </P> <P> FRESH RASPBERRY-STRAWBERRY SAUCE:  </P> <P> In food processor or blender, puree 1 pint hulled strawberries with 1/2 pint  raspberries until all pulp is removed from seeds, about 1 minute. Press through  fine sieve to remove seeds. Add 2 to 4 tablespoons raspberry fruit spread  (sugarless) until sauce is sweetened and thickened to taste. Makes about 2 2/3  cups.  </P> <P> FROZEN RASPBERRY SAUCE:  </P> <P> In food processor or blender, puree thawed 10-ounce package frozen raspberries  in syrup (preferably light) until all pulp is removed from seeds, about 30  seconds. Press through fine sieve to remove seeds. Add powdered sugar to taste  and 1 tablespoon raspberry or blackberry liqueur, if desired. Makes about 1 1/4  cups.  </P> <P> FREEZING TIP:  </P> <P> If using small amounts of sauce, freeze sauce in plastic ice cube trays. Once  frozen, pop cubes out and freeze them, wrapped airtight in plastic bags.  Individual servings of raspberry sauce will always be available. ABBY MANDEL  </P></p>

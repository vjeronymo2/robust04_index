The Secretary-General of Finland's Ministry  for Trade and Industry Matti Vuoria, and ESA Director-General  Jean Marie Lutton signed an Agreement which admits Finland as  the 14th member of the Agency. Finland will officially receive  the official status of full participating member on January 1,  1995, once its Parliament has ratified the Agreement, and will  then join its two Scandinavian neighbours, Norway and Sweden,  which are already ESA members.

The new member intends to become more  involved in space science programmes, as well as earth  observation and satellite telecommunications. ESA member  countries are: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany,  Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland  and the UK.</p>

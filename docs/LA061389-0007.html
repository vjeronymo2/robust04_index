			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADMONITION TO OFFICEHOLDERS  </P> <P> Just an observation on Archbishop Mahony's policy statement on abortion. As a  lawyer of some 55 years of active practice, I wish to congratulate him on his  excellent argument against abortion and its application to Catholic and public  officials. No attorney could have better presented the facts. It surely gives  thought to all of them, whether elected or appointed. The easiest position for  any of them to take is to straddle the fence by arguing that I am not  pro-abortion, but I will leave it to my constituents for their individual  freedom of choice.  </P> <P> It is great to be elected to office, but after obtaining the positions, none of  them can cast aside the fact that abortion is murder and human sacrifice.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, abortion will, undoubtedly, be with us, but it should not be  legalized and funded with taxpayers' dollars. I am tired of hearing about  everyone's rights, but seldom a word of their obligations.  </P> <P> FREDERICK C. DOCKWEILER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

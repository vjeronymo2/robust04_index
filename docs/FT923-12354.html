			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Nestle is poised to win Perrier: Brussels anxious to avoid mineral water duopoly in France THE European Commission is set to approve Nestle's FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.6bn) bid for Perrier, the French mineral water group, next week in a landmark decision for EC competition policy. To preserve competition in France, the Swiss food group will have to give up control of about 20 per cent of total French mineral water capacity by selling eight of its springs to a single buyer. But Nestle is likely to keep all the best-known mineral water brands involved in the takeover, including Evian, Vittel and Perrier itself. It will also have to delay the sale of the Volvic brand to BSN, the French food group, until the Commission has approved the sale of the other brands. The recommendation of the Brussels competition authorities is aimed at avoiding the formation of a 'duopoly' in the French market by BSN and Nestle. It is the first time such considerations have played a part in an EC merger decision. If commissioners approve the deal at their meeting on Wednesday, they will at a stroke extend the scope of Brussels' initiative over mergers far beyond what was envisaged when current EC rules came into force in 1990. The deal was agreed after nearly four months of hard bargaining between Nestle and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, and is essentially a pragmatic solution to the commercial and political questions raised by the bid. The controversial question of whether the Commission can interpret the EC merger rules in such a way has been saved for Wednesday's political discussion between commissioners. The Commission's legal service is understood to have severe misgivings about the decision. The Commission will also have to consider whether French public opinion will be affected by Brussels' radical interpretation of the merger rules ahead of the September referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The Commission has been heavily criticised for taking on too many powers and competition policy is one area where the French government is particularly sensitive about Brussels' influence. Nestle has the right to challenge the decision in the European Court, even though it is thought to have agreed the conditions laid down by Sir Leon and his officials, but after waiting so long for the go-ahead it seems more likely to press ahead. By selling Volvic, the Swiss group says it would retain nearly 37 per cent of the French market for still and fizzy water, before other divestments. BSN, meanwhile, would increase its share to 30.9 per cent with Volvic. When the recommendation was put to an advisory committee of national anti-trust officials last week, competition hard-liners such as Britain and Germany were said to be concerned that Nestle would still be allowed to sell Volvic to BSN. Sir Leon appears to have bowed to the argument that it would have been difficult to unscramble the contract with BSN.</p>

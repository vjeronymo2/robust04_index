			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered On Monday, Standard Chartered held a meeting for eight selected analysts to discuss the organisation of its UK operations. On Tuesday and Wednesday, its share price rose by 6 per cent. Standard emphasises that the analysts' meeting was of a non-financial nature and the swing in its share price on a volume of only 3.4m shares reflects the lack of liquidity in its paper. Just the same, such a sharp movement so soon after such a limited briefing leaves an uncomfortable feeling. If Standard had something interesting to say about its UK operations, it could have gone to the small extra trouble of putting out a statement through the stock exchange.</p>

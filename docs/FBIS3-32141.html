Caldera takes office as  president of Venezuela today.    Lage, who is on his way to Brazil, spent a few hours in  Caracas, where he met with current Foreign Minister Fernando  Ochoa Antich and with Venezuelan businessmen. Lage told  journalists this is a good moment for the ties between the two  nations and said he had reason to expect these ties to continue  to develop, because the Cuban and Venezuelan peoples are very  much alike.</p>

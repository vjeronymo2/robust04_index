			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Secretary proposes that, in order to be financially responsible, an institution must not have as part of its audit report for its most recently completed fiscal year any of the following. First, the institution's audit would not contain a statement by the accountant acknowledging substantial doubt about the institution's ability to continue operating as a going concern. A ``going concern'' statement is a professional opinion rendered by an independent certified public accountant, commenting on the institution's unstable financial condition and informing the reader of the possibility that the institution may not survive the coming fiscal year. Although such a ``going concern'' statement is rarely issued, its presence attests to a concern held by the auditor that the institution's ability to continue operating is uncertain. The Secretary believes that if an auditor, after close examination of the institution's operations, concludes that such a statement is warranted, this is cause for the Department to protect its interest in the Title IV, HEA program funds administered by the institution by requiring the institution to be subject to the appropriate remedies for establishing financial responsibility, or to be subject to provisional certification or the proceedings in subpart G of these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the institution's audit could not contain a finding of unauthorized use of donor restricted net assets to meet current operating expenses. Unauthorized use of donor restricted net assets is a violation of the restrictions placed on donations by the donor. Any donor-restricted funds are placed in an endowment fund to be used for specific purposes, such as providing scholarships. Donor restricted net assets are most commonly found at nonprofit institutions. The Secretary believes that if this money is transferred to current funds or total net assets for current operating expenses, this is not only an indication of extremely impaired cash flow, but also a violation of an institution's responsibility as a fiduciary of Title IV, HEA program funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third, the institution's audit could not contain a disclaimed or adverse opinion by the accountant. A disclaimed or adverse opinion is an indicator that the auditor is unable to perform a complete audit of the institution with the assurance that the audit presents a reliable presentation of the institution's financial condition. An audit submitted with such a disclaimer or limitation would cause the institution's financial report to be rejected by the Secretary. Such a statement in the auditor's report is an indication that the financial statement was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as required in current regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute authorizes the Secretary to prescribe criteria for evaluating operating losses, net worth, asset to liabilities ratios and operating fund deficits. The Secretary's goal in developing these proposed regulations is to ensure that institutions are capable to operate as a fiduciary of Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds based on a sufficient financial base to properly provide education and meet the institution's financial obligations. The Secretary, therefore, proposes to amend the current factors of financial responsibility section to establish new financial responsibility standards as a means of further refining the above requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes that, as in the past, failure to meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any one of the factors may result in initiation of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative proceeding to limit, suspend, fine or terminate an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. Because some of these proposed factors are more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent than those currently found in the regulations, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary recognizes that an institution may need a sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of time to adjust its operations in order to come into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with these proposed factors, if they are adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposal, the Secretary may provisionally certify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that did not meet these proposed standards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide them with this additional period of time to comply,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided that the institution shows that it would have met the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Technical Amendments of 1993 require the Secretary to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take into account an institution's total financial circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in making a determination of an institution's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility. The Secretary believes that these proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors evaluate, both directly and indirectly, the overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soundness of an institution's financial condition for the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by its audited financial statements and, therefore, take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into account an institution's total financial condition as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by the Technical Amendments of 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Technical Amendments of 1993 require that criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed for the determination of an institution's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility take into account any differences in generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accepted accounting principles, including required financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements, that are applicable to for-profit and nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions. Therefore, in addition to general standards that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all institutions would be required to meet, the Secretary has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standards applicable specifically to for-profit,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit, and public institutions that the Secretary believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate an equal level of financial responsibility. At the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestion of some of the negotiators, the proposed specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards of financial responsibility have been organized by type  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of institution; i.e., for-profit, nonprofit, and public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

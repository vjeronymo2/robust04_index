			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Redland/Steetley Most of last year's big takeover tussles - BTR/Hawker and Lasmo/Ultramar to name but two - turned out much closer than the market originally assumed. So despite the blandness of Steetley's document rejecting Redland's Pounds 600m bid, there is reason to believe that the battle of the UK brickies can yet provide an absorbing finish. You would hardly think so from the movements of the two companies' shares. So far, at least, no white knight is being signalled by the Steetley price, which last night was still trading 7 per cent below Redland's paper offer and bang in line with the mainly cash alternative. But these are early days. Steetley can do better than highlight a financial record which transparently leaves out its dismal performance last year. It can spell out in greater detail the benefits of the proposed building materials joint venture with Tarmac. Above all, it will be able to trumpet the results of its much-heralded asset revaluation. In the end, however, the fairness of the price comes down to a good deal more than asset value. Steetley's strategy was arguably a good one for the 1980s, but the cost to shareholders now is all too visible in a stretched balance sheet. Redland is financially much stronger but is vulnerable to jibes about the volume of new paper it has issued in the last few years. There is a clear choice in management style and an equally clear choice between exposure to the UK through an independent Steetley or a more diverse merged European portfolio. Redland's timing has been neat and its intellectual case well made. But there is still a long way to go.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has said that there are  extremely good relations between Turkey and Iran, and that the  two countries cooperate in connection with Iraq and the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan]. He pointed out that the embargo  on Iraq causes Turkey a loss of $3 to $5 billion annually. He  stressed that the UN Security Council and the concerned  countries must show understanding in connection with the oil  pipeline.    The president was replying to reporters' questions at  Cankaya  Mansion in connection with press reports that Iranian President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani offered to carry out a joint intervention to  end the fighting in north Iraq. Demirel recalled that Turkey  has close relations with Iran, adding that the two countries  cooperate regarding both Iraq and the PKK issue. He said the  ministers of the two countries and officials of their respective  security organizations meet from time to time to review  developments.    [Begin Demirel recording] There are still PKK members who  are able to infiltrate into Turkey through Iran. I told  Hashemi-Rafsanjani's brother, who was here last time, about  this. It is true, I said, we cooperate very well with Iran, but  such things are still happening from time to time. So I told  him to bring me something from Hashemi-Rafsanjani which shows  Iran's sensitivity about this issue and a reassurance that its  interest will continue. [end recording]    Demirel pointed out that the invitation to visit Iran on 25  July was reiterated.    Asked to comment on the UN debates scheduled for tomorrow in  connection with the embargo on Iraq, Demirel stressed that  Turkey's interests necessitate joint action with the world.    [Begin Demirel recording] However, a great injustice is  being done to Turkey. The embargo causes Turkey a loss of $3  billion to $5 billion annually. Also, the pipeline is corroding.  It must be filled and emptied a few times. The United Nations  and the coalition states, especially the United States, France,  Britain, Germany, and Russia must show understanding. That is  what we are hoping. [end recording]    Demirel stated that Turkey has been stressing the issue for  more than two years and urging Iraq to do whatever the United  Nations asks it to do. He stressed that Turkey does not want  Iraq to be divided. Iran too wants Iraq's territorial integrity  to be maintained, he added.</p>

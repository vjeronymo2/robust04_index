			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Airtours in Pounds 221m bid for Owners Abroad AIRTOURS, the UK's third largest package holiday company, yesterday launched a hostile Pounds 221m all-share bid for its larger rival, Owners Abroad, in a move that could provide a substantial challenge to the market leader, Thomson. The bid, which Owners Abroad immediately rejected as inadequate, would, if successful, leave Thomson and the enlarged Airtours with nearly 60 per cent of the holiday tour market and might trigger a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Airtours' offer is dependent on Owners Abroad's shareholders not accepting the terms of a previously proposed link with Thomas Cook, the travel agent and banking services chain now controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank of Germany. Mr David Crossland, Airtours' founder and chairman, said the proposed merger would create 'a very significant force in the UK travel industry'. The combined group would account for 26 per cent of the UK holiday market, behind Thomson, which has 33 per cent. Mr Crossland did not expect the deal to be referred to the Monopolies Commission. Airtours had made 'exhaustive inquiries' about the possibility of a referral. The Office of Fair Trading is understood to have given Airtours non-binding 'confidential guidance' that the merger would not be referred. The Airtours bid leaves open the question of whether Thomas Cook will want to take a more substantial financial stake in Owners Abroad. Under the current proposal, the company would make a net cash injection of only Pounds 2m although it is taking a 10 per equity stake. Owners Abroad yesterday postponed tomorrow's extraordinary general meeting at which shareholders would have voted on the Thomas Cook deal. Airtours is offering three new ordinary shares for every eight Owners Abroad shares, valuing this part of the bid at 113p last night after Airtours' share price slipped 19p to close at 302p. Owners Abroad shares closed up 11p at 120p. It is also offering 188.5 convertible preference shares for 100 Owners Abroad convertible shares, valuing these shares at about 194p. There is a partial cash alternative, fully underwritten by Barclays de Zoete Wedd and The British Linen Bank. Airtours is also proposing to raise Pounds 49.5m by way of a placing, with clawback, of convertible preference shares. BZW is advising Airtours and Samuel Montagu is advising Owners Abroad.

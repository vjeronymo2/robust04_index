			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Second half lifts Burton to Pounds 9.4m SHARES IN Burton Group jumped 25 per cent to 55p yesterday as the fashion retailer announced a return to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.4m for the year to August 29 and maintained its final dividend. The profits, which compared with a loss of Pounds 13.4m last time, were struck on turnover 6 per cent higher at Pounds 1.76bn and were helped by the absence of last year's Pounds 24.6m exceptional reorganisation costs. Nevertheless, analysts said the results were much better than expected, especially with the welcome decision to change the accounting treatment of the property development portfolio. The Pounds 4.2m in property holding costs - net of rents received - were included above the line for the first time. Mr John Hoerner, who became chief executive in February, said there was much work yet to be done to improve the company's performance. Trading profits before exceptionals had declined from Pounds 46.2m to Pounds 35.3m, with Pounds 3m of the decline due to the sale of Harvey Nichols. 'No one is kidding themselves that this is a wonderful performance, because it isn't' At the interim stage profits halved to Pounds 2.2m. However, the group was encouraged by the substantial progress of the second half. The final pay-out was maintained at 1p, for a lower full-year total of 2p (2.7p). Earnings per share were 0.8p against losses of 2p. The year had been 'a story of two halves,' Mr Hoerner said. 'In the second half, very cautiously and very quietly, we have turned the corner.' During the latter part of the year, Burtons moved from a trading loss of Pounds 17.4m to profits of Pounds 2.7m. Sales in the second half improved by 14 per cent to Pounds 830m, with same space sales 15 per cent ahead. The improvement was partly due to a significant restocking. The board also decided not to be beaten on prices, which contributed to a fall in gross margins from 2.8 per cent to 2 per cent. However, market share improved to more than 12 per cent (11 per cent). The best performance came from Debenhams, with trading profits of Pounds 31.1m, and Dorothy Perkins, the women's wear retailer. The multiples business was hit by disappointing performances from Principles and Burton men's wear. COMMENT Mr Hoerner has done much in this set of results to dispel the shadows of recent years. However, it must be noted that 1990-91 had been an appallingly bad year and the achievement compared with 'a very easy base' in the words of one analyst. The road to real recovery is sure be long and hard before profits are anything like respectable for a company with almost Pounds 2bn in sales. The good news is that Mr Hoerner is under no illusions about this and he appears to be doing all the right things. The question now is whether the gains will be short or long-term. Many potential investors will be watching the interims with more than ordinary interest before plunging in. Forecasts are for Pounds 25m next year. The p/e of 32, based on an uncertain tax charge of 25 per cent, might look expensive at the moment. However, the yield could attract investors in the short term.</p>

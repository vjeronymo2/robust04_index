The Adviser to the Prime Minister on His Former Boss"]    [Text] On the heels of the resignations of Gaydar and  Fedorov followed the resignation of Andrey Illarionov, head of  the analysis and planning group under the prime minister. The  resignation was completely logical, since it was precisely  Illarionov, side by side with Gaydar and Fedorov, who was a most  active proponent of an intensified toughness in credit and  financial policy. Our conversation took place on the day after  the announcement of the resignation.    [Travin] Today you are taking your leave of Chernomyrdin  with  a fair amount of fanfare. But when your collaboration was  beginning, you evaluated the prime minister's possibilities as a  reformer, evidently, fairly optimistically? At that time, the  union of Chernomyrdin and Illarionov surprised many people.    [Illarionov] To be precise, I must note that I did not come  to Chernomyrdin. I was simply appointed to the post of head of  the analysis and planning group.    The proposal that I fill the post in question came to me at  the end of January of last year. I said that I needed to think  about it. The mulling lasted for three months. Chernomyrdin  during that time did not express any great desire to appoint me  to the post, and I did not strive toward it, particularly.    More than that, if in January our meetings were fairly  regular, in the spring I was not able see him for more than two  months on a very important matter. At that time, the government  apparatus was engaged in the quiet suffocation of the working  center of economic reforms (an organ created by Gaydar at the  dawn of the reform--D.T.). I wanted to discuss this problem and  to stop the destruction, but Chernomyrdin evaded a meeting with  me.    There were days when I spent almost 24 hours in the prime  minister's waiting room, but my efforts were spent without  success. It became clear that Chernomyrdin was well apprised of  the problems of the working center, and that everything was  taking place with his knowledge. I ceased any attempts at  establishing contact.    Suddenly, on 26 April, several hours after the results of  the  April referendum became known, the telephone rang, and I was  invited to a meeting with the prime minister. Everyone remembers  the results of the referendum today, just as they remember that  on the eve of the voting many people evaluated Yeltsin's chances  for victory extremely skeptically.    I spent three hours with Chernomyrdin at that time. An  unprecedented fact. After all, the prime minister, and  especially at such a moment, had an enormous number of important  matters to attend to. It suddenly transpired that the order  naming me to the post of head of the analysis and planning group  had long been ready. And now no one was asking for my assent.    [Travin] But you, apparently, perceived Chernomyrdin's  actions as a sudden change in his consciousness, brought about  under the influence of the referendum. The possibilities of  cooperation in such a political situation were evaluated more  optimistically than during the time you were trying to get  through on the subject of the working center.    [Illarionov] It was not a change in consciousness, but  precisely a change in the political game. It was necessary to  demonstrate to the public some change in the composition of the  government. My optimism applied not to April but rather to  January, when it seemed that Chernomyrdin grasped reformist  ideas. At that time, after all, he gave voice to several very  strong speeches, in Davos, for example. It seemed to me that the  prime minister was not simply repeating my words, but perceived  what was said as his very own.    In April I no longer thought this, but I still believed that  I could bring some benefit if I were in the post in question.  Our relations remained more or less acceptable until July, that  is, until the moment that Mr. Gerashchenko conducted his money  reform. The prime minister supported this reform.    [Travin] Soon after this, you made a series of sharp  statements, coming out in print against the reform. Obviously,  there was some kind of confrontation with Chernomyrdin?    [Illarionov] We had two conversations on this topic. The  most  serious was on 29 July. We talked for about an hour with raised  voices and could not find common ground for a long time.  Finally, I said that I had to go to a press conference that had  been arranged earlier. The prime minister got scared and said  that he forbade me to give it.    I have to say that it was originally planned to hold the  press conference on Ilinka. But the government press center  issued a statement--three times, in fact--to the effect that it  would not take place. I announced to its management that I would  speak with journalists in any case, even if I had to do so in  the street; plus I would tell them about the prohibition laid on  the meeting with the press. In the end I managed, bypassing the  press center, to come to an agreement on the conduct of a press  conference on Zubovskiy Boulevard. It was to that place that I  planned to go from Chernomyrdin's office.    When the prime minister tried to forbid me to meet with the  press, I said that it was impossible to call it off and that the  best egress from the situation that had taken shape would be the  personal appearance of Chernomyrdin at Zubovskiy Boulevard. And  I added that he should make a statement on the erroneousness and  criminality of the money reform and that Gerashchenko had led  the government astray. To that the prime minister responded that  he was not about to do that but that still, now he had begun to  understand the situation better. He also expressed regret that  our conversation had not taken place earlier.    [Travin] But after all, the conversation could not have  taken  place earlier, since the whole government was not informed in  advance about the conduct of the money reform in such a variant.    [Illarionov] Of course. That was the reason that I still  insisted that I would hold the press conference. To this I  received the response: Illarionov, do not forget yourself....    [Travin] He came out and said that?    [Illarionov] No, in fact he said it much more sharply, but I  am not going to repeat his expression now. Then the prime  minister gave me to understand that no one in particular was  keeping me in the government. To which I, likewise, frankly gave  him to understand that I was not hanging onto the job but that I  was obligated to speak my mind directly, both to the prime  minister, since I was his adviser, and to the journalists.    The upshot was that we agreed that I would refrain after all  from any statements to the press; however, the prime minister  had to convince the president of the fallaciousness of the  conducted money reform and (since repealing it was already  impossible) of the necessity of immediately firing Gerashchenko.  The agreement was strictly a gentlemen's one. I fulfilled it  completely, saying not a word at the press conference about the  money reform. Chernomyrdin did not keep his promise.    [Travin] Did the prime minister never realize the  harmfulness  of the money reform, or was the patronage of the Central Bank's  policy a conscious political play on his part?    [Illarionov] The main goal of the activity both of  Chernomyrdin and of Gerashchenko consists by no means in the  reformation of the economy, but in the attainment of a maximum  of power, both on the territory of Russia and also beyond its  borders: within the framework of the entire former Soviet Union.  Money reform in the form in which it was conducted answered only  one goal--the restoration of the USSR, at least in questions of  the conduct of credit and monetary policy.    [Travin] Immediately after the exchange of banknotes,  representatives of the republics of the CIS came running to  Moscow....    [Illarionov] And they ran to see not the president, or even  the prime minister, but precisely Gerashchenko--the person  distributing the money. And the policy of gathering all the  republics under the Russian roof almost succeeded. The agreement  on the ruble zone of a new type was prepared on an emergency  basis and quickly signed.    [Travin] How in the world, after that episode, did relations  with Chernomyrdin evolve?    [Illarionov] They hardly evolved at all. As a result of our  conversation, I ended up in the hospital, where I spent more  than a month. After that, I convalesced in a sanatorium,  although not very successfully. Then I went to work, but for the  last half-year Chernomyrdin has not once shown a desire to speak  with the head of his analysis and planning group or to give him  any kind of assignment.    He and I met only three times, at my initiative, and these  meetings worked out because they were held at times of  emergency: on the night of 21-22 September, on the night of 3-4  October, and on the morning of 13 December.    [Travin] Were these meetings marked by anything in  particular?    [Illarionov] Each of them was memorable in its own way, but  what brings them all together is the figure of the main hero of  our conversations. Each time, we talked about Mr. Gerashchenko.  In particular, on 13 December I spoke out about my understanding  of the election results. In my view, a most important reason for  such results was inflation. People voted not so much for  Zhirinovskiy as against the government. It is interesting that  Chernomyrdin, generally speaking, again promised me to resolve  the issue of Gerashchenko. He asked me to provide him with  materials substantiating the necessity for firing the chairman  of the Central Bank, and he did receive these materials. In two  weeks, the prime minister declared that he did not know a  greater reformer than Mr. Gerashchenko and that there were no  problems in working with him.    [Travin] Much is being said today to the effect that  Chernomyrdin aspires to the presidency. How do you assess his  chances?    [Illarionov] They are very high. At least, among the  candidates there are at the given moment. There is no question  that Chernomyrdin is a talented politician. He knows how to  avoid conflict and criticism aimed in his direction. After all,  even after having spent more than a year in the prime minister's  seat, he was able to represent the situation in such a way that  all the fire of criticism for the economic problems was directed  at Gaydar and Fedorov. Besides, he has been able more than  anyone else to gain the favor of the president.    [Travin] How did he manage to get so far into his good  graces?    [Illarionov] I think that personal qualities were at work  here, and also the fact that the president and the prime  minister are people of the same generation. Gaydar and Fedorov  have neither the same life experience behind them as does  Chernomyrdin, nor a period of administrating the largest gas  corporation in the country, with a billion-dollar turnover.    Chernomyrdin is a person who stands firmly on his feet.  Suffice it to recall how he appeared in the government in May  1992, and immediately in the post of deputy prime minister, and  not minister of fuel and energy. There is much that is  mysterious in the story of the firing of Lopukhin (the former  minister of fuel and energy) and the appointment of Chernomyrdin.    [Travin] In order to become president, Chernomyrdin will  have  to go through the procedure of national elections, and that is a  different story than apparat games.    [Illarionov] That is exactly what will be the simplest  thing.  In the first place, the prime minister has already accomplished  a great many trips around the regions, and he has met with a  mass of people. Everywhere, he has made good contacts, since he  has said, "Yes," and not "No."    In the second place, the balance of forces will be  approximately the following. On the democratic  flank--Yavlinskiy, possibly Shakhray, possibly Gaydar. In the  center--Chernomyrdin. On the right--Zhirinovskiy. Only  Zhirinovskiy and Chernomyrdin will emerge in the second round.  After that, all clear-thinking people will start to call to vote  for Chernomyrdin, and since, I am convinced, most Russians are  sober-minded people, he is exactly who will become president.    [Travin] Could all of that happen earlier than in two years?    [Illarionov] It could, If, in a year and a half, the country  finds itself in a condition of hyperinflation, the question will  arise as to who is responsible for this. Since the prime  minister has already repeatedly proven his amazing capacity for  evading direct responsibility, then probably a multitude of  people will appear who will do everything possible so that the  responsibility lies with the president.    [Travin] What awaits the country under President  Chernomyrdin?    [Illarionov] Policy will be about the same as it has been  lately under Prime Minister Chernomyrdin. We will have a highly  monopolized economy with an enormous share of expensive  governmental regulation. And the basis for the monopolies will  be the old ministerial structures.    It is fairly clear what will be in the political sphere. If  under President Yeltsin human rights are basically observed,  judging from the customs that reign in Chernomyrdin's team, the  situation could change in a radical way. Take if only the recent  accusation of Fedorov that after his resignation announcement,  he supposedly went to the U.S. Embassy and asked for a  profitable job overseas. Chernomyrdin also committed a rudeness  to Gaydar soon after the latter returned to the government. He  declared that the first deputy prime minister would do as he was  directed. In Italy, in a moment of candor, it was said that in  Moscow Chernomyrdin was in command. That says a lot. [end  Illarionov]    When our conversation with the former head of the  analysis and planning group was over, an INTERFAX tape was  brought in, which contained the well-known report by the  government press service to the effect that Andrey Illarionov  had been fired for absenteeism. This was the interpretation of  his recent business trip to London, attempting to show that it  was not a matter of ideological differences and not of voluntary  resignation, but of an ordinary violation of work discipline,  which somehow happened at a moment very convenient for the prime  minister.</p>

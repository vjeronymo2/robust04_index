			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES OF THE WEEK  </P> <P> E.A.R.T.H. Force (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie/series pilot starring  Gil Gerard and Joanna Pacula, concerns a tycoon's right-hand woman forming a  special team to deal with a nuclear meltdown crisis.  </P> <P> The disappointing 1989 TV movie My Boyfriend's Back (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.)  tells of a TV special that reunites a '60s girls group who had one hit record.  </P> <P> The 1983 Sudden Impact (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), the fourth of Clint Eastwood's  Dirty Harry movies, is assuredly the worst, a nakedly manipulative exploitation  picture that's an unabashed call for everyone who believes he or she has been  wronged to take the law into his or her own hands. Not only does it exploit sex  and violence but also audiences' prejudices against minorities.  </P> <P> The Way West (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.), an ambitious 1967 account of a  covered wagon train crossing the Oregon Trail in 1843 that stars Kirk Douglas,  Robert Mitchum and Richard Widmark, was sabotaged by a terrible script.  </P> <P> Babies (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, tells of several women who face  different problems as each attempts to become pregnant. Lindsay Wagner stars.  </P> <P> Field of Dreams (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) was the most potent, unexpected fantasy  of the '80s -- a heartfelt, irresistible account of a young farmer (Kevin  Costner) who heeds "the voices" who tell him to build a baseball diamond on his  Iowa cornfield, which is suddenly populated by baseball greats of the past. At  the heart of the matter of Phil Alden Robinson's marvelous film is a grown  man's yearning for a reconciliation with his long-gone father.  </P> <P> Andrew Stevens stars in the new Hidden View (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.,  again on Saturday at 8 p.m.) as a mysterious home security agent hired to  investigate the affairs of an adulterous rock star's beautiful young wife  (Tanya Roberts).  </P> <P> One of John Frankenheimer's finest films, the 1966 Seconds (Channel 11  Wednesday at 8 p.m.) stars Rock Hudson as a man in late middle age who receives  a handsome, youthful new appearance. With superlative James Wong Howe  black-and-white cinematography, a taut Lewis John Carlino script and a  top-notch performance from Hudson.  </P> <P> Lasse Hallstrom's wonderful 1985 Swedish film My Life as a Dog (Channel 13  Wednesday at 8 p.m.), at once funny and touching, is about a resilient  12-year-old (Anton Glanzelius) coping with a new life with relatives in the  country.  </P> <P> Donna Mills plays a high-powered attorney whose life is turned upside down when  she falls in love with her young male secretary (Brian Wimmer) in the new TV  movie The World's Oldest Living Bridesmaid (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.).  </P> <P> In the new TV movie Murder C.O.D. (NBC Friday at 9 p.m.), a police commander  hunts a killer who exacts fees from the enemies of his victims. Patrick Duffy  stars.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills Cop (ABC Saturday at 9 p.m.), the 1984 Eddie Murphy smash hit, is  a slick, sleek, violent high-style Hollywood entertainment that seduces you in  spite of yourself.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 19 (XINHUA) -- The United States Forces  in Korea (USFK) started a three-day defense readiness drill  involving USFK dependents and American civilians residing in  South Korea Thursday [19 May], the Korea-U.S. Combined Forces  Command (CFC) here said.    The semi-annual drill, which is called non-combatant  evacuation operation (neo), will include the checking of  manpower, paperwork and the operation to evacuate non-combatants  in the event of war on the Korean peninsula, a CFC spokesman  said.    "The drill is just part of the routine semi-annual program  having nothing to do with the current situation in which tension  has escalated due to the standoff involving Pyongyang's nuclear  weapons program," the spokesman claimed.    At present, some 36,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South  Korea.</p>

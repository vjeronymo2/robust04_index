			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: US statistics upset London trading A UK equity sector slow to return to work after the May Day holiday closed on a sour note yesterday following disappointing economic news from across the Atlantic. The sharp drop in the US index of leading economic indicators in March - prompting an admission of 'cause for concern' from the White House press secretary - halted London's earlier advance, which had reflected firmness in bonds both in New York and London. The fall in economic indicators, which checked an early gain on Wall Street where the Dow Average was unchanged when London closed, heightened worries that the recovery in the US economy might be losing momentum. It was these worries, mirrored by signs that US investors might have been switching into gold, that upset the UK stock market last week. Some London strategists believe that Wall Street may be taking too sanguine a view of the economic recovery and could soon face a significant correction. UK equities opened firmly, still responding to indications that the domestic economy has now turned the corner from recession towards recovery. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, told parliament yesterday that statistics showing lower home repossessions added to the evidence that Britain is heading towards recovery. In early trading, the FT-SE 100 Index added 9.8 points, but trading volume was woefully thin. This is the last week of a UK equity trading account extended over three weeks to cover the May Day break. With the City of London still taking a somewhat restrained view of the UK economic recovery and of Wall Street, traders were inclined to stay out of the market until the new trading account opens on Friday night. The stock market soon lost its early peak of 2,822.9 on the Footsie but was content to mark time in positive territory until Wall Street opened. Firmness in New York bonds took the pressure off UK government stocks, and gains in gilts in turn helped equities. London quickly dipped below overnight levels when Wall Street lost its initial gain, and although both markets steadied later, the FT-SE 100 ended the day 0.5 off at 2,812.6. Most of the day's features focused around company news, either actual or expected. BAT Industries found buyers ahead of today's trading statement, and similar factors brought some support among the UK clearing banks. The stock market's evident unwillingness to renew its advance at present is seen by some analysts as confirmation that it has settled into a trading range of FT-SE 2,750 to 2,850 for the near term. Retail, or genuine customer, interest in equities has remained satisfactory in spite of last week's shakeout in shares. Stock Exchange statistics show that retail business on Friday was worth Pounds 1.14bn, at the lower end of the range of the past six months. Second line issues were slower than the Footsie-listed stocks to react yesterday to developments in New York. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, although off the top, retained a net gain of 1.4 at 3,133.5. Trading volume in non-Footsie stocks made up around 63 per cent of the day's Seaq total of 422.8m shares, indicating a return to a more typical daily market profile after a week which had seen the Footsie blue chips dominating trading.</p>

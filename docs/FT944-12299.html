			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Business and the Environment: Insurers in a storm Fifteen catastrophic hurricanes, floods and storms cost worldwide insurers more than Dollars 80bn (Pounds 50bn) since a period of weather extremes set in five years ago, according to an article in the latest World Watch Institute's journal. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew struck Florida and set a new record for damages at Dollars 25bn. The Mississippi floods in 1993 cost Dollars 12bn. Europe was hit by four severe windstorms in 1990 which accumulated damages of Dollars 10bn. Japan was struck in 1991 by Typhoon Mireille with nearly Dollars 5bn in damages. As the damages mount, insurers have begun to take seriously the global warming theory advanced by many scientists. The fear is that the warming, spurred by 'greenhouse gases', produced by fossil fuels, could seriously disrupt the world's atmospheric and oceanic systems. Lack of agreement in the scientific community has made the insurers wary. But their interest is being applauded by environmentalists who see the insurers as a potential counterweight to the power of the oil and coal interests in the global warming debate. Christopher Flavin, author of the World Watch article, is urging the insurers to enter the struggle over climate policy. 'Few industries are capable of doing battle with the likes of the fossil fuel lobby. But the insurance industry is,' he says. 'On a worldwide basis the two are of roughly comparable size and potential political clout.' The insurance industry could, for example, push government to tighten energy efficiency rules for new buildings. It could actively lobby for a stronger global climate pact. It could also use its investment capacity. 'If they (companies) were to dump some of their stocks in oil and coal companies or actively invest some of their funds in new, less carbon-intensive energy technologies (forming a sort of climate venture fund), insurance companies could spur the development of a less threatening energy system,' says Flavin. Unless the industry begins to use its clout in the struggle over climate policy, its future 'is likely to be stormy indeed', said Flavin.</p>

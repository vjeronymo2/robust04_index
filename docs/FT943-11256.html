			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Berlusconi tries to escape a web of his own making: Italy's PM now sees 'conflict of interest' dangers Silvio Berlusconi has finally recognised the obvious. In proposing a way to distance himself from his Fininvest media empire, he has accepted that there is a serious conflict of interest between his role as prime minister and his ownership of Italy's second largest private business group. Even before the media magnate became prime minister, he was warned of the potential dangers arising from his conflicting interests as a businessman and as a politician. His sole response was to name three lawyers - one of whom had a direct link with Fininvest - to prepare a report by the end of September. Now circumstances have obliged him to anticipate their proposals and propose a system of controls far more comprehensive than he would have liked. The planned solution came on Friday, at the end of a week in which Mr Berlusconi's credibility had been seriously damaged as his business empire was placed under the microscope by Milan's anti-corruption magistrates. The central aspect of Mr Berlusconi's scheme is to establish a five-member commission, composed of the head of the anti-trust commission and the chairman of the media watch-dog committee, plus three unnamed experts. In tandem with the commission, an 'administrator', nominated by Mr Berlusconi, would be created to monitor the management and strategy of Fininvest, with powers to approve asset disposals. The commission, in turn, would have the power to monitor all Fininvest activities and could reject the choice of administrator. His proposals have already come up against some hurdles and are likely to be modified, given the opposition of his coalition partner, Mr Umberto Bossi, the leader of the populist Northern League. They have also run into constitutional objections from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The president said it was outside his competence to name, in conjunction with the speakers of the two houses of parliament, part of the five-member commission to safeguard the conflict of interest. The president appears to be hinting that he does not want to compromise his impartiality by helping Mr Berlusconi solve a problem he should have resolved before taking e. Any future commission's ability to remedy the situation is also in question. The US-style 'blind trust', which lets public officials hand over the management of their assets in the form of stocks and shares, does not fit Mr Berlusconi's unusual position as owner of a complex group active in sensitive areas of the economy. Fininvest, with a L11,600bn (Pounds 4.8bn) turnover and L3,800bn of net debt at the end of 1993, is undergoing serious readjustment and requires an active management, capable of strategic decisions on growth, asset disposals and debt reduction. While willing to let management operate independently under a system that offers considerable flexibility and reasonably transparent controls, Mr Berlusconi is not ready to distance himself from ownership. Mr Franco Tato, who was brought in as chief executive under pressure from creditor banks last October, has been restructuring Fininvest with a relatively free hand, despite the presence of two of Mr Berlusconi's eldest children, a cousin and his closest friend on the board. The conflict of interest has not been in the management of the group but in the way Mr Berlusconi has been seen to continue defending Fininvest. This situation has been further complicated by the role of Forza Italia, the political support movement backing Mr Berlusconi. It has been funded in part by the Fininvest empire and is run almost entirely by people who were employees until three months ago. One of Forza Italia's most powerful figures is Mr Marcello Dell'Utri, the head of Publitalia, the group's advertising arm. Mr Berlusconi also hangs onto his team of ex-Fininvest associates in the cabinet, all of whom have a stake in the fortunes of the group. He wanted Mr Cesare Previti, his lawyer, to be justice minister and only switched him to the defence portfolio after objections about a conflict of interest. Apart from those conflicts of interest which have already emerged, plenty of others loom ahead. For example, Fininvest's three TV channels control 80 per cent of commercial television and could be direct beneficiaries of any change in status of the loss-making RAI, the state broadcasting organisation; the liberalisation of state-run telecommunications could countenance the use of telephone lines for TV image transmission as canvassed by Fininvest; Fininvest's life assurance business stands to gain from new legislation on pension funds. With so many potential conflicts of interest, an active impartial commission would slow the business of a Berlusconi government. The existence of the impartial body will allow Mr Berlusconi's coalitition partners a constant opportunity to refer government policy to the commission by appealing against a conflict of interest. This, in turn, risks placing an unfair 'political' burden on the commission. President Scalfaro is believed to have voiced such a concern. In saying he is willing to distance himself from Fininvest, Mr Berlusconi has ruled out the idea of placing his share of the business in a trust or foundation for his five children. The tax on such an operation would reportedly be punitive. But even on Friday he still refused to give details on the proprietary shares held by different members of the family. Fininvest, founded in 1978, has an ownership structure geared to limit tax liability. Through 22 'box' companies, the family owns 51 per cent of Fininvest directly and the remainder through two fiduciaries, Servizio Italia and Saf, set up by the Socialist-controlled BNL bank. Mr Berlusconi has never said how much he personally owns of the empire he founded, or what links remain between Fininvest and the construction and newspaper interests hived off to his younger brother, Paolo, in 1992 for anti-trust reasons. Thus Italians do not know what exactly Mr Berlusconi is distancing himself from, even if they take his word that he is the owner.</p>

He also said that to save time, it is hoped that the  Legislative Yuan will agree to adopt a package of laws when  enacting laws.    He stated that our side has already studied the issue of  holding negotiations with Communist China over investment and  direct cross- strait shipping and air ties under GATT. He  added, however, that there is no need at present to show our  cards. Hsiao Wan-chang said that administrative departments  will first have to coordinate with and seek the legislative  departments' approval to negotiate. However, because the time  for joining GATT is rather pressing, we cannot expect to  maintain the pace needed to join GATT if we do not adopt a  package deal in enacting laws.    Administrative departments will also strive to win approval  from the legislative departments. Hsiao Wan-chang said that  because the government has already studied ways to deal with the  issue of holding negotiations on investment and direct  cross-strait shipping and air ties with Communist China after  joining GATT, there is no need to wrestle with these problems at  this point because they will be dealt with after we join GATT.</p>

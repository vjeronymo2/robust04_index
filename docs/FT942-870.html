			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Equity Markets: Liberty Life blazes trail for corporate South Africa - International offerings Liberty Life's Dollars 360m to Dollars 500m global convertible bond offering, due to be priced in two weeks, is likely to prove a landmark issue. A successful deal could pave the way for a spate of financings by South Africa's underborrowed corporate sector; a flop could turn off the tap of international investment before the flow has really started. The deal, for the country's fourth largest company, was approved at cabinet level as a suitable trail-blazer for the return of corporate South Africa to the international capital markets following the first non-racial elections in May. In fact, Robert Fleming, which won the mandate to arrange the offering, did not offer the cheapest terms to the company. But the generous indicated pricing of a 6 to 6 1/2 per cent coupon and a 10 to 12 per cent cent conversion premium for 10-year bonds, non-callable for at least the first five years, was felt to be necessary to attract a broad range of foreign investors. First of all, bearish global market conditions have made international fund managers much more choosy. (In fact, Robert Fleming has indicated that the pricing can be adjusted if the current weakness in world markets worsens.) In addition, South African companies are a little known quantity. The company is doing its best to address this problem, fielding a visit from underwriters and fund managers to Johannesburg last week and hosting a series of roadshows in Asia, Europe and the US this week, when the book-building process begins. In practice, the decision on whether to buy the deal will for many investors be a decision on South Africa. The fiscal discipline of the new government's first budget, presented to parliament by finance minister Mr Derek Keys last week, encouraged investors and the imminent inclusion of the country in the IFC global emerging market index, at 13 per cent, is set to boost interest in South African shares generally. 'Liberty Life is a good proxy for South Africa, and the convertible structure gives it a defensive quality which appeals to more conservative investors,' said one fund manager on last week's trip. For investors viewing the company as proxy, there are several attractive features: its broad range of interests, such as brewing and property, mean that it stands to benefit from domestic economic growth. However, the deal also has a keep-well agreement which gives investors concerned about political risk the added security of Liberty's UK assets, which include Sun Life. Further, the large size of the transaction, which has made some underwriters nervous, is an added incentive for some investors. The South African stock market, with average daily volume this year of Dollars 63m, is not very liquid, and some investors expect the convertible bonds to be easier to trade than the stock. Some fund managers will not be able to buy the bonds even if they want to, because they are not rated. (South Africa itself has yet to be rated.) Further, in the US, where sanctions on South Africa were strongly enforced, some fund managers have not yet received approval to start re-investing. However, the reception of two straight equity offerings for South African companies following May's elections bodes well. A Dollars 67m offering for industrial and mining giant Anglovaal, priced late Thursday at Dollars 27.33, was 2.7 times oversubscribed, according to arranger SG Warburg, with just over half the demand from the US. Meanwhile, a Dollars 70m offering for retailer Pepkor is due to be priced this week.</p>

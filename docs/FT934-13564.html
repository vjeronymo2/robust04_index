			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Direct Line to create 400 jobs DIRECT LINE, the telephone-based motor insurance subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland, yesterday announced the creation of 400 jobs in Leeds within a year through the opening of a fifth regional operations centre in December. The company, which also offers household insurance, has been growing rapidly since its launch in 1985. It has nearly doubled the number of its motor insurance customers to 1.25m during the past year. Direct Line said yesterday that it expected to recruit 400 people to service customers in the Yorkshire area and the north-east. Moreover, the new Leeds property has the capacity to hold 900 people. The company, which is based in Croydon, Surrey, employs 1,900 in Croydon, Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham. Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said that the growth in customers in the north meant that it now needed more than one regional office there. Jobs would include telephone sales and claims-handling positions.</p>

According to these sources, the delegation gave King Husayn  an official request for the king's mediation with Iraqi  President Saddam Husayn. They asked him to help facilitate the  resumption of the Kurdish-Iraqi dialogue on the self-rule  negotiations that started in May 1991 with visits to Baghdad by  Kurdish leaders Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani. The  negotiations came to a halt in July 1992 when the Kurds joined  the opposition delegations visiting Western capitals to ask for  support to topple the regime in Iraq.    The sources said that the Kurds' need to resume the dialogue  with Baghdad appears urgent now with the lack of prospects for  the Kurdish plan in northern Iraq. This is mainly due to  Iranian and Turkish fears over their domestic situations and the  possibilities for division and the redrawing of maps in the  region, which has not seen stability for dozens of years. It is  also due to indications that the international embargo imposed  on Iraq could possibly end next June.    The Jordanian sources say they do not expect King Husayn to  respond quickly to the Kurdish desire out of fear of Arab  reactions, especially since he is now in the process of  normalizing relations with Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Gulf  states. He also fears a new failure in his mediations,  especially since he has not yet recovered from the failure in  his mediation between the parties to the Yemeni crisis.</p>

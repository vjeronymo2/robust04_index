			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POLICE, MUSLIMS CLASH AT SHRINE IN ISRAEL  </P> <P> Riot police today fired tear gas and rubber bullets at thousands of  stone-throwing Palestinians after Muslim prayers at Al Aqsa mosque, one of  Islam's holiest shrines.  </P> <P> Clouds of tear gas rose from the complex at Temple Mount, a Palestinian  national symbol as well as the site of the ancient Jewish Temple destroyed by  the Romans in AD 70. A barrage of shots was heard several hundred yards away.  </P> <P> At least five police officers and three Palestinians were injured, said  Jerusalem police commander Yosef Yehudai.  </P> <P> Austrian television cameraman Wolfgang Scheider was hit in the face with a rock  and collapsed when a barrage of stones were hurled at a building from which  reporters watched the prayers. Scheider was taken to a hospital.  </P> <P> Police said they arrested 37 Palestinians.  </P> <P> A similar protest occurred in the West Bank city of Hebron. Hundreds of  worshipers chanting nationalist slogans stoned troops who opened fire. Four  Palestinians were wounded, and the army clamped a curfew on the city.  </P> <P> The violence in Jerusalem came after 25,000 people attended noon prayers on the  first day of Ramadan, Islam's holy month of fasting and religious fervor. After  prayers, police said 4,000 worshipers raised five outlawed Palestinian flags  and burned two Israeli flags. They chanted "Palestine is Muslim!" and 'Allahu  Akbar!" (God is great).  </P></p>

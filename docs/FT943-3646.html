			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Dalgety Dalgety is a minnow in a sea of food manufacturing whales, facing the constant danger that profitable niche markets will prove vulnerable to assault from larger competitors. It was this phenomenon - in the form of intensifying competition in the UK crisps market - which helped drive margins in the group's food division down from 11.2 to 8.8 per cent last year. Recognising the difficulties, Dalgety yesterday signalled a subtle but significant refinement of its strategy. It is pinning its hopes on the Europe-wide pet foods and food ingredients markets, two segments of the food manufacturing industry where Dalgety reckons it can more than hold its own against giants such as Mars and Unilever. The group will continue to defend its share of the crisps and snacks market in the UK, but will withdraw from continental Europe - hence the sale of its Dutch business in this sector to United Biscuits. Whether this is a complete answer to the strategic issue is unclear. Pot noodles and savoury snacks alone will not secure good returns for Golden Wonder in the UK over the longer term. Ultimately it might make sense to dispose of Golden Wonder so as to finance more rapid expansion in pet foods and snacks. There are benefits in the pipeline from the restructuring undertaken by the new management, but, until Dalgety takes final shape, the main attraction will be its 5.5 per cent yield.</p>

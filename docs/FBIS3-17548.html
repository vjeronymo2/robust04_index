"The West needs Russia as a partner capable of  action in political, economic, and strategic terms," Ruehe  stressed in St. Petersburg at the weekend. A stable Russia is  in the interest of both Germany and Europe as a whole. The West  will therefore continue to support the "political, economic,  social, and military rebuilding process" in the country.  However, Russia must create the conditions for the success of  the reforms itself.    German-Russian relations have always been particularly  important, Ruehe underscored. The friendship between the two  countries is an important pillar of present stability and the  future security order in Europe. The further deepening of  relations, also in the military sphere, is a contribution to  "transparency and predictability" on the continent.    Ruehe is attending a meeting of the "Bergedorfer discussion  round" in St. Petersburg. The association was set up around 30  years ago in Bergedorf near Hamburg. Politicians, military  representatives, scientists, and representatives from  organizations from Europe and American are taking part.</p>

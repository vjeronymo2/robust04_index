			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by the Ricardo Canon from "The Midday Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The next administration, through Vice  President-elect Humberto de la Calle Lombana, today expressed  its fullest support for President Cesar Gaviria in his  initiative to call a referendum as the only solution to  challenge attempts to decriminalize drug consumption in the  country. [begin recording]    De la Calle: President Gaviria's proposal to call  a referendum to reform the Constitution stems precisely from  situations that we have observed. We, too, have questions about  this ruling which today is a legal reality that can only be  removed from the Colombian judicial scene by improving the  Constitution. We applaud the government's decision on this  issue. [end recording]    Meanwhile, President Cesar Gaviria believes there is no way  to implement Constitutional reforms other than through popular  participation.    [Begin recording]    Gaviria: There is no other possible option,  because, while it is true that, in the opinion of the court, the  judicial measure allows legislators to regulate matters related  to age, place, employment, and some other activities in which  drug consumption takes place, unquote [as heard], this is not  enough to ban or penalize drug consumption as a rule, which in  our opinion should be the case. [end recording]</p>

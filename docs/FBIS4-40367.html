			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yan Ulanskiy report under the "Scandal" rubric: "There Is </F> No Keeping V.V. Zh. in Check"]    [Text] Moscow's law and order organs gave the LDPR  [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] a remarkable gift for  Russian Independence Day.    The Investigations Directorate of the Moscow Main Internal  Affairs Administration has turned down a request to start  criminal proceedings against Zhirinovskiy from State Duma  deputies and a STOLITSA magazine journalist who were injured by  V.V. Zh. [Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovskiy] on 8 April (owing to  the absence of corpus delicti). Thus, the LDPR leader gets  carte blanche to use the physiognomies of his political  opponents to relieve the itch in his fists. According to  KURANTY, however, the State Duma deputies do not intend to give  up attempts to get Zhirinovskiy punished, even if not by court,  for the fight in the Duma in April.</p>

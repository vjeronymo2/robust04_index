			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 16 Mar -- The agreement signed by the  defense ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and the  Nagorno-Karabakh military representative with the mediation of  the Russian defense minister in Moscow on 18 February does not  infringe the rights and dignity of any state and should be  observed. This was stated by Army General Pavel Grachev, chief  of the Russian military department, at a meeting with  journalists. He is not satisfied with how the agreement is  being observed as "none of the sides is totally fulfilling the  obligations undertaken." "Unfortunately, percentage-wise the  Azerbaijani side is the one least fulfilling the agreement,"  Pavel Grachev noted.    The leadership of Azerbaijan, in the minister's words, is  categorically against bringing troops into the conflict region,  which would make it possible to withdraw the troops of both  sides some 20-30 km from where they are deployed. Grachev  called this circumstance "a stumbling block."    The Russian defense minister informed journalists that on 15  March he refused to meet the heads of the military departments  of Armenia and Azerbaijan, who arrived in Moscow, and stated  that he does not intend to meet them until they comply with the  agreement which had been signed with his participation.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This final rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). William E. Ludwig, the Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), has certified that this final rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. State and local welfare agencies will be the most affected to the extent that they may be required to modify application forms, add telephone access information to their forms, and modify their verification procedures, however the effect on these entities will be minimal. Participants and applicants will be affected by changes to the application and to procedures in reporting medical expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reporting and recordkeeping burden associated with the certification and continued eligibility of food stamp households is approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under OMB control number 0584&hyph;0064. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The food stamp application, as approved under this OMB number, already contains several important verification statements to the household. The requirement in 7 CFR 273.2(c)(5) that State agencies develop a separate written general ``Notice of Verification'' versus including such information on the food stamp application or verbally conveying such information to households does not alter or change the methodologies used to determine the burden estimates approved under OMB control No. 0584&hyph;0064. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirements in 7 CFR 272.2(a), 272.4(d), and 272.5 relative to the submission and updating of an optional ``Program information activities planning document'' as part of a State agency's Plan of Operation have been submitted to OMB and have been approved under OMB approval number 0584&hyph;0083. This rule amends the table at 7 CFR 271.8 ``Information collection/recordkeeping_OMB assigned control numbers'' to reflect the OMB control number for the approval of burden associated with 7 CFR 272.5 of this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The remaining provisions of this rule do not contain any reporting and/or recordkeeping requirements subject to approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12778 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is intended to have preemptive effect with respect to any State or local law, regulations or policies which conflict with its provisions or which would otherwise impede its full implementation. This rule is not intended to have retroactive effect unless so specified in the ``effective date'' paragraph of this preamble. Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions, all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program, the administrative procedures are as follows: (1) For program benefit recipients_State administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15; (2) for State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities); (3) for program retailers and wholesalers_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 278.8. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 7, 1989 the Department published an interim rulemaking at 54 FR 24518, which implemented several of the food stamp provisions contained in the Hunger Prevention Act of 1988 (Pub. L. 100&hyph;435). Comments were solicited on the provisions of the interim rulemaking through August 7, 1989. The Department received 13 comment letters from State and local welfare agencies and public interest groups. All comments received were reviewed and considered but comments which were unclear or not pertinent to this rulemaking are not addressed in this preamble. For a full understanding of the provisions of this final rule, the reader should refer to the preamble of the interim rule. The provisions of the interim rule addressing specified procedures for claiming the medical deduction are not being finalized in this rule. Those provisions will be addressed in a forthcoming proposed rule entitled Simplification of Program Rules. Also, the provision of the interim rule addressing the delivery of benefits to households which apply after the fifteenth of the month is not finalized in this rule but will be placed in final form in the forthcoming Benefit Delivery final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

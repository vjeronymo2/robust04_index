			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 12 (CTK) -- Czech President Vaclav  Havel firmly believes that the April 10 NATO bombing raid  against the Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde will be the  last real warning that would bring the Bosnian Serbs to the  negotiating table, Havel told CTK and the daily RUDE PRAVO today.    "I have long thought is was necessary that the international  community use stronger means to let it be known that (the Serbs)  cannot do whatever pleases them," Havel said.    Two U.S. Air Force F-16 jets under NATO command attacked  Bosnian Serb units which had entered the southern suburbs of  Gorazde. It was the first NATO air strike against ground  targets in Bosnia.</p>

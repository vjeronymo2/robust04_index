			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Vigorously Carry Out Plans for Key Help-the-Poor Projects </F> and Promote Economic Development in Mountain Regions"]    [Text] From 25 to 27 May, the Anhui provincial party  committee and provincial government held a meeting on the work  of helping poor and mountainous regions in economic development.  The meeting summed up and exchanged experience in helping poor  and mountainous regions in economic development and discussed  the policies, measures, and ways for poor and mountainous  regions to develop the economy and free themselves from poverty.  Responsible comrades of 37 poor counties and mountain counties  (cities), as well as the prefectures, cities, and provincial  departments concerned, attended the meeting.    Lu Rongjing, secretary of the provincial party committee,  and  Governor Fu Xishou delivered important speeches at the meeting.  Wang Zhaoyao, member of the Standing Committee of the provincial  party committee and vice governor of Anhui, conveyed to the  provincial meeting the guidelines of the national meeting on the  work of helping poor regions to develop. Fang Zhaoxiang, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee, presided over the  meeting and gave a summing-up speech.    Other provincial leaders present at the meeting were Yang  Yongliang, Wang Taihua, Chen Jiyu, and Wang Sheyun. Also  present was Cui Jianxiao, adviser to the provincial leading  group the help-the-poor work.    In his speech, Lu Rongjing discussed the following five  points on how to further understand the great significance of  helping poor and mountainous regions in economic development and  how to help them shake off poverty and achieve prosperity as  soon as possible:  <H5>  1. Helping poor and mountainous regions achieve prosperity </H5> sooner is an important economic task, as well as an important  political task, and we must always pay great attention to it.    Lu Rongjing said: To wipe out poverty and achieve a common  prosperity is the essence of socialism, as well as its  superiority. More than one-third of Anhui's counties are rated  as poor counties or marginally poor counties and entitled to  state and provincial aid, and about one-third of the land in the  province is mountainous. It is evident that if the poor and  mountainous regions cannot shake off poverty and achieve  prosperity soon, they will impede Anhui's economic development  and seriously prevent the province from attaining its goal of  becoming fairly well-off on schedule. Most of Anhui's  mountainous regions are old revolutionary base areas,  particularly the Dabieshan region and the southern Anhui  mountainous regions. During both the revolutionary war period  and the socialist construction period, the people in the  mountainous regions have displayed selfless dedication and made  great contributions. Over many years, some poor regions along  the Chang Jiang and the Huai He have repeatedly made great  sacrifices to bear flood losses in the interests of the whole.  We have the obligation to help those regions develop faster and  make the people there improve their living standards sooner.  For this reason, helping poor and mountainous regions achieve  prosperity sooner is not only an important economic task, but  also an important political task.  <H5>  2. To Accelerate Development, Poor and Mountainous Regions </H5> Must Firmly Establish the Notion of Self-Reliance and Hard  Struggle, and Earnestly Rely on Their Own Efforts To Improve  Their Situation.    Lu Rongjing said: Of course, the government will, as always,  help poor and mountainous regions shake off poverty and achieve  prosperity sooner. However, those regions must regard the help  of the government and others merely as a motive force, and they  must mainly rely on their own efforts to improve their backward  situation. In development, poor and mountainous regions indeed  have great difficulties, but they also have great potential. In  particular, they have the advantage of possessing certain  natural resources. With a strong desire to shake off poverty  and achieve prosperity, the people in those regions have an  extremely great initiative and creativity for developing the  economy and improving their backward situation. If the masses  are widely mobilized, their enthusiasm for braving the elements  is aroused, and their potential and strength are brought into  play, they will be able to blaze a new trail and truly shake off  poverty and achieve prosperity.  <H5>  3. It Is Necessary To Consider Local Realities, Give Play to </H5> Local Strong Points and Salient Features, and Constantly Explore  and Improve the Ways of Economic Development for Poor and  Mountainous Regions During the Course of Practice.    Lu Rongjing said: The practice of reform and development has  told us that the concept of economic development has an  important bearing on the speed and efficiency of economic  development as well as on the changes in the economic situation.  The most fundamental way to straighten out an economic  development concept is to adhere to the ideological line of  "emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts," judge  everything by whether it is conducive to the development of  productive forces, and respect the initiative of the masses. We  should consider local realities, find out the right place to  make a breakthrough, and give play to our superiority and  salient features. Any development concept which conforms to  local realities should be upheld persistently and implemented  step by step.  <H5>  4. It Is Necessary To Fully Understand the Opportunities </H5> Created in the Transition From a Planned Economy to a Market  Economy and Make Best Use of it To Vigorously Resolve the  Prominent Issues Existing in Poor and Mountainous Regions.    Lu Rongjing said: Anhui's poor and mountainous regions are  endowed with rich natural and human resources. The gradual  establishment of a market economy has created unprecedented  opportunities and broad prospects for the development of these  regions' resources. We must increase our awareness of current  opportunities and do everything possible to seize them and take  advantage of them. Currently, we must pay special attention to  resolving several prominent issues. First, we must use the  market as our guide to step up structural adjustment. Second,  we must strengthen socialized service and market construction,  and we must unclog distribution. Third, we must increase  investment and strengthen the building of infrastructure.  Fourth, we must improve science and technology education and  raise our population's standards.  <H5>  5. It Is Necessary To Strengthen Leadership Over Work in </H5> Poor and Mountainous Regions, Make Concerted Efforts, Pool All  our Wisdom and Efforts, and Jointly Fulfill our Important  Historic Mission of Helping the Poor Cast Off Poverty and Become  Prosperous.    Lu Rongjing said: Party committees and governments at all  levels in poor and mountainous regions must always help peasants  cast off poverty and become prosperous, and they must regard  this as their foremost task. As always, they should be  duty-bound to strengthen leadership over the work of helping the  poor to develop. We must be resolved to earnestly change our  leadership and work style, go deep into the grassroots and among  the masses, conduct investigation and study in a down-to-earth  manner, and earnestly implement policies on helping the poor to  develop. We must try to discover models, review our  experiences, give different guidance to suit different  conditions, and earnestly carry out work in this respect.    Grass-roots organizations and cadres play a role that will  determine whether or not poor and mountainous regions can  accelerate the pace to cast off poverty and become prosperous.  We must strengthen the functions of towns and townships through  constant in-depth reform to make it possible for town and  township party committees and governments to effectively  exercise their power, more successfully implement the party's  relevant principles and policies, and organize and lead the  masses in carrying out development. Village organizations, which  are on the frontline of helping the poor to develop, are vital  to the success of this work. Therefore, we must earnestly  strengthen the building of party branches at the village level,  particularly by doing a good job of selecting branch  secretaries. We must pay attention to maintaining stability of  cadres in poor and mountainous regions; there should not be  excessive personnel changes.    In his speech, Fu Xishou first analyzed the situation in  helping our province's poor and mountainous regions to develop  and the tasks facing us. He said: Since the beginning of the  Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the  vast number of cadres and masses in our mountainous and poor  regions have upheld reform and opening up, relying on themselves  to build up their regions through thrift and diligence. As a  result, the local economy has developed considerably and their  overall strength has increased notably. In 1993, the 37  counties (cities and districts) accounted for 27 billion yuan of  the GNP, their gross industrial and agricultural output value  reached 47.4 billion yuan, and their revenues totaled 1.4  billion yuan, an increase of 2.5 times, 3.2 times, and 2.2  times, respectively, over 1978. Construction of infrastructure  has steadily increased with more than 5,000 kilometers of  highway opened to traffic, and program-controlled telephones set  up in all of the county towns. Our peasants' per capita income  last year was 636 yuan, an increase of 7.4 times that of 1978.  The number of people below the poverty line in 21 poor counties  has decreased by 3 million from 1985. However, the task of  helping the poor to develop in our province is still difficult.  As a whole, the economy in the mountainous region is still  fairly backward. We must not overestimate our achievements.    Fu Xishou pointed out: To accelerate the pace of helping the  poor and speed up economic development in poor and mountainous  regions, we must successfully carry out the following six tasks  in a down-to-earth manner: 1) We must earnestly do well in  agriculture to lay a strong foundation for the development of  poor and mountainous regions. Anhui's mountainous and poor  regions are endowed with rich agricultural resources and have a  variety of farm produce. However, its rich resources have not  been fully exploited. We must use the market as guide to  comprehensively develop their agricultural resources and  vigorously develop a type of farming that provides high yields  of fine quality with maximum efficiency. With enterprises as  the leader, we should link thousands upon thousands of families  in the regions with domestic and foreign markets and take the  road of forming economic associations that combine agriculture  with manufacturing and trade. 2) We must not let up on the  development of village and town enterprises but vigorously  promote them. We must begin the task by developing whatever  projects are possible, based firmly on actual conditions. We  should respect peasants' choice of types of ownership and allow  them to operate as collectives, individual households, private  enterprises, or shareholdings. We should treat everybody  equally without discrimination. 3) We must run county-owned  industries, particularly state enterprises, effectively. We  should strive to follow market changes with interest, strengthen  technological transformation, readjust the product mix, and  improve enterprise management. 4) We must invigorate commodity  circulation as well as concentrate our efforts on establishing  transportation carriers and improving the circulation  environment. We must do a good job in developing the commodity  market and introducing peasants to the market. 5) We must  insist on promoting development with reform and opening up.  While taking measures to manage collectives' land ownership  well, we must strengthen land-use rights. All localities must  realistically study and formulate specific methods for  quickening forestry and water resource development, so as to  centralize as well as bring about collective operations and  increased efficiency in land-use. 6) We must meticulously  manage our financial and taxation matters to bring them into a  better position as soon as possible. Fu Xishou said:  Governments and departments at all levels must continue to  increase their input in poor and mountainous regions. This  year, the state has decided to increase the amount of existing  funds, with Anhui's development fund for the poor topping 600  million yuan. We must effectively develop education and assist  the poor through science and technology. We must implement the  9-year compulsory education system, develop vocational and  technical education, and train personnel in practical and  specialized skills. We must mobilize all social forces to  jointly undertake the tasks to become well-off. Last year, the  provincial government decided to adopt a system whereby  provincial departments, cities under the jurisdiction of the  provincial government, as well as large- and medium-sized  enterprises were asked to help their counterparts in 21 poor  counties. The policy will be implemented unchanged for several  years until the poor regions cast off poverty. We must  encourage well-off regions to help poor regions. And,  economically developed regions should take the initiative to  help poor and mountainous counties. They should utilize their  edges in technology, personnel, market, information, and  material resources to develop the resources of poor and  mountainous regions through various channels such as economic  cooperation, technical services, employment of labor services,  and product distribution. They should cooperate with these poor  regions in joint development on the basis of mutual benefit and  supplementing one another with individual edges. The provincial  party committee has decided that, beginning this year,  provincial organizations will transfer department-level cadres  to work with their counterparts in poor regions. Prefectural  (city) and county offices will also transfer cadres to work with  townships (towns) and administrative villages to help these  regions cast off poverty more quickly.    Regarding several specific policies on supporting economic  development in mountainous regions, Fu Xishou said: Based on  investigation and study, the provincial party committee and  government have readjusted some policies on mountainous regions  and formulated some new policies and measures, which all  localities and relevant provincial departments must earnestly  implement.</p>

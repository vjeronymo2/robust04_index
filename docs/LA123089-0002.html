			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> When the first annual Police and Fire Invitational Shoot-Out was scheduled, it  seemed a bit unfair to have law enforcement types competing against personnel  who stamp out blazes for a living.  </P> <P> Then again, maybe not. Overall winner of the trap and skeet shoot-out in  Redlands was the Long Beach Fire Department.  </P> <P> We don't know if that makes us feel good about the Fire Department or nervous  about the police.  </P> <P> Another contribution of the L.A. car culture: Owners of expensive jalopies can  now install in their garages hydraulic platforms that will lift their treasures  12 feet off the ground, presumably putting them out of reach of thieves.  </P> <P> The inventor, Car Stacker West of Redondo Beach, charges about $4,500 to put  one car in the air and about $8,500 for a double lift job.  </P> <P> Think of the possibilities: With the car on the rack, you could change your own  oil or rent a grease monkey.  </P> <P> And you could brag about your new architectural style: Mark C. Bloome Moderne.  </P> <P> Considering the purpose of the form, you can't really blame Wolcott's  stationery store downtown for posting this announcement on its counter:  </P> <P> "No bankruptcy kits sent out C.O.D. (cash on delivery) -- except to law firms."  </P> <P> When we reported Friday that some local history buffs have formed the Millard  Fillmore Bicentennial Commission to prepare for the 13th President's 200th  birthday on Jan. 7, 2000, you might have been tempted to ask:  </P> <P> But why should I care about Millard?  </P> <P> Well, it was Fillmore who signed the bill admitting California as the 31st  state on Sept. 9, 1850. There was, however, no celebration that day in L.A.,  which was then a dusty pueblo teeming with about 1,800 people (the exact count  on any day depending on how many people had been killed at the gaming tables  the previous night).  </P> <P> In fact, news of statehood didn't reach L.A. for weeks because the town had no  telegraph, railroad or fax machines.  </P> <P> Talk about ingratitude: L.A. nearly left the state in the mid-1850s, writes  author Midge Sherwood in her recently published "Days of Vintage, Years of  Vision."  </P> <P> At the urging of the southern counties, who felt they paid an unfair burden of  the taxes, a bill was introduced into the state Assembly that would have  divided California into three states: Shasta (the northern portion), California  (the central), and Colorado (the southern, including L.A.).  </P> <P> The bill was approved by the Assembly but died in the state Senate. Had it  passed, USC would be the University of Central Colorado today. An oft-used  expression would be: "It never rains in Colorado. . . ." And singer John Denver  no doubt would have been inspired to write "San Gabriel Mountain High."  </P> <P> Did anyone get the license number of that mattress?  </P> <P> Sonia Duran of Long Beach was directing traffic while her company's float -- a  bed -- was being wheeled into position for the funky Belmont Shore Christmas  Parade. But someone lost control of the bed and it crashed into her, spraining  her ankle.  </P> <P> Said Duran: "My doctor told me, 'I've heard about people falling out of bed,  but never someone getting run over by a bed.' "  </P> <P> Did anyone get the license number of that fireball?  </P> <P> Still no word on the identity of the large, greenish mass that flashed across  the sky Thursday night and prompted hundreds of calls from residents and  pilots.  </P> <P> It wasn't a missing aircraft, said Federal Aviation Administration officials.  </P> <P> It wasn't a spacecraft, the North American Air Defense Space Command said.  </P> <P> It wasn't indigestion, doctors interviewed by The Times agreed.  </P> <P> Whatever, museum guide Rick de la Cruz of the Griffith Park Observatory didn't  seem worried about this ambiguous omen for the new decade. He said the  phenomenon prompted about 10 calls.  </P> <P> An unusual number?  </P> <P> "We get hundreds of calls more about our Laserium shows," he added.  </P> <P> KNX radio's Tom Sirmons predicts that the complaint of the '90s mother to her  grown children will be:  </P> <P> "You don't write, you don't call, you don't fax. . . ."  </P></p>

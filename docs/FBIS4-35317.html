			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Announcer] In Tehran this  morning, officials and authorities of the Islamic system  gathered in Imam Khomeyni's mosque, may he be admitted to God's  paradise, in order to offer congratulations on the occasion of  the auspicious 'Id al-Ghadir Khumm, the 'id of guardianship  [velayat] and imamate, to His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, the  guardian of the cause of Muslims.    [Unidentified Correspondent] At this meeting, the honorable  leader made a speech in which he offered his congratulations on  the occasion of the great 'Id al-Ghadir to the Muslims and  righteousness-seeking people of the world, and the faithful  people of Iran. [passage omitted]    His Eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i described the period of  reconstruction and repair of the damages caused during the war  as a sensitive and important stage in the history of the  revolution. At the end of his speech, he said:    [Begin Khamene'i recording] Today is the stage of  reconstruction. Today the people have the opportunity after a  long war. For this very same sensitive reason, you can see that  the world is attacking the productive policies of the Iranian  people with poisoned arrows from all sides. It engages in  propaganda, it engages in political games, it engages in  security provocations, it engages in economic sabotage. The  enemy does all it can, but thanks be to God, it is not  successful in the majority of cases. In this era, the thing  that can make you victorious, the thing that can build the  nation, the thing that can keep the Iranian people on the  political scene, the thing that can mobilize all forces in this  holy path of construction is holding on to Islamic values with  both hands. [crowd chants] [end recording]    [Announcer] Before the speech by the honorable leader,  Hojjat  ol-Eslam val Moslemin Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the president,  delivered an address in which he offered his congratulations on  the occasion of 'Id al-Ghadir to the honorable leader of the  Islamic revolution. [passage omitted] Speaking about Imam  'Ali's appointment, may peace be upon him, as the guardian of  the Islamic ummah on 'Id al-Ghadir Khumm, the president said:  The Muslim people of Iran rebelled through relying on the  principle of guardianship and created the Islamic system. They  have put the difficult phase of defense and the problems of the  revolution behind them. Today, by using this very same divine  blessing of guardianship, while neutralizing the carefully  worked out plots of the revolution's enemies, it is successfully  going through the difficult period of reconstruction and  economic balance.

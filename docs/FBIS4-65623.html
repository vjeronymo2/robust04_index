			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report]  <H8>  Readership Losses Noted </H8>   The postunification rush of publishers to reestablish or buy  into Berlin newspapers has not led to the increased circulation  figures that were anticipated. Surveying the media situation in  Berlin, the 25 April DER SPIEGEL weekly magazine noted that  cumulative readership loss by Berlin newspapers in the last  three years exceeds 250,000, a trend not even reversed by the  Springer Verlag's flagship, DIE WELT, which, after moving its  offices to Berlin, had 1993 losses of 70 million German marks  [DM]. Eleven newspapers are competing for Berlin's readership  and advertising revenue, making it "Germany's roughest and most  chaotic press market." DER SPIEGEL speculated that "the  combatants are thinking of the dazzling twenties, when 60  dailies were published in the national capital...," noting that  government ministries, offices and associations are still in  Bonn, while the "legions of educated officials everyone dreamed  of," as well as a strong intellectual milieu, are lacking in  Berlin. DER SPIEGEL also reports that Germany's largest  publishers, Axel Springer Verlag and Gruner and Jahr, have  invested triple-digit millions in the Berlin market, which an  unnamed expert sees as a "warmup run for the year 2000," when  the national government is due to complete its move from Bonn to  Berlin.  <H5>  Circulation Losses and Promotion </H5>   The 17 March FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE reported that a recent  meeting of its stockholders expressed concern about its  Berlin-based subsidiary, Deutsche Zeitungsverlag GmbH, publisher  of NEUE ZEIT. The latter daily, once the organ of the GDR's  Christian Democratic Union, has a circulation of only 33,000  (compared to the 1990 figure of 104,000). The paper lost  double-digit millions in 1993, and despite "widely recognized  journalistic achievement and the redesign of the newspaper"--its  unique blue newsprint and expanded eastern coverage, for  example--its hoped for break-even point is expected in four  years at the earliest. The report in DER SPIEGEL noted that  despite costly promotional offers and extensive revisions in  format, smaller publishers are having a hard time sustaining  themselves in the current business environment: DER  TAGESPIEGEL, a conservative and venerable daily, estimated it  would reach 450,000 circulation after unification, equaling its  1946 level, but circulation has stagnated at about 130,000. The  DM100 million invested in its staff and new printing plant have  led to annual losses in double-digit millions, and the new press  has been sold to Springer Verlag. Although a new Gruner and  Jahr plant is being built in Berlin, DER SPIEGEL observed "there  is a shortage of material for so great a capacity. The eastern  Berliners' initial enthusiasm for newspapers from the west is  gone." So, too, is the enthusiasm for the daily BERLINER  ZEITUNG, the former Socialist Unity Party [SED] Berlin bezirk  organ, a favorite of old former party members: its circulation  has fallen from 303,000 at unification to about 250,000, as  reported in IVW circulation bureau figures. Erich Boehme,  one-time editor in chief of DER SPIEGEL, in his fourth year as  publisher of the BERLINER ZEITUNG, was cited in the paper's 25  March issue as saying: "I want to get a foothold in western  Berlin," claiming as inducements the impending introduction of a  larger weekend edition and color presses and the expansion of  the business section.  <H5>  Victims in the Competition </H5>   According to DER SPIEGEL, six Berlin newspapers have folded  since Germany's unification in 1990, and a longtime daily, the  SPANDAUER VOLKSBLATT, has become a weekly. The end may be near  for NEUE ZEIT; JUNGE WELT, once the central paper for the SED's  youth corps; and for the one-time SED national organ, NEUES  DEUTSCHLAND, which suffered a drop in circulation from 1.5  million to 80,000, and is being kept afloat by donations. The  left-leaning western daily, TAGESZEITUNG, just celebrated its  15th anniversary and dismissed its editor in chief for writing  that the editors had become too well-behaved and conservative.  With circulation stagnating at 60,000, down from the 1990 figure  of 100,000, and only 3,500 copies being sold in the east, the  newspaper chose to make its editor a "victim of the rock-hard  competition in the capital's media market," and to replace him  with a former VOGUE editor, in the hope of succeeding in a media  market changing "as fast as men's necktie styles."</p>

In  concluding the conference (Zhang Wenzhu), deputy secretary  general of the provincial people's government, delivered a  speech in which he put forward demands for the province's work  of safe production.    (Zhang Wenzhu) said: The province's situation in safe  production in 1993 was as elsewhere in the country and a peak of  production accidents cropped up again. The number of various  accidents occurring in 1993 reached more than 28,000, resulting  in the deaths of 4,800 persons. This is another large-scale  increase in accidents since the first over-4,000-person  occurrence of deaths recorded in 1992. The economic losses  caused by these accidents last year reached more than 160  million yuan and showed a 45.15 percent increase over 1992.  Traffic accidents left the largest number of persons dead  followed by deaths and injuries caused by industrial and mining  enterprise accidents.    (Zhang Wenzhu) pointed out: The province's situation in safe  production is still unstable though it has been somewhat  alleviated since the beginning of this year. Important and  appalling accidents still continue to occur. For this, the  provincial people's government urges leading personnel at all  levels and the responsible persons of enterprises to resolutely  and successfully deal with the relations between security and  production, between security and economic results, and between  security and reform. A good job should be done in implementing  the tasks of handling these relations.    (Zhang Wenzhu) stressed: We should seize the emphasis and  weak link of safe production and do a good job in conducting  safe production. In particular, we should enhance the security  supervision and inspection over the key industries, trades, and  departments of communications and over coal mines. We should  also do a good job in conducting propaganda and education on  safe production. As for personnel who will be in special posts,  we should employ them through training and keep them in line  with state regulations.    (Zhang Wenzhu) said: According to the state unified  arrangements, we will launch the weekly campaign of safe  production from 16 to 22 May this year. Through the campaign,  we should foster a social environment in which everyone shows  concern for security and pays attention to security in doing  everything.    Listening to the telephone conference at various branch  halls  were leading personnel from the provincial people's government,  from the people's governments of various cities, from the  relevant departments and bureaus under the provincial level  organs and various city level organs, and from the supervisory  and procuratorial departments in charge of security management  --about 300 persons in all.</p>

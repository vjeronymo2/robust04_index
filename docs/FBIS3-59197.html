			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin (DPA) -- The IG Metall metalworkers trade  union has announced that warning strikes will begin in the west  German metallurgical and electrical industry on Monday [31  January]. The announcement was intended to get the stalled wage  negotiations moving again, deputy chairman Walter Riester told  journalists in Bonn today. He accused employers of "sabotaging"  the pay talks. The assumption is not unjustified that some  employers want to start a large-scale dispute all over the  republic.    The legal moratorium on industrial action in the west German  metal and electrical industry ends on Friday.</p>

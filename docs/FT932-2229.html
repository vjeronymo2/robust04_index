			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo weaker ahead of no confidence vote MOUNTING uncertainty over the political situation pushed investors on to the sidelines, and the Nikkei average posted moderate losses on the growing likelihood that Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, would dissolve the lower house for a general election, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index lost 120.97 to 19,804.54 after volatile moves between a high of 19,913.96 at the opening and a low of 19,678.14 in the afternoon. A sharp fall in the futures contract in Singapore triggered arbitrage unwinding, while public funds and investment trusts supported share prices above the 19,600 level. Volume fell to a three-month low of 250m shares against 313m. Declines led advances by 605 to 387 with 164 unchanged, and the Topix index of all first-section stocks fell for the fifth consecutive day, losing 6.27 to 1,587.32. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.35 to 1,202.53. The yen continued to weaken on political fears. The dollar closed Y0.40 higher at Y107.40, and prompted profit taking by foreigners. Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities predicted that the Nikkei would fluctuate within a narrow range next week, with the bottom at 19,300. 'The political situation has been discounted into prices, and unless something drastic happens, the index will find support,' he added. Banks were lower on Topix-linked, arbitrage selling. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to Y2,890 and Sakura Bank fell Y40 to Y1,560. Heavy electricals lost ground with Hitachi down Y12 to Y827, but consumer electronics groups were firmer with Sony up Y50 at Y4,360. In Osaka, the OSE average posted its fifth straight fall, declining 34.97 to 21,954.09 in volume of 16.4m shares. Roundup POLITICAL initiatives, bargain hunting and a buying spree in Bangkok combined to give the region a positive bias. HONG KONG saw late profit-taking which pared gains after Britain and China agreed on the franchise for the projected airport's West Harbour Crossing tunnel project. The Hang Seng index closed 11.65 higher at 7,200.75, 0.9 per cent down on the week, after an early fall of some 85 points, and an afternoon gain of 49 points. Turnover rose from HK4.7bn to HKDollars 4.8bn. The afternoon profit-taking halted rebounds by the airport contractors, Hutchison, which ended down 40 cents at HKDollars 21.20, and Swire Pacific A, down 25 cents at HKDollars 39.75. BANGKOK climbed as foreign institutions joined local investors, Taiwanese and Hong Kong Chinese in a buying spree, brokers said.

Granite Industries put on MDollars 1.00 to MDollars 8.75 on rumours that it had won a timber concession in China.

The BSE index lost 19.43 to 2,214.95. JAKARTA closed at a new high for the year, the index gaining 0.71 to 355.64.</p>

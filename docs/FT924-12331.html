			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Letter: Intervention needed in construction Sir, I have been reading with growing despair the projections and assessments made for the construction sector in your newspaper. The situation may be even more serious than most commentators realise. The points that are regularly overlooked are the leading roles played by the specialist engineering sub-contractors and the levels of liability imposed on them by the rest of the construction industry. The construction site of today is run by a small management team, the site skills belong to the sub-contract specialists. Clients should be aware that these 'providers' are close to collapse. Using the 'plastic mac' theory clients and contractors pass down onerous warranties. These are being signed by companies which are unlikely to survive as recent receiverships prove. Far better properly to select the specialist and pay a fair rate for the work, thereby protecting the future integrity of the warranty. The president of the Board of Trade has confirmed his interventionist tendency; for the ranks of construction specialists he may be too late. We urgently need intervention to promote activity. This could be by reintroducing 100 per cent capital allowances on new industrial buildings, action on the infrastructure programme and help to building materials suppliers with export potential. Allan F Collins, president, British Constructional Steelwork Association, 4 Whitehall Court, London SW1A 2ES</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Letter: Abta funds in healthy state Sir, You reported ('Plans to widen rescue funds for package tour customers', July 22) that a new fund has been proposed to add further protection for package holidaymakers. However, your story comments on difficulties in the travel trade 'with the Association of British Travel Agents recently admitting that its passenger rescue fund will be exhausted if another holiday group collapsed'. The fund which your story refers to is indeed the Air Travel Trust Fund, which is administered by the Civil Aviation Authority - not Abta. May I assure you and your readers that Abta's funds are in a very healthy state and, as indeed your article goes on to confirm, the association has access to bonds of a value of up to Pounds 400m. Michael Grindrod, president, Abta, 55-57 Newman Street, London W1P 4AH</p>

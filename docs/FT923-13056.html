			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Westpac to quit London Eurobond market WESTPAC yesterday became the last Australian bank to give up a significant presence in the London-based Eurobond market, following the departure of the ANZ group two years ago. The bank's decision, which resulted in the loss of 20 jobs, also signals the poor return on capital earned by some banks in the Eurobond market, despite the high level of bond issuance this year. The bank's departure leaves the Australian dollar section of the international bond markets almost entirely in the hands of non-Australian banks, led by Hambros and Deutsche Bank. Westpac said the move was part of its strategy of concentrating on domestic customers. The bank had been active mainly as a trader of Eurobonds, rather than an underwriter, and so did not consider the operation essential. Bond trading had been only marginally profitable and did not justify the ADollars 50m (USDollars 37.3m) of capital tied up in running its trading positions, the bank said. Instead, it said it will use the capital in higher-margin areas, such as commodity and equity derivatives and swaps. In a further move to trim its London operations, Westpac said it would limit its corporate banking activities in the UK almost exclusively to servicing Australian clients. The decision is expected to lead to further redundancies. Westpac also announced the closure of its nine-person Paris branch.</p>

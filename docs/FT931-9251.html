			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Bonds: Public authority sector is fast opening up STATES, departments, autonomous regions, municipalities, communities, cities  - a motley procession of new public-sector credits from around Europe is fast opening up one of the biggest new areas of the international bond markets. Last week, the Bank for Dutch Municipalities -  a specialist credit institution for local and other authorities in the Netherlands -  made its debut in the Swiss franc market, raising SFr200m. Next week, the autonomous Spanish region of Andalucia will come to the international bond market for the first time. It follows hot on the heels of the Basque region and the city of Madrid, both of which made their first appearances last year. European borrowers like these still have a long way to go to rival the Canadian provinces and Australian states, which remain the biggest of the so-called 'quasi-sovereigns' in the Eurobond market (a heterogeneous collection of public-sector entities, also known as 'sub-nationals'). Canada's provinces raised more than Dollars 7bn between them internationally last year, with some Dollars 5.5bn accounted for by Ontario, according to IFR Securities Data. On Friday, Quebec stepped forward with the announcement of its first global offering, hoping to raise at least CDollars 1bn -  apparently undaunted by the fact that more than CDollars 6bn of bonds have already been issued in the international market this year, much of which is reported to be still sitting on underwriters' books. Nor is Europe about to get its own version of the US 'muni' market, the bustling debt marketplace for thousands of small-scale borrowers from school to sewerage districts. Decentralisation of government may have been a popular cause across Europe in recent years, but it hasn't got that far yet. However, the ranks of new European credits swells by the week. Moody's, the US rating agency, has given ratings to six regions or cities in Spain in the last 18 months, along with five departments or regions in France. There has also been much gossip about which of the UK local authorities will be first back into the capital markets, following a decade-long absence. There are several reasons for this new wave. In part it reflects a general desire by national governments in Europe to subject local authorities to capital market disciplines, forcing them to take a tighter control of their finances. Also, the quasi-sovereigns are being squeezed out of their domestic capital markets by the growing funding needs of their national governments, forcing them increasingly to look abroad, says Mr David Levey, head of sovereign credit ratings at Moody's. Political motives could also play their part. Local government borrowing generally by-passes national government balance sheets, helping to reduce the apparent deficits of some countries. This could help to bring UK authorities to the capital markets: they borrow most of their money at present from the National Works Loan Board, which itself is funded through gilt sales. Weaning them off the PWLB would help to ease the mounting pressure of gilt sales. What are investors to make of this rag-bag of new borrowers? Some occasionally look and feel as though their credit is as good as the nation-states of which they are a part. In practice, that may not be the case. 'Investors have had their fingers burnt on quasi-sovereigns before,' says Mr Hugh Corbett, head of bond research at UBS in London. 'When things go wrong, they're often more quasi than sovereign.' The swaps fiasco in the UK, which revealed that local authorities were acting ultra vires by dealing in the derivatives markets, alerted international investors to look more closely at the complex legal environment in which such entities operate. And the financial difficulties of several French cities in recent years, most prominently Anguoleme, have underlined the credit risk. Implicit guarantees from national governments need close scrutiny, say bond market specialists -  along with the revenue-raising powers of authorities, and any limitations on borrowing. But for investors looking for a yield pick-up over sovereign bonds, the public authority market could yet prove one of the biggest new areas around.</p>

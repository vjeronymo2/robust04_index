			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the leader of the Communist Party of  the Russian Federation, Gennadiy Zyuganov, the national crisis  has acquired the traits of a trench civil war interrupted by  ever more violent attacks on the people. Zyuganov was  addressing the party's national conference in the city of  Zvenigorod near Moscow, on Saturday.    He said that owing to social degradation and the  impoverishment of the population, mounting tensions could erupt  in a spontaneous rebellion of marginalized elements and in an  all-out war for the division of what remained of public property.    If this kind of a rebellion did take place, the party would  aim to channel the masses' energy into the mainstream of class  struggle for the labor masses' vital interests. The Zyuganov  party rejected even the fairest of civil wars.    Zyuganov assigned strategic priority to civic peace as the  main condition for coping with the crisis and transition to  socialism.    Also, the Communist party of the Russian Federation intended  to build a broad coalition of left-wing, centrist-oriented,  patriotic and democratic forces which would be able to  neutralize the party of civil war and hold it in political,  economic and moral isolation.    Thirdly, the Zyuganov party aimed to lead the left-wing  coalition to power by either carrying a general election or with  the help of some other non-violent means.    The party's chief objective, according to Zyuganov, was the  creation of an updated union of republics and the declaration of  the Minsk decision on the abrogation of the treaty of union as  null and void.    In Zyuganov's view, the executive branch of national power  felt irresponsible because it reported to no one and the  legislative branch - because it enjoyed no rights. He  suggested redistribution of powers between the two branches and  more work on the national checks and balances system. He  called, among other things, for:    - moves to build bridges between the two houses of the  Russian parliament and outline their joint authority over,  primarily, relations with the executive branch;    - full operational subordination of the Ministries and  government agencies to the prime-minister and more clarity on  the authority and functions of the president and his men;    - holding the government accountable to the legislative  branch and for the endowment of the Federal Assembly with the  right to make decisions on the government's staff and structure,  confirm or reject choices for prime-minister and government  programs, as well as initiate, in case the government deviated  from a confirmed course, moves to unseat the government;    - the exclusion of TV and radio authorities from the system  of the executive branch;    - the restoration of all the echelons of the legislative  branch and for holding all echelons of the executive branch  accountable to the corresponding echelons of the legislative  branch, as well as the reincorporation of the municipal  governments into the system of state power.</p>

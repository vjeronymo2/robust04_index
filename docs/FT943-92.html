			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Trading reformed on Amsterdam SE The Amsterdam Stock Exchange is scheduled to open an hour later than normal today to allow brokers, banks and jobbers to cope with wide-ranging reforms to the bourse's trading system. When trading begins at 10:30am, the exchange will be split into retail and wholesale sectors for the first time, forcing the jobbers, known as 'hoekmen' in Dutch, to adjust to a new role as market specialists along the lines of their counterparts on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock exchange closed at noon yesterday, 4 1/2 hours ahead of its normal closing time, to enable workmen to re-route telephone lines and also to give brokerage houses and jobbers the time to reprogramme their computer screens. The Amsterdam reforms, introduced after years of debate and controversy, are designed to help the Dutch capital recapture trading in Dutch equities that has seeped over the years to London. 'We need and want to confirm our role as the price leader in Dutch equities,' the exchange's chairman, Baron Boudewijn van Ittersum, said. The changes will allow Amsterdam to retain its trading floor for retail orders, where transactions are based on matching supply and demand through a central auction system. However, at the same time it will be trying to compete with Seaq International in London by introducing two screen-based systems for the new quote-driven wholesale market. One of the screen systems will enable market-makers to advertise bid prices, the other will allow them to trade directly on screen. The new-style 'hoekman' will be expected to act as an arbitrageur between the two systems and, effectively, link them together. Mr van Ittersum said Amsterdam chose to launch the new system on a Friday so it could iron out any problems that developed over the weekend in time for Monday. Eventually, once regulatory and other issues are resolved, foreign brokers and banks will be able to trade on the Amsterdam exchange from their bases in London or from other financial centres.</p>

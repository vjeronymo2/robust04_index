"We can't go on indefinitely  asking countries quite far away from fighting to make  sacrifices, if there is no readiness of the parties to make  peace," he told a press conference at the end of a visit to  Sofia. Bulgaria is one of the Central European countries whose  trade and economy have been badly hit by the United Nations  embargo against Serbia and Montenegro, the rump Yugoslavia.    "I do not favour lifting sanctions," Owen added. "It would  be premature. But I don't think the status quo can carry on  indefinitely."    "Sanctions are applied for a purpose... to achieve a  settlement," Owen said. "If there is no way at the end of the  day to achieve a settlement, questions would be asked about  sanctions. But we have yet not reached that state."    Owen and his UN co-mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg had talks  here Thursday with President Zhelio Zhelev and Foreign Minister  Stanislav Daskalov before going on Friday to Albania in a tour  of Yugoslavia's neighbours.    In Tirana, presidential spokesman Genc Pollo said they saw  President Sali Berisha. Albania has expressed concern about the  war spreading to Kosovo, the restive northern province of Serbia  which has a 90 percent Albanian population, or Macedonia,  another former member of the Yugoslav federation.</p>

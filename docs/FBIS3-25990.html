Governor Tian  Chengping and Vice Governor Wang Hanmin attended and the  addressed the meeting.    Wang Hanmin stressed: In this year's foreign trade and  economic relations, we should further deepen reform and firmly  abide by the line of macro-foreign trade. This is the  fundamental way to increase vitality in foreign trade  enterprises. We should unify our policies, carry out operations  openly, engage in fair competition, assume sole responsibility  for profits and losses, combine economy with foreign trade, and  seek new ways of reform in light of our specific conditions. We  should build export commodity bases in a planned way in  accordance with international market demands, introduce  conglomeration, jointly develop production by allowing others to  buy shares, and form enterprise groups. [passage omitted]    Wang Hanmin pointed out: This year, we should continue to  carry out the strategy of market diversification and triumphing  over others by means of good quality. In the course of  consolidating and developing the existing network and foreign  trade relations, foreign trade and export enterprises in the  province should also explore markets in developing countries so  that we will have trade partners all over big continents. In  the meantime, all localities and departments should regard  foreign economic relations and foreign capital as a basis for  foreign trade development. [passage omitted]    Governor Tian Chengping hoped that other departments in the  province would actively cooperate with foreign trade departments  in promoting foreign economic relations and trade.</p>

			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (5): Plenty of surprises here - Consultant's critique IMAGINE a bookie who stands to lose everything if a horse called 'Storm and Flood' wins the 3:30 at Goodwood. Now imagine the same bookie being unaware of that fact. It seems incredible but that is the position that Alexander Howden claims many of their clients are in. I found it hard to believe that insurance companies might be unaware of the geographical risks that they were taking. If true, rapid enlightenment is in order for their managers. The system that Mr Roberts showed me seemed an obvious application of the MapInfo software. It was not particularly well done, having the marks of a system put together by computer novices. In many ways it reminded me of the early days of spreadsheets. Then, users wrote truly horrible Lotus 1-2-3 macros that did what they wanted but were a nightmare for anyone else to change. The comparison is not altogether surprising as geographical information systems are still in their infancy. I believe that the system now needs revision and improvement from IT specialists. Non-computer people have a tendency to re-invent wheels and to be unaware of all the possibilities available. It seemed suprising to me that the IT department had not been involved at all. In my experience, it is rare for technical staff to turn up their noses at working with leading-edge software. Perhaps they were stuck in the mainframe mentality that sees PCs as an attack on their power base, rather than an opportunity. I hope not. Having said all this, the system is producing real benefits. It replaced a tedious system (of colouring maps by hand) with a graphics package and can offer far more refined risk analysis. While it may have rough edges, it is generating revenue. Lessons learned from this study: Modern software tools empower users to develop their own solutions outside IT departments. Non-software people generally write poor software. Even if it does what they want now, it is rarely possible to extend it later. Earning revenue is more important than having a technically perfect solution The author is a consultant with Software Design and Construction of Milton Keynes</p>

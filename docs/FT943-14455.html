			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Abbott Mead to purchase Redwood for Pounds 2.85m Abbott Mead Vickers, the advertising group, announced yesterday that it had agreed to buy Redwood Publishing, the contract publisher, best-known for its American Express, Marks and Spencer, and InterCity magazines, for an initial cash payment of Pounds 2.85m. AMV also said 537,879 new ordinary shares were being placed by Hambros Bank at 660p apiece to raise Pounds 3.35m, net of expenses. The balance will be used by Redwood as additional working capital. Brokers are SG Warburg and dealing is expected to start tomorrow. Four additional payments, dependent on Redwoods' performance until the end of 1998, are also to be made. Redwood's unaudited pre-tax profits for the first five months of 1994 were Pounds 300,000. AMV shares rose 1p to close at 670p. Mr Peter Mead, AMV group chief executive, said that customer magazines had come of age over the past few years and Redwood's magazines were 'carefully focused towards existing customers of each of their clients'. There was considerable synergy between AMV's and Redwood's activities, and the purchase was part of the group's strategy of offering integrated marketing to clients, he said. Redwood was formed in December 1993 after the BBC, which partly owned the company's predecessor, WPL, decided to sell its contract publishing interests, retaining just its consumer magazines. Mr Michael Potter and Mr Christopher Ward, founders and senior directors of Redwood, will run the business as a separate company within the AMV group.</p>

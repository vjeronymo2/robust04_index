			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAMMER WINS BUSH PARDON IN VOTING LAW CASE  </P> <P> President Bush pardoned Los Angeles industrialist Dr. Armand Hammer on Monday,  ending a decade-long quest by the 91-year-old founder of Occidental Petroleum  Corp., who had pleaded guilty to making illegal contributions to President  Richard M. Nixon's 1972 campaign.  </P> <P> White House officials, who normally do not release the names of people granted  pardons, confirmed that Hammer was one of 10 pardoned by Bush on Monday after  Hammer announced the decision in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I deeply appreciate President Bush's action in clearing my name," Hammer said  in a prepared statement. "Having spent my lifetime fighting injustice, this  vindication reinforces my abiding faith in the American system of justice."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long Quest  </P> <P> Hammer had been seeking a pardon almost since the moment he pleaded guilty -- a  second time -- in 1976.  </P> <P> Associates have said that he and attorneys who represented him were deeply  disappointed last year when then-President Ronald Reagan failed to include  Hammer in a final round of pardons issued shortly before he left office. At the  time, Reagan pardoned New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, whose legal  troubles, like Hammer's, resulted from contributions made to Nixon's reelection  fund.  </P> <P> Hammer pleaded guilty twice to three misdemeanor charges involving $54,000 in  illegal contributions to Nixon's 1972 reelection. The first time was in  October, 1975, when Hammer pleaded guilty in federal court in Washington to the  charges, which had been filed by the Watergate special prosecutor's office.  </P> <P> But only days after entering the plea, Hammer sent a letter to his probation  officer blaming the crimes on Occidental executive Timothy Babcock, a former  governor of Montana. Prosecutors initially had learned of Hammer's involvement  in the illegal payments from Babcock, who had pleaded guilty to a related  charge in 1974 and received a four-month jail sentence.  </P> <P> After hearing of Hammer's letter, U.S. District Judge Walter B. Jones voided  Hammer's guilty plea and ordered him to stand trial. The case was subsequently  moved to federal court in Los Angeles after doctors for Hammer told the judge  that a heart ailment had made the industrialist too frail to travel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Left Hospital  </P> <P> In March, 1976, under threat of a felony indictment, Hammer left a Los Angeles  hospital and appeared before U.S. District Judge Lawrence T. Lydick.  </P> <P> Sitting upright in a wheelchair during a 20-minute court hearing, Hammer  admitted in a soft but firm voice that he had concealed illegal campaign  contributions to Nixon. He said he was "pleading guilty because I am guilty and  not to avoid a trial."  </P> <P> At his sentencing later, the millionaire oilman told Lydick: "This was the  first time I have been charged with a criminal offense and I greatly regret my  actions." He was fined $3,000 and placed on one year's probation.  </P> <P> As he later wrote in an autobiography, Hammer almost immediately "set out to  clear my name." He contended that an investigation he had started had turned up  "exonerating evidence," which became part of his plea for a pardon.  </P> <P> Hammer was unavailable to comment Monday on what that evidence might be.  </P> <P> In his long and colorful career, the Bronx-born Hammer, who was educated as a  medical doctor, has been an enormously successful industrialist, who developed  a remarkable relationship with the Soviet Union. He has met every Soviet leader  since Lenin.  </P> <P> With his wealth, Hammer has collected fine art, endowed museums and contributed  to cancer research with tens of millions of dollars in gifts.  </P> <P> After the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union in 1986, Hammer  financed trips by American physicians to treat radiation victims.  </P> <P> David Lauter reported from Washington and John Kendall from Los Angeles. Staff  writer Ronald J. Ostrow in Washington contributed to this story.  </P></p>

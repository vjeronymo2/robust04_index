			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tim Kelsey and Martin Himmelheber in Rottweil: </F> "Trial Told Britain Beat Arms Embargoes"]    [Text] British officials helped the export of arms to  banned countries in the mid-1980`s on a far greater scale than  has been revealed to the Scott inquiry, with its remit  restricted to arms to Iraq, according to evidence being given in  a German court case.    The East German security services and the Contra rebels in  Nicaragua were said to be among recipients of arms routed  through Britain, in defiance of international agreements.  Officials with the Royal Ordnance, then the state-run arms  company, provided falsified documents, it has been claimed.    The allegations, made during the prosecution of the managing  director of the leading German machine-gun-maker, Heckler &amp;  Koch, suggest a patter of repeated disregard for international  arms embargoes by the British Government's arms manufacturer.    Royal Ordnance -- which was privatised and sold to British  Aerospace in 1987 -- is being accused of helping Heckler &amp;  Koch  to evade restrictions on exporting its compact machine-guns and  rifles, which are favoured by special forces all over the world,  including the British Special Air Service.    The prosecution alleges that the British company did that by  pretending to import the weapons into Britain as the "end-user"  and then exporting them to their real destinations, many of  which were affected by German, and in some cases, international  embargoes. Sources close to the prosecution have told the  INDEPENDENT that they have evidence of 50 examples over 10 years.    The case is focusing on a shipment of 1,100 Heckler &amp;  Koch  machine-guns, some of which were seized in Italy in 1987 on  their way to the United Arab Emirates, a destination banned  under German law.    Their true destination, however, was thought to be Iraq,  according to the Italian police, who made the original arrests  in 1987. The ship, which had sailed from Liverpool, was sailing  under the flag of Qatar and the police noted 17 officers of the  Iraqi Navy among the 23 sailors.    The court has been told that the guns were allegedly  assembled from German parts at the Royal Ordnance small arms  division's factory in Enfield, north London. Royal Ordnance  added the firing pins to the finished weapons and procured false  documents showing they were destined for use in Britain. The  prosecution has claimed that Royal Ordnance's role was to "build  a smokescreen."    Walter Lamp, the managing director of Heckler &amp; Koch,  based  in Oberndorf, in Baden-Wuerttemberg, is pleading not guilty to  breaching German law on weapons exports, arguing that he was not  personally responsible for export licensing. If convicted, he  could face up to 10 years in prison.    Apart from shipments to the Middle East, German customs  officials have alleged at the trial that Royal Ordnance was  involved as a "middleman" helping Heckler &amp; Koch to export  guns  to East Germany. At least 300 Heckler &amp; Koch weapons have  been  found since reunification in the possession of the former  communist security forces and police. Parts allegedly went from  Oberndorf to England, where the guns were assembled and then  shipped to Rostock.    The prosecution has issued a statement stating that Heckler  &amp;  Koch weapons were also found in Nicaragua in the possession of  the Contra guerrillas in 1986. The statement alleges that the  weapons went via Royal Ordnance.    The case, which has been adjourned for Christmas, has  attracted extensive media attention in Germany.    Sources close to the German prosecution are not clear to  what  extent the British Government knew of the company's alleged  activities with Heckler &amp; Koch before its 1987 privatisation  and  sale to British Aerospace. In 1991, Royal Ordnance bought  Heckler &amp; Koch.    British Aerospace told the INDEPENDENT: "The alleged events  took place before Royal Ordnance purchased Heckler &amp; Koch. It  is an individual that is on trial, not the company, and it is  inappropriate for British Aerospace to comment any further."</p>

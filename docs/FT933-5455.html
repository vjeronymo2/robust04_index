			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Murdoch rails at critics MR Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, last night responded to a bitter attack by The Independent newspaper on his plan to cut the price of The Times to 30p on weekdays. The Independent changed its front page yesterday to accuse Mr Murdoch of trying to 'drive this newspaper, The Independent, and The Independent on Sunday out of business'. The editorial adds: 'Without any new editorial ideas and without any belief in The Times as a newspaper, Murdoch has decided to crush his nearest rival with the power of money.' The paper said that Mr Murdoch knew the Independent was at 'a turning point' with advertising starting to pick up after three years of recession. Mr Murdoch said last night: 'I think it's a bit rich of Andreas Whittam Smith (The Independent's founder), particularly when he was only able to launch his paper because of what we did at Wapping. He also closed the Sunday Correspondent and tried to do the same to The Observer.' There was also a hostile reaction to The Times price cut plan from other broadsheet rivals yesterday. Mr Joe Cooke, managing director of The Telegraph group, described the decision as 'the last gasp of a failed editorial policy. The paper has had five editors since 1991'. The Daily Telegraph, 48p during the week, would not be responding to the price cut and would continue, Mr Cooke said, to develop the editorial quality of the paper and charge the right price for it. The Guardian declined to comment but it is thought unlikely that it will cut its 45p cover price. The Financial Times will remain at 65p. The two main middle market papers - The Daily Mail and the Daily Express - will now be 2p more expensive than The Times. Up for grabs, Page 14; Observer, Page 15</p>

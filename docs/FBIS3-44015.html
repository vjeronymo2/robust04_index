After the  speech made by Marcolino Moco last Wednesday, it was Eduardo dos  Santos' turn to reshuffle the army, the police, and navy for  what he described as a national requirement for 1994. The  reshuffle was undoubtedly a sign of return to belligerence when  Angola is already very tired of war. Observers view his decrees  as very troublesome.</p>

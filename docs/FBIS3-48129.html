			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television Network in  Japanese at 2230 GMT on 22 January, in its regularly-scheduled  "News 2001" program, carries a 60-minute live relay of a  roundtable debate participated in by Yoshiro Mori, general  secretary of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP); Koken Nosaka,  chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan's (SDPJ) Diet  Affairs Committee; and Kozo Watanabe, general secretary of  Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party).    Former SDPJ Secretary General Hirotaka Akamatsu, and  Masatoshi Ito, one of the SDPJ upper house members who voted  against the government-proposed political reform bills on 21  January, join in the debate via remote hookup in the latter part  of the program which is moderated by newscasters Yuji Kuroiwa  and Kaori Matsuyama.    After a lengthy introduction of the guests, moderator  Kuroiwa  at 2238 GMT begins the discussion by noting the reform bills  were rejected unexpectedly by the upper house, and asks Mori of  the LDP how he feels about it. Mori, though speaking on behalf  of the opposition camp, says it was "very regrettable" and adds:  "While the Diet is a forum for the representatives of the  people, it was unable to understand the bills." The LDP general  secretary says, "Another point to note -- aside from the  question of the substance of the bills -- is that this body --  the House of Councillors -- is independent, and is separate from  the House of Representatives. This fact has been more or less  ignored by many, particularly by those of the ruling parties,  and the members of the House of Councillors have been angered by  it."    Asked how he feels about the voting results, the SDPJ's  Nosaka also says it was "very regrettable" that the bills were  rejected. Nosaka says: "The party must, once again, do all it  can do to have the bills passed during the current session of  the Diet."    After some introductory remarks by the newscasters and a  review of the political scene by guest political commentators,  full-fledged debate starts at 2338 GMT. Moderator Kuroiwa asks  Mori to comment on reports that the LDP wants the bill dealing  with political corruption to be taken up first, ahead of other  bills. Mori explains the history of why the efforts for  political reform started, recalling, "The people became  disappointed with close ties between politics and money, as well  as by scandals involving politicians, and they started to  distance themselves from politics. Political reform started  about six years ago from the desire to do something about this  situation."    Asked whether Mori believes the bill on political corruption  should be acted on ahead of other bills during the one-week  remaining of the current Diet session, he says there are some  who think that way, but he declines to give his own view.    Kuroiwa asks Mori if the LDP would agree to pass the bills  if  the coalition accepts amendments to the bills proposed by the  LDP before the bills are put to the vote. Mori responds: "The  bills were in fact scrapped, and rejected. Now that this has  happened, the various organizations within the party have to  agree on a policy to deal with the matter. I think that will be  done on Monday (24 January) or Tuesday."    At 2256 GMT, Shinseito's Watanabe is asked to give his view.  Watanabe notes that the LDP leadership made a proposal to his  party on changes in the government bills last week. Watanabe  says his party is willing to make daring concessions in  accepting the terms of the LDP in the forthcoming negotiations.    The moderator recalls that the terms demanded by the LDP  include one on accepting political fund contributions by  business organizations, and asks Nosaka of the SDPJ if his party  can accept such a condition. Nosaka says his party cannot  accept everything in the LDP terms, but adds his party is  willing to negotiate as much as possible and make a final  decision after the negotiations are completed.    At 2304 GMT, the SDPJ's Ito, one of the rebels who voted  against the political reform bills in the upper house session,  is asked to comment via the remote hookup. Ito insists that  what the people of the nation really want in political reform is  to prevent political corruption and that, as such, what is  needed is a bill dealing with corruption. He says the election  system has nothing to do with political corruption.    At 2305 GMT, moderator Matsuyama asks Akamatsu if the  SDPJ upper house members who voted against the bills will be  expelled from the party. Akamatsu says: "I asked Chairman  Murayama and Secretary-General Kubo to deal strictly with or  expel from the party the rebels who ignored the party resolution  and voted against the bills at a critical time for the SDPJ.  Mr. Murayama and Mr. Kubota, needless to say, said they would  deal strictly with the rebels because the situation this time  was completely different from the time when some SDPJ lower  house members voted against the bills."    Asked what he thinks of Akamatsu's comment, Ito says the  SDPJ  mainstream was to pass the bill on prevention of political  corruption first. Akamatsu immediately refutes this, saying:  "The party convention, held on 11 and 12 January, unanimously  agreed to resolutely promote political reform." He adds that  "those who cannot abide by the party resolution have no right to  remain in the party." Nosaka agrees with Akamatsu and says:  "We will have a meeting with local representatives at 1500  (0600 GMT) on 26 January to hear what they have to say. We will  also listen to the opinions of the party's upper house  executives. After that, we will deal strictly with the rebels."    At 2309 GMT, Kobayashi points out that public disclosure of  their internal problems will be a big blow to the SDPJ, and that  it may be better to split the party into two because the  so-called rebels have different beliefs from other SDPJ members.  Nosaka responds to Kobayashi, saying that although there are  many different opinions, the party has been very democratic in  determining party resolutions or in finding "the greatest common  denominator."    Going back to the issue of political reform, Kuroiwa asks  Watanabe what the coalition parties are going to do about the  bills during the remaining period of the current Diet session.  Watanabe says: "Of course, we will call for a joint conference  of the two houses. This is our constitutional right." He also  explains the need to hold a top-level meeting between Prime  Minister Hosokawa and LDP President Kono to settle the political  reform issue.    Asked what he thinks of the proposal to hold such a meeting,  Mori says: "As I briefly explained earlier, I think it is a  good idea. However, the important thing is whether Mr. Hosokawa  has discretionary power." Mori then criticizes Prime Minister  Hosokawa for lack of leadership and failing to have the  political reform bills approved.    As for the possibility of dissolving the lower house, and  thereby forcing a general election, Watanabe and Mori agree that  the time is not right because the government has many "important  and imminent tasks," including the Japan-U.S. summit and budget  compilation.    The live relay ends at 2330 GMT.</p>

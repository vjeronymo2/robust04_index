			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by Lotte Henriksen, deputy chairman of the </F> Social Democratic Party (SDP) Folketing group: "Denmark Places  Great Emphasis on East European Aid"]    [Text] BERLINGSKE TIDENDE has devoted a lot of energy to  discrediting Development Minister Helle Degn's credibility. The  newspaper put a discussion of whether the minister was quoted  correctly in connection with the selection of the Foreign  Ministry's East European Aid Committee, which deals with  technical and administrative aid, on the front page. A formality  that suddenly became interesting.    However, the newspaper did not find it interesting a month  earlier when the entire Folketing (with the exception of the  Progress Party) agreed on the total substance during an  interpellation concerning the whole future of East European aid.  At any rate it was not on the front page or subsequent pages.  That is a pity, for the interesting discussion was important.    People should take a stand on how East European aid is to be  administered and prioritized in the future if only because of  the large sums of money that are involved. More than 2 billion  kroner has been set aside for East European aid in 1994, which  corresponds to one-third of what is spent on aid in the rest of  the world.    This money can be a good investment if it is used correctly.  The money can help stabilize the budding democracies in the  former communist countries, and reducing water and air pollution  will also improve the Danish environment. At the same time, it  is realized that there is reason to fear unrest and refugees  from these countries unless we help them get off to a good start.    Denmark has something to contribute to this kind of good  start in several areas:    In the environmental and energy sector Denmark is on the  leading edge of development. We have good possibilities for the  continued development of environmental technology and knowledge,  and with a goal-oriented effort we could also help Danish firms  to increase exports.    The government's new report on trade and industry points to  the need to develop the welfare sector. Denmark has a lot of  experience and expertise in this area that could be utilized to  export systems. Among other things it mentions the possibility  of exporting services to countries in East and Central Europe. A  concrete positive example is systems exports in the gerontology  area.    It is necessary to make a connection between expanding the  social networks in the East European countries and building up a  market economy. Just as an expanded commercial infrastructure is  necessary to help the Danish commercial sector build up exports.  In the future this will provide opportunities in energy,  communications, and transportation projects, as well as housing  and education projects.    The labor market is also relevant to systems exports. A  solid  labor market system contributes to political stability and firms  that are already partly owned by western capital are demanding  parity and cooperative organs. The Danish provisions for aid to  the East should include conditions on good job environment and  social safety net considerations.    This will counteract "social dumping" from the East, and at  the same time, enable us to improve employment here at home by  exporting services and welfare programs.    All this will be discussed in the weeks ahead by the East  European Aid Committees that have been set up in several of the  ministries. It will be debated by the Folketing spokesmen on  East Europe and the minister in charge of the area.</p>

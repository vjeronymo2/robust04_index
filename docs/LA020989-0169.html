			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Donald Trump hired former top casino regulator Mike Rumbolz to head his Nevada  operations, an indication that the financier intends to become an active player  in that state's gambling industry. Trump, who recently sold a large part of his  New Jersey gambling empire to Merv Griffin, last month got federal antitrust  clearance to buy more than 15% of the stock of Caesars World Inc., which owns  one of the premier Las Vegas hotel-casinos, Caesars World. Rumbolz, whose term  as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board expired in December, said he had  been negotiating with Trump since January.  </P></p>

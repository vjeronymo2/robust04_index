			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Dutch telecoms group plans to cut 3,000 jobs The Dutch telecommunications and postal group, KPN, said yesterday it would cut 3,000 jobs over the next three years in its telecommunications business. It is the first round of job losses since the company was partially floated on the Amsterdam stock exchange in June. PTT Telecom, KPN's telecommunications arm, said the job losses, representing nearly 10 per cent of its workforce of 31,981 people, were necessary to boost productivity. It hopes to be able to shed most of the jobs through natural attrition, avoiding the need for large and potentially controversial forced redundancies. 'Increasing productivity is necessary if the company wants to continue delivering high-quality services at low prices in a fully deregulated telecommunications market,' PTT Telecom said. The job loses should boost productivity, measured by the number of telephone lines per employee, by 15 to 20 per cent by the end of 1997. By pursuing this goal, PTT Telecom said it wanted to emulate the 'Baby Bell' telephone companies in the US, which have achieved an average 6 per cent annual improvement in productivity over the past few years. The telecommunications subsidiary said the job losses were a continuation of restructuring begun in 1990. PTT Post, KPN's postal company, has cut around 6,000 jobs since 1990 and now employs around 38,411 people. KPN is the Netherlands' largest private sector company. The job losses in telecommunications will come across the board but will concentrate specifically on employees in telecommunications maintenance. Digitalisation of the Dutch telecommunications network means that fewer people are needed for maintenance work. However, PTT Telecom said it expects to hire additional employees in future in 'customer-contact' jobs such as sales and marketing, as well as in mobile communications and new media.</p>

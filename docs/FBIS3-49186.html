The government presented reports by three international  commissions asked to check out the safety of the plant, and  Jazbinsek said they had "found no critical shortcoming that  would justify halting the nuclear plant." One of the commissions  was from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the second from  the International Commission for Independent Safety Analysis,  and the third from the European Commission in Brussels (the  executive arm of the European Community).    Jazbinsek noted that the reports acknowledged that there  were  "considerable financial problems" in upgrading the plant's  safety.    The power station, 30 kms (19 miles) from the Croatian  capital of Zagreb, was built by the U.S. firm Westinghouse and  went into operation in 1984. Its capacity is 632 MW, and it  sends half of its output to Slovenia and the other half to  Croatia.    Slovenia has criticized Croatia for irregular contributions  to operating costs and its refusal to store part of the nuclear  waste.    As to improved safety, the experts point particularly to  fire  protection, replacing steam generators, and seismic dangers in  the area.</p>

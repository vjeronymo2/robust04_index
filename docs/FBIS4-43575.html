			<p>BFN     [Text] The Senate by a very large majority approved the  1995-2000 Military Programming Law yesterday. Only the  Communists voted against it. Since no amendment was retained,  the law has now been definitively adopted. Answering questions  with regard to the 2.5-billion-franc [Fr] freeze in the  equipment budget (Fr1.9 billion) and the operating budget  (Fr0.630 billion), Defense Minister Francois Leotard said that  "France is engaged in a formidable economic war." Nevertheless,  the defense minister hopes that this freeze will not lead to  cancellation, as is feared by the Armed Forces, which saw their  budget slashed already by Fr630 million in March.</p>

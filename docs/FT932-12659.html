			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / International Company News: Profits at Italgas fall to L81bn as sales weaken ITALGAS, the Italian gas and drinking water group, reported a L10bn fall in net profits to L81bn (Dollars 53m) for 1992 following weaker sales which eased to L3,381bn from L3,353bn. The company blamed the mild winter, which had reduced gas demand, and higher tax. It is holding the dividend at L100 a share. Earnings were also held back by the freezing of gas prices, which have not been raised since July 1991. Mr Carlo Da Molo, chairman, warned that an increase in charges, even below the rate of inflation, was now 'indispensable'. Italgas's client base rose by 155,000 units to 4.5m, though the volume of gas sales remained little changed. Sales in the drinking water business area grew more sharply, with a 10 per cent increase in water supplies. Italgas continued its diversification into refuse disposal, its still little developed, business division, with the purchase of a 49 per cent stake in Aimeri. The company is the leading private operator in the field. Although net interest charges fell markedly to L18bn from L51bn in 1991, the company reported a substantial downturn in extraordinary items owing to the devaluation of the lira. Dalmine, the stock market listed steel tubemaker controlled by the Ilva state steel concern, reported a rise in net group profits to L5.6bn last year from L5bn in 1991 in spite of the crisis in the European steel industry. The company, in which Ilva controls about 69 per cent of the shares, is set to be privatised under the latest rescue plan for group, which lost L2,309bn in 1992.</p>

			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE PASSES MEASURE TO BAR POSTING GUARDS AT VOTING SITES  </P> <P> Reacting to an incident at the polls in Santa Ana last year, the state Senate  on Thursday approved legislation that would make it a crime to post security  guards at voting sites without the permission of election officials.  </P> <P> Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco), who authored the bill, said the measure  was meant to prevent a repeat of what he termed the "disturbing episode" that  occurred Nov. 8, when the Orange County Republican Party hired 20 uniformed  guards to monitor Latinos as they went to the polls in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Republican leaders said the guards were retained to watch for voter fraud after  party officials heard persistent rumors that Democrats were going to bus  non-citizens to the polls to vote illegally. GOP officials said the guards were  given strict instructions not to interfere with voters and were pulled from  their posts when the registrar of voters complained that their actions might  intimidate Latinos legally registered to vote.  </P> <P> The bill would make it a felony or a misdemeanor, subject to the discretion of  a judge, to hire or serve as a uniformed security guard within 100 feet of a  polling place without written permission from the appropriate elections  official. The measure also would prohibit anyone other than an elections  official from receiving a ballot from a voter or asking a voter to turn over  his or her ballot.  </P> <P> The legislation was approved on a vote of 22 to 2, one vote more than the  majority needed for passage in the 40-member Senate. The bill was sent to the  Assembly, where its first stop will be the Elections, Reapportionment and  Constitutional Amendments Committee.  </P> <P> That panel includes Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), on whose behalf  the party hired the security guards.  </P></p>

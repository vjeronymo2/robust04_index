			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Welsh Water Welsh is starting to get its act together outside the regulated water business. The shares have notably outperformed the sector since the turn of the year, since the ill-considered stake in South Wales Electricity was jettisoned. Since then, the new management has vowed to get out of hotels - although that is proving difficult - and is wondering whether to remain in pipelines. Given the low margins and risks inherent in such contracting business, an early exit looks desirable. Acer, the engineering consultancy acquired in February, has proved more difficult to manage than Welsh envisaged. But a small operating profit in the first half, together with a firm prediction that the acquisition will enhance earnings this year, is enough to earn the benefit of the doubt. With turnover of only Pounds 350m a year in its basic water business - half that of North West Water - consultancy might make a meaningful contribution to earnings. The best that can be said so far, though, is that worries about a serious error on the road to diversification have been allayed. That has allowed the strength of the water business to shine through. With dividend cover of four times and a balance sheet barely geared, Welsh could live with a tougher regulatory regime more easily than its peers. While the outcome of next year's review of price limits remains so uncertain, such defensive qualities will continue to drive the shares.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS MEDIA: TIMES MIRROR CO. NET INCOME OFF 13% IN 3RD QUARTER  </P> <P> Times Mirror Co. reported Tuesday that it earned $70.1 million in the third  quarter, off 13% from the previous year, when the sale of timberlands boosted  earnings.  </P> <P> Excluding those gains from asset sales, the 1989 earnings were 13% higher for  the Los Angeles-based media company, which publishes The Times, Newsday, the  Baltimore Sun and other newspapers. Revenue increased 7% in the quarter to  $873.9 million from $814.8 million.  </P> <P> "Overall, it was better than expected," said Drew Marcus, vice president of  Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York. "But we do have some concern about high  cost growth and an uncertain revenue environment."  </P> <P> Marcus said costs in the newspaper division increased 5.5%, outpacing revenue  growth of 4%. That was the fastest growth in costs among the 10 newspapers that  Marcus monitors, and he noted specifically the expense of new zoned editions at  Newsday and the Hartford Courant as well as higher promotional costs for the  Orange County edition of The Times.  </P> <P> Net income for the first three quarters of 1989 was $223.9 million, a slight  decrease from $235.1 million in 1988. Excluding gains from asset sales in both  years, the 1989 year-to-date earnings exceeded those in 1988 by 7%. Revenue  totaled $2.58 billion, up 7% from $2.41 billion in the first three quarters of  1988.  </P> <P> A robust performance in cable television and professional publishing companies,  along with improvement in broadcast operations, helped offset a decline in the  newspaper group, primarily in the Northeast, the company said.  </P> <P> Overall, the newspaper division reported a 5.7% decline in year-to-year  operating profits for the quarter. In a statement, Robert F. Erburu, Times  Mirror chairman and chief executive, said softness in advertising volume,  primarily in the Northeast, continued to adversely affect the newspaper  division's performance.  </P> <P> The cable television division reported a 69.7% increase in operating profit to  $17.4 million. The company said controls on expenses and growth in the number  of subscribers had boosted profits.  </P> <P> The division responsible for book, magazine and other publishing reported that  operating profit climbed 32.4% to $49.5 million. Improvements in the Texas  economy helped increase earnings in the broadcast division, which includes  television stations in Dallas and Austin, by 12.5%, to $7.8 million.  </P> <P> "It's good to have the newspaper weakness offset by other divisions, but I  think what investors want to see is a rebound in the newspaper division, and I  see no signs of that yet," said Bruce E. Thorp, an analyst with Provident  National Bank in Philadelphia.  </P></p>

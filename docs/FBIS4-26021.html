			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Li Shaowen "Commentary"] </F>   [Text] North Korea says it would immediately withdraw from  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and rejects any  inspection of its nuclear facilities. It now sees any UN  sanctions as an act of war. Li Shaowen has a commentary:    Pyongyang is toughening its stand in the wake of mounting  pressure. It will not reverse its decision until the nuclear  issue has been solved fairly through dialogue and negotiations.  A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement issued on Monday [13  June] charges the IAEA with committing an act of grave  encroachment on its dignity and sovereignty.    The United States responded immediately. The State  Department said on Tuesday [14 June] that Washington has worked  out a draft resolution calling for UN economic sanctions. Also  on Tuesday, North Korea's UN ambassador said its government has  informed the United States of its decision to withdraw from the  agency. It will also order the remaining two agency inspectors  to leave the country.    North Korea and the IAEA have been differing over the  nuclear  fuel rods replacement. The agency accused Pyongyang of blocking  a full inspection of the refueling process. The United States  suspected it transferred plutonium from the Yongbyong nuclear  reactor for its weapons program. On 10 June, the IAEA adopted a  resolution urging North Korea to open its military facilities  and suspended the agency's assistance to it. The United States,  South Korea, and Japan agreed on imposing UN economic sanctions  on Pyongyang. Washington has been lobbying support for the  measures but failed to win any agreements from the international  community.    Russia has called for an international conference to find a  solution to the issue. On Monday, President Boris Yeltsin  discussed the latest development with his U.S. counterpart Bill  Clinton by a telephone call. They also discussed ways to settle  it through political means.    China is opposed to sanctions imposed on North Korea.  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen has stressed the denuclearization  of the Korean peninsula and regional stability as two of the  goals in the fundamental interest of Asia-Pacific countries.  China has time and again called for dialogue to resolve the  dispute and appealed to the international community for  restraint from taking hasty actions.    The door is still open for a political solution. North Korea  has been calling for the resumption of talks with the United  States on the issue before considering further inspections. It  has threatened to withdraw from the IAEA and has not done yet.  What is more, it is still a signatory to the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty. All this indicates that only dialogue  can bring about a resolution. Further confrontation and  hostilities will just intensify the already tense situation and  will cause a greater threat to regional peace and stability.  After all, talks, however tough, are better than extreme  actions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elsy Fors] </F>   [Text] Havana, 27 Jan (PL) -- Osvaldo Martinez, who is  president of the Economic Commission of the Cuban Parliament and  an expert on Latin American economics, has stated that the  political and social spectrum mirrored in the Fourth Latin  American and Caribbean Meeting is giving shape to a new social  transformation project in the region.    On its third day of sessions, the forum will establish  contact with the peasant, women, and religious sectors; with  community organizations, associations of friendship and  solidarity with Cuba; and with intellectuals and artists.    Martinez pointed out to PRENSA LATINA the importance of this  meeting, which, in his opinion, makes evident the vigor and  maturity of the region's new left.    He said: The diversity prism that this meeting displays, is  giving shape to a new social and revolutionary transformation  project that has no traditional conceptual framework, although  Marxism is an important component of it.    Martinez said that never before had the left had the broad  and diversified social setting it has now, with the presence of  political forces that include movements of towns people, women,  peasants, religious people, and ecologists, among others.    With regard to the criticism that regional organizations  such  as the Economic Commission for Latin America and the  Inter-American Development Bank, have made of neoliberal  programs, the legislator said that some new economic proposals  mean economically acknowledging neoliberalism and at the same  time rejecting the inevitable social results of that policy.    He said: It is aberrant to consider only the economic face  of the neoliberal policy while trying to lessen its negative  social consequences. It is like trying to mix oil and vinegar,  he said.    When asked about the U.S.-sponsored initiative of holding a  Pan American summit, Martinez said that in his opinion this is  an attempt to counter both the Iberian American summits and the  possibility of a high-level Latin American and Caribbean meeting.    The Initiative for the Americas is an integrationist design  subordinated to U.S. economic plans rather than to Latin  American integration.    The meeting will conclude tomorrow with reports from the  work  commission and a probable, and expected, concluding speech by  Cuban President Fidel Castro.</p>

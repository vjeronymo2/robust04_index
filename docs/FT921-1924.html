			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Tax relief on study I AM taking a part time evening course at the local College of Further Education. The course is the BTEC National Certificate in Business and Finance. The fees this year are Pounds 180 and textbooks cost Pounds 40. I fund this myself. Is it possible to claim tax allowances for these expenditures from the Inland Revenue? No; the tax relief for certain expenditure on vocational training (announced in last year's Budget) does not apply to payments made before the beginning of 1992-93. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

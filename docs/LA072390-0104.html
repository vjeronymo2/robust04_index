			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC NOTES  </P> <P> New Zealand's government has put the brakes on its controversial program to  sell state-owned businesses to the private sector, just three months before the  troubled Labor administration faces a general election.  </P> <P> State-Owned Enterprises Minister Richard Prebble said New Zealand's debt crisis  is over. Proceeds of the sales have been earmarked for cutting the debt.  </P> <P> Labor has sold numerous state enterprises in recent years, including Air New  Zealand, the energy company Petrocorp and Telecom Corp. But the deals have  aroused public anger, notably when Telecom was sold to a U.S.-dominated  consortium last month for $2.5 billion.  </P></p>

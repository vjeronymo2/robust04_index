			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / All the ingredients for a long shelf life: Can Wal-Mart, America's discount retail group, sustain its explosive growth? At 8.30 on a cold winter's morning in Dover, Delaware, employees of a new 114,000 sq ft Wal-Mart store are whooping and hollering. 'Give me a W,' shouts a store manager, leading the pre-opening ceremony. 'W,' yells the throng of shop assistants. 'Give me an A,' . . . and so on. Outside, the locals press against the glass and debate what effect the arrival of America's most successful discount retailer will have on their town. 'Tough on Ames,' mutters one lady, referring to a rival general merchandise retailer which has already filed for bankruptcy. Sure enough, 100 yards down the road, Ames has sparsely stocked shelves and only four customers. Already an aggressive store expansion programme has taken Wal-Mart's sales from Dollars 2.44bn in 1982 to almost Dollars 44bn last year - making it the world's largest retailer in turnover terms. Last week it reported a 24.6 per cent increase in profits in 1991 over 1990 to Dollars 1.6bn. Now Wal-Mart, which sells goods from detergents to golf clubs, is muscling into food retailing and experimenting with own-label. It is also engaging in a row with trade representatives, and offering suppliers a direct computer link to individual stores to cut lead supply times. In so doing, the group is starting to lay down rules for the retail sector in a way that no US chain has done before. 'Wal-Mart is the biggest single influence in US retailing,' says Ms Dorothy Lakner, an analyst with Oppenheimer, the US financial services group. Perhaps not just in the US. Retailing does not cross national boundaries easily, but ideas do get swapped. The international spread of discount (or 'value') shopping, for example, is evident in the arrival of Germany's Aldi group and the Danish Netto chain in the UK. Wal-Mart's position today is all the more impressive when put in perspective. In 1950, Mr Sam Walton, a former trainee with the J C Penney retail group, lost the lease on a Ben Franklin-franchised variety store in Newport, Arkansas. After complex negotiating, he secured a new property in the tiny northern Arkansas town of Bentonville. Here, he opened the first Walton's 5 &amp; 10, a small general goods store. Forty years later, Bentonville is still the headquarters for more than 1,700 Wal-Mart stores, about 208 Sam's Warehouse Clubs and four hypermarkets. These are served by 20 distribution centres, employ 365,000 people, and capital expenditure runs at more than Dollars 2bn a year. Mr Walton, now 73, and his four children ranked third last year in Fortune's list of the 500 richest Americans. For years, observers have tried to define the ingredients of this success. Their answers usually mention Wal-Mart's traditional small-town base - where land costs are low, and shrinkage (or 'lost' stocks) and other operational problems are more manageable. Then there is the meticulous attention to cost, and the fact that prices are, indeed, kept very low. (In Dover, a quart of bleach costs 89 cents in Wal-Mart and Dollars 1.14 at Ames.) This is partly because Wal-Mart's staff is non-unionised, and 40 per cent work part-time, saving the company insurance and holiday expenses, while executives occupy shoe box offices. Success is also attributed to the company's willingness to innovate or, at least, to poach successful ideas. Warehouse clubs are a good example. These barns, which sell a limited range of goods at wholesale prices to 'membership' customers, were developed by a Californian retailer in the mid-1970s. Wal-Mart latched on to the notion within a decade - well before competitors like K mart, which subsequently bought the PACE club chain. Not all schemes work so well. Wal-Mart borrowed the hypermarket concept from Europe, and built four - all at least 220,000 square feet. Now it says they are too large to manage efficiently, and will not add more. But whatever the key to Wal-Mart's past success, the question is whether the group can sustain its explosive growth, as competition grows from the likes of Dayton Hudson's Target chain and K mart. The first expansion route is geographical. Wal-Mart is concentrated in the south and mid-west, only recently tackling the north-east and west and taking tentative steps into Mexico. 'There's so much opportunity out there,' says Mr David Glass, Wal-Mart's chief executive. 'We have gone from Dollars 32.6bn in sales in 1990-91 to almost Dollars 44bn last year, and I can envisage us layering on Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn this year.' One potential problem with this strategy is that it may raise costs. 'If they want to go after the New York, Los Angeles or Chicago markets, it's a different ball-game,' says Mr Tony O'Reilly, chairman of Heinz, a Wal-Mart supplier. 'Real estate becomes expensive and there are all sorts of union problems.' Used to hearing such concerns, Mr Glass shakes his head, pointing out that Wal-Mart already has stores around Houston, Dallas, and even in Chicago's suburbs. As well as new sites, however, Wal-Mart's long-term plans depend on new product areas - notably food retailing. Sam's Clubs have already taken the Wal-Mart group into bulk food items in a big way. But now the company is experimenting with 'supercentres', which combine supermarket facilities with general merchandise. It plans to double the number to about 20 this year. Manufacturers, meanwhile, may have shuddered at Wal-Mart's experiments in selling colas, cookies and snacks under the Sam's Choice name. In general, US shoppers view own-label products as cheap but inferior - giving brand manufacturers considerable clout. But Sam Walton is a household name, and Sam's Choice may convey more sense of quality. Wal-Mart itself is ambivalent about the potential. '(The targeted own-label segments) are generally difficult products to merchandise,' says Mr Glass. 'You buy soft drinks regionally, you buy them at all kinds of prices. Other categories are simply those where there has been a big increase in brand prices, and you're getting consumer resistance.' So is Wal-Mart saying that when suppliers fail to meet its requirements, it will crack the whip by introducing competing own-label products? 'Oh no;' Wal-Mart's chief executive looks pained. 'We wouldn't do that - we believe we are partners with our suppliers.' But underlying such expansion tactics is a more fundamental question. How far can any retailer grow before operations become unmanageable and standards slip? It is a conundrum to which no one has an answer. Wal-Mart has surpassed K mart and Sears Roebuck, which seemed to stall when their merchandise sales reached some Dollars 30bn during the 1980s. Asked about estimates that Wal-Mart could see annual sales of Dollars 100bn this century, Mr Glass says this is 'do-able'. 'But that's a pretty ambitious plan,' he adds quickly, 'because no retailer has ever done Dollars 100bn before, and I'm not sure that any of us know what you'd have to do to be able to achieve it.' Retail analysts suggest that part of the answer may lie in technology, and Wal-Mart seems to agree. It makes much of the 'retail link' scheme, which plugs suppliers into point-of-sale data in individual stores. Although only a fifth of its 5,000 vendors have been persuaded to invest so far, overall average lead times are said to have fallen from double figures a year ago, to nine days. The retailer also suggests that increased efficiency is the reason for a recent move to eliminate manufacturers' representatives, the traditional middlemen, from negotiations with suppliers. 'If you have a manufacturer and you do Dollars 50m with him one year, and say you'll probably do Dollars 100m next . . . many of them have trouble relating to that,' says Mr Glass. 'Where you have a third party involved it becomes particularly difficult.' The representatives, for their part, protest that they are essential to small manufacturers, and have tried to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission, the US competition watchdog. They also hint that Wal-Mart's real aim is better terms from manufacturers. Whatever the merits of the argument, most observers suspect that the discount chain will win - at least, where larger suppliers are concerned. Already, Procter &amp; Gamble, probably Wal-Mart's largest supplier, is reported to have a team living in Bentonville. And if anyone doubts the seriousness of Wal-Mart's ambitions, they should visit its computer room. 'I don't think many people know this exists,' confesses one employee, opening the door on a room the size of a football pitch. Bentonville may just have seen the future.</p>

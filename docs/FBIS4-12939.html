			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sufyan Abu-Zayidah, "prominent Fatah leader </F> in the Gaza Strip," by Aharon Klein on 13 April; place not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Klein] How will you deal  with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] when you take over  control of Gaza and Jericho?    [Abu-Zayidah] The Israelis attribute terror attacks, car  bombs, and stabbings to Hamas and think that all its members are  the same. However, the truth is that not everybody in Hamas  thinks the same way or has the same logic and views about the  near future. There are many moderate people among them, who  believe in a modus vivendi with the Palestinian rule, similar to  that of the Islamic movements in the Arab countries, such as  Jordan. These people have got nothing to do with terror  attacks, but they represent Hamas.    [Klein] Nevertheless, how will you prevent Hamas from  setting  out on attacks from the Gaza Strip and Jericho?    [Abu-Zayidah] The Palestinian side will not allow car bombs  or any other attacks to set out from the Gaza Strip. Both  sides, the Palestinian and the Israeli, will try to prevent it.    [Klein] Has Hamas given you any indication that it wants to  take part in the process? Palestinian sources claim that Fatah  and Hamas men met on Monday in an apartment in Gaza and that  they secretly decided to integrate Hamas in the Palestinian  police force, which will also include 2,000 inhabitants of the  territories.    [Abu-Zayidah] They want to take part in it. They do not  reject it. However, their integration in the Palestinian police  force has both its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage  is that the police force would be representing everybody and not  just Fatah. The disadvantage is that they might use their jobs  to smuggle weapons and pass on information against the  Palestinian rule in the Gaza Strip.    [Klein] How much support do you think Fatah could muster in  the territories?    [Abu-Zayidah] It is all a matter of economic success; of  getting a democratic Palestinian rule established and of  successfully solving economic problems. Fatah may very well  enjoy the support of 90 percent of the population if it  succeeds, and of 30 percent if it fails. Everything depends on  how we go about translating the transfer of rule to us into  action. [passage omitted]</p>

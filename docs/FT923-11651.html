			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Observer: Vanishing lady No one knows if British Coal really will have to slim itself down from its current 50 mines to perhaps a dozen big pits. And even if it does, few are prepared to stick their necks out and name the long-term survivors. It's not so long ago that Britain dug its coal in colourful mines such as the Lady Windsor and Marine Six Bells, in South Wales, and Ledston Luck and Kinsley Drift, in Yorkshire. However, these names have been committed to the history books, and the list of pits scheduled to survive come hell or high water has the sound of a pretty boring bunch. Observer's man at the coalface predicts that they will include Notts pits like Thoresby, Ollerton and Welbeck, Selby's Stillingfleet, Wistow and Riccall, and a few others such as Daw Mill in the Midlands and Tower in South Wales. Sadly, it doesn't sound like a place will be reserved for Yorkshire's Prince of Wales in the slimline British Coal Corporation.</p>

			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Paris Club in debt write-offs The Paris Club of richer government creditors yesterday said it was ready to write off 67 per cent of the maturing debt of 27 of the poorest countries, which could also for the first time get softer terms on the rest of their debt. The announcement follows agreement in principle by the Group of Seven economic powers at their July summit in Naples to give more debt relief to the poorest countries. The move, strongly backed by France and the UK, marks a further easing by the Paris Club, which in 1991 raised to 50 per cent the share of poorest countries' maturing debt that it was willing to write off. The total official debt of the 27 countries, mainly from sub-Saharan Africa and a few central American states plus Vietnam, is put at Dollars 35bn (Pounds 21.3bn). The novelty in yesterday's announcement is that the Paris Club is also prepared to give debt relief on countries' total residual stock of debt, provided their restructuring programmes are considered sufficiently far advanced.</p>

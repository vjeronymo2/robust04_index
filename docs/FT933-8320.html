			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / China's golf plans drive into the rough CHINA has cracked down on the spread of golf courses and race courses as part of a nationwide campaign against frivolous real estate development, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. A circular from the State Council (cabinet) said there would be 'no approval, no licence, no land and no loans for such expensive projects as horse race tracks and golf courses'. China's cabinet last year reiterated a ban on gambling, but a number of Chinese businessmen had pushed ahead with race course construction in the hope of getting the ban lifted. The Chinese authorities, in their efforts to regain control of a runaway economy, have targeted real estate speculation as a leading cause of a credit binge, which was draining funds from much-needed infrastructure projects such as roads and railways. 'For buildings with limited market potential, such as villas, holiday villages, luxury apartments, hotels and office buildings, the country will place strict limits on this area, and halt the construction of some buildings already in progress,' the circular said. Mr Deng Chenbo, who has been attempting to introduce horse-racing to the Chinese capital, said he was sure racing would be allowed to go ahead in China 'in due course'. Mr Deng blamed 'muddle-headed' figures in the Chinese leadership for the continued ban on racing. 'They should know that golf courses and race courses will bring them not only a lot of tax money, but also make the people happy,' he said.</p>

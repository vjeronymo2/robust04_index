			<p>CSO     [Text] The head of the APBN [State Budget] Commission of  the DPR [Parliament] believes that problem loans and  nonperforming loans made after the KLBI [Bank of Indonesian  Liquidity Credit] was halted in January 1990 were caused by  debtors manipulating their equity by marking up the projects  funded with that credit and by using part of the KLBI funds for  other projects.    Aberson M. Sihaloho, Deputy Chairman of the DPR's APBN  Commission, said that as soon as the KLBI was halted at the  beginning of 1990 through the issuance of the 29 January 1990  policy package known as the January Package, the number of  problem loans rose sharply.    He then mentioned that the percentage of problem loans in  government banks, about 6 percent in 1990, rose to 11.8 percent  in 1991, rose again to about 15.8 percent in 1992, and in 1993  it rose to 21.2 percent of the total credit of 91.8 trillion  rupiahs granted by BUMN [State-Owned Enterprise] banks.    "The Minister of Finance himself presented these figures at  a  working meeting with the APBN Commission," said the  Representative in the DPR building yesterday.    Aberson said that the problem loans occurred because debtors  who obtained low-interest KLBI loans at around 14 percent  interest increased their equity by marking up the value of their  projects or their capital goods. "So that equity reached 25  percent, as was required at that time, but in reality it wasn't  that high," he said.    At the same time, Aberson added, debtors who obtained KLBI  loans used part of the credit for other projects which had no  connection with the projects funded by the KLBI, for example for  investment in hotels or other enterprises; some was even  deposited in banks.    So that, Aberson continued, when the due date arrived and  the  debtor had to pay the instalment payment and the interest, the  project funded by the KLBI was unable to pay the obligation  because the real value of the project was less than what was  submitted in the credit proposal. "Debtors who obtained a KLBI  manipulated the equity from the proceeds of their project  mark-up, said Aberson, a member of the FPDI [Indonesian  Democracy Party Faction] of the DPR.    As Aberson said, Sumarlin's statement made when he was still  Minister of Finance in 1990 when he explained the 1990 January  Package alluded to the fact that the debtors had diverted the  KLBI funds.    Sumarlin said that the KLBI had weaknesses and problems.  "Many KLBI loans which carry low interest rates and which  frequently cause distortions in allocation and evaluation are  still used in our present system of national credit," Sumarlin  said at that time.    Sumarlin said that what happened was that low-interest cash  loans were then deposited in banks.    "As a result of actions such as that, loans obtained by  debtors before the beginning of 1990, including KLBI loans  obtained by Eddy Tansil of the Golden Key Group, became problem  loans, which are not very different from nonperforming loans,"  said Aberson.    Nonperforming loans not yet turned over to the State Auction  and Loan Affairs Board [BUPLN], Aberson said, are still  considered problem loans by the bank concerned. "It is not until  it is turned over to the BUPLN that it becomes a nonperforming  loan," said Aberson.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENATE BACKS BAN ON AIDS VICTIMS IN FOOD-HANDLING JOBS  </P> <P> The Senate voted today to allow AIDS victims to be barred from jobs that  require them to handle food.  </P> <P> "If Ryan White (the teen-ager who died of AIDS earlier this year) was still  alive and he wanted to go to work for Burger King, this amendment would say  no," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.)  </P> <P> .  </P> <P> The Senate ordered its negotiators on the Americans with Disabilities Act to  agree to a House-passed amendment that would permit employers to move AIDS  sufferers from direct contact with food to other duties without loss of pay.  </P> <P> Although the provision was primarily intended for restaurants, it could also  cover supermarkets and food preparation on airliners and luxury cruises.  </P> <P> The Senate approved the instructions, proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) by  voice vote after refusing 53 to 40 to kill the order to the negotiators.  </P> <P> Senate instructions to its negotiators are rare and, although no records have  been kept, Senate historians could recall no time when negotiators were told to  adopt a House provision.  </P> <P> The instructions are not binding. But they put heavy pressure on the Senate  negotiators to agree to the House provision.  </P> <P> The Senate and House versions of the Americans with Disabilities Act are  remarkably similar in other respects, and the negotiators are expected to reach  agreement quickly. President Bush has indicated that he is eager to sign the  final product.  </P> <P> The House-passed amendment, aimed directly at AIDS victims and carriers of the  HIV virus, would also allow the transfer of individuals with communicable and  infectious diseases that people "perceive" can be transmitted through the  handling of food.  </P></p>

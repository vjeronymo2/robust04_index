			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Technical rebound lifts Nikkei in thin trading TOKYO stocks closed moderately higher in a technical rebound following Monday's drop, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Public pension fund buying and index-linked buy programs gave prices an upward twist, but volume remained thin with most investors away on holiday. The 225-share Nikkei average closed up 97.02 at 17,285.64, after a low of 17,146.48 and a high of 17,312.13 in the late afternoon, helped by short covering from the futures market. Advances led declines by three to two, with 533 higher, 354 lower and 182 unchanged and volume was estimated at about 130m shares. The broader first section Topix index was up 4.54 at 1,326.38, and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.50 to 1,081.07. 'This is not a market for attempting any bold moves,' said Mr Masahiko Tsuyuzaki of Tachibana Securities. 'We're stuck in a box range in the absence of any hard news. But public pension funds seem to be coming in and soaking up selling pressure.' The market opened higher on bargain-hunting by dealers and some institutional investors. But the rebound proved short-lived and the Nikkei succumbed to arbitrage selling and profit-taking ahead of the New Year holiday. The day's key gainers were the railway/bus, warehouse, service, gas, brokerage, precision instrument, communications, automobile, machinery and airline sectors. The fishery, credit/lease, food, electric power, non-life insurance and rolling stock sectors were the decliners. Most heavily traded, Isuzu rose Y10 to Y318 on the restructuring theme. Some cheaper large capital issues continued to attract buying interest. Nippon Steel was up Y4 to Y294 and Hitachi Zosen Y2 to Y497. Toshiba rose Y6 to Y640, helped by reports that it had won an order to build a space satellite. Canon ended unchanged at Y1,380 in relatively brisk trade. The second section index was down 0.36 to 1,727.42, with 2.95m shares traded. Roundup SOME markets in the region traded for the last time this year. Seoul was already closed and will reopen on January 4. HONG KONG closed sharply lower on profit-taking but trading was still very thin. The Hang Seng index finished 87.52 lower at 5,444.13 with HKDollars 1.48bn changing hands, compared with Monday's HKDollars 2.27bn. Trading focused on blue chips, with property stocks meeting the most pressure. Cheung Kong fell 70 cents to HKDollars 18.70, Sun Hung Kai Properties 70 cents to HKDollars 27.60 and Henderson Land 30 cents to HKDollars 14.60. Hang Seng Bank, supported by selective buying in the morning, closed 50 cents lower at HKDollars 51.50. Hutchison Whampoa lost 60 cents to HKDollars 15. TAIWAN was pulled up by a technical rebound on the last trading day of this year, but brokers said confidence remained weak and political worries would continue to hurt the market when it reopens on January 5. The weighted index ended 49.39 or 1.5 per cent up at 3,377.06 in turnover of TDollars 9.6bn against Monday's TDollars 10bn. AUSTRALIA ended slightly ahead despite efforts by some brokers to sell some stock down to depress the index. The market climbed 8 points in the first 30 minutes but suddenly fell again before noon. The All Ordinaries finished up 2.8 at 1,539.0 in low turnover of ADollars 116.1m. Among stocks apparently targeted were CRA, down 28 cents to ADollars 13.22, and Comalco, down 15 cents to ADollars 3.10. BHP jumped 14 cents to ADollars 13.24 following news that BHP Petroleum has signed an agreement jointly to explore the Dai Hung oilfield off Vietnam. The cement maker Adelaide Brighton, down 1 cent to ADollars 1.71, topped turnover in industrials after South Australia's State Government Insurance Commission sold 6m shares - half its stake - at Dollars A1.70 each. NEW ZEALAND was lifted by end-of-year overseas buying of leading shares and the NZSE 40 capital index closed 15.2 higher at 1,557.52, its first foray above 1,550 since August 6. Turnover was thin at NZDollars 10.2m. Brierley rose 1 cent to NZDollars 1.03 while Fletcher Challenge rose 6 cents to Dollars 2.50. MANILA closed higher on the last trading day of the year, fuelled by Philippine Long Distance Telephone's strong performance in New York, and by window-dressing. The composite index firmed 15.21 to 1,256.22. The market will reopen on Monday. PLDT rose 25 pesos to 870 while Philippine National Bank closed 5 pesos higher at 230. Combined turnover eased to 408.74m pesos from 1.05bn. SINGAPORE closed firmer in thin trading as the Straits Times Industrial index rose 2.32 to 1,506 in volume of 52.2m shares against 53.1m. KUALA LUMPUR drifted to a lower close in thin trading as investors remained sidelined ahead of the New Year holiday. The composite index fell 2.08 to 642.95 in volume of 51.5m shares against 80.5m.</p>

Steve Linde  has the details:    [Begin recording] [Linde] [passage omitted] The  Portuguese foreign minister noted that negotiations are now  beginning for a new trade agreement between Israel and the  European Union, and he added, Portugal firmly supports the move.    [Barroso] Now we are going to begin negotiations -- the  European Union with Israel -- for a new agreement, and Portugal  was among the countries from the very beginning that supported  that very idea of a new mandate to negotiate with Israel.    [Linde] Foreign Minister Peres pointed out that Prime  Minister Rabin will visit Portugal later this month. He  explained the importance of Portugal to Israel:    [Peres] Our interest is many-sided, the bilateral relations,  which now took a momentum in the domain of the economy and  culture. We just exchanged a protocol to abolish visas,  something that will enable tourists and businessmen from the two  countries to visit and act in better conditions. Then again,  Portugal is a very important member in the EC, and our relations  with the EC also has many sides: political and economic. No  wonder [words indistinct] side and the peace process.

After the meeting, al-Husayni said  that despite the progress in the talks, Israel is not taking  steps to prove to the residents of the territories that peace is  drawing closer; therefore, they are losing faith in the  political process. Al-Husayni confirmed that the Palestinians  plan to set up a shadow municipality in Jerusalem to handle East  Jerusalem during the autonomy period."]</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Bonn coalition split on president With only three days to go before the election of a new state president, Germany's governing coalition is in disarray over support for Chancellor Helmut Kohl's favoured candidate, constitutional court president Roman Herzog. The minority Free Democratic party, junior partner in the coalition, is deeply divided between Mr Herzog and Mr Johannes Rau, the Social Democratic party (SPD) candidate, who is a clear favourite in popular opinion polls. At the same time, east German members of Mr Kohl's own Christian Democratic Union are also grumbling openly about the choice of candidate, and threatening to vote either for Mr Rau or for Mr Jens Reich, an independent and the only east German of the four contenders. The divisions have left the issue, to be decided on Monday by the 1,324-member federal assembly, still very close, although Mr Herzog remains favourite. The assembly, consisting of 662 members of the Bundestag, the directly elected federal parliament, and the same number from the 16 state parliaments, meets once every five years to elect a state president. The vote is secret, and can consist of three ballots, requiring an absolute majority for the winning candidate in the first two ballots, but only a simple majority in the third. The FDP's 111 votes are certain to decide the outcome, but if the party splits, it could go either way. Neither the CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, with 619 votes, nor the SPD, with 502, can gain the necessary majority on its own. Mr Jurgen Mollemann, former economics minister and FDP chairman in North Rhine-Westphalia (where Mr Rau is premier), yesterday restated his support for the SPD candidate, accusing Mr Herzog of being 'too conservative'. At the same time Mr Gunther Krause, former transport minister and spokesman for east German CDU members in parliament, expressed doubts about Mr Herzog's identification with the east. He said that the judge, a close associate of Chancellor Kohl, could not count on 'unconditional' eastern support. FDP officials confirmed yesterday that Mr Herzog had written a long letter to Mr Werner Hoyer, party secretary-general, seeking to clarify his position on foreigners living in Germany, and his opposition to any system of dual nationality. He denied saying in press interviews that those who were not prepared to take out German citizenship should leave the country - a suggestion which had alienated many party members. The greatest danger for Mr Herzog is that he will emerge with a bad result in the first round of voting, in which he will also be opposed by the FDP's own candidate, Mrs Hildegard Hamm-Brucher. If a significant number of potential CDU/CSU members do not back him, he might reconsider his candidacy. However, a victory for Mr Rau requires solid support not only from his own SPD, but also from the 44 Greens (who plan to vote for Mr Reich in the first ballot), from a significant number of the FDP, and almost certainly from the Democratic Socialists, the former East German Communist party. Mr Klaus Kinkel, foreign minister and FDP party leader, is known to favour Mr Herzog, to demonstrate his faith in the present Bonn coalition. If his party does back Mr Rau, it would be seen as a death blow to the coalition, and a clear bid by the FDP to switch partners in favour of the SPD after the October general election. In the interim, the coalition would be fatally undermined.</p>

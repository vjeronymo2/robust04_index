			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: BNZ climbs 30% and lifts dividend THE BANK of New Zealand yesterday reported a 30 per cent improvement in net operating profit to NZDollars 171.1m (USDollars 92m) for the year ended March 1992 and increased its dividend from three to four cents a share. But company officials declined to comment on speculation that the bank would soon have new owners. Mr Syd Pasley, chairman, told a news conference it was inappropriate for him to comment on the prospects of a sale. BNZ's share price has risen by 22 per cent in the past month, partly on expectations of improved profits, but mostly on rumours that the government was about to sell its 58.2 per cent stake in BNZ. The NZ government attempted to sell the bank in 1987, but pulled out of the market because bids were too low. Since then the state has twice had to inject capital to rescue the bank. Mr Pasley said the bank had been successfully reshaped during the past three years. Last year's profit equated with 21.1 per cent on ordinary shareholders' funds.</p>

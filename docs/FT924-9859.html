			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / People: Non-executives It really is the end of an era for Quicks, the once family-owned group of car dealerships from which Mancunians have been buying their Fords since time immemorial - or at least from soon after Ford first began assembling cars at nearby Trafford Park in the early 1900s. For the first time there will not be a Quick in the chair when the current incumbent, Norman Quick, retires at the end of the year having reached the age of 70. In line with the current chairman's long-held objective of bringing in outside blood to strengthen the board, he will be succeeded by Michael Moore. The versatile Moore is chairman of Tomkins and The Bank of Edinburgh Group and a director of Linx Printing Technologies, as well as being chairman of the NSPCC. Moore will serve as a non-executive director until he takes up the chairmanship on January 1, when Norman Quick will also become Quicks' first life president. ***** Ian Hargreaves at CLAREMOUNT UNDERWRITING AGENCY. ***** William Croft and Heinz Moonen at MULTITONE ELECTRONICS' German subsidiary, after they retire as group technical director and md respectively at the end of December. ***** Richard Wevill, joint md of Causeway Investment Management, at VARDON. ***** Martin Rafferty, chairman of United Drug, Readymix, Ulster Investment Bank and the Irish Industrial Development Authority, at GREENCORE.</p>

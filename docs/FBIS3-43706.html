The PF leaders included ANC President Nelson Mandela, Labour  Party leader Allan Hendrickse, Transvaal Indian Congress  representative Cassim Saloojee and the leaders of Lebowa, Venda,  Transkei and kwaNdebele. PF co-ordinator Ismael Ibrahim said  the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the April 27 elections  and the PF's campaign.    Mr Mandela, reacting before the meeting to Inkatha Freedom  Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi's threat to oppose the  election process, said that while the ANC and the National Party  were the major players, they were not the only ones. "Our  desire is to persuade all political parties to come along with  us in the process."    Mr Mandela disclosed that he held talks on Wednesday with a  "major personality" to broaden the inclusivity of the process.  He did not name the person and asked the media not to probe for  details. He said it would be regrettable if any political  parties turned their backs on the negotiations process.</p>

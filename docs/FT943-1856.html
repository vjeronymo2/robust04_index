			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Top civil servants attacked: Maclennan makes stormy debut as president Mr Robert Maclennan, president of the Liberal Democrats, was challenged last night to name the senior civil servants he accused of lying to parliament. In his first speech as party president, Mr Maclennan said civil servants had lied to protect their political masters, abandoning their traditional political neutrality. Drawing on his experience as a member of the Commons public accounts committee, Mr Maclennan said: 'I have seen it in response to direct questioning - that long, nervous, intake of breath, followed by the telling of a flat fib. I use the word 'fib' only because this is a family conference.' Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the FDA top civil servants' union, challenged Mr Maclennan to 'put up or retract' his allegations. 'Mr Maclennan's attack is unprecedented. He knows civil servants are unable to answer back. He must now stand up this charge,' she said. Mr Maclennan, a former Labour junior minister, said civil servants occasionally told untruths 'for their political masters for all the world as if they were members of the same political party'. As a result Britain had regressed from standards of public service established for 140 years. The next party in government would be 'entering Tombstone like Wyatt Earp. It would have to go in with all guns blazing and hit every target first time, every time.'</p>

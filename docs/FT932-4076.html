			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Row over premiums threatens insurance cover for terrorism THE FUTURE of the government-backed reinsurance company which covers terrorism risks appeared to be in doubt yesterday after a row over plans to introduce swingeing premium increases. Insurers are poised to withdraw their support from Pool Re, the company set up earlier this year after insurers withdrew terrorism cover from commercial policies in the wake of the IRA's mainland bombing campaign last year. Mr Ian Rushton, chairman of the Association of British Insurers, warned in a sharply worded letter sent earlier this week to Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, that 'in future months it will be difficult to continue to maintain the active co-operation of the insurance companies in this venture'. He added: 'The present approach shows that the DTI look upon Pool Re as effectively their tool to undertake government wishes without any real need for full consultation with the insurance industry.' Under the scheme, companies insure their assets against terrorist attack with Pool Re. In the event of a claim, Pool Re pays out until its own funds are exhausted. If the claim amounts to more than the total amount available to Pool Re, the government meets at least 90 per cent of the shortfall. Take-up of the new terrorism policies has been more limited than expected. Claims of more than Pounds 400m from the Bishopsgate bomb in April will exhaust the new company's funds and have prompted the government to press for changes in rates. Businesses outside London will receive rate reductions, but some large London buildings face rises of more than 300 per cent. In the ABI letter, Mr Rushton said increases had been imposed without full consultation. 'Very simply, the whole history of Pool Re to date shows a serious lack of willingness to work in a co-operative manner with the insurance companies'. He said the ABI did not regard the initial target figure set for Pool Re's annual premium income of Pounds 500m as 'realistic'. Low take-up of the new insurance - especially outside London - suggests that the figure will not be achieved. Mr Rushton said ABI members would be looking carefully at the terrorist cover they continued to offer as part of commercial policies.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / US Money and Credit: Unemployment data spur rally THE latest US jobs data could not have been worse. Against expectations of a rise in August of about 150,000, employment actually fell by 183,000 - excluding seasonal distortions caused by federal jobs programmes. Non-farm employment was down by 83,000 and the weakness of the US economy proved to be an across-the-board affair, with jobs being lost as speedily in the manufacturing industry as in the retailing sector. Factory employment is now at the lowest level since 1983. For President Bush, the latest unemployment numbers offered more bad news on the electoral front. For challenger Bill Clinton, another opportunity was served up for attacks on the Bush Administration's economic record. Back in the real world, the Federal Reserve, having last cut the discount rate last July, found its options limited due to the weakness of the US dollar, now the bargain basement currency of the world foreign exchange market. While the White House struggled to put a favourable spin on the penultimate set of jobs data to be released before election day, the Fed injected money into the banking system and signalled a quarter point reduction in the target range of the Fed funds rate, from 3 1/4 to 3 per cent. The jobs data and limited Fed action spurred a sharp rally in the Treasury bond market on Friday. The price of the 30-year benchmark Treasury issue gained nearly a full point on the day and the yield fell to 7.28 per cent, a level seen briefly last month, but more recognisable as the yield on offer more than five years ago. Mr Alan Greenspan, Fed chairman, was meanwhile criticised harshly by some economists who feel the economy needs shock treatment rather than more gradualism in monetary policy. Mr Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities in New York, said the dollar should be damned and the Fed should act to cut interest rates still further. 'The true culprit here is the Fed and the blame must fall on its leader, Alan Greenspan,' said Mr Brusca. 'The Fed has been behind in providing for the economy's needs since before the recession started. Here we are, 25 months after the recession began, with nothing that looks remotely like even the worst post-war recovery we have seen - and with a currency crisis to boot. The Fed has bungled away all its flexibility to reduce interest rates, and now, with little firepower left, the dollar is sinking - despite low inflation.' At Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, sentiment was less vitriolic. The Fed, said DLJ, had no choice but to react to the disastrous jobs data by easing monetary policy. Whether or not the absence of a discount rate cut was dictated by foreign exchange considerations or mere logistical timing considerations remained to be seen. 'We suspect the latter,' said DLJ. The bond market may be happy at the effect of more bad economic news on prices. But in broader terms, the outlook for the US economy seems gloomier than ever. Nor are September jobs figures, to be released in early October, likely to look improved. In fact they could be even worse since they will include many who were thrown out of work in Florida by Hurricane Andrew. The bottom line, both for the politicians and the economy itself, may be that even much lower rates are not sufficient to stimulate spending by those many terrified and debt-burdened American consumers and companies who are struggling through the present deflationary environment. The genuinely structural - rather than cyclical - nature of America's economic woes is finally becoming apparent.</p>

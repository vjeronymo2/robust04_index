			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The lesson of hindsight, the best buys of 1988 - Philip Coggan on the most successful investments of the past five years THE ECONOMIC news may have been gloomy for some time, but investors have actually enjoyed quite good returns over the past five years. Interest rates have been high for much of the period, but equity-based products have also shown decent profits despite the impact of adverse factors such as the UK recession and the Gulf War. The table shows that most commonly-held investments have managed to beat inflation and that a significant number of products have produced nominal returns of more than 50 per cent. It also may tell you what you should have invested in five years ago. Tax efficiency helps - which is why, looking at the average figures, friendly society bonds and managed pension funds are top of the list. The snag is that, though the percentage returns are high, it would have been hard to become rich out of a friendly society investment. The maximum monthly contribution into a friendly society in 1988 was Pounds 9 a month. Also, friendly society rules would stop you from realising an investment for another five years - you would only get back your premiums if you surrendered early. Pension funds also have strong tax advantages and the average figures look good. However, those who are about to retire may find that the recent falls in annuity rates offset their profits. Just because they have a bigger pension fund, they will not necessarily get a bigger pension than they would have a year ago. Elsewhere, what will strike many savers is that it was possible to get a very good return at minimal risk. Index-linked National Savings offered a healthy 63 per cent return and allowed the investor to sleep at night without any worries about safety. Indeed for top rate taxpayers, index-linked look even better in comparison; since several other of the investments listed reflect the impact of basic rate tax only. Building society returns were not too far behind index-linked National Savings (at least for larger depositors) and were marginally ahead of unit trusts. The Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester returns are net of basic rate tax and assume the investor switched from the Gold account to the London deposit account at the right time. In January 1988, the Crash of October 1987 was very fresh in investor's minds. Few investors will have been venturing into equities at that time. Those who did take the plunge will have done moderately well, but not extraordinarily so. We have included the stock market indices purely as a guide. They reflect capital gains only, and do not include the yield. On the other hand, they do not allow for any costs and what with bid-offer spreads, brokers' commissions and stamp duty, the factors probably balance out. It is likely that many private investors will have struggled to beat the returns from the FT-SE 100 index or the All-Share. Of the main markets, the best place to have picked in January 1988 was the US. The Dow Jones index more than doubled, in sterling terms, over the past five years, with more than a bit of help from the pound's decline against the dollar. The best way for a UK investor to take advantage was via a North American investment trust (up an average 174.3 per cent over five years) or a unit trust (up 117.5 per cent). Most UK investors, however, stay close to home, and the average returns for all trusts are less impressive. Investment trusts look better than unit trusts in the table but savers should be aware of two important factors. The first is that investment trust returns are shown on mid-market to mid-market basis (with net income reinvested) and do not reflect the full bid-offer spread or brokers' commission. The unit trust figures (offer-to-bid with net income reinvested) take all charges into account. The second factor is that the share price performance of many investment trusts will have benefited from a narrowing of the discount over the five-year period. With some trusts now standing at a premium to net assets, this factor is unlikely to recur - and may well work against investment trusts over the next five years, if the discount starts to widen. Of course, averages are all very well. The actual returns from investing in a unit or investment trust varied very widely from a gain of 306.5 per cent (from investing in the best unit trust - F&amp;C US Smaller Companies) to a loss of 98.5 per cent (from the worst investment trust - Gresham House). Unit trust sector averages are shown as the easiest way of indicating fixed interest returns - and reveal that, because of the pound's decline, the biggest profits were achieved overseas. Finally, a word about single premium bonds. The average managed fund lagged behind the average unit trust; even though the bonds are measured on an offer-to-offer basis, giving them an advantage. Although past performance is useful information, the chances are high, of course, that the comparative returns over the next five years will be completely different. Figures were taken from Micropal and Finstat, except for the indices (from Datastream) or the building society and National Savings figures (provided by institutions concerned).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Five year performance  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- US market (Dow-Jones Industrial in pounds terms)             111.3% Average friendly society unit-linked policy                   69.0% Average managed pension fund                                  66.9% FT-SE 100 index                                               66.2% Average investment trust                                      65.9% Index-linked National Savings                                 63.0% FT-A All-Share                                                56.7% C&amp;G Gold Account/London (pounds10,000 deposit)                55.6% Average unit trust                                            54.8% Average International Fixed Int unit trust                    52.5% Fixed Interest National Savings                               52.1% Average managed unit-linked bond                              49.3% C&amp;G Gold (pounds1,000 deposit)                                41.9% Average UK gilt unit trust                                    38.3% Retail prices index                                           34.7% Tokyo market (Nikkei-225 in pounds terms)                     -5.3%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

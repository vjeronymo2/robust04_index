			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Cookery: The long and the short of buying perfect pasta THE FLOURY fad of making pasta at home seems to be on the wane. Many pasta-making machines have joined the once-fashionable ranks of slow cookers, yoghurt-makers and sandwich toasters, has-beens now rattling like skeletons in the back of kitchen cupboards. Even deli-traiteurs who once boasted massive trayloads of pasta 'freshly made on the premises daily' are cutting back. Yet pasta is bigger business in Britain now than ever. Most of us eat pasta once a week; many eat it twice or more. So where does it come from? The answer in the main is from the High Street multiples. Half-yard lengths of dried spaghetti wrapped in dark blue paper can still be bought, but the major part of our pasta binge is catered for by supermarket own-label fresh pasta. But how good is it? How does it compare with a competent cook's home made? And how does it rate against quality brands of dried pasta from Italy, such as La Molisana, de Cecco and Agnesi? I asked each of the High Street multiples to provide samples of their own label offerings for two blind tastings, one of fresh and one of dried. Each company agreed to supply its plain egg tagliatelle in the two versions. In the event, Asda and Sainsbury failed to deliver. Tesco's fresh was ruled out of court because it was spinach, not plain. Similarly, the dried tagliatelle from Waitrose and Tesco were deemed hors de combat because they were flavoured with garlic and herbs. The field, much reduced, none the less provided an interesting study. I subjected the pastas to a fine selection of palates: Anna Del Conte, Britain's most respected writer on Italian foods; Josceline Dimbleby, winner of this year's Glenfiddich cookery writer award; Simon Parkes, former Michelin inspector and now a radio journalist; Oliver Waley, Anna Del Conte's husband, a critical and experienced pasta eater; and Henry Dimbleby, Jossy's son, fresh from a stint in Bruno Loubet's kitchens at The Inn on the Park in London. Each pasta was prepared the same way - cooked in fast-boiling salted water, drained, but not too thoroughly, and anointed with a smidgeon of unsalted butter (better than olive oil for taste-testing as oil has too much character of its own). We started with the fresh pastas. Even in their raw state the three looked quite different. Marks &amp; Spencer was much the yellowest and the skeins looked almost waxy. Safeways was also yellow, but less intensely so, and the ribbons were thicker. Waitrose was pale buff, grainy looking, narrower and dryish. Depth of colour, Anna suggested, indicates quality. She went on to explain that home-made (ie fresh) tagliatelle is the pasta of northern Italy, traditionally made with nothing but eggs and soft wheat 00 flour. Dried pasta, on the other hand, is the product of the south, traditionally made from hard durum wheat semolina and water. That is why good fresh pasta is yellow, eggy and delicate tasting, while good dried pasta smells and tastes of wheat and has a firmer, floury bite. Each of the three fresh pastas tasted very different. Anna and Henry were especially enthusiastic about the Marks &amp; Spencer. 'Very similar to tagliatelle as I would make it at home,' approved Anna. Indeed, it is made with the classic ingredients: whole eggs imported from Italy (it is the Italian eggs that give the dough its rich colour) and Italian 00 flour - plus a little British flour to facilitate machine rolling. 'Good waxy bite,' 'lovely feel in the mouth' and 'appropriately eggy with no taste of flour' were other appreciative comments though Jossy found it 'rather rubbery'. Safeways fresh pasta was unanimously disliked. Anna suspected the colour was due to carotene. Simon called it 'hard, heavy, laboured'. 'Bad pasta,' said Oliver. 'Stodgy,' 'not good in any way' were other bricks hurled at it. The Waitrose fresh pasta earned more praise although it was not typical of egg tagliatelle, which one expects to be eggy not floury. It had the good wheaty smell, the positive and very pleasant durum wheat taste characteristic of dried pasta, and the correspondingly fine, more floury bite that made it Jossy's favourite of the three fresh pastas we tasted. Anna identified correctly that it was made with durum wheat semolina, egg and water. Moving on to the dried pastas, what with no-shows from Asda and Sainsbury, and Tesco and Waitrose submitting non-comparable samples, we were left with just two dried pastas from the High Street multiples. So we tasted them against the latest Italian dried pasta to arrive in the UK, a brand called Spinosi. Marks &amp; Spencer's dried tagliatelle was remarkable because it was cut so short, looking more like something from a can of Heinz than an adult pasta, and almost impossible to eat since you cannot wind it around a fork. Anna described it as Tuscan, for the Tuscans are so addicted to soup that they always eat their first course with a spoon. 'Flat in looks and taste,' remarked Simon. 'Decidedly odd tasting,' 'terribly sticky and heavy,' 'truly dislikeable,' said the others. Safeway's ribbons of dried tagliatelle were long, white and tightly coiled when raw, and 'edible but not impressive' when cooked. So unenticing were both these offerings that, after some discussion, we decided to refresh them - to rinse them in hot water after cooking to wash away some of the starch. This is commonly done in restaurants to help hold the cooking point and to cope with delays between cooking and serving. Henry had learnt it in Loubet's kitchen. Anna disapproved but the proof was in the eating. Pasta of dubious quality is undoubtedly helped by slightly undercooking it and then refreshing it. Thus treated, the sample dried pastas from Marks and Spencer and Safeways perked up. Suddenly they looked alive and the taste seemed improved. Even so, the final verdict on the M &amp; S offering was a definite thumbs down and the reaction to Safeways was far from ecstatic. The Spinosi experience was totally different, eliciting accolades all round. These tagliatelle are made with durum wheat and egg in a small Italian factory using labour intensive methods. The beautifully thin strands are hand cut, and its taste and its feel in the mouth are 'unmistakeably superior,' as Anna put it. 'Fantastic to eat, bouncy and as light as a feather,' enthused Simon. 'Delicious, full of character and amazingly elastic,' said Jossy. 'And it holds its cooking point perfectly,' said Oliver. In summary, the Waitrose fresh tagliatelle at 89p per 250 gram pack was the cheapest of the pastas we approved of. Marks &amp; Spencer's fresh tagliatelle cost rather more at Pounds 1.19 for the same weight, and Spinosi at Pounds 3.95 cost the earth - but because of its outstanding quality the Spinosi will stretch further. Spinosi is the pasta that is taking over from Cipriani, about which I have enthused before and which Danmar has now ceased to import. Spinosi is even better to eat than Cipriani and Danmar says it is about 20 per cent cheaper. A premium product at a premium price. Waitrose fresh at 89p, with its agreeable wheaty taste, and Marks &amp; Spencer fresh at Pounds 1.19, with its eggy delicacy, are affordable for everyday meals. Both are well worth freezing. Next week: pasta sauces.</p>

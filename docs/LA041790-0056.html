			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MWD MAY OFFER REBATES TO ENCOURAGE CONSERVATION  </P> <P> To encourage saving water, a committee of the Metropolitan Water District on  Monday recommended paying millions of dollars in rebates to water agencies that  get customers to cut use by more than 5% this summer.  </P> <P> The plan, which officials expect to be approved by the MWD board today, would  rebate $100 for every acre-foot of water that local agencies conserve between  June 1 and Sept. 30. If successful, the program would bring an estimated $10  million to the 27 Southern California water agencies served by MWD.  </P> <P> The money could be passed along to retail customers as rewards, could pay for  "water cops" to enforce conservation rules, or could be used to offset lower  water sales, officials said.  </P> <P> "Money is a great persuader," said MWD General Manager Carl Boronkay, who urged  adoption of the rebate program. "In order to get the money, they have to get  demand down. Just how they do that, we don't dictate. . . . We're leaving it to  their imagination."  </P> <P> The rebate program is the centerpiece of MWD's plan for dealing with an  estimated 10% to 12% shortage in water supplies this summer.  </P> <P> The MWD, which supplies about 60% of the water consumed by 15 million residents  in the six-county region, anticipates being short about 200,000 acre-feet of  water because of severe drought conditions that have reduced water supplies  from the Sierra Nevada and Colorado River. An acre-foot is enough water to  cover an acre to a depth of one foot, or 326,000 gallons -- roughly the amount  of water used by two families in a year.  </P> <P> Under the proposed "Drought Action Plan '90," MWD will also spend an estimated  $2 million on advertising, $500,000 on conservation kits and $500,000 on  low-flow plumbing fixture rebate programs.  </P> <P> The agency estimates that those measures can cut overall water consumption by  about 100,000 acre-feet, or roughly 5% of total use. Conservation would be  measured by comparing this summer's use against 1989 figures, adjusted for  population in creases.  </P> <P> Any cut above the 5% target by its member agencies will qualify for the  conservation rebate.  </P> <P> For some agencies, that could be a considerable amount of money.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power uses about 700,000 acre-feet of  water annually, and Mayor Tom Bradley has said that if residents do not  voluntarily save 10% of that amount, he will seek a mandatory rationing system.  If the city meets that goal, DWP could collect about $3.5 million in rebates  from MWD.  </P> <P> Dorothy Jensen, a DWP spokeswoman, said the funds probably would be passed  along to city residents in the form of lower water rates. Based on 1989 total  revenues of $294 million, the rebate would reduce billings by 1.2%.  </P> <P> Passing along savings may help keep the public happier with conservation than  they were in the 1978 drought. At that time, water rates in many communities  went up as usage went down, and water agencies struggled to meet their fixed  business costs.  </P> <P> Boronkay said he is hopeful that the rebate program will help local water  agencies, serving more than 300 communities across Southern California, to  develop programs for cutting use voluntarily.  </P> <P> Besides paying $10 million in rebates, the agency could lose an additional $25  million in revenues if usage drops 10%, a spokesman said. The MWD, one of the  largest water agencies in the nation, has about $150 million in cash on hand.  </P> <P> Despite the cost of the rebates, MWD would like to conserve more than 10%, so  the agency can increase its water reserves in case of a fifth year of drought.  </P> <P> "It's better to give the carrot and save the stick for a more drastic  situation," said Boronkay. During earlier droughts, MWD also adopted a punitive  pricing schedule that charged higher rates to water agencies that failed to cut  use by 10%.  </P></p>

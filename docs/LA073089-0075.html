			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUBSTANCE ABUSE AS CHILD ABUSE;  </P> <P> THE BROKEN CORD BY MICHAEL DORRIS (HARPER &amp; ROW: $18.95; 314 PP.;  0-06-016071-3)  </P> <P> Having spent most of my professional life in Indian country, I have struggled  to understand and deal with the overwhelming phenomenon that is alcohol abuse  among American Indians. I am still filled with shame at my impotence before it  and with rage at the destruction it wreaks, especially upon unborn children.  </P> <P> It is not enough to say that "The Broken Cord," Michael Dorris' new book about  Indian alcohol abuse, is good. Written like a prayer from the heart of someone  strong enough to share his pain, it tells a tale of crimes against Native  American children that approach the dimensions of genocide.  </P> <P> Dorris -- of Native American (Modoc) descent himself -- is professor of  anthropology and Native American studies at Dartmouth College and was among the  first unmarried men in the United States to adopt a very young child. "The  Broken Cord" is about the first of his three Native American adoptive children.  </P> <P> Adam, born seven weeks prematurely, was severely neglected and abused by his  biological mother, who died an alcoholic death before she was 35. Gradually,  Dorris realized that Adam was learning very slowly and that time wasn't  improving his condition. It was not until the boy was almost 10 years old,  however, that it became clear to his father that the constellation of his  physical symptoms -- unusual head shape, altered facial characteristics,  seizures, skeletal deformities, attention deficit, behavioral problems and  mental retardation -- meant that he was suffering from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.  </P> <P> That the recognition came slowly is no surprise: The first scientific article  about birth defects in children born to alcoholic parents was not published  until 1968, the year Adam was born. And not until 1973 were these observations  at all widespread in the United States. There are now more than 2,000  contributions to the literature.  </P> <P> Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is not unique to Native Americans. It is a serious  concern in Europe, Asia and Latin America. And yet for scarcely any group is it  so great a problem as it is for American Indians. Neither smallpox nor  tuberculosis nor any of the other European infectious diseases (for which  Indians had no natural immunity), neither military defeat nor the ensuing  neo-colonialism and racism has accomplished a comparable destruction of the  native peoples. It is alcohol that may now be sowing the seeds of the "final  solution" for Native America.  </P> <P> The statistics and history of the problem are not the focus of "The Broken  Cord." By way of historical overview, though, consider that Adam is a Lakota  child. The Lakota, whom we call Sioux, are a hunter-warrior group of complex  religious and healing traditions and exquisite arts and crafts. In the  beginning, the Lakota were willing to live and let live with the trickle of  pioneers who first penetrated the Northern Plains. When gold was discovered,  however, the trickle became a torrent; entrepreneurs, prospectors and hunters  exploited the sacred Earth. War became inevitable.  </P> <P> By the 1880s, the nomadic hunters were restricted by martial law to  reservations, the buffalo no longer roamed the Plains, and alcohol -- first  introduced by trappers at the turn of the 19th Century -- had become a growing  problem. Disconnected from a credible past, from those shared symbols and myths  that sustain their culture, the Lakota were ripe for the demoralization of  which alcohol abuse is a manifestation.  </P> <P> Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is a completely preventable disease. If mothers abstain  from alcohol during pregnancy, their children do not become afflicted. But, in  tragic numbers, the preventable goes unprevented. There are 7,500 reported  cases of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome in the United States each year, and the number  is probably dramatically under-reported. Those statistics don't include most of  the cases of Fetal Alcohol Effect, in which the symptomatic manifestations are  less profound but no less debilitating.  </P> <P> My own experience suggests that Dorris' and others' estimates that up to  one-third of Indian youngsters are afflicted by Fetal Alcohol Effect may be too  conservative. There are Indian communities where, if we include the morbidity  from Fetal Alcohol Effect, the death rate exceeds the live birth rate.  </P> <P> The chilling fact is that alcohol is the most severe and widespread health  problem among American Indians today. There is scarcely a single living Native  American who is not directly or indirectly (through the extended family)  plagued by alcohol. The alcohol-related death rate among Native Americans is 6  1/2 times the national rate. The suicide rate is 2 1/2 times the national rate  and even higher among the Native American young. Whatever the theories of  causation, alcohol is threatening to destroy 1.5 million contemporary Indian  people. The annihilation is almost unimaginable.  </P> <P> Dorris gives all this a name, a face and a personal history that make it  impossible for the reader to remain detached. His story is not the musing of a  well-manicured academic with anthropological objectivity. The book may do  little in fact to speed Dorris along on the academic fast track. Never  pedantic, the author is unabashed about his own inflexibility and passionate in  his exhortations and judgements.  </P> <P> "The Broken Cord" begins as the story of a 26-year-old doctoral student who  wants a child. Dorris says: "Single parenthood had for generations been the  practical norm in my family." One would like to know more. Why not get married  first? Is this some unresolved sexual thing? What are the unconscious dynamics?  Dorris does tell us of his naivete, even the conceit of his certainty that  whatever had been the noxious influences in his son's early life, he would by  dint of his own commitment and love offset them. Adam's life would commence  from the moment when the two of them came together.  </P> <P> Painfully, Dorris learns that nature is more important than nurture in  predicting not just physical characteristics but behaviors as well. And he is  willing to re-examine an idealistic confidence bordering on arrogance and look  again at everything he once thought he knew.  </P> <P> Dorris is an unusual man. Not only does he adopt Adam knowing that his mental  development has been quite slow, he also confronts Adam's ever more numerous  and life-threatening physical maladies. But, despite the fact that these co-opt  much of his time and energies, Dorris proceeds to adopt two more children while  still a single parent -- all this while teaching, administering and publishing.  </P> <P> Consider this scene: Adam is napping. Dorris returns from his teaching  responsibilities to meet the social worker for the first official,  post-adoption home visit. He proceeds to bake an apple pie from scratch, find  the ingredients for a tomato-bacon soup lying around, squeeze lemons for  lemonade and then sift flour for a double-Dutch-chocolate cake.  </P> <P> During the period covered by the book, Dorris publishes a novel ("Yellow Raft  in Blue Water"), gets promoted to full professor and in between teaches  high-impact aerobics. (I must be working one-quarter time or have a glandular  condition.)  </P> <P> Ten years after Adam's adoption, Dorris marries the distinguished, National  Book Award-winning novelist Louise Erdrich. Erdrich writes an impassioned and  sensitive foreword to "The Broken Cord." Together they produce three more  children while pursuing their distinguished careers.  </P> <P> I loved this book, and yet I found myself wanting to know more. What has it  been like surviving as husband and wife in the face of such daily trauma and  its explosive potential for divisiveness? Did they ever want to kill each other  or at least run away? What impact have the afflictions of Adam had on their  other children? What price the pursuit of their unique vision? I want to know  more.  </P> <P> This hunger takes nothing away from the power of Dorris' material, however, and  probably bespeaks mainly my own need to come to peace with my history. You see,  I also adopted a child, a 3-year-old boy. The experience has been the most  painful and illuminating of my life, and I have not yet found the courage to  write about it.  </P></p>

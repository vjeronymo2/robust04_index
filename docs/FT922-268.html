			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Recession overturns southern and regional divide THE lingering recession has overturned the caricatured relationship between Britain's southern economic core and its regional periphery. The southern regions have fared badly while Scotland and Northern Ireland have escaped relatively unscathed. Yet the slow spread of the recession from services into manufacturing means the west Midlands has suffered the sharpest fall in output over the last eight quarters, according to Business Strategies, the regional consultancy. The service and consumer-oriented recession was largely a punishment for the excessive growth rates enjoyed by London and the south-east in the latter half of the 1980s. Rapid southern growth and the lingering side effects of the last, northern-biased recession, opened wide north-south gaps in unemployment rates, house prices and incomes per head. But Britain's economic boom proved unsustainable and the combination of heavy debts, high real interest rates and falling house prices affected the spending power of southern consumers worse than less indebted consumers elsewhere. Across a wide range of economic indicators - unemployment, house prices, bankruptcies - the southern regions have fared worst. The south-east may still have a lower unemployment rate than the average, but the difference has closed to 0.5 percentage points from 1.5 percentage points when the recession started, and 2.8 percentage points in 1987. The south's hangover is likely to impede economic recovery this year. National Westminster Bank expects a sluggish recovery to be led by Wales, the north of England and Scotland. The wealth and economic power of southern Britain means that those regions are expected to experience above-average growth rates when the economy shakes off its lethargy. NatWest expects the fastest growth rates in the next five years to be experienced by the four regions bordering the south-east.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ANATOMY OF THE RECESSION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- NORTH-WEST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Slowdown rather than shutdown, thanks to the diversity and strength of Greater Manchester. Bus scars from the last recession remain, particularly in Merseyside.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Our central concern is the contraction of the defence and aviation industries. We have a skilled workforce increasingly without work, markets and prospects.' Basil Jeuda, managing director of Inward, the north-west investment agency.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SCOTLAND  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mild recession caused much less pain than in the over-borrowed south. North Sea oil industry has flourished and manufacturing exports have held up well.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'If the recovery does come to the south east it will be a challenge for Scotland to match it. People down there still have more money to spend.' Ron Garrick, chief executive of the Weir Group, the engineering company  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WEST MIDLANDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Deep recession interrupted recovery from the early 1980s shakeout in engineering and halted the more recent service sector expansion.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Business across a wide spread of products and services is, at best, flat and the economy is likely to remain that way for the rest of the year.' Gareth Davies, chairman of Glynwed International, the engineering group.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SOUTH-EAST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bore the brunt of the service-sector recession, but the region's wealth and proximity to Europe make it a good growth bet when the recovery finally materialises.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'We would expect the recent, very gradual uplift in the retail sector to continue. How the south responds will largely determine the strength of Britain's economic recovery.' Nigel Whittaker, director of Kingfisher, the retail conglomerate.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Argentine voters set to endorse reforms: Menem's liberalisation has become Peronists' biggest electoral asset THE RULING Peronist party in Argentina is virtually assured of victory in Sunday's mid-term congressional elections. Pollsters expect the government to take about 40 per cent of the votes, against 30 per cent for the opposition Radical party. The elections, for half the 257 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, should confirm therefore the popularity of President Carlos Menem and his free-market economic policies, ensuring continued political stability to enable the government to deepen economic reforms. In the four years since he took office, Mr Menem has implemented far-reaching economic liberalisation which has brought low inflation and rapid growth. These policies have become the government's biggest electoral asset. Mr Manuel Mora y Araujo, a leading pollster, says: 'Economics are fundamental. People may say the government has many defects, that it's inefficient and corrupt, but at least it does certain things well. You don't change horses in midstream.' Whatever the result, nobody expects economic stability to be affected. Mr Pedro Lacoste, a business consultant, expects inflation to continue falling to 4 per cent in 1994 from a forecast 8 per cent this year. Growth of 5 per cent this year is expected to continue into 1994. But victory on Sunday will probably not be enough for Mr Menem to gain the support of the two-thirds of Congress he needs to change the constitution, which bans successive presidential terms, and run for a second term when his mandate ends in 1995. The Peronists hold only 45 per cent of seats in the Chamber of Deputies and the poll on Sunday is not expected to increase that. Even so, Mr Menem intends to keep up the pressure for his re-election. He said on Wednesday he would call a plebiscite on the issue. This, however, would not be binding on Congress. Whether or not he has to abandon his ambition to remain in office, the congressional election result is likely to suggest he will remain sufficiently powerful to designate his successor, via presidential elections due by December 1994. The outcome of the elections on Sunday, in which all the main Peronist presidential candidates are participating directly or indirectly, will narrow the field. Mr Eduardo Duhalde, former vice-president and now governor of Buenos Aires, Argentina's wealthiest province, should benefit from a decisive victory over the Radicals. A coalition assembled by Mr Ramon Ortega, governor of the poor north-western province of Tucuman, is expected to get 43 per cent of the vote, against 16 per cent for the opposition. The great unknown is the economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, who has become Mr Menem's most powerful and most popular minister. He has fielded a trusted aide to lead the Peronist campaign in his home province of Cordoba, a Radical bastion. He has played a leading role in the campaign. If the Peronists perform well there, by running the Radicals close, then Mr Cavallo's supposed presidential ambitions - which he denies - will gain added strength. The political future of three powerful Radicals is also in the balance. Mr Eduardo Angeloz, the conservative governor of Cordoba and Mr Menem's opponent in the 1989 presidential election, has the most to lose by a strong Peronist performance. Mr Federico Storani, a left-leaning politician, has campaigned well in the Peronist heartland of Buenos Aires province and could mount a credible challenge for the party leadership. Senator Fernando de la Rua, a veteran centrist politician, is masterminding the Radical effort in the city of Buenos Aires, where the party is traditionally strong. However, he has picked weak candidates and the Peronists - led by Mr Erman Gonzalez, a former economy minister - are expected to do well. Mr Mora y Araujo doubts fringe politicians on the extreme left and right will be able to gain much ground. The Radicals are riven by internal divisions and will almost certainly pay the price with yet another electoral defeat - their fourth consecutive reverse. A rout in the 1987 mid-term elections led to the collapse in 1989 of President Raul Alfonsn's Radical government, amid hyperinflation and social upheaval. The election on Sunday demonstrates the growing solidity of Argentina's political system. It is 10 years since the military returned government to the civilians after a fierce seven years in power. The stresses that led to six military coups since 1930 have largely disappeared. Despite widespread criticism of the arrogance and corruption of their politicians, few Argentines question the legitimacy of the democratic system. Mr Lacoste hopes the government will seize the initiative and use its remaining 22 months in office to implement overdue plans to reform the rigid labour market, crack down on widespread tax evasion, and improve its inefficient and corrupt social policies. Above all, the pace of liberalisation cannot slacken: 'There is a great dynamism and flexibility, making many sectors competitive. It's a question of time, as country-risk declines, (before) an infinity of projects will become attractive.'</p>

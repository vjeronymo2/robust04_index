			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME IMPROVEMENT;  </P> <P> AVOID, CURE PROBLEMS WITH EXTERIOR PAINTING  </P> <P> Usually it's the paint itself that gets the blame for paint problems on your  home's exterior.  </P> <P> But in most cases the cause lies elsewhere. Here are some common problems and  ways to prevent them.  </P> <P> Blistering is the earliest stage of peeling and is usually caused by moisture  trapped under the new paint coat or by poor surface preparation.  </P> <P> If it occurs within the first few weeks, it's probably caused by trapped  moisture. While latex paint can usually be applied to damp surfaces without any  problem, alkyd and other oil-based paints form a moisture barrier skin that  traps the water inside. The water then turns to vapor and forms blisters.  </P> <P> To avoid this, never paint with alkyds after a rainstorm, when the relative  humidity is more than 85%; while dew is on the siding, or too soon after you've  washed the old surface. Also, never paint when the temperature is more than 90  degrees.  </P> <P> If the blisters appear after a month or so, the problem is probably poor  surface preparation. If you washed the surface down with detergents, did you  take the time to rinse completely? Unless such films are removed before  painting, they can cause blistering. Also, glossy surfaces must be given a  light sanding, so the new paint will grip well.  </P> <P> Peeling is the curling of large pieces of dried paint and is merely a later  manifestation of blistering. Severe peeling may also indicate use of a poor  primer, or a heavy film of dirt, grease or dust.  </P> <P> Prevention involves sanding or wiping the old finish with a deglossing liquid.  Then follow the manufacturer's directions as to what primer may be required  before applying the top coat of paint.  </P> <P> Alligatoring is a cracking and flaking of the paint in a square pattern. It can  result from applying paint over a previous coat that had a high gloss finish  that was not sanded, use of the wrong primer or use of old paint, particularly  paint that's been stored in an unheated space and allowed to freeze.  </P> <P> To repair the condition, sand the surface smooth and apply the proper primer  before applying a new top coat.  </P> <P> Checking is a series of long lines, with shorter check marks crossing between,  usually caused by the wood underneath expanding and contracting. This can be a  problem with exposed plywood siding regardless of the kind of paint used.  </P> <P> Sanding and then applying a new coat of wood primer will usually solve the  problem. But if the new paint shows signs of coming loose, complete removal of  the old paint is required.  </P> <P> Wrinkling results in a crinkled surface that is caused by interfering with  required drying time. Contributing factors are too-thick finish coat, building  up of too many layers, undercoat that was not completely dry, wrong solvent or  improperly stirred paint. Repair by sanding smooth and applying proper primer  before painting top coat.  </P> <P> Chalking or powdering characteristics are designed into some paints in order to  keep the surface looking new. Chalking of old paint can interfere with proper  bonding of a new coat, so scrub off as much as possible beforehand. In severe  cases you may have to apply a bonding primer or sealer.  </P> <P> Mildew manifests itself as patches of black spots. Though most exterior paints  contain mildew-inhibiting ingredients, none work under all circumstances.  </P> <P> Remove mildew by washing down the affected area with a bleach solution. Use  one-third cup powdered laundry detergent, two-thirds cup of household cleaner  containing trisodium phosphate, and one quart of household bleach. Wear long  pants, a long-sleeved shirt, gloves, goggles and a respirator to avoid  breathing the fumes.  </P> <P> Stains that bleed through the paint are often the result of sap from knots in  the wood seeping through the surface. But they also can be caused by rust from  nails and hardware.  </P> <P> Many discolorations bleed through coat after coat of paint, so repainting alone  is not the answer. Instead, apply a primary coat of stain killer, such as  pigmented shellac-base sealer, and then apply your paint.  </P></p>

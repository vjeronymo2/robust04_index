This AD requires an inspection and repetitive visual checks for slippage of the tail rotor (T/R) drive and replacement of the T/R gearbox, if necessary. This amendment is prompted by two incidents in which the T/R output key (key) was not installed between the output shaft and the output pinion during assembly of the T/R gearbox. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent slippage of the T/R drive, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective on November 21, 1994, to all persons except those persons to whom it was made immediately effective by Priority Letter AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;07, issued on August 25, 1994, which contained the requirements of this amendment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 21,1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments for inclusion in the Rules Docket must be received on or before January 3, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;SW&hyph;10&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Blvd., Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applicable service information may be obtained from Robinson Helicopter Company, 24747 Crenshaw Blvd., Torrance, CA 90505.

That action was prompted by two incidents in which the T/R output key (key) was not installed between the output shaft and the output pinion during assembly of the T/R gearbox. The key is required to prevent the output gear from rotating on the output shaft. Both incidents resulted in slippage of the T/R drive. On June 2, 1994, Registro Aeronautico Italiano (RAI), the Airworthiness Authority of Italy, issued RAI AD No. 94&hyph;131 to require a daily inspection to determine if there had been any slippage of the T/R drive between the output shaft and the output pinion. This condition, if not corrected, could result in slippage of the T/R drive, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has reviewed Robinson Helicopter Company R22 Service Bulletin (SB)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 74, dated July 18, 1994, that describes procedures for determining slippage of the T/R drive using a 35-lb. load on the T/R blade and checking for correct alignment of dots that have been marked in accordance with SB  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 74, dated July 18, 1994. The FAA is issuing this AD to require the initial marking of dots and an inspection prior to further flight, rather than within the next 20 hours time-in-service (TIS) as specified by SB  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 74, dated July 18, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the unsafe condition described is likely to exist or develop on other Robinson Helicopter Company Model R22 series helicopters of the same type design, the FAA issued Priority Letter AD 94&hyph;17&hyph;07 to prevent slippage of the T/R drive, loss of directional control, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter. The AD requires the installation of alignment marks, an initial inspection prior to further flight, daily pre-flight visual checks for slippage of the T/R drive, and replacement of the T/R gearbox, if necessary. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. This AD is considered to be an interim action. The FAA is considering further rulemaking to require opening the T/R gearbox and verifying installation of the key as the terminating action to this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

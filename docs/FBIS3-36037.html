In an interview  for MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, Eduard Rossel, the failed governor  of the Urals Republic, waved his hand enthusiastically: "Crimea  is a Russian land, and I favor its being reclaimed by Russia as  soon as possible." When asked by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS how  much time the construction of a dam or a bridge across the Kerch  strait will take, Mr. Rossel, of German origin, revealed that he  knew firms that could cope with such an order fairly quickly.  The bridge that would connect the Russian Federation with  Crimea could be built vertically and lowered later when the  situation allows. The cautious Nikolay Gonchar, guarding his  reputation as a centrist, said that Crimean President Yuriy  Meshkov is a good and calm person, but that Moscow and Kiev  should touch upon the Crimean issue very carefully so as not to  carry matters to the brink of war. Mr. Gonchar called on both  the president and the Federation Council to agree on a common  stand on the Crimean issue so as not to transplant local  passions to Moscow. Formerly, the stances of the president and  the Russian Supreme Soviet regarding Crimea were diametrically  opposed, a fact that was skillfully exploited by Crimean  extremists.</p>

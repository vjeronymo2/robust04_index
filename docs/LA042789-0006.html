			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A COLD SHOULDER;  </P> <P> MISPLACED SENTIMENTALITY  </P> <P> Modern medicine probably has contributed more to the practical liberation of  mankind than all political ideologies and economic systems combined. No other  form of human endeavor has done as much to eliminate suffering, degradation and  grief from our daily lives.  </P> <P> One of the many traumas inflicted by the AIDS epidemic is the grim reminder of  what life was like in all the long centuries through which disease, mysterious  and merciless, rampaged at will.  </P> <P> These simple observations ought to be self-evident. We repeat them because the  nation's medical researchers currently are enduring the annual week of siege  imposed by so-called animal rights activists, who believe that all experiments  involving live animals ought to be stopped.  </P> <P> These eccentric demands should not to be confused with the serious concerns of  responsible animal welfare advocates. In recent years the latter have done much  to remind scientists of how important it is to police the small minority of  researchers who sometimes have taken an insensitive or overly casual approach  to experimentation on animals.  </P> <P> In fact, if their consequences were not so serious,the actions of the animals  rights cranks could be ignored for what they are, self-righteous tantrums  masquerading as appeals to conscience. However, because those involved are  willing to engage in illegal disruption and even burglary, their campaign  already has forced a diversion of attention and resources our medical  laboratories can ill afford.  </P> <P> Research on non-human species is an unfortunate, but indispensable part of  valid medical science. Though zealots may claim otherwise, no tissue culture or  computer simulation can take the place of a complex living organism in  determining the usefulness and, more important, the safety of new drugs and  medical technologies.  </P> <P> At the root of this silly controversy there is, indeed, cruelty and  callousness. It does not, however, occur in our medical laboratories, but in  minds so self-absorbed and vulgar that they are able to equate the suffering of  mice with that of dying children.  </P> <P> Behind the animals rights movement is a misplaced sentimentality pretending to  be compassion. It should exert no claim on any conscience capable of mature and  sober reflection.  </P></p>

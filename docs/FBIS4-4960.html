			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 KYODO -- The Air Self-Defense Force  (ASDF) has proposed freeing air space in the vicinity of a base  in Shizuoka Prefecture for civilian use in exchange for  converting the base into a host facility for AWACS [airborne  warning and control system] aircraft, Defense Agency sources  said Monday [4 April]. The sources said the proposal was made  in talks between the Defense Agency and the Transport Ministry  over the use of skies off the ASDF base at Hamamatsu, which is  used for training exercises over the Pacific Ocean.    Under the proposal, the base would be used exclusively for  AWACS-converted Boeing 767 passenger planes, while its current  training function would be shifted to another base, possibly on  the Japan Sea coast.    The Transport Ministry has long been eyeing a return of the  training air space since a major air corridor runs through it,  utilized by about 330 civilian aircraft a day. The number of  those planes is expected to increase with the opening of the new  Kansai International Airport this fall.    AWACS stands for airborne early warning and control system,  where airborne vehicles are equipped with search and  height-finding radar and communications equipment for  controlling weapons.</p>

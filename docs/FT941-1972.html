			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Arts: Enlightenment for all - Television Did you see that excellent programme Modern Art about the Musee d'Orsay? Tim Benton expressed the intriguing thought that the curators exhibited the Impressionists but did not dare put out their big collection of 'pompier art' - all that 19th century wedding cake stuff  - although they recognised its historic importance, because they feared that people might think they actually liked it. And what about that documentary on the development of the bicycle, Design Principles, which showed that some of the best designs have never been mass produced because of bureaucratic rules about the definition of 'bicycle'? Did you catch Ron Moody playing Aristotle, Galileo and Newton in that short drama about the beginnings of physics, Newton's Revolution? Or see the eye-opening programme Managing Schools which showed how the theory of 'collegiality' (oh dear) has led to committee mania with some teachers now seeming to spend as much time referring up or down and making references back as they spend in the classroom? If the answer in each case is no, it is hardly surprising, because none of those programmes was trendy or 'sexy' within television's special definition (striking and appealingly fashionable). They were not made to win big ratings and, since none of them appealed to the lowest common denominator, they were not promoted by the BBC which screened them all. Indeed, the BBC barely acknowledges their existence. They are all Open University programmes, and consequently shown on BBC2, early in the morning or late at night, coned off behind the OU logo. Yet they are available to us all, and if you seek them out - loading the video recorder each night with a three-hour tape timed to start at 6.15 in the morning is the best way - you find yourself watching the sort of television which you may have forgotten was possible. Television does not have to come at you all the time like a fairground stall staffed by teenage speed freaks. There is a calmness and an intelligence here which is wonderfully refreshing. Of course not all OU programmes are made to the same standard, or in the same style, and, unless you are a true polymath, some will leave you baffled. I stuck with Genetics - Beyond The Double Helix while they explained how miles of DNA is coiled up neatly to get it inside a cell, but when they began to assume that I knew the meaning of things such as 'X-ray diffraction' I gave up. Pure Maths: Orthogonal Bases I deserted even faster since I did not understand the symbols. However, at the other end of the spectrum are programmes which are almost indistinguishable from the more serious offerings in mainstream television. Some, such as an episode in the Technology series billed as 'Eurekaargh]', turn out to be literally indistinguishable: this was an old Horizon programme about the exploitation of patents. Performing Art, which was simply billed as the midnight programme on BBC2 on Tuesday last week without any reference to the OU (probably sensible if the BBC wants to maximise its audience) was an engrossing report on the huge success of the new Tate Gallery in St Ives. True, it was more concerned with the creation and organisation of the gallery than with the pictures on the walls, but it could have stood up in any of television's arts slots. It was far more interesting than much of the overwhelmingly metropolitan material on The Late Show. Filling the remarkably large central area between the bewilderingly specialised and the universally appealling are many programmes which, while slightly more pedagogic than we would expect these days from mainstream television, are perfectly comprehensible to anyone with a reasonable education. Many are on subjects which mainstream television either ignores or treats only in a destructively reductionist manner. Outstanding in my two-week sampling was the first in a series called Lifestyles, Work And The Family which compared changing expectations and social attitudes between two generations of doctors in one family and two generations of steel workers in another. No doubt this would be considered not punchy enough for television's normal current affairs series, yet in terms of history, politics in the broadest sense, and sociology, it is powerful stuff. The episode 'It's A Lovely Day Tomorrow' in the series Science, Technology, And Everyday Life was a startling reminder of the Pollyanna attitudes towards scientific 'progress' in the first half of the 20th century. Best of all, perhaps, was another episode in the Modern Art series which ranged widely from a discussion of attitudes towards women in pictures by Degas and his contemporaries to an exploration of the redevelopment of Paris by Haussmann; an utterly absorbing programme. The style may sometimes jar a little. It is usually fairly obvious that the presenters are academics first and broadcasters second, though none that I saw was completely inept, and presentation has improved since the early days. Although the flared trousers and Zapata moustaches which, thanks to repeats, appeared to survive for so long as a uniform among OU presenters, have now (almost) all gone, you can still find yourself brought up short by some Marxist comment which sounds endearingly dated, five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Similarly you can still come across old fashioned finger-wagging feminism, yet both are now exceptional. There is another difference between OU material and other television programmes. Difficult to pin down precisely, the most important aspect is probably that OU personnel do not feel compelled to strain perpetually for 'balance', either politically or between any other schools of ideas. As often as not the OU tone indicates the sort of detachment and scepticism regarding all traditional and received wisdom which is such a healthy aspect of the better sort of academic life. A little more of it in mainstream television journalism could go a long way.</p>

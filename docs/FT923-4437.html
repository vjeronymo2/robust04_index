			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Arts: Revival brings Yan Tan Tethera into sharper perspective - Music theatre IT IS 10 years since Opera Factory burst upon London's staid sensibilities with David Freeman's startling production of Birtwistle's Punch and Judy. In the last decade, the company has established itself as a vital third force in the capital's operatic life, clinging on without ever receiving the level of financial support it deserves, yet scoring a good many more invigorating hits than misses in its catholic range of stagings. One of those successes from 1986 is currently being revived in the Queen Elizabeth Hall - Yan Tan Tethera, Birtwistle's 'mechanical past-oral' to a text by Tony Harrison. It is a slender tale. A northern shepherd, Alan, comes south to settle among the sarsen stones of the Wiltshire downs with his wife, Hannah, and white-faced sheep. His success there attracts the envy of the local shepherd, Caleb Raven, whose black-faced flock fails to thrive; Caleb enlists the support of the Bad Un to steal away Alan and his newborn twin boys. In the end, of course, northern intuition and faith triumph over southern evil and avarice: Hannah's reliance on the old magic and the potency of traditional counting ('yan, tan, tethera, methera, pimp') restores Alan and her children to her; Caleb is trapped by his own greed, and the rest live happily ever after. At the premiere six years ago it seemed a rather undramatic, unfocused piece, especially when set against the theatrical magnificence of Birtwistle's Mask of Orpheus, which had finally been staged at the Coliseum only two months earlier. But the revival puts everything into a much sharper perspective; Yan Tan Tethera can be now appreciated strictly on its own terms and the Opera Factory production seems altogether more tightly and confidently worked, with the orchestral contribution made far more telling. The cast is almost entirely new; only Tom McDonnell, as the Ram leading the wonderfully observed chorus of sheep, has survived. The portrayals this time are, in general, less severe and their fluid style adds yet another layer to the complex dramatic web. Birtwistle's hieratic musical treatment, full of overlapping cycles and a likewise magical belief in the power of counting, Harrison's emphatically rhymed text and the strict ritualised scenario combine to create a subtle clockwork of its own. There may be a viable way of presenting Yan Tan Tethera that follows the prescriptions of the libretto more closely (in what was originally conceived as an opera for television), but Freeman's carefully detailed naturalism gives it positive life and energy. As it is, Geoffrey Dolton's Alan, full of wonder and naive hope, and Marie Angel's passionate, unflinching Hannah bring the central characters alive in a way that the piece originally seemed to preclude. Dolton delivers his counting rhymes with vivid certainty, while Angel's luscious tone and compelling stage movement make every phrase into an adventure in itself. Patrick Donnelly does as much as he can to flesh out Caleb's character; Harry Nicolls flits around effectively as the pipe-playing Bad Un. The chorus, steeped in sheep body-language, is a constant fascination and, an occasional ill-judged Larry-the-Lamb phrase apart, sings with great intensity. The musical success of the revival stems from the conducting of Mark Wigglesworth and the playing of the Premiere Ensemble, who invest the score with intense lyrical detail. The music is typical of Birtwistle's writing in the early 1980s: beautifully wrought, absolutely free of unnecessary rhetoric and conjuring a succession of striking images - haunting wind figures, webs of unfurling string lines, sudden stark percussive attacks. Here they are all fitted into a perfect dramatic context; the scale and ambition of the piece are exactly matched. Queen Elizabeth Hall; further performances September 7, 8, 11 and 12.</p>

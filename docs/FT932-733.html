			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / How To Spend It: Nineties-style? It's all so simple, really  -Lucia van der Post picks up some useful tips on making the modern home a model of clean, uncluttered chic WE HAVE all been told many times that nineties-style is simple style. Conventional wisdom has it that overnight the bad old sumptuous ways became demode and the truly chic household was suddenly transformed into a model of pared-down simplicity. Reality, of course, is different. The words may be easy to say, realising it is much less easy to bring off . . . particularly for those whose houses are still laden with the legacies of 1980s chic. There are many, though, for whom the new wisdom chimes with a change in the inner psychology, who find their natural tastes and inclinations veering towards a more pared-down way of life, who feel an instinctive rebellion against the over-blown excesses of the eighties and who long to translate this into a cleaner, fresher-looking home. What they need is a 1990s version of Mrs Beeton, a kind of comprehensive encyclopaedia or guide-book to the new life-style. Needless to say, where there is a gap, something usually fills it and this week sees the launch of . . . guess what? . . . a primer on simple chic. Chic Simple* is a cross between a visual record, a sourcebook and an evangelical tome. It goes in for lots of inspiring photographs and plenty of uplifting aphorisms, all homing in on the wondrous benefits of simplicity. Anybody who is anybody in design circles has a go. Here, for instance, we have Andree Putman, that meteor of the French design scene who designed offices for Jack Lang, the French Minister of Culture, as well as smart boutiques in almost every capital of the world. 'Unless you have a feeling for that secret knowledge that modest things can be more beautiful than anything expensive, you will never have style.' Then, on comfort: 'Of course, I love seven pillows behind me, but physical comfort is never the first thing. I prefer spiritual comfort, by which I mean space, light (natural, as well as artificial), contrast of textures, and pure lines. I never look for literal comfort, but for something that allows my mind to rest.' Then we have Sir Terence Conran: 'I firmly believe that plain, simple things are superior to flashy, complicated ones. Something that is simple and satisfying is a greater achievement than something fussy. Good objects are designed with honesty, integrity, simplicity, and guts. A plain glass milk bottle can ultimately be more impressive than an intricate silver gilt pitcher.' If these are the sort of sentiments that you feel comfortable with then Chic Simple has a lot to offer. It presents a powerful visual argument for restraint, quality and purity - most floors are wooden, most walls white or cream, objects are functional, streamlined and - it goes almost without saying - efficiently designed. Simple, often neglected things, are photographed in a way that makes one look at them properly and see their beauty - a battered table (Candice Bergen is quoted as saying 'I pay a fortune for these battered tables, and my husband says, 'Aren't you going to paint them?' And I say, 'You don't understand the concept here','), a collection of some everyday kitchen utensils, an old cupboard, a couple of wooden chairs - 'A chair is a very difficult object to design,' says Mies van der Rohe. 'A skyscraper is almost easier, that is why Chippendale is famous.' If a consensus does emerge it is probably best summed up by Le Corbusier - 'Space and light and order. These are the things men need just as much as they need bread or a place to sleep.' It is probably evident by now that this is almost a compendium of pictures, philosophies, poetry, attitudes, all adding up to a package of considerable charm. It is a book, above all, to dip into but it is also a reference book, for the practical bit comes last - at the back is a useful list of sources for the ingredients that make up the simple life. From the US to England, France, Australia and Japan there are the suppliers of highly functional lighting, of the best modern furniture, of the rugs and taps and kitchens. The book itself can be bought from Muji branches at 26, Great Marlborough Street, London W1, 39 Shelton Street, London WC2 and 63-67, Queen Street, Glasgow. Muji, regular readers may remember, is the Japanese company dedicated to pursuing the anti-label way of life, and which will be filling its windows with photographs of the Muji way to nineties living. The book is also available in branches of Waterstone's bookshops. More visual inspiration, though of a much more vibrant nature, can be found in Tricia Guild's Design and Detail: The Practical Guide to Styling a House*. Here we have Tricia Guild's sure and individual way with colour, though stronger and more primary than in the floral days of old. If you have ever been hesitant about how to hang your pictures, how to make flowers look more enticing than a conventional florist's offering, how to present food so that it looks dramatic and appetising, here is your pictorial guide. Filled with ravishing full-colour pictures it would be a dull person indeed who did not come away with a few ideas on how to update their rooms. Finally, The Reject Shop chain of stores has a small, simple mail order catalogue from which you can order a few of life's necessities - plain as plain sofas, straightforward chests of drawers, slatted folding chairs and a simple series of dining tables. The lines are clean and pleasing, the prices good. Find the catalogue at any one of The Reject Shop's many branches or telephone 071-736-7474 for a free copy. *Chic Simple is published by Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 12.95. Design and Detail by Tricia Guild is published by Conran Octopus, Pounds 12.99.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lucia Perez Moreno] </F>   [Text] Athens, 29 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Belize today abandoned  the 10th Central American and European Union [EU] Foreign  Ministers' Meeting after Greece, the host country, withdrew its  observer status.    The incident occurred after the Guatemalan delegation asked  Theodoros Pangalos, current chairman of the European Council of  Ministers, to withdraw Belize's status as observer at the  ministerial meeting.    "Belize's participation in the San Jose meetings will depend  on the context of negotiations on the territorial dispute," it  was stated to NOTIMEX by Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gladys  Marithza Ruiz de Vielman.    Guatemala and Belize established diplomatic relations in  1981, although the two countries have yet to settle a  territorial dispute.    "We were invited by the council's chairman. We do not  consider this the place to discuss differences between Guatemala  and Belize," said Ursula Brown, Belize's ambassador to the  United Kingdom, shortly before her departure.    A participant in the meeting said Greece made "a mistake in  formalities" when it invited Belize as an observer without first  consulting with the Central American country.    The problem arose when the Belizean representative stood  close to the EU and Central American foreign ministers when  posing for a group picture of the meeting, which is currently  being held at an elegant hotel on the outskirts of the Greek  capital.    Belize, with a population of 200,000, achieved its  independence from the United Kingdom in 1986, and Guatemala has  demanded the return of part of their common border since then.    Although Belize had been invited to participate as an  observer in other international forums on Central America, this  was the first time it had been invited to participate in the San  Jose Summit.</p>

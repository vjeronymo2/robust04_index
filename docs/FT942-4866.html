			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / OECD Unemployment Report: Rejecting the unthinkable and the unacceptable - An earlier version of this year's OECD report linked long-term joblessness with the rise in crime and drugs abuse The OECD jobs study is like a Rorschach ink blot, in which different people see different things, says Mr Robert Reich, the US labour secretary. Mr Reich was responding to questions about whether the political tone of the document had changed since its earlier, January, draft. The US labour secretary believes it has not changed significantly but, from long experience of OECD reports, he knows that there is something in it for everyone. The OECD has always been a strongly pro-market organisation but it is broad enough to reflect a spectrum from relatively interventionist social market ideas to purer free market ones. This report has certainly been through various mutations. Last year, at the instigation of Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the OECD secretary-general, OECD economists were invited to 'think the unthinkable' about whether unemployment could be reduced by fiscal expansion, protectionism or even reducing the pace of technological change. Not surprisingly, such approaches were rejected. And the final drafts have emphasised the 'middle-way' - combining labour market flexibility with efficient welfare to work measures and improved training - which forms the new consensus running through the Detroit Jobs Summit earlier this year, Mr Jacques Delors' European Union white paper of last December, and even the recent Mais lecture by Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor. There have been a few minor changes in the past few months. The January draft explicitly linked long-term unemployment to rising levels of crime and drug abuse and also called for higher taxation on capital to off-set reductions in non-wage labour costs. Neither point has found its way into the final draft. On the other hand the scepticism towards levies on employers to generate a higher level of training has also disappeared and training levies are listed as one of the possible routes to a better trained workforce. There is certainly plenty for the UK government, towards the free market end of the spectrum, to welcome in both the January draft and the final version. The micro-economic stress on flexibility - with qualified hostility towards strong employment protection legislation and minimum wages, and a relatively draconian approach to unemployment benefit - fits with the government's de-regulatory approach. The UK's Family Credit benefit for the working poor is also explicitly praised and the passage on public employment services could have been written in the UK's department of employment. One other aspect of policy singled out by the OECD - low non-wage labour costs - is something which the Conservative government cannot claim credit for as Britain has always paid for welfare through general taxation rather than through pay-roll taxes. And UK government economists did have some worries particularly on the vagueness about who pays for the ambitious training plans and about the idea that employers should pay something toward the cost of lay-offs. Those closer to the social market end of the spectrum - including most trade union centres, left of centre political parties and the EU - welcome the stress on social consensus, lifetime training, and the critique of the social consequences of the US labour market model. Mr John Morley, head of the employment task force at the European Union, said: 'The OECD places a slightly different stress but the basic message is very similar to that of the Delors white paper. Both documents stress that there are disadvantages and advantages in all models, policy is about steering a path through these things.' But Mr Morley, in an implicit criticism of the UK government, adds: 'The real challenge is to avoid the burden of job creation being borne only by those in the weakest position in society.' He believes that the OECD report, with its stress on avoiding social exclusion, will help in that cause. The study certainly stresses that labour market dynamism must be combined with social objectives but they must be designed in ways that do not have job-killing side effects. The danger for the OECD in being all things to all men is that governments and lobby groups will simply pick out what they want in order to reinforce what they are already doing.</p>

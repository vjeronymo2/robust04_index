			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Quito, 3 Feb (EFE) -- According to an official  government bulletin, 10 policemen have been seriously injured  and 130 demonstrators have been arrested in Ecuador within the  past seven days as the result of disturbances in several cities  prompted by an increase in gasoline prices. The bulletin was  released today, with the country partially paralyzed by a  general 24-hour strike called by labor unions and other sectors  demanding that the government repeal the higher gasoline prices.    Several Quito radio stations have reported numerous clashes  betweeen demonstrators and police in Quito, Cuenca, Guayaquil,  and other cities during the morning. The police bulletin gave  no figures for injured or arrested demonstrators [as received],  but witnesses and the media are reporting that they run into the  hundreds.    Leaders of the United Workers Front [FUT], the country's  largest labor federation, said at noon that the strike is  "widespread." FUT President Edgar Ponce said in a news  conference that "the response has been very positive." He  declared that, if the government fails to repeal the gasoline  price hike, another strike, this time for an "indefinite time,"  will be called. [passage omitted]</p>

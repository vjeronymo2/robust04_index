A series of arrests  was made last night in Asti and Piedmont as part of the inquiry  undertaken by the Italian and Swiss police, revealed the  carabinieri during a press conference.    The police operation undertaken jointly by the Italian and  Swiss investigators and dubbed "San Jose"--the name of the  Colombian town from where the cocaine leaves--led to a series of  arrests in Italy (Piedmont and Lombardy) and Ticino. Over a  month ago, a native of Lugano and his companion were the first  to be arrested in Asti.    On 18 February, the Ticino police put the handcuffs on one  of  its own men, a 40-year-old corporal who worked at the Agno  airport. The man immediately admitted participating in the  international trafficking of some 150 kg of cocaine, an amount  that rose to 500 kg a few days later. On 24 February, it was  the turn of a Lugano bar owner to be arrested. Then, on 2  March, a 30-year-old Italian employed by the airline Crossair  was apprehended.    On Wednesday, a few hours before the last arrests that took  place Wednesday night in Asti, the Ticino police announced the  arrest of a 54-year-old Italian man in a Lugano hotel. The  police asked the press not to report the story until further  notice. The silence was broken Thursday by the Italian  investigators, who revealed the identity of the man arrested in  Lugano. He is from Milan and is considered the right-hand man  to the head of the organization, a 28-year-old Colombian.    With these latest arrests, operation "San Jose" has put 18  people behind bars in Italy and Ticino. Only five kilograms of  cocaine were seized. The trafficking operation, which has been  going on since 1991, involved some 2,000 kg of drugs with a  value of 4.5 million Swiss francs.    After being exported from Colombia, the cocaine was  transported by ship to Savona, near Genoa, or by airplane with  stopovers in Bogota, Santo Domingo, Madrid, Zurich, and Agno.  The drugs that arrived in the Lugano airport were taken over by  the crooked policeman and thus avoided customs checks.    While the prosecutor, Jacques Ducry, who is in charge of the  inquiry in Ticino, said Thursday that "for the time being there  is no link between the arrests in Ticino and those in Italy,"  the names of the Ticino inhabitants implicated were given to the  Italian police during the press conference in Asti.</p>

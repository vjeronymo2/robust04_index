			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY COUNCIL OKS BOND ISSUE FOR NEW 911  SYSTEM  </P> <P> A $235-million bond issue to pay for a new 911 emergency call system was  approved unanimously by the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday for placement  on the November ballot.  </P> <P> The Police Department is backing the measure as a way to finance replacement of  an emergency response system that officials say is outmoded and overburdened.  </P> <P> If the measure is approved by the voters, the emergency dispatch system located  in City Hall East will be replaced by two centers -- one in the San Fernando  Valley and the other at an undetermined location in the central city. Police  officials have said that two centers are necessary in case an earthquake or  other disaster knocks out one emergency center.  </P></p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / 'Signs of life' in housing THERE has been a widespread increase in confidence among potential house buyers and sellers since the general election, according to a survey of almost 100 English and Welsh estate agents, published today. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, which conducted the survey, said the number of people making inquiries about properties for sale has risen since polling day. 'The clearest signs of recovery are coming from East Anglia, where increased sales are reported, particularly in Norwich and Peterborough,' it said. 'The London housing market, worst hit by the property slump, also shows greater signs of life, with more people house hunting and a detectable rise in optimism. After several false starts, a recovery in the housing market is at last within sight.' The institution warned that it would take a long time before house sales returned to normal levels. The survey said 30 per cent of agents reported price falls in the three months to the end of April, compared with 68 per cent who said prices had remained static. Most agents expect prices to lag, even if sales increase this year.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Business and the Environment: Style without substance - Andrew Jack argues that without approved guidelines, companies' environmental disclosures invite criticism Fans of the Body Shop may have been impressed when the company produced a 'green book' earlier this year to accompany its annual report. But while the text gushed over the company's achievements in 47 pages, one independent eye was rather more circumspect. A statement at the end from Arthur D Little, brought in as independent consultants, or 'verifiers' of the information in the report, said it was 'impressed' by the company's 'leading role in promoting environmental excellence'. But it added that the Body Shop still needed to assess areas such as the impact of its manufacturing wastes and pollutant emissions, and to develop a formal audit programme. It stressed that it only examined one of the company's plants, that it did not conduct a comprehensive environmental audit, and that it did not validate figures quoted by Body Shop on issues such as raw material and energy consumption and waste. The report raises both good and bad points in the emergence of environmental auditing. While a handful of companies are beginning to take the publication of their green impact seriously, the results can be disappointing and limited. A survey earlier this month by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitoring service of company accounts, showed that 23 per cent mentioned environmental information in their most recent annual report, up from 10 per cent 14 months earlier. There has been a corresponding growth in independent consultancies to meet these new demands. Environmental Data Services, a green information organisation based in London, is about to issue its third annual directory of environmental consultants. Stewart Foxon, who has been co-ordinating the project, says he has heard estimates of more than 1,000 firms claiming to provide green advice. His new directory, which is rather more selective in choosing 'mainstream' firms, will list 350 consultancies employing more than 10,000 people and with an estimated turnover last year of Pounds 350m. The growth in environmental consulting in the last few years has been staggering. The first edition of the directory in 1990 listed 125 firms. Last year's contained 225 with a turnover of Pounds 200m. The new version will show that one third of the firms expect their turnover to double within the next five years. It will show that roughly 18,000 contracts were awarded to the consultancies in the last year. Most of the work related to contaminated land and water pollution. Environmental auditing alone represents a growing field, up from 5 per cent last year to 8 per cent. As more companies lay claim to the green mantle in their annual reports and publicity material, a growing number of consultancies are emerging which offer data to fill the space. Quality can leave much to be desired. The pressure to gather environmental information reflects rapidly growing public and political concern over the subject. This has given rise to a series of national and international legal requirements. Among the most significant are the EC guidelines on environmental impact assessment, first published in 1988, and the forthcoming packaging directives. The voluntary Eco-audit requirements - which will require independent scrutiny of environmental impact of a company's activities - are due to be in place by 1994. Similar guidelines are being developed through British Standard 7750. All are beginning to have an effect on the level of corporate green activity. Directors in some companies - notably the chemical sector - grit their teeth at the sudden obsession with things green, however. Many have been conducting environmental audits for several years. The Chemical Industries Association has a well-established set of guidelines, for example. The reason is often grounded in sound business management. Geoff Mills, a director of the Association of Environmental Consultancies, and head of consultants Gibb Environmental, argues that companies want both to recognise emerging problems - to stave off litigation or public criticism - and to identify areas in which they can take action to save costs. 'Environmental reviews are becoming an integral part of good management,' he says. 'The environment is becoming just another part of a business manager's legitimate day-to-day concerns.' But there remains a fundamental problem over definitions, according to Martin Houldin, principal consultant at KPMG Peat Marwick's national environment unit. He says activities described as 'environmental audits' can range from internal environmental reviews or partial examinations by consultants, through to full independent verification of a company's activities. The latter, he says, is rare. This is in large part explained by the focus of legislation. Most is focused on site-specific analysis: the impact of a particular plant or the changes brought to a unit of land as a result of development. There is little guidance for analysing the entirety of a company's operations. The information which gets into the public domain is far more limited and less reliable still. The Company Reporting survey showed that only 11 per cent of businesses disclosed concrete information such as environmental policies or achievements. 'The remaining 12 per cent publish statements which are general to the point of being virtually meaningless,' it concluded. That echoed the conclusions of a survey of environmental reporting published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales at the start of this year. 'Many appear to be using environmental disclosures in the annual report primarily as a channel for public relations,' it said. It warned that the information was often partial - stressing 'good' and not 'bad' news - and that sometimes information from other sources even contradicted that provided by the company. Companies may be undertaking a wide range of activities behind closed doors. But little is made public, and a smaller proportion is a balanced or comprehensive attempt to describe the impact of a business' operations. A tinier proportion still uses an independent firm to scrutinise this information and state whether it reflects the true picture. No systematic guidelines exist on how to undertake such reviews, or a consistent use of words which might be included in annual reports. 'Conflicts can arise, especially over the commercial pressures when audit findings are not what the clients expected. There is a need for professional standards,' says Mills. That is why his association is introducing a system of accreditation and peer review. At the same time, the Institute of Environmental Assessment, which represents individual environmental consultants, is drawing up a registration scheme for its members. Without compulsory disclosure of environmental information, companies are likely to receive growing criticism from outside observers. Without independent, objective scrutiny from environmental auditors, the little information which is provided will remain suspect.</p>

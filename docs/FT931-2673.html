			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Polly Peck administrators fail in court move A 17-MONTH attempt by Touche Ross, the administrators of Polly Peck International, to sue the Central Bank of Turkish Cyprus for Pounds 45m was rejected yesterday by the Court of Appeal. The claim was part of the attempt by the administrators to recover between Pounds 400m and Pounds 500m which was allegedly misappropriated from the collapsed fruit and electronics group. Touche Ross had claimed that the bank had knowingly assisted Mr Asil Nadir, the former chairman of Polly Peck, in committing an alleged fraud or had received the Pounds 45m knowing that it was being paid in breach of Mr Nadir's fiduciary duty to Polly Peck. Mr Nadir was alleged to have used the bank as a conduit through which Polly Peck's money was diverted to 'friendly' hands in Northern Cyprus and elsewhere. Touche Ross had been given permission by the High Court to issue a writ against the bank in Northern Cyprus, outside the jurisdiction of the UK courts. Three Appeal Court judges ruled yesterday by a 2-1 majority that the case against the bank was not strong enough to justify allowing the writ to be served in a foreign country. Touche Ross said afterwards that it would be seeking leave to appeal against the decision by the judges in the House of Lords. Last year the Court of Appeal refused Touche Ross a Mareva injunction to freeze Pounds 29m of assets held by the bank.</p>

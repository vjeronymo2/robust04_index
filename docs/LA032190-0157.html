BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GREYHOUND BUS FIRED ON IN VA.  </P> <P> A Greyhound bus carrying 50 people on Interstate 81 in Virginia was hit by  three shots fired from a passing car, but no one was injured, state police said  today.  </P> <P> The shooting was the 14th incident of violence in the often heated strike since  about 9,000 Greyhound workers walked out on strike March 2.  </P> <P> Negotiators for Greyhound and its striking drivers have been talking to federal  mediators but not to each other and remained far apart in efforts to cement a  contract that could bring the employees back to work.  </P> <P> Virginia State Trooper E. R. Adams, who was investigating the Interstate 81  incident that occurred between Roanoke and Christiansburg, said three small  holes were found in the windshield of the bus, possibly from a small-caliber  rifle.  </P></p>

Before a plenary packed with diplomats from almost 100  countries who are participating in the UN Human Rights  Commission's annual meeting, U.S. representative Vivian Derryck  startled Brazilian diplomats by saying that "in Brazil, street  children search through litter to find food and sometimes are  hunted for sport." [passage omitted]    Caught by surprise by the criticism leveled by the U.S.  delegation, the Brazilian delegation immediately delivered a  lukewarm speech prepared the day before. In its speech, the  Brazilian delegation again asked the international community for  enhanced efforts to offer technical cooperation and other  methods of assistance to those countries requiring assistance.  Two pages of the Brazilian delegation's speech were dedicated  to the Brazilian Government's successes, ranging from the  eradication of poliomielitis "in three years" to the campaign  against hunger devised by sociologist Herbert de Souza, alias  Betinho.    Brazil's official response to the hard overtones of the  criticism leveled by the U.S. delegation during the UN Human  Rights Commission's annual meeting came at the end of the  meeting through a passionate protest speech delivered by  Brazilian Ambassador Gilberto Saboia. Following is the  ambassador's speech:    "Exercising its right to a response, the Brazilian  delegation  wants to express its surprise over and disagreement with the  remarks on Brazil made by the U.S. delegation.    "To mention Brazil as a country that deliberately neglects  children not only represents a false argument vis-a-vis the  facts, but also contradicts the opinion voiced by UNICEF and  other international authorities in this field. The Brazilian  delegation is ready to furnish the U.S. delegation a copy of a  report the Brazilian delegation distributed among  nongovernmental organizations and UN Human Rights Commission  countries, describing in detail the actions and programs  implemented in Brazil in favor of children.    "The allegation that children in Brazil are "hunted for  sport" is totally unacceptable and demonstrates the U.S.  delegation's lack of objectivity and lack of information on our  country's reality. In addition, as demonstrated by the 1994  UNICEF report, we note that the United States does not have the  required authority in this field to use this peremptory and  disqualifying language with regard to other countries.    "As UNICEF Executive Director James Grant said recently, 20  children are shot to death in the United States of America every  day and the situation of children from minorities such as  Afro-Americans and Hispanics is comparable to the situation of  some underdeveloped countries."</p>

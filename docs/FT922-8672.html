			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: BIS in detailed analysis of futures trading THE MOST detailed analysis yet of the escalation of worldwide trading in derivatives is published today by the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. It's conclusion: that the 'pyramiding of transactions in derivatives', with different markets feeding off each other in an upward spiral of trading volume, has created a complex network of linkages between derivative and cash markets around the world. The BIS study, contained in its latest quarterly report on international financing, reveals: While open interest in exchange-traded instruments has jumped by 500 per cent in the past five years, the value of outstanding currency and interest rates swaps has expanded eightfold. Activity in Europe has soared as trading in the US has levelled off. Last year, 200m derivatives were traded on US exchanges, hardly different from the 198m of two years before. By contrast, European exchanges traded 84m contracts, up from 49m in 1989. Arbitrage activity between markets has brought pricing of different instruments closer, at the same time prompting an explosion of trading volume. 'Swaps, for instance, have linked the bond markets in different currencies more closely together,' said the BIS. Banks have become the most significant participants in some markets, particular those in short-term interest rates, the BIS says. This reflects the development of derivatives, especially swaps, which in the mid-1980s were dependent on arbitrage-related trading. 'Over time interest rate swaps have become a more general instrument of risk management, especially for financial institutions, and to some extent have replaced more traditional interbank activity.' In the first half of 1991, 44 per cent of the new interest rate swaps completed were between banks, up from 30 per cent at the end of 1987. At the same time, banks now account for around two-thirds of trading in some short-term interest rate contracts in the US. International Banking and Financial Market Developments, May 1992, BIS.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 21 Jun (AE) -- The Army Ministry has  ordered an investigation to find out who is responsible for the  detonation of a home-made bomb last week in the Army  headquarters in Brasilia. The bomb did not cause any damage but  it made a lot of noise. A message found at the site of the  explosion states: "War is not necessary, eating is,"  paraphrasing Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa. The message is  interpreted as a warning over low military salaries.    Army spokesman General Gilberto Serra denied the existence  of  the message and minimized the effects of the explosion at the  Army headquarters, which is known in Brasilia as "Fort Apache."  He said the initial investigations show it will be difficult to  discover who is responsible for the explosion, which took place  on the third floor of the Training and Research Department  (DEP). The official report states that the explosion was caused  more by a firecracker than a real bomb. The main report was  drafted by a DEP colonel.    The explosion was an "isolated incident that has nothing to  do with salary demands." He said military personnel know of  their chiefs' efforts to achieve a salary increase and know  President Itamar has promised to improve their situation. "We  must wait a little because everything depends on arrangements in  the economic field," he said.    Federal Administration Secretary Romildo Canhim today  confirmed that a salary increase for civilian and military  employees will be discussed and defined after the implementation  of the new currency, the real. "It has already been decided,  and a salary increase will not be discussed now," he said. Once  the real is in circulation in July the government will resume  discussions to implement the Equal Salary Law which foresees a  28 percent real increase for public servants, the minister said.  The increase will come in August.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Tokyu Store gross profits fall 18% to Y10.8bn TOKYU Department Store yesterday reported that group pre-tax profit fell 18 per cent to Y10.8bn (Dollars 80m) in the fiscal year ended January 31, AP-DJ reports. Sales were up 8.2 per cent at Y558.3bn from Y515.85bn last time. Reflecting a general trend among Japanese department stores, Tokyu's pre-tax profit suffered because management and marketing costs rose faster than sales while sales of luxury goods were damped by the slowdown in Japan's economy. The group suffered a net loss for the past fiscal year of Y806m, against a profit of Y5.07bn the year before. This was mainly because of a special loss suffered through Daiwa Securities Company's 'Tobashi' trading of Tokyu stock. Through Tobashi trading a securities company arranges repurchase agreements, selling and buying shares for customers at artificial prices to allow clients to avoid posting losses on their investments in their earnings reports. Tokyu claimed Y60.5bn in damages from Daiwa, but the broker agreed to compensate only 80 per cent of that amount. That left Tokyu with a loss of roughly Y11bn. For the current fiscal year, Tokyu expected group pre-tax profit to climb 4.6 per cent to Y11.3bn, with sales rising 2.1 per cent to Y570bn. The company said it projected last fiscal year's net loss to swing to a net profit of Y4.4bn.</p>

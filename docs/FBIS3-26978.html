			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 16 (XINHUA) -- The speaker of  the Bosnian Serb parliament, Momcilo Krajisnik, said Wednesday  [16 February] that the Serbian side will fully carry out the  ceasefire agreement with the Muslims by submitting all their  heavy weapons to UN control.    Speaking at the "Poeitika" television station, Krajisnik  said, "We are committed to fully respect the Muslim-Serb  agreement and its provisions calling for the control of heavy  weaponry and demarcation lines."    "This concerns the basic interests of the Serbian people,  and  we cannot in any way raise any problem to the agreement," he  said.    He warned that the danger of Serbian people being bombed  "has  never been greater than now." "We are very serious about the  threat. We must be fully prepared for air strikes," he said.    He expressed the hope that by submitting the heavy weapons,  "The will of the forces calling for the bombing of Serbian  positions will be partially satisfied."    Meanwhile, former commander of the United Nations Protection  Force (Unprofor) General Jean Cote said the Serbian side has  promised to withdraw their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo  before the NATO deadline of midnight GMT Sunday, or put them  under UN control.    He said the Muslim side has promised to do the same.    United Nations commander Lieutenant General Michael Rose  today warned that if the warring sides do not submit their  weaponry before the NATO deadline, the Western alliance will  definitely use force.    NATO also said today that it will not wait one minute more  in  executing the air strike plan after the deadline is reached.    Bosnian Serb Defense Minister Dushan Kovachevich said today  that if NATO really carries out air strikes on Serbian  positions, the Serbians will defend themselves by all means  necessary.    He expressed the hope that a "wise party" will be heeded  within NATO.    Reports said convoys of artillery could be seen moving along  the highways outside Sarajevo toward destinations selected by  the UN command.    Spokesman Bill Eikman said today that the UN is deploying  forces in preparation for air strikes, and that 3,000 more UN  troops are expected to arrive in Sarajevo soon.    However, Spain and France have reportedly refused to  increase  the number of their troops, and Russia has refused to allow its  UN soldiers to move close to Sarajevo.</p>

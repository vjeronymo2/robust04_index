			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / People: Mason moves to Balfour Beatty Peter Mason has been appointed to replace David Cawthra as chief executive of Balfour Beatty, the construction arm of BICC engineering group. Cawthra stunned the construction industry last September when he stood down from Balfour, one of the country's biggest contractors, to become chief executive of Miller Group, a privately owned construction company based in Edinburgh. Mason was formerly executive chairman of Norwest Holst, the British construction group in which Compagnie Generale des Eaux acquired a 51 per cent stake in January 1989. Norwest last year generated a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.6m on a turnover of Pounds 338.52m. Balfour Beatty by comparison made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 37.7m on a turnover of Pounds 1.9bn. Mason, now 45, graduated from Glasgow University in 1968 with a degree in civil engineering to join Sir Robert McAlpine construction group. Between 1970 and 1976 he was a contracts manager with Faircloughs (now part of Amec) before becoming construction director of Shanks &amp; McEwan. He joined Norwest Holst in 1980 and became chief executive in 1985 shortly before the company was acquired in a management buy-out. He became executive chairman in 1991 following the takeover by CGE.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, May 6 (XINHUA) -- The Wuhan Iron and Steel  Company, one of China's leading producers of steel, has been  making active efforts to improve its efficiency since late 1992.    The company, which was founded in the 1950s, now has key  production plants such as a blast furnace, a steel plant and a  rolling mill, and auxiliary plants for making machinery, and  providing electricity and water. It also has a construction  team, as well as a hospital, schools and a food-processing  factory.    The production efficiency of the company has long been  hindered to some degree by this complicated network of  installations, and the per capita output of steel of the workers  in the company is around 40 tons a year, equal to only one fifth  of that of the Baoshan Iron and Steel Company based in Shanghai.    Beginning in August 1992, the company has attached great  importance to the improvement of its efficiency and worked out  concrete measures to achieve this goal.    The measures include reducing surplus labor from the  production line and diverting it to other work, and separating  steel production from other departments.    Now, the company's team engaged in the production of iron  and  steel has been reduced from the former 120,000 to the present  50,000.    The endeavor has begun to pay off. Last year, the company  produced 5.234 million tons of steel, an increase of 5.35  percent compared with the previous year, and the per capita  production of steel of the company rose to 100 tons. It also  produced 5.4 million tons of pig iron last year, up 6.6 percent  compared with the corresponding figure for 1992, according to  company officials.    In the first four months of this year the company turned out  1.7 million tons of steel and 1.8 million tons of pig iron, both  showing sharp increases compared with the related figures for  the same period of last year.</p>

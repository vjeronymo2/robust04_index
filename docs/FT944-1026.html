			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Hickson profit shortfall after Unilever decision Hickson International, the specialty chemical company, said yesterday it would suffer a profit shortfall following the decision of Unilever to halt purchases of the controversial manganese catalyst in Persil Power and other Unilever detergents. Its shares fell 12p to 114p. Despite the setback, the group was still on track to meet market forecasts of pre-tax profits for 1994 of between Pounds 21m and Pounds 23m, against Pounds 22.1m a year earlier. Hickson said it had already won orders from two pharmaceutical companies to help use the capacity of the plant in Ireland affected by Unilever's decision. Unilever cut the content of the catalyst in the fabric detergents by 80 per cent this summer. It reformulated the products after discovering that the new detergents were reacting adversely to a small selection of deep dyes in cotton and viscose fabrics. The problem, which gave rise to the soap war between Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble, its rival, has been solved by reducing the catalyst, Unilever said. As a result of the reduced catalyst, Unilever has sufficient stocks to last until the end of next year, Hickson said. Unilever, which is on a take-or-pay contract lasting to the middle of next year, is negotiating a settlement with Hickson. In a full year the catalyst, which had accounted for half the plant's production, would have contributed some Pounds 8m of operating profit to Hickson but because of the settlement the shortfall would be less, Hickson said. Hickson said Unilever was aware that the plant would be fully committed to other products when it wanted to resume production of the catalyst. Hickson, therefore, might not wish to produce for Unilever.</p>

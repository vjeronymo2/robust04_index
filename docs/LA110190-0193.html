			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> SCHOOL SECURITY GUARD HELD ON KIDNAPING, RAPE CHARGES  </P> <P> A school security officer who was arrested and charged with kidnaping a woman  and gang raping her pleaded not guilty and was suspended from his job with the  Long Beach Unified School District.  </P> <P> Victor Lopez Jr., 27, was arrested along with three other men identified as  gang members by sheriff's deputies early Friday morning. Deputies said they  found Lopez holding a semiautomatic pistol to a woman's head in the back seat  of a car, while another man sat in the front seat and two more waited outside.  </P> <P> The San Francisco woman, who was in town visiting relatives, told authorities  that she was abducted near the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard  and Pacific Coast Highway in Long Beach while she was on her way to buy formula  for her baby. Deputies assigned to patrol the Metro Rail Blue Line spotted the  car, its license plate covered with tape and plastic bags, in the 1300 block of  Lime Avenue.  </P> <P> Lopez and the other suspects, Oniva David Tautolo, Owen Fuimaono Jr. and Lau  Talo Jr., remained in jail Wednesday. Bail for each was raised to $150,000  during arraignment Tuesday in Compton Municipal Court, Sheriff's Deputy Rich  Erickson said.  </P> <P> Trial for the four suspects has been set for Nov. 13. They are charged with  rape, kidnaping and oral copulation. In addition, Tautolo and Talo are charged  with sodomy.  </P> <P> The arrest has shocked Lopez's co-workers in the school district, where he has  been a security guard for 2 1/2 years. "I just couldn't believe it," said Joe  Romero, the district's chief of security.  </P> <P> Before Lopez joined the school district, officials did a background check and  found that he had no prior criminal record, Romero said. Lopez, who is single  and lives with his mother in Burbank, had worked for another police agency  before joining the district, according to Romero.  </P></p>

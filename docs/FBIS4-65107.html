			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on Interior Minister Charles Pasqua remarks made to </F> the National Assembly in Paris on 11 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] In Paris today, Interior Minister  Charles Pasqua announced that he will be taking supplementary  measures to avert terrorist activities by foreigners in France.  He declined to give any further details. He was in fact  answering a question from a deputy on the situation in Algeria,  and on the arrest last Friday [6 May] of an Algerian in  possession of weapons in France. In fact, in Pasqua's view, the  best way of avoiding this export of terrorism is to support the  Algerian Government in its effort to put an end to the crisis:    [Pasqua] Algeria is an independent, sovereign state, faced  with terrorist action in which, unfortunately, about a dozen of  our nationals have been victims. The Algerian Government should  provide itself with the means to restrict these terrorist  actions and to fight them. It is applying itself to this  matter. It is not for us to intervene in Algeria's internal  affairs. Our country's interest, the interest of France, and,  in general terms, of Europe -- which cannot fail to take an  interest in what is happening on the other side of the  Mediterranean -- is to see a democratic solution found to the  situation in Algeria, and to see peace prevail throughout this  territory once more. This is the reason why the French  Government wishes to encourage the efforts of the Algerian  Government along the path of a peaceful search for this solution.</p>

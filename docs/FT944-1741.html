			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / This Week: Sport CRICKET: Australia v England, 2nd Test, December 24-29, Melbourne. A double century for Mike Gatting at the weekend, but it still looks a case of Shane Warne facing 11 turkeys over Christmas. HORSE RACING: King George V1 Tripleprint Chase, December 26, Kempton Park. The big race at Kempton on Boxing Day is expected to be a three-cornered contest between Bradbury Star, Barton Bank and The Fellow. A year ago, in the same event, Barton Bank beat Bradbury Star by a neck. But trainer Josh Gifford is confident his double Mackeson Gold Cup winner will reverse the result this time.</p>

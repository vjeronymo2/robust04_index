			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev arrived in  Murmansk today. Our correspondent Yuriy Arkhipov reports by  telephone:    [Arkhipov] Andrey Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister and  Murmansk Oblast's deputy to the State Duma, was met at Murmansk  airport by the head of the oblast administration, the commander  of the Northern Fleet, and by representatives from the Russian  Foreign Ministry in Murmansk. On this occasion, the aim of the  minister's visit is to take part in Victory Day celebrations.    In an interview with journalists at the aircraft steps, he  congratulated all the defenders of the Polar region on the  holiday, and underlined that as our people managed to withstand  the horrors of the 1941-45 war, there is no doubt it will be  able to overcome today's difficulties.    Andrey Kozyrev went straight from the airport to  Severomorsk,  where he had a meeting with the officers of the aircraft carrier  Admiral Nakhimov. An agreement to establish patronage ties  between the oblast administration and the command of the  aircraft carrier was signed on board the vessel. Andrey Kozyrev  took part in the signing ceremony of this agreement.    Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev also had a  conversation with Yevgeniy Komarov, head of the administration  of Murmansk Oblast. The social and economic development of  Murmansk Oblast based on the resources of the region was  discussed during the meeting.    On 9 May the Russian foreign minister will take part in a  procession of the inhabitants and guests of the city to the  monument commemorating the defenders of the Polar zone -- or as  the northerners call the monument, Alesha -- and lay flowers at  the monument. In the second half of the day, Andrey Kozyrev  will fly back to Moscow.</p>

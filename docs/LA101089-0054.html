			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: HE'S CAPABLE OF SAYING ALMOST ANYTHING ONCE HE GETS COOKIN'  </P> <P> College football commentator Beano Cook, quoted by Sandra McKee of the  Baltimore Evening Sun on Air Force quarterback Dee Dowis' chances to win the  Heisman Trophy:  </P> <P> "If Dowis can get 100 yards on Notre Dame Saturday, it will be a big boost for  him. To this point, he's gotten a lot of yards against some lesser opponents.  </P> <P> "Against Notre Dame, he'll be playing behind a line that couldn't play for  Notre Dame. Heck, there are probably only five guys on the whole Air Force team  that could get a tryout with Notre Dame."  </P> <P> Who will win the Heisman? "You just can't tell," Cook said. "I still think the  majority of people who vote for this award are like the people in Congress --  not very bright. So who knows?"  </P> <P> Who's on first?: From Tim Kurkjian of the Baltimore Sun:  </P> <P> "Texas Ranger first baseman Rafael Palmeiro was asked to fill out a ballot for  best defensive players in the league. When he got to the word assist, he asked,  'How you do get an assist?' Palmeiro once asked, 'How many teams are there in  the American League?' "  </P> <P> Add Kurkjian: "The Toronto Blue Jays' Mike Flanagan has a new nickname for  (Detroit) Tiger reliever Mike Schwabe: Chemo. Get it? Chemo Schwabe."  </P> <P> All in good taste: Vida Blue, former pitcher for the Oakland Athletics and San  Francisco Giants, got married during the last weekend of the regular season on  the field at Candlestick Park. The ceremony included an honor guard of Giants  with raised bats and a carriage ride for the newlyweds around the outfield.  When a TV crew approached the groom and asked for an interview, Blue declined  because he "didn't want to turn his wedding into a circus."  </P> <P> Not ready for any time: Speaking of bad taste, how lame was the "Saturday Night  Live" sketch on the late Bart Giamatti? It began with an ersatz Commissioner  Fay Vincent, who was a friend of Giamatti, telling baseball's owners that he  would like all players to wear armbands bearing Giamatti's initials during the  1990 season. It went straight downhill from there, with the Vincent character  demanding that baseball terms, stadiums, and, finally, players and owners be  renamed for Giamatti. The audience didn't think it was funny, either.  </P> <P> Trivia time: On Oct. 10, 1981, USC's Marcus Allen rushed for 211 yards, his  fifth straight 200-plus game, against Arizona. Who won the game?  </P> <P> Thrill is gone: From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun:  </P> <P>  -- "I don't want to say a Vin Scully broadcast is stereotyped, but I can't  tell if the NBC headliner is live or Memorex anymore."  </P> <P>  -- "If George Steinbrenner letting soon-to-be free-agent pitcher Mark Langston  know that he's in tight with movie producers isn't tampering, what is? See,  Langston's wife is an aspiring actress."  </P> <P>  -- "Now that Yogi Berra has retired from baseball, he'll assume his real  position in life, that of movie critic. His agent is listening to offers as  Siskel &amp; Ebert cringe. Yogi says his favorite funny line was, 'Nobody goes  to that restaurant anymore; it's too crowded.' The man belongs on the tube,  definitely."  </P> <P> The Fitchburg State watch: The Falcons had the week off.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Arizona, 13-10.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Artist Robert Longo, who has an exhibition at the Los Angeles County  Museum of Art, explained on KCRW public radio why his work is a reflection of  violence in America: "I grew up watching TV, watching movies . . . and I played  football."

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Erich Inciyan: Five Priority Missions for the </F> Police]    [Excerpt] Charles Pasqua's "law of orientation and  programming regarding security" provides for a programming  effort comparable to the Joxe plan for investments (materiel,  equipment, furnishings), while assuring recruitment of  administrative personnel and a package of more important  categories of measures.    The government is assigning five "priority missions" to the  police for the next five years: safety of persons and goods,  control of immigration and the fight against clandestine labor,  the fight against major criminality and drugs, protection  against "external threats and terrorism," and the maintenance of  public order. The message Charles Pasqua addressed to "his"  police is clear: in these five priority sectors the police must  obtain results at the level of effort agreed upon by the  governmental security policy in a period of budgetary  restriction.    The draft law, containing twenty-six articles, is  accompanied  by two appendices which define the government's security policy  and the programming of means for the national police for the  years 1995-1999.     -  Police, gendarmerie, customs officers:  With authority over the entire country, the police and the  gendarmerie have the "obligation" to cooperate with regard to  equipment, technical and scientific police, the creation and use  of files, and exchanges of information. The draft law also  establishes their "obligation to share their allocations with  each other and to rationalize geographic installations." The  customs office sees its role recognized in combatting  trafficking, especially of drugs, and fighting clandestine  immigration and labor, without the customs officers becoming  officers of the judicial police (OJP). Finally, a "reserve  situation" is envisioned for those who have completed their  national service in the police force; they will be recruited by  the creation of a specific competitive entry examination.    -  Powers  of police chiefs: In order better to coordinate the activities  of decentralized services and forces dependent upon the state,  the representatives of the state receive general authority for  activities in crime prevention. In Paris, the chief of police  coordinates the activities of the Ile-de-France police chiefs to  "prevent or confront events which disrupt public order when they  involve Paris and other departments of the region."    -  Municipal  police and security agencies: The draft law recognizes the  contribution provided by mayors to "the mission of public  safety." The missions of the municipal police are limited "to  activities which derive from the authority of the mayor." A  draft law specific to the municipal police will be submitted  "this summer." Another draft law will define the legal status  and missions of guard agencies, money transporters, and  investigative agencies.    -  Demonstration police: In order to  protect the officials tasked with the maintenance of order, it  is proposed to "prohibit the carrying and transport of material  which could endanger the safety of persons and goods during  demonstrations," as well as to permit "vehicle searches and the  seizure of these materials." Also envisioned is "a supplementary  punishment of prohibiting the participation in a demonstration  at the same location to persons who have already been found  guilty of violence during previous demonstrations."    -  Video  surveillance and security measures: A legal framework will be  established for the use of surveillance cameras on public  streets and in places open to the public (stores, railroad  stations). The general principle according to which the  "security aspects" must be taken into account in laws and  regulations "whatever the subject" is stated: large  administration and construction programs (stadiums, housing  projects) must include the security dimension.    -  Special status  for police officers: In addition to the creation of three  police corps, the minister declared that police officials will  be granted "special status." The OJP status is granted to  officers and commanders of the national police, which is in  accord with the fusion of "uniformed" and "plainclothes"  officers.    -  Ten billion francs over five years: Seven billion  francs are allocated for police equipment and materiel (an  increase of 71 percent over 1990-1994). Pasqua claims that this  will permit a doubling of the effort devoted to transmissions  and to computers, to furnishings and housing, while increasing  the credits for weapons, clothing, and means of protection by 30  percent. In addition, between now and 1999, 5,000 positions for  police administrative and technical agents will be created (1.9  billion francs). Measures for personnel (1.15 billion francs  over five years) focus in particular on the establishment of a  premium granted to "approximately 30,000 to 35,000 officials  posted in difficult zones" in Paris and areas coming under city  contract.

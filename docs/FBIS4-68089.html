			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] Police authorities in the Autonomous Region in  Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) have recommended to higher police  headquarters the launching of an all out offensive against the  extremists Abu Sayyaf group, Mindanao's most dreaded terrorist  band. The recommendation was issued by ARMM Police regional  director chief Supt. Magingin Magomnang after receiving reports  Wednesday from Sulu Police provincial director Supt. Aukasa  Handa.    Magomnang called a command conference Wednesday at Camp S.K.  Pendatun in Parang, Maguindanao. It was his first meeting with  his subordinates this year. Both Magomnang and Handa said that  the number of the fundamentalist group is increasing and a  massive police action should be taken against them before they  can harm people with their terroristic activities. ``I am  considering Abu Sayyaf group as a threat,'' Handa told  reporters. ``I am recommending to higher headquarters that  police action should be taken against this group.'' The Abu  Sayyaf, a fundamentalist group that originated in Basilan  province, is composed of 80 to 100 fully armed members.    Denying the group had just received arms shipment from  nearby  countries, Handa said the Abu Sayyaf, led by Abdulradjak  Janjalani, is armed with several 90 recoilless rifles, B-57,  mortars, M-60 and M-50 machineguns and assorted high powered  firearms. The group was tagged by military and police  authorities as responsible in several criminal activities such  as kidnapping and bombings in Mindanao. It was also believed to  be responsible in the Davao Cathedral bombing last December 26  which killed six church-goers and wounded 150 others.    Authorities also identified the extremist group as  responsible in the kidnapping of language researcher Charles  Walton, shipyard owner Ricardo Tong of Zamboanga City,  missionary priest Bernardo Blanco, Spanish nuns in Sulu and  several businessmen in the Zamboanga archipelago.    ``The Abu Sayyaf is really a threat in the area,  particularly  in Sulu, but we have some precautionary measures that can take  care of this group,'' Magomnang said in a press conference. He  said he will tak to PNP chief Dir. General Umberto Rodriguez and  Chief of Staff Gen Lisandro Abadia for a joint police and  military action against Abu Sayyaf. Magomnang also reported that  he already had a talk with several Moro National Liberation  Front (MNLF) commanders in Sulu to cooperate with the police in  pursuing the fundamentalist group.    Handa stressed that the Abu Sayyaf is not yet capable of  destabilizing Mindanao. Abadia, during his Mindanao visit last  month, said Abu Sayyaf cannot destabilize the region but  admitted that they can create trouble and terrorize people.  [passage omitted]    Admitting terrorism is difficult to address, Abadia vowed to  neutralize the group in due time. Magomnang said the police has  already identified the base of Abu Sayyaf in Sulu and will  strike anytime when the ``go signal'' is issued. Aside from  Basilan, Handa said the Abu Sayyaf is concentrated in Patikul,  Sulu.</p>

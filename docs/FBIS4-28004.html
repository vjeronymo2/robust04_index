			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary: "Opinion of Various Circles in Phnom Penh </F> Voices Opposition to the Resumption of U.S. Interference in and  Provocation of Cambodia's war"]    [Text] Circles both in Phnom Penh and the provinces have  all been aware that the United States, on behalf of the alliance  of Western powers, is canvassing military aid for the two-headed  government to enable it to continue igniting the flames of war  in Cambodia. Opinion of various circles in Phnom Penh is  wondering whether in doing so the United States is pouring water  to extinguish the flames of war, or is it adding fuel to them?    In so doing, the United States is certainly joining the  communist Vietnamese in their aggression against Cambodia. The  United States should know that giving money and supplying arms  and materiel to the two-headed government can only benefit the  communist Vietnamese. If the United States gives the two-headed  government political and diplomatic assistance, the only one who  will benefit from that will be none other than the communist  Vietnamese. If the United States helps the two-headed  government politically and diplomatically, only the communist  Vietnamese will gain in their attempt to swallow Cambodia. That  could be seen as a serious act of murder against Cambodia  because the Western alliance would be helping the communist  Vietnamese to annex Cambodia.    The United States should realize that this alliance, which  is  helping the communist Vietnamese to annex Cambodia, is running  counter to the general trend. On the one hand, it could create  more acute, insoluble differences with the Cambodian nation and  people. It is incapable of doing away with the Cambodian nation  and people because the United States would be creating conflict  on top of conflict, thus driving the Cambodian nation and people  to rise up simultaneously and fight back. At the same time, it  could create differences with neighboring countries. If  Cambodia became part of Vietnam, it would automatically be part  of the Indochinese federation of the communist Vietnamese. As  such, how dangerous a threat would that be to the ASEAN borders?    You do not have to look far. Just a few days after it had  come to power, the two-headed government began to insolently  lambaste other countries, verbally attacking its own neighbors.  ASEAN in general wants to see Cambodia achieve reconciliation  and peace and is opposed to any move that would give military  aid for continuing to ignite the war because ASEAN realizes that  should Vietnam succceed in swallowing up Cambodia, ASEAN would  share its border directly with the communist Vietnamese, and  there would be all kinds of problems to ASEAN's security. As  far as United States is concerned, what could it gain from such  a situation?    As for the differences within the nation and people, they  are  permanent. These include differences arising from the problems  of land owenership, taxation, robberies, assassinations, and all  kinds of power abuses, such as forcible recruitment and so on.  These are utmost and permanently painful differences. No  matter how much money the United States and the alliance is  willing to give the two-headed government -- be it $100 million  a month or $1,200 million a year or $2,400 million every two  years -- these differences would never be solved. No wizard  could ever solve them. Do not look at them as being differences  with the 10,000-20,000 or 100,000 Khmer Rouge. Instead, look at  them as differences between war and peace, as political,  economic, and social differences created and continually  inflamed by the communist Vietnamese, the alliance, and their  puppets.    How can these differences be resolved? If one tries to solve  them through war, one only multiplies them. If one tries to  resolve them through national reconciliation, these differences  might gradually dissipate, thus inviting peace and happiness  back to the country and the national community.    The United States should not look at the Khmer Rouge as just  a bunch of induviduals. It should look at them as the  offspring, the flesh and blood of the entire Cambodian nation  and people and especially of the nearly 7 million peasants.  Attacking the Khmer Rouge is tantamount to attacking the entire  peasantry, the entire Cambodian nation and people. The United  States should reconsider whether it is better for Cambodia, the  countries in the region, and the United States itself if it  chooses the means of using water to extinguish the flames of  war. This is a question that requires very close consideration.  There should not be an error of judgment as the ones made when  the United States decided to start the Vietnam war in 1960 and  stage the coup d'etat in Cambodia in 1970 and when the communist  Vietnamese decided to invade Cambodia in 1978-79.</p>

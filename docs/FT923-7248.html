			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Cowie must clarify Henlys offer THE Takeover Panel has told T Cowie, the motor dealer bidding for rival Henlys Group, to clarify five points in its final offer document issued last week. The latest request follows other clarifications and withdrawals of remarks made during the bid which the panel has required. The first of the five points concerned a bar chart comparing the two groups' net assets. Cowie's offer document showed the chart (above right) with the vertical scale starting at Pounds 40m. The panel asked that it be redrawn (below right) with the scale commencing at zero 'to ensure there is no misleading impression'. The panel said the many clarifications  - and the recent knuckle-rap of Dowty advisers in the TI/Dowty bid  - did not reflect any new get-tough policy. Full story, page 18</p>

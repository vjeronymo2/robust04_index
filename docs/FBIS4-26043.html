			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 17 (XINHUA) -- China's Supreme  People's Procuratorate (SPP) issued a provisional regulation  here today to protect and reward people who report cases of  graft and bribery, leading to successful prosecutions.    It has already been decided to give rewards ranging from  3,000 yuan to 30,000 yuan under these regulations to some 13  informers for the information on such evil-doers which they gave  to the procuratorates, said Zhao Dengju, an SPP deputy  procurator.    "Exposure by means of letters, telephone or interviews by  the  masses has played a key role in China's drive against the  corrupt practices," Zhao told a news conference here today.    Some 80 percent of all the corruption cases on the  procuratorial file for investigation and prosecution were traced  on the basis of clues reported by the masses, he said.    Since the beginning of the current anti-corruption drive,  the  procuratorates nationwide have accepted and heard 230,000 such  cases, of which 170,000 were corruption cases, he said, adding  that they accepted and heard 1.69 million reported cases since  1988, of which 1.22 million were related to corruption.    The provisional regulation stipulates that an informer will  be rewarded based on the role his information plays in cracking  the case, or his contribution in helping the judicial bodies,  and the illicit money or goods recovered.    To protect the informer from revenge, the regulation states  that information about the informer will not be disclosed  without his or her own permission.    The SPP official said the 13 rewarded informers had helped  to  uncover 11 major and important corruption cases, and recover 18  million yuan worth of illicit money and goods.    Their rewards will total 119,000 yuan, he said.    The provisional regulation going into effect today is  expected to help further the country's anti-corruption drive,  Zhao said.</p>

Transportation  Minister Viktor Klima, who visited Vietnam, Malaysia, and  Indonesia, accompanied by a delegation of leading industrialists  and business managers, describes the region as a promising  growth market with very tough competition.    In order for Austrian exporters to be successful on these  markets, the state should grant them the same competitive  conditions their foreign competitors enjoy, said Klima in a  report on his talks.    Specific projects worth approximately 5 billion schillings  were negotiated, Klima told Austrian radio correspondents  following his visit. Klima is expecting the talks to yield  tangible results within the next two or three years.    There is particularly great interest in equipment for local  infrastructure programs, such as special rails, rail production  machinery, locomotives, and freight cars.    In Vietnam, a bilateral railroad cooperation program is in  the offing, and in Malaysia, a relevant railroad agreement,  including the Austrian Rail Engineering (ARE) company, was  discussed. In addition, Klima said deliveries in the area of  power plant engineering and sewage treatment were discussed.  However, real successes require soft loans. Klima said he  would discuss this in the government.    Austrian suppliers will also set up, step-by-step, local  production facilities in Indonesia and Malaysia.    In Kuala Lumpur, the extension of the current air transport  agreement with Malaysia and MAS was discussed. Detailed  negotiations are scheduled to begin in the next few weeks. The  talks will be aimed at offering Vienna Airport increasingly as a  bridgehead for Far East air connections. At present, MAS  supplies a Kuala Lumpur-Vienna service twice every week.</p>

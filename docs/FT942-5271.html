			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Positive verdict on impact of Channel 5 The government's technical advisers have decided that it is possible to go ahead with a new conventional Channel 5 without damaging the prospects of developing digital television, Raymond Snoddy writes. A report by the Radio Communications Agency, the specialist agency responsible for radio frequencies, has decided that it is possible to have the best of both worlds. The positive verdict on Channel 5 was delivered in a report to Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary on Friday. The agency's recommendation, based partly on work carried out by engineers at National Transcom, the privatised former research and transmission division of the Independent Broadcasting Authority, will involve an element of compromise. Mr Brooke will meet Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, within the next 10 days to reach a joint position before the issue goes to cabinet for final decision. The view at the Department of Trade and Industry has been for some time that the prospects of digital as opposed to the present analogue television system should not be allowed to be jeopardised by allowing Channel 5 to go ahead. Mr Brooke has called for more research to see whether the two were are incompatible. The precise shape of the compromises involved are seen as a political decision. Under old plans for Channel 5, for example, the new channel could have reached about three-quarters of the UK population. By ensuring that enough frequencies are kept available for the development of digital Channel 5 could lose some of its potential reach.</p>

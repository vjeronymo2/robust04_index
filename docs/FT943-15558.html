			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Schroders builds up Wall Street presence: Chairman sees further US investment as merchant bank pays Dollars 92m for Wertheim control Schroders yesterday announced a deal giving it one of the largest presences on Wall Street of a UK merchant bank. The Dollars 92m (Pounds 60.5m) purchase for the half of US-based investment bank Wertheim Schroders it does not already control would allow Schroders to make further investment in a US arm, according to Mr George Mallinckrodt, Schroders chairman. Schroders already has a presence in the US through its asset management arm, which was the largest non-US manager of international investments as of March 31, 1994, according to the trade publication Pensions and Investments. Of the Pounds 6.5bn in net new cash it attracted last year, nearly Pounds 4bn was from accounts outside the UK, with much coming from the US. The increasing interest among US investors for non-US securities was a key factor in Wertheim's decision to sell full control of the firm to Schroders, Mr Mallinckrodt said. 'Two or three years ago, this was not really a factor. That's what persuaded them to sell now,' he explained. 'In the future we can target ourselves to introduce more foreign securities into the US.' To this end, Mr Mallinckrodt said, Schroders hoped to expand Wertheim's securities distribution capabilities in the US, as well as its corporate base. The acquisition of total control of Wertheim allows Schroders to draw the firm into areas its management might have been reluctant to participate in, such as expansion of its derivatives activities. Mr Mallinckrodt said that Schroders might seek to raise Wertheim's capital base to Dollars 250m from Dollars 177m in the next five years or so. Schroders has owned 42.5 per cent of Wertheim's equity since 1986, a stake which carries 50 per cent of the voting rights. Yesterday's deal will pay Dollars 68m for the shares held by Wertheim's management and a further Dollars 24m for the 15 per cent non-voting interest held by institutional shareholders. The acquisition price, which includes the assumption of some Dollars 65m in Wertheim debt securities, values the company at about Dollars 310m. Wertheim had net tangible assets of Dollars 179m at May 31, 1994, and for the year ended December 31, 1993, pre-tax profits after exceptional items of Dollars 35m. Wertheim last year paid roughly Dollars 20m to cover compensation and legal fees to Ames, the US department store chain, over advice Ames received when it made the Dollars 1.3bn purchase of the discount store division of Zayre in 1988. According to Securities Data in New York, Wertheim ranks 15th among worldwide M&amp;A advisers so far this year, having worked on completed transactions valued at Dollars 5.56bn. In 1993 the firm ranked 10th, advising on Dollars 16.8bn in deals. However, in league tables showing number of M&amp;A deals worked on, Wertheim stands higher - 12th in the year-to-date, and 4th in 1993 - an indication that its corporate clients are smaller in size than those advised by Wall Street's biggest banks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. Mr James Harmon, Wertheim's chief executive, said it was wrong to label the firm as serving the medium-sized corporate market, as it had particular strengths in sectors such as chemicals. The buy-out of Wertheim comes a time when other UK firms have been actively developing US operations, with mixed success. Lazard has long had a presence in US investment banking through its relationship with Lazard Freres, while SG Warburg and NatWest Securities have begun to establish themselves in various corners of the domestic securities markets. In contrast, Barclays de Zoete Wedd has been unsuccessful in its attempt to build a US stock brokerage business, while the 1991 partial merger between Baring Brothers and Dillon Read has yet to pay significant dividends. Mr Philip Gibbs, merchant banking analyst at BZW, said the deal offered benefits for Schroders, even though, at 1.7 times net worth, it had paid a premium over the going rate for US merchant banks. 'The fact that they have worked together as partners for eight years augers well.' If there is a disadvantage, it may be that the senior management of Wertheim no longer has the incentive of sharing the profits as owners. Wall Street's top earners receive compensation packages in the millions of dollars, whereas London pay rates are much lower. Mr Harmon said talk of tension over pay levels was off-target. 'We are well aware of this matter. Clearly, you have to pay competitively, and we will continue to pay competitively.' A Schroders banker in London said: 'The reality is that New York pays more, and you have to pay local market rates.' Lex, Page 18</p>

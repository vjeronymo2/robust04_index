			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / International Company News: Valmet acquires machine group VALMET, the Finnish state-controlled paper machinery and engineering group, is to acquire 91 per cent of Tampella Papertech of Finland, one of the world's leading producers of board machinery. Valmet plans to set up an operating group with annual sales of FM1.6bn (Dollars 352m). This would combine its existing board, tissue and specialty paper machine manufacturing companies and Tampella Papertech's board machine production plants. Valmet is paying for its shareholding in Tampella Papertech with 3m of its own shares, worth about FM90m at current stock market prices. In addition, Valmet has agreed to take over some of Tampella Papertech's debts, increasing the value of the deal, although the size of the loans to be acquired was not disclosed. Tampella Papertech, which made a loss last year, has net sales of FM1.14bn and 1,800 employees. Its main production plants are in Finland, Italy and the US. It is a subsidiary of Tampella, the heavily-indebted Finnish forestry and engineering group which is controlled by the Bank of Finland. The central bank was forced to take over Tampella last year following the rescue from collapse of its previous owner, Skopbank, the Finnish bank. The central bank owns 81 per cent of Tampella through Solidium, its holding company. Tampella will be able to reduce its level of debt - estimated to be about FM6bn in 1991 - as a result of the deal. Following the divestment, Tampella will have four main business areas: forest products; mining and construction equipment; boilers for the pulp and paper industry; and packaging. The Finnish state's stake in Valmet is reduced from 81.4 per cent to 73 per cent as a result of the deal.</p>

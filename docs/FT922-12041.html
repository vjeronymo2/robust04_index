			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Trade News: World business leaders increase pressure for global trade agreement - Successful completion of the Uruguay Round is seen as a 'prerequisite for world economic growth and prosperity, and therefore for jobs' AS President George Bush and Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, meet in Washington today, world business leaders are stepping up pressure for an agreement on global trade liberalisation. Mr Bush and Mr Delors will try to resolve differences between the US and the EC, mainly on farm subsidies, that have blocked agreement so far in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. It is seen as the last chance of concluding a Gatt pact before a new administration takes office in the US in January. A senior US official yesterday depressed hopes of a breakthrough in the talks, but insisted that the coming presidential election was no 'impediment' to agreement. Japanese, US and European businesses said in Tokyo yesterday that successful completion of the Round was 'a prerequisite for world economic growth and prosperity, and therefore for jobs'. Agreement would restore business confidence by reducing uncertainties and the risk of trade conflicts, they said in a joint statement signed by the Keidanren, Japan's leading business organisation, and US and European business groupings. The Tokyo statement follows a letter signed last week by more than 120 chief executives around the world appealing to national governments to iron out their differences. Among US signatories to the letter from the International Chamber of Commerce, IBM, AT&amp;T and General Motors stressed the need for a clear set of trading rules. Their absence 'raises the cost of doing business,' a GM official said. IBM said it was vital to have a trading framework covering services, anti-dumping and trade in services. 'We want a consistent world-wide application of trade practices that can be applied locally.' GM noted tariffs were no longer especially important in trade in cars. It had reservations about the language of the Gatt draft's anti-dumping provisions, but was pleased it would at least replace many local content rules complicating external investment. AT&amp;T thought aspects of the draft could be improved, in the protection of intellectual property, rules of origin and the anti-dumping provisions. But it believed an umbrella agreement was the priority. Mr Patrick Gillam, chairman of Asda, the UK supermarket chain, said his organisation as a 'buyer of a lot of imported goods' would benefit from liberalised world trade. 'Anyone who is an industrialist will be happy not to see the world fall into competing trade blocs. The record since Gatt was introduced shows ever-increasing world trade ..if you can complete the agreement you will have similar beneficial effects. Our organisation benefits from the general economic prosperity that arises from greater freedom of trade.' Sir Patrick Sheehy, BAT Industries chairman, said: 'With the world on the whole in a recession and experiencing difficult economic conditions, there is a bit of a beggar-my-neighbour attitude about. It would be easier to get an agreement in a period of prosperity. To bring about a meaningful agreement needs political courage, which is lacking in Europe and the US.' The BDI, Germany's leading industry association, warned of the 'devastating' economic effects (of failure in Gatt) on the national economy, which derives 32 per cent of income from exports. Companies took a more cautious view. The immediate worry is that heightened uncertainty will further delay economic recovery. They fear polarisation of world markets into three defensive trading blocs, the EC, the US and Japan, which would have unquantifiable effects on reconstruction and social conditions in Europe's former communist states. 'We are all worried because central and eastern Europe need market access to build their economies,' said Mr Jurgen Pfingster, chief economist at Commerzbank, one of Germany's biggest banks. Global businesses such as Siemens, the electronics and engineering group, fear increased 'complications in procedures' will hamper their development, a spokesman said. The heads of five of Italy's leading companies also signed the letter, among them Fiat, the country's largest private sector group, and ENI, the state-owned oil and energy concern. Mr Luigi Orlando, chairman of SMI, Europe's biggest maker of copper and alloy products, stressed his commitment to open markets, but like Fiat's chairman, Mr Giovanni Agnelli, he believed the Commission should produce policies to defend European companies against their US and Japanese competitors. In Australia, Mr John Prescott, chief executive of Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP), the mining, energy and steel group, said Australia had suffered materially 'as a result of the agricultural protectionist policies of the US and the EC. We believe that wholesale abolition of agricultural protection, combined with steady progress towards the ultimate removal of protection of manufactured goods would lead to a more even spread of world prosperity.' 'We do so much exporting that it's vital to us,' said Mr Alf Powis, chairman of Noranda, the Toronto-based resources and industrial group. Mr Red Wilson, president of the Montreal telecommunications holding company BCE, said that while BCE was unsure how it might be affected by lower barriers to international telecommunications, 'we'd rather talk about opportunities to liberalise than not talk about them.'

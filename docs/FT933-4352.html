			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Survey of Northern Ireland (7): Back seat figurehead / Profile of James Molyneaux AS leader of Northern Ireland's largest political party, the Ulster Unionists (UUP), Mr James Molyneaux is the figurehead of traditional, mainstream Unionist politics and values in the province. His is the distilled voice of a majority Protestant population which, down the years, has had to face the gradual erosion of its privileged status in holding the reins of Ulster's political and economic power. The provincial government at Stormont was dissolved in 1972, replaced by direct rule from Westminster. And then in 1985, for the first time, the Anglo-Irish agreement gave the Irish Republic a consultative role in any future constitutional arrangements for the province. Reaction to those changes has pushed Unionism in a number of different directions. Devolutionists, integrationists, power-sharers and even pro-'independentists' have all sought to push the UUP into their chosen path. It is Mr Molyneaux's claim to achievement that he has held the party together through these internal struggles - despite the radical shift of one trend of Unionism into the hard-line DUP, another trend into paramilitary activities, and the loss of voters to the confessionally-neutral Alliance party and, more recently, the Conservatives. Elected to Westminster for the South Antrim constituency in 1970, where he had been constituency secretary to his predecessor, Mr Molyneaux assumed leadership of the parliamentary party in 1974, and went on to be elected party leader in 1979. He is a leading exponent of the 'integrationist' line of Unionist politics: his principal political goal is to improve and democratise direct rule from Westminster - the political arena in which he feels most at ease - rather than argue the case for devolution. Arthur Aughey, an academic and writer on Unionist politics, says: 'Molyneaux has always been a Westminster man and is well respected for his honesty and integrity and his competence at the parliamentary game. His way of defending the Union was the undemonstrative, the quiet and patient cultivation of sympathy behind the scenes'. But Mr Molyneaux's faith in his ability to sway Westminster politicians came unstuck in 1985 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former British prime minister, signed the Anglo-Irish agreement with the Republic. More recently, his party's support for John Major's government at Westminster during two crucial and closely-contested votes, on pit closures and on the Maastricht Treaty, brought accusations of a behind-the-scenes deal - but to date it has brought no tangible benefits for the UUP. Government ministers have insisted that no concessions have been offered or will be made in exchange for the UUP support. A shy, almost reclusive figure, Mr Molyneaux frequently avoids the spotlight, leaving public statements on party policy to his deputy leader, Mr Ken Maginnis. During the series of 'round-table' inter-party talks on Northern Ireland during 1991 and 1992, which broke up without agreement, participants say he often took a back seat, sitting silently and leaving much of the negotiation and argument to Mr Maginnis. When one round of the talks took the historic step of moving to Dublin in 1992, Mr Molyneaux was notable for his absence from the UUP delegation. Now 73 years of age, he has been criticised for failing to move the narrowly-focused mainstream of Unionist politics into the era of European union. He has also been accused of failure to seize opportunities and initiatives to achieve a breakthrough in the political log-jam that has characterised Northern Ireland for the past two decades. Such a breakthrough could only happen with the initiative and support of the UUP, the majority party. But Mr Molyneaux seems content to leave that crowning achievement out of his political memoirs.</p>

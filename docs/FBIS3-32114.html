			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 31 Jan (AFP) -- The Maoist organization  Shining Path has stated it will continue its 13-year military  struggle. According to its official newspaper EL DIARIO, which  was sent to the Lima media on Monday, an "impostor" took the  place of its imprisoned leader, Abimael Guzman, to issue an  appeal for peace to the Peruvian Government in October 1993.    EL DIARIO said, "We know reactionary people have Guzman  hidden and isolated in the Navy's dungeons. We reject the  October video, which presents an impostor, a man they prepared  for over a year to replace Guzman on television."    Shining Path thinks the government's campaign for "a peace  agreement justifies the assassination of President Gonzalo  (Guzman)," and so it asks that the health of its leader, who was  arrested in September 1992 and is currently serving a life  sentence at the naval base in El Callao, "be taken care of."    Nevertheless, the opposition magazine SI claims, in its  Monday edition, an uneasiness prevails among high command  members of the Navy, who are in charge of Guzman's custody, over  the meetings held between the Shining Path leader and the  imprisoned leaders of the organization at the officers' club in  El Callao Naval Base.    According to official information, during those meetings  they  wrote the letters from Guzman and his comrade, Elena  Iparraguirre (one letter remains unpublished), issuing an appeal  for peace; and another one along those same lines from four  imprisoned leaders.    SI magazine reports, citing reliable sources, that Shining  Path's demands to achieve a peace agreement include "a general  amnesty for all of its imprisoned activists," so they can hold a  congress to establish the groundwork for peace.    The magazine, along with all Peruvian media, thinks a  division prevails within the Shining Path between the group  which advocates peace, led by Guzman, and a group of  "hard-liners" who do not want to end the armed struggle, which  began in 1980 and which is represented by leaders who are still  at large.    Conversely, EL DIARIO calls the division "false" and denies  Guzman wants peace; it does admit the imprisoned activists  include a handful of "capitulators, now lackeys of the  dictatorship (President Alberto Fujimori's Government), who are  trying to plant the idea of capitulation among the people."    EL DIARIO also publishes a statement from female Shining  Path  members, currently at the women's prison in Lima, who also  recognize the existence of "a small revisionist, black group of  capitulators that wave the flags of peace while shouting threats  that will have deadly consequences."    To conclude, the January edition of the Shining Path  newspaper, which is banned in Peru and the possession of which  is proof of active participation in the organization -- a fact  that may be punished with a life sentence -- is exclusively  dedicated to proving its total loyalty to Guzman.</p>

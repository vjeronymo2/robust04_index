Zou made the remark during an investigation tour of Tangshan  City in north China's Hebei Province from January 16 to 20.    Accompanied by local leaders, Zou visited Jingtang Harbor,  the harbor development zone, the Tangshan Iron and Steel  Company, the Douhe power plant and the Jidong cement plant.    While visiting the expansion project of the Tangshan Iron  and  Steel Company, Zou said the development of an enterprise must be  based on technical progress.    "Technical upgrading should be carried out every year,  especially from the aspect of using new technologies and  developing new products," Zou said.    He pointed out that the worth of an enterprise should be  decided not by its output merely, but by its efficiency and  technical level.</p>

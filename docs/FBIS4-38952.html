			<p>BFN     [Text] Admiral Feliks Gromov, commander in chief of the  Russian Navy, in a conversation with journalists, said: Efforts  by a group of naval experts to estimate the fleet's strength,  particularly its floating capability, is under way. The  specialists will determine the parameters for the basis of the  fleet's division, focusing on the categories of ships and their  technical condition. Feliks Gromov pointed out that this is not  a meeting of delegations but work done by experts. The work is  difficult because every ship has to be examined.    About his meeting with Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy, the  Ukrainian Naval Forces commander, Feliks Gromov reported that  their points of view do not coincide, and it is necessary to do  everything possible to reach a mutual understanding.</p>

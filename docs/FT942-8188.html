			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa Johannesburg posted steady late-afternoon gains as shares rallied in response to a stronger gold price and a general improvement in sentiment. The overall index finished 34 better at 5,474, industrials rose 62 to 6,621 and golds collected 22 to 1,908. A bounce in Remb Beheer after hefty losses on Thursday helped the mood. The tobacco stock rose R3.75 to R20.75 after a R7 fall on Thursday after ANC health officials proposed a 100 per cent rise in cigarette prices.</p>

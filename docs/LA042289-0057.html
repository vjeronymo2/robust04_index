			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUSS OVER ETHICS AND OFFICEHOLDERS  </P> <P> At least one of the charges of the House Ethics Committee regarding the conduct  of Wright portends an interesting philosophical question: In the minds of the  goose and gander, is that which is good for one necessarily good for the other?  </P> <P> One thing my mother never let me forget was that my father never would pay her  poll tax. One was a Lincoln Republican, and the other was a Roosevelt Democrat.  My father said that he didn't want my mother to kill his vote, and my mother  said that she might have voted like he wanted her to vote, but that she wasn't  going to let him tell her how to vote.  </P> <P> I reckon it's insignificant to the point of this letter, but mother always  finished that story by saying that on the first election day after the poll tax  was abolished and she could have voted, dad took her fishing.  </P> <P> RONALD WEBSTER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

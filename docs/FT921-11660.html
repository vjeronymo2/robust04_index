			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / MPs told of watchdog's pay-off THE FORMER chief executive of the National Rivers Authority agreed a Pounds 125,000 compensation deal with the authority's board after resigning last year, a committee of MPs heard yesterday. Mr John Bowman left the water watchdog in June following serious financial weakness for which all board members were ultimately responsible, the MPs were told. The board decided Mr Bowman should leave after an internal inquiry discovered lax management controls had led to overspending of at least Pounds 1m of taxpayers' money on a new headquarters building. Two senior managers were disciplined. However, a memorandum by the National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, shows that the Department of Environment had told the NRA that principle responsibility for effective financial management lay with the authority's board as well as the chief executive. It reveals that, as well as informing Mr Bowman of his responsibilities, a letter about the line of responsibility had been sent to Lord Crickhowell, the NRA chairman. Mr John Wheatley, the new NRA chief executive, told the Commons' public accounts committee that the board decided Mr Bowman should leave the NRA on 'agreed terms'. The Pounds 125,000 was in compensation for the unexpired part of his five-year contract. Mr Wheatley, a board member at the time, said there had been 'no justification' for dismissing Mr Bowman. Asked if the board had agreed to pay compensation in order to conceal its own shortcomings, he replied: 'That was not in our mind.' The NRA, which monitors the state of the water environment in England and Wales, decided to relocate its head offices from London to Bristol in October 1989 at an estimated cost of Pounds 1m. To save time the NRA, without the chief executive's knowledge, decided to negotiate a contract with Corporate Design and Construct (CDC) rather than putting it out for tender. The National Audit Office report also shows how costs rose, without the board's approval, to Pounds 2.65m. The NRA's internal inquiry found tendering and contractual failings and weak financial controls and procedures. It encouraged CDC to ensure that Pounds 1.4m was spent on the project by March 31 last year in order to prevent the loss of any government grants unspent before the end of the financial year.</p>

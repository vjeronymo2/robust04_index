			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17 KYODO -- The government should curb  spending by more than 7 trillion yen to limit dependence on  bonds, the Finance Ministry said Tuesday [17 May].    The ministry presented its fiscal reform policy with a  five-year budget outlook through fiscal 1997 in a report  submitted to the Budget Committee of the House of  Representatives, which started deliberations on the fiscal 1994  budget Tuesday.    The report takes into account neither the planned income and  other tax cuts for calendar 1994 nor the deficit-covering bonds  to cover the tax cuts since the ruling coalition parties are  still to decide on permanent tax reform by the end of the year.    Given such uncertainties, the ministry does not actually  believe future budgets will match the estimates of the report, a  budget bureau official told reporters.    The report said budget outlays must be reduced by more than  7  trillion yen annually over three years starting in fiscal 1995  to match the anticipated tight revenues and avoid excessive bond  issuance.    On the revenue side, the ministry estimates that 850  trillion  yen from bonds must be trimmed annually to hold bond revenues to  5 percent of the budget outlays in fiscal 1999.    The share of bond revenues in the fiscal 1994 budget is  estimated at 18.7 percent, up from 11.2 percent in the initial  fiscal 1993 budget and the highest since 19.4 percent in fiscal  1987.    The report came after the ministry postponed its five-year  target of reducing bond reliance to 5 percent of the budget by  fiscal 1995.    When accounting for fiscal reform, the ministry expects the  outstanding bond balance, excluding 3.13 trillion yen in  deficit- financing bonds to cover the tax cuts, to peak in  fiscal 2002 at 211.40 trillion yen after rising steadily from  197.50 trillion yen in fiscal 1994.    If red-ink bonds for covering the tax cuts are included, the  ministry estimates the balance will top 200 trillion yen for the  first time in fiscal 1994 to reach 201 trillion yen.    But even if the bond balance peaks in fiscal 2002, the  ministry estimates it will remain at the 200 trillion yen level  until at least fiscal 2007.    The ministry has been insisting the government tackle the  swelling bond balance since higher debt-servicing costs would  put a squeeze on policy expenditures.</p>

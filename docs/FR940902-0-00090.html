			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The determination of EDWAA eligibility for any of the program's services and activities is determined based on the best information available at the time. If the circumstances upon which the eligibility decision(s) were based change, a reevaluation of the continued need for the services/activities is appropriate. It is expected that consideration would be given to such factors as the exact nature of the employer action (postponement or reversal), where the participant is in the system (e.g., whether the participant is enrolled and participating in a retraining activity), and the impact of a termination on the individual. However, title III expenditures for services/activities to a participant who was correctly determined to be eligible are not, in and of themselves, disallowed costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter asked how States should define ``plant or facility closing'' within the context of &sect;631.3(b). Specifically, they asked if WARN rules should be used in defining these terms (i.e., whether line closings within a plant or the elimination of a shift should be considered a plant closing). While the Department believes the WARN rules provide helpful guidance, this determination is left to the discretion of the Governor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter requested the addition of language requiring the availability of ``rapid response-like activities'' to a firm entering bankruptcy, whether or not a formal public announcement has been made. Section 631.3(b)(1) provides for participant eligibility in the event of a formal public announcement of a plant closure. While no change is made in the final rule, a State may, pursuant to section 314(b) of the Act, provide rapid response assistance after becoming aware of a current or projected permanent closure or substantial layoff. Moreover, the firm's employees may receive the services authorized in section 314 of the Act if they meet the eligibility criteria established at section 301. In assessing the circumstances of an impending bankruptcy, it is expected that the Governor would determine whether the filing would result in a closing, a layoff, or a Chapter 11 restructuring with no contemplated change in manpower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter questioned whether or not a participant had to be enrolled to receive basic readjustment services and if limited basic readjustment services could be provided to eligible workers prior to enrollment into a title III program. Section 314(c) of the Act (Basic Readjustment Services), of course, includes outreach and intake. The Department believes that outreach and intake services include limited assessment of an eligible applicant to allow service providers to evaluate an applicant's suitability for JTPA training and services. The definition of ``participant'' at section 4 of the Act provides that: ``Participation shall be deemed to commence on the first day, following determination of eligibility, on which the participant began receiving subsidized employment, training or other services.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters felt that &sect;631.3(b)(3) inappropriately excluded certain groups from consideration as ``eligible dislocated workers'' pursuant to &sect;631.3(b). A few believed involuntary, forced and early retirements should be excepted from this provision, since many individuals falling into this category have lost jobs through no fault of their own. Stating that individuals are often forced or ``seduced'' into early retirement, another commenter wished to except any individual who is likely to retire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The exclusion of individuals ``likely to retire instead of seeking new employment'' is statutorily required at section 314(h)(1) of the Act and, therefore, will remain. The Department interprets the Act to preclude services to those who are unlikely to need them because they will remain employed with the employer or because they will retire. The decision about whether any individual who has ``voluntarily'' retired does, in fact, intend to remain unemployed must be made on a case-by-case basis. This decision is best made at the state or local level. Therefore, the Governor is responsible for the interpretation of this phrase and its subsequent application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter questioned what was acceptable documentation that a person is ``likely to remain employed with the employer or to retire'' when no individual notice is provided. It is within the Governor's discretion to determine what would be acceptable documentation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A new &sect;631.3(j) is added to set forth the requirements of section 250(b)(2)(C) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2271, et seq.), as amended by the NAFTA Worker Security Act (Title V of Pub. L. 103&hyph;182).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Approved Training Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 314(f)(2) of the Act states that eligible individuals participating in title III programs may receive unemployment compensation benefits consistent with State policies under the Approved Training Rule and defines eligible workers as those ``participating in training (except on-the-job training).'' The language in the final rule at &sect;631.4 is revised from participation in ``any of the programs'' to ``any retraining activity, except on-the-job training.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter thought that limiting the receipt of unemployment compensation benefits to only those trainees participating in a retraining activity was inappropriate. Specifically, the commenter believed trainees in a class providing assessment and the preparation of an individual service strategy (ISS) are not available and looking for work, and they too need compensation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Objective assessment and preparation of an individual readjustment plan are defined in section 314(c) of the Act as basic readjustment services and, therefore, individuals participating solely in these activities fail to meet the criteria established under section 314(f)(2) of the Act and &sect;631.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Classification of Costs at State and Substate Levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 631.13 was not altered in the interim final regulations. However, a few commenters suggested redefining ``retraining'' to be consistent with ``direct training services'' under titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C and ``basic readjustment services'' to be consistent with ``training-related services'' under titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Department acknowledges that statutory requirements often present barriers to coordination, it must be pointed out that titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C and title III authorize separate programs with distinct goals, structures, services and requirements. For example, objective assessment is defined in titles II&hyph;A and II&hyph;C as a direct training service while it is defined in title III as a basic readjustment service. The statute and, in turn, the regulations reflect this fact. Therefore, the different terms with their distinct definitions remain intact in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Limitations on Certain Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Inquiry ordered into funding of French political party The French Justice Ministry yesterday ordered an official investigation into the funding of the Republican party, one of the largest groups in the centre-right government and which is headed by Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister. The announcement is a further blow to Mr Longuet, under pressure to resign after allegations of irregular payments concerning a villa in Saint Tropez. It is also a setback for Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, who is seeking support from the Republicans as part of his strategy for next year's presidential elections. The decision to open a formal investigation, which has been rumoured for several days, follows a report by Mr Renaud van Ruymbeke, an investigating magistrate, which alleged irregularities in the party's funding. In particular, he has questioned whether its Paris headquarters were acquired on favourable terms and how it received an estimated FFr28m (Pounds 3.35m) in cash between 1987 and 1991. Mr Van Ruymbeke is also leading the investigation into the financing of Mr Longuet's villa. Mr Balladur said at the weekend the investigation must pursue its course but Mr Longuet should resign if formally charged. A decision on whether to lay charges is due at the end of the month. The Republican party is the largest element in the UDF, junior partner in the governing coalition, which also comprises the Gaullist RPR party. Mr Balladur is engaged in an undeclared battle with Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR head, to represent the right in next spring's presidential polls. The opening of the inquiry will further fuel demands for a reform of French political funding. Mr Philippe Seguin, national assembly president, has proposed an all-party study of the legislation and criticised Mr Balladur for his reticence on the issue. Mr Pierre Mehaignerie, justice minister, has proposed a separation between business and political party financing.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Alliances reinforce retailers' power Sir, The rapid expansion of the activities of many well-known retailers  - from and into all corners of the world - is correctly highlighted by Neil Buckley ('Retailers' global shopping spree', October 12). However, international activities take on even more significance when retailer alliances are taken into consideration. Of the top 25 retailers in Europe, at least 15 - including Argyll, Asda and Sainsbury from the UK - operate within cross-border relationships formed with similar stores. For instance, Sainsbury's 'multi-functional alliance' with Esselunga from Italy, the Belgian Delhaize group and Docks de France (SEDD) was formed earlier this year in what Sainsbury described as a 'forceful pan-European association' - no less than one would expect from a group of companies with a combined annual turnover approaching Pounds 25bn, almost 3,000 stores across Europe, and around 1,000 in the US] The various economies of scale on offer from cross-border alliances are clearly fully appreciated by retailers. However, the considerable power and influence which can be wielded by such operations is not a force which should be ignored by manufacturers (or, some might add, governments).

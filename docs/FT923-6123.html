			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Surge of 38% at Rhone-Poulenc RHONE-Poulenc, France's largest chemicals group, yesterday announced a 38 per cent increase in net income to FFr1.55bn (Dollars 316m) in the first half of 1992 from FFr1.12bn in the same period last year. The news of a rise in profits for Rhone-Poulenc, one of the growing band of French state-controlled companies which is keen to move into the private sector, contrasts with the recent stream of lacklustre interim sales figures from other large French industrial concerns including Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group which, on Monday, disclosed a sharp fall in first half profits. Rhone-Poulenc, like other French companies, saw sales growth fall below inflation - running at an annual rate of 3 per cent in France - during the first half with an increase of 1.3 per cent to FFr42.56bn. However it managed to boost operating income by 22 per cent to FFr4bn. Net income per share rose by 67.6 per cent to FFr21.34 during the first six months of the year. The second quarter was slightly more robust than the first, with operating income rising by 18.9 per cent from FFr1.55bn to FFr1.84bn between the two quarters on static sales. This growth in interim operating income was fuelled by a strong performance from its burgeoning health division, where operating income rose by 34 per cent to FFr2.15bn in the first half. The group also fared well in speciality chemicals and fibre interests, which benefited from restructuring. Speciality chemicals saw operating income rise from FFr156m to FFr407m during the first half, while the contribution from fibres and polymers rose from FFr311m to FFr418m. Rhone-Poulenc's strong first half performance reflects the switch in group strategy to build up its healthcare business thereby reducing its reliance on its old basic chemicals interests.</p>

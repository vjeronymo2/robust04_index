			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Shareholders put on a brave face / A look at Hafnia's decision to suspend its shares The decision yesterday by Hafnia, Denmark's second biggest insurer, to suspend its shares and effectively seek protection from its creditors, will have widespread repercussions throughout Scandinavia's embattled financial sector. Shareholders were putting a brave face on the deal, which transfers assets of DKr5.9bn (Dollars 1.04bn) to a new holding company, leaving them with potential liabilities of up to DKr6bn. 'It is still too early to say whether all the money we have invested in Hafnia shares is lost,' said Mr Flemming Skov Jensen, of the LD wage-earner pension fund. He admitted: 'There rarely comes anything good out of a suspension of payments.' The old holding company retains formal ownership of the new one. But the restructuring appears to put the company's bankers in control of the assets and provides lead bankers Den Danske Bank, whose exposure to Hafnia is thought to be in the region of DKr1.2bn, with some measure of security, even though interest payments have been suspended on outstanding loans. Other bank creditors include Unidanmark, whose exposure amounts to DKr450m. It casts further uncertainty over the immediate prospects of two of the region's largest insurance companies, Denmark's Baltica and Sweden's Skandia, in which Hafnia was a large investor. Hafnia's former chairman, Mr per Villum Hansen, borrowed heavily to buy into both companies as part of a bid to create a Scandinavian insurance conglomerate capable of competing in the newly liberalised European markets. Hafnia's creditors now control 34 per cent of Baltica and a further 14 per cent of Skandia's share capital. Chaos prevails, commented Mr Bjorn Wolrath, the chief executive of Skandia, who is critical of both Hafnia's management and shareholders. Earlier this summer, Hafnia's shareholders rejected a deal in which Skandia would have obtained majority control of the Danish company in exchange for liquidating Hafnia's outstanding debt. The deal also has implications for a fourth insurer, Uni Storebrand, of Norway, which had joined with Hafnia in its bid to take over Skandia. Uni Storebrand owns 28 per cent of Skandia's shares. Hafnia's difficulties have their origins in the ambitions of Mr Hansen, who first pioneered the company's diversification within Denmark into merchant banking and real estate in the 1980s, before turning his attention to the broader Scandinavian and European scene in 1990. Mr Hansen wanted to 'reshape corporate Denmark', said one analyst, commenting on a DKr3.8bn investment in Baltica in 1990. Baltica's management balked at joining Hafnia's putative Scandinavian alliance. Nonetheless, Mr Hansen followed up by joining forces with the Uni Storebrand in a bid to take control of Skandia at the end of last year, investing DKr2.3bn to acquire a 14 per cent stake. 'Having found himself in one hole he dug himself into an even bigger one,' comments Mr Angus Runciman insurance analyst with BNP Securities. Hafnia's investments in its insurance company rivals, totalled an amount equal to over a third of Hafnia's equity investment portfolio. More seriously, the two investments exceeded Hafnia's entire shareholders funds at the end of 1991 of DKr3.1bn and left the company's balance sheet heavily exposed to the difficulties of the Scandinavian insurance market as a whole where trading conditions deteriorated sharply in 1990. 'They should never have been playing around with that size of stake. Hafnia is a small insurance company which wanted to play with the big boys and wasn't up to it,' says Mr Runciman. Matters have deteriorated sharply over the past two months. Following their rejection of the Skandia deal earlier this summer, shareholders agreed to support a DKr1.9bn rights issue to rebuild the company's capital. Within the two months since the share issue the money has evaporated, as further insurance and investment losses have emerged. Provisions against losses on the group's credit insurance business amount to DKr250m. Unrealised capital losses on the Baltica and Skandia shares amount to DKr700m. 'As things were developing, we have crossed the line where we could continue no longer. We thought the DKr1.9bn share issue we launched in July would have solved our problems but it did not,' said Mr Holger Lavesen, chairman of Hafnia. Lex, Page 16</p>

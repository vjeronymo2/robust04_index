According to reporter  Leonel Perez Moya, who is in Guantanamo, the president of the  People's Supreme Tribunal stated that the new legislation  establishes policies for the imposition of more severe  sanctions, although such severity will be be effected within the  framework of the law without neglecting procedural guarantees.    Amaro Salup stated that they are not trying to repress for  the sake of repression but to dissuade and protect people who  commit this serious crime, as well as to ensure the safety of  the border guards and the integrity of national territory.</p>

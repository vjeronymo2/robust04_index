			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Emerging Markets: News Round-up GREECE Buying opportunities are expected on the Athens stock market this week, with brokers predicting a sharp decline in the value of the drachma, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The index rose slightly on Friday as overseas institutional investors returned to the market amid rumours that the currency would be devalued. However, the index was 2.3 per cent down on the week. The government's attempts to offset pressure on the drachma by raising interest rates and lifting capital controls six weeks ahead of the EU's July 1 deadline, triggered turmoil on Athens financial markets. The drachma closed the week only 1.32 per cent down against the D-Mark. But that reflected soaring short-term interest rates that at one point reached 500 per cent. Foreign institutional investors bought Greek blue-chips, and export-led companies, including textile and cement manufacturers. STRATEGY With the sharp correction in emerging markets this year investors might wonder if there is more bad news to come. Foreign &amp; Colonial notes that the IFC Latin American index is off nearly 30 per cent since its peak in mid-February, while Asia was down some 15 per cent by the end of the first quarter. According to F &amp; C the apparent hesitation by the US Federal Reserve to raise short rates more rapidly increased uncertainty and adversely affected short-term liquidity flows to emerging markets. The latest rise in US rates should trigger an upturn, says F&amp;C, and they forecast strong performance over the next few months with the Latin American markets leading the way. MOLDOVA Moldova is to transfer 1,600 state-owned companies to private ownership in auctions forming part of a delayed privatisation campaign, Reuter reports. Most small companies will be sold by auction but investors will also be allowed to subscribe in larger groups. Emerging markets coverage appears daily on the World Stock Markets page.</p>

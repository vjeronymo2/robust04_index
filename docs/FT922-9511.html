			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Bold action to transform Russia's 'wooden' rouble DIPLOMATS and businessmen in Moscow laugh about it. Russian enterprises are worried by it. The Russian people are bewildered. But the government is deadly serious about it. The announcement on Tuesday that the Russian government would make the rouble internally convertible this summer was a bold political statement following the west's decision to provide a Dollars 6bn (Pounds 3.3bn) stabilisation fund for the project. Politically, it served notice to the battered Russian people that the government would deliver its promise to transform the much-maligned 'wooden' rouble into a real currency. It told the world Moscow was on track with its bold plans to integrate Russia into the world economy. It warned the other republics that they would have to play by tough budgetary, financial and credit policy rules dictated by Moscow in order to continue using the rouble. The plan involves floating the rouble rate from July 1 and then defending it up to 7.5 per cent either side of the fixed rate from August 1. Russian officials admitted yesterday that many of the details had yet to be decided. But the general idea, as explained Mr Andrei Vavilov, the first deputy finance minister, is that if central bank intervention to defend the rouble becomes excessive, the government responds by either raising interest rates (to encourage people to convert dollars into roubles to earn interest) or by devaluing. Foreign diplomats and businessmen doubt whether the rate of Rbs80 a dollar at which the goverment hoped to start defending the rouble was realistic given the enormous demand for hard currency in Russia. But Mr Alexander Potemkin, head of the Russian central bank's international department, suggested that the rate might be as strong as Rbs50-Rbs60 with the moves towards convertibility. He pointed to three factors: if exporters were encouraged to sell hard currency earnings at a free market rate there would be more supply than at present. Secondly, if the government's macro-economic reforms stayed on track, the state-owned enterprises would have to become more efficient. Thirdly, he said, the exchange rate would continue to benefit from a physical shortage of roubles in the economy - yesterday the rouble strengthened to Rbs128 per dollar from Rbs143.6 last week. The reform will seek to create a single exchange rate, abolishing all other rates such as the punitive 'commercial' rate at which exporters are obliged to sell 40 per cent of their earnings to the state. This means doing away with favourable exchange rates for certain types of state-owned enterprises to purchase vital imports such as spare parts. Competition from imports is unlikely, since imports would probably remain too expensive for most Russian consumers for some time. But for foreign companies contracting to sell goods to solvent buyers in Russia, the system would be little changed. The Russian buyer converts roubles into currency and sends it to the seller's bank account. Another argument in favour of proceeding with convertibility is to encourage badly-needed foreign investment - investors will be less afraid of making mountains of roubles they cannot spend or convert to hard currency. It remains to be seen if the supply of currency can be vastly increased. Estimated annual export earnings are Dollars 25-Dollars 30bn, but only 2 per cent of that is sold voluntarily by enterprises to the state, with many avoiding the 40 per cent tax by keeping earnings in foreign bank accounts. The government plans to open exchange points around the country to encourage the ordinary citizen to part with dollars. It is unlikely that this will attract currency in itself. But what may have more of a role will be a proposed clampdown on the use of the dollar to buy and sell goods within Russia - if it can be enforced.</p>

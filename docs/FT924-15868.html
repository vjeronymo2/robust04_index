			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Gatt faces crisis over oilseeds row THE multilateral trading system is facing a damaging crisis of confidence following yesterday's refusal by the European Community to accept binding arbitration in its oilseeds row with the US. The governing council of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has been forced to admit impotence in devising a way of settling the five-year dispute over EC oilseed subsidies, which have been condemned twice by a Gatt panel. The EC's proposal for a Gatt working party, whose recommendations would not be binding, was rejected by the US on Wednesday as a 'non-solution'. The failure of Gatt procedures to implement the panel's findings on oilseeds has seriously dented their credibility. The US is backed by many other Gatt members in seeing the EC's legalistic arguments against arbitration as a device to avoid compliance with the panel's rulings. Yesterday's events have also soured the atmosphere for planned high-level talks on October 10 and 11 designed to break the impasse in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations. The US is poised to impose prohibitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn-worth of EC imports if the oilseeds dispute is not speedily resolved. Mr Rufus Yerxa, US ambassador to Gatt, said the decision on which goods would be targeted and when had yet to be taken in Washington. He told the council that the US 'remains prepared to negotiate with the European Community, but time is running very, very short'. The EC would have to come up with 'fresh new proposals'. 'Our patience has worn very, very thin,' he said after the council meeting ended. So far the EC has refused to alter its subsidy system, offering instead other farm trade concessions that the US and other oilseeds exporters say are unacceptable. The US wanted a panel to rule on the global sum of trade damages to oilseeds exporters, which it puts at Dollars 2bn, against the Dollars 400m EC estimate. The dilemma for the US is that imposing trade sanctions would certainly provoke retaliation by the Community, which would hurt US industry. It would also not remedy the trade losses suffered by American soyabean farmers. And it could sink renewed attempts to complete the global trade talks, which both sides hope could lead to a parallel oilseeds settlement. 'Ultimately, retaliation doesn't help anyone,' Mr Yerxa said yesterday. 'You have to be hopeful that we can find a solution.'</p>

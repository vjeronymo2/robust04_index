			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Menu to make a leaner and fitter bank: Barclays faces some awkward choices if it is to regain its position as Britain's most profitable high street bank Just for now, while its headquarters in the City of London are re-built, and its directors struggle to restore its battered reputation, Barclays Bank has taken up residence in the 1810 Johnson Smirke building at the old Royal Mint. Visitors to the grandest high street bank in Britain are still served lunch on fine china, and wine in cut glass. But the main course is humble pie. 'We are not doing well, we are not giving our shareholders value, and we have got to do better,' says Mr Andrew Buxton, the chief executive. 'We must learn from the mistakes of the past, and improve substantially,' says Mr Alastair Robinson, director of the banking division. 'I don't know if we were dumber than others, but we were certainly dumb,' says Mr Joseph DeFeo, director of service businesses. This public hand-wringing is new for Barclays. While the other high street banks went through troubles in the past five years, Barclays seemed to stand above the fray. Until last year, it was Britain's most profitable bank - making pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.39bn in 1988 - as well as the largest by asset size. But in the past year, it has been beset by problems. It is likely to make only a small profit this year - possibly even a loss - because of bad debt provisions estimated by analysts at about Pounds 2bn. This presents the bank with an awkward choice. If it cuts the final dividend, it risks alienating shareholders who backed a Pounds 922m rights issue in 1988. This was the capital used for an ill-judged expansion in lending, including a rise in its Pounds 8.5bn portfolio of property loans. Yet maintaining the dividend - at a cost of some Pounds 192m - would weaken its capital base. Barclays has tried to signal a fresh start by appointing Mr Buxton as chairman and chief executive, following Sir John Quinton's retirement this month. But the move has provoked controversy over whether Mr Buxton, the managing director under Sir John, should combine the roles. After meeting unhappy institutional investors, Mr Buxton said last week that the roles would be split 'in the long term'. Mr Buxton is pleading for time. He knows Barclays faces renewed criticism when the full-year results are published in March. He believes a firm improvement in profitability will only emerge in 1994, with next year being a time of 'recovery'. But he has set an ambitious long-term target: 15 per cent post-tax return on equity within five years. This would require pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.4bn at current equity levels. Senior Barclays managers want to do three things to reverse the bank's fortunes. First, to draw a line under the past; second, to implement tougher operating methods; third, to put in place a coherent strategy for the future. Mr DeFeo believes if they achieve these, they deserve a reprieve. But even he accepts that clemency cannot last forever. If results do not improve in time, 'I would sack us all, and rightly so,' he says. The degree to which Barclays achieves these aims will depend on an old tension within the bank: how rapidly it should leave the past behind. The past exerts a strong pull: Barclays was formed by a merger of local family banks in 1894, and members of the families have traditionally formed its top management. Although Sir John was not a member of the families, Mr Buxton's family was involved with the Overend Gurney Bank, which was absorbed by Barclays. This is one reason why the bank's first aim of drawing a line under the past has proved hard. Mr Buxton's association with family control has exacerbated the dispute over his appointment as both chairman and chief executive. In addition, the bank is still dealing with its past lending. One example is Imry, the struggling property company, to which the bank lent Pounds 440m. Barclays has already made one provision of Pounds 140m, and is expected to disclose a further one of at least Pounds 100m shortly. Its second aim is achieving more efficient operations. In branch banking this means increasing the use of technology, so as to cut jobs. It now intends to shed 18,000 of its 80,000 employees between 1991 and 1995. This is welcomed by analysts. Mr Rod Barrett, of Goldman Sachs, says cutting costs is the most direct way in which Barclays can improve profits over the next two years. Yet the bank must cut numbers while trying to improve service. Mr Robinson says relations with customers are strained. Many small businesses have complained about the bank's tighter lending policy. 'It is important to re-establish relationships of trust with our customers,' he says. Mr DeFeo says it will take up to six years to install the technology needed to improve analysis of loan risks and provide 24-hour telephone banking. In investment banking, greater efficiency means being selective about the type of business it seeks. Mr David Band, chief executive of the BZW investment banking division, says BZW has wasted energy by trying to compete with banks such as Deutschebank within their own countries. He says BZW needs to seek cross-border business where it can offer a competitive advantage. 'There is no point in throwing money at everything. We have had a blunderbuss approach, and we must aim more carefully with a rifle,' he says. The third aim, of establishing a coherent future strategy, is probably hardest of all. Mr Buxton has drawn up a five-year plan, with the aim of making Barclays 'a European bank with global reach'. What this means is not clear. He wants to develop its 50 branches in France - acquired through buying L'Europeene de Banque last year - and 220 branches in Spain. Yet in Germany, it will eschew branch banking. The emphasis on international expansion raises the question of balance between branch and investment banking. Mr DeFeo says Barclays must reduce its reliance on UK branch banking because the difficulty of reliable risk management means its earnings will otherwise be 'jerked around in huge cycles' with the economy. In the US, Barclays has decided to concentrate on investment banking after making losses on its branch network. In healthier times, the balance might be achieved through competition between the two divisions for capital depending on which made a greater return. Yet as Mr Band says, this is hardly possible at the moment because 'on recent results, you would not allocate capital to anyone'. At least for a few years, the balance will have to be decided more by directors' judgement than by figures. For the moment, the main figure that concerns directors is Mr Buxton's target of 15 per cent post-tax return on equity. Analysts and directors agree there is virtually no chance of achieving that next year, while this year's profit will be puny at best. It is likely to be some time yet before there can be a change on the lunch menu at the Johnson Smirke building.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Coal miners raise output Miners at British Coal raised their output to an average of over 13 tonnes per shift in the first six months of the company's financial year, compared with 8 tonnes in the same period last year. But the sharp increase reflected the closure of less productive pits. Sales of coal outside the power-generation business rose 6.4 per cent to 2.3m tonnes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Seimas Economic Committee Chairman Vytautas </F> Zimnickas by Aldona Svirbutaviciute in Vilnius; date not given:  "Economic Committee Chairman Does Not Intend To Resign" --  questions published in boldface; first paragraph is TIESA  introduction]    [Text] Economy Minister Julius Veselka has resigned. Does  Seimas [parliament] Economic Committee Chairman Vytautas  Zimnickas intend to follow his example? The chairman has  explained this in his interview with TIESA.    [Svirbutaviciute] You, as well as Minister J. Veselka, voted  against the law on litas reliability in the Seimas. Do you also  intend to resign?    [Zimnickas] This law was submitted to the Seimas by the  government. I think that the Cabinet of Ministers had to be of  a unanimous opinion. This law was supervised by the Seimas  Budget and the Finance Committee rather than the Economic  Committee. Certainly, we also discussed and analyzed it. I may  have had to resign in line with political etiquette, because my  opinion differed from that of the government and the Seimas  majority. In general, resigning is no problem.    [Svirbutaviciute] Were there any people in the majority  [Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party] faction who shared your  opinion that the litas should not be pegged to any currency?    [Zimnickas] I suppose that the position of economists in our  faction is unanimous. None of us approved of this move, and we  expressed that by voting against or abstaining. We believed  that currently there was no immediate necessity to adopt such a  law. The bank performs its functions entrusted to it with  success. The litas has become stable against other currencies  for over half a year. It is backed either by gold reserves or  other convertible currencies. I know that some people are going  to appeal this law to the Constitutional Court because it  contains certain contradictions.    [Svirbutaviciute] So, the law has been adopted and it must  now be enacted.    [Zimnickas] Of course. Moreover, I voted for separate  articles of this law and submitted proposals so as to adopt  optimal decisions. We will have to enact it. That is that!    [Svirbutaviciute] Was it really necessary to adopt this law  now?    [Zimnickas] We began to talk about its advantage and  necessity when the situation was unstable. Certainly, the law  was essential last fall. However, the discussion has become  protracted, while the situation in the bank has stabilized.    [Svirbutaviciute] How do you imagine Deputy J. Veselka's  role  in the Seimas?    [Zimnickas] I think that it will be beneficial for  Lithuania's economy. I wish an opposition emerged in our  faction.    [Svirbutaviciute] You, as well as J. Veselka, came to the  Seimas as members of the Forum of Lithuania's Future. Some  hopes concerning more radical moves in the legislature and the  Democratic Labor Party faction itself are pinned on J. Veselka's  return to the Seimas.    [Zimnickas] I am for constructive work. There are almost no  politics in our Economic Committee; nor does the opposition  submit politically biased proposals. We engage in essential  discussions and often forget about our party membership. We  argue about cardinal matters. I am pleased that we work in this  way. I suppose that J. Veselka will also manage to successfully  join our work and convey his knowledge and experience for the  benefit of Lithuania's economy.</p>

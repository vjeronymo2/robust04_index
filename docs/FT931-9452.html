			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / The Long View: Jetlagged judgments 'I WISH British Airways were the only airline playing dirty tricks,' grumbled Steve the strategist as he ate breakfast and I ate lunch one day this week. 'My slides are apparently heading for Acapulco and my clients will be heading for Goldman Sachs.' Never mind, I said, it must be a pleasant change on his current world tour of financial centres to be stopping off in a country where the stock market was 15 per cent higher than this time last year. But he was distinctly unfazed. 'That's OK for the locals,' he pointed out, 'but most of my clients account in dollars and on that basis the UK is 10 per cent adrift year-on-year. Wall Street is up - maybe only by 7 per cent, but that's in real money.' How did he view the UK stock market? I wondered. Did he subscribe to the judgment that the UK economy was tracking the US, but six to nine months behind? There seemed to be some of the same elements, including a sharp fall in short-term interest rates and a flood of private investor money into equities, offset by a torrent of new issues. And of course there was a weak currency too, just as the dollar was plunging for a good part of 1992. 'Obviously there are similarities,' said Steve. 'There is the same potential for the development of a garbage stock market with the second-liners racing away on exaggerated recovery hopes or hot technology hype, leveraged by poor market liquidity. 'Private investors have been scared by the fall in savings deposit rates to 3 per cent in the States, and there was a net inflow of Dollars 200bn into long-term mutual funds in calendar 1992 including Dollars 80bn into equity funds. But because equity issuance exploded too, hitting Dollars 76bn, and Wall Street therefore only went sideways, the average total return was no more than 6.7 per cent on equity funds. Still, that was better than the alternative. 'Also, a number of the big listed corporations are in secular decline, because the structure of the economy is changing. In the 1970s you could never get fired for choosing IBM, but now even the chairman of IBM himself can be pushed out of the door. I guess the same applies even more in the UK, which is a more open economy.' Small company share prices have certainly been motoring in London, I said. The new FT-SE SmallCap Index had gone up by 11 per cent so far this year while the FT-SE 100 Index of the biggest companies was actually down a percentage point or two. As for garbage stocks, British Aerospace was up 55 per cent in six weeks. Investors' appetite for low quality was being underlined by the rights issue list, dominated by companies emerging from losses, with sketchy stories about recovery. 'These rights issues often seem very strange from my international perspective,' said Steve. 'I happened to be doing some sums on the Commercial Union issue on the way from the airport. Three-quarters of the Pounds 428m is simply going to fill the hole left by the past three years' dividends which were paid when there were no earnings. In Germany they would simply have cut the dividend out in the first place. It shows that the UK equity market is uniquely income-driven. Unfortunately, dividend growth prospects seem now to be historically poor, which is therefore a good reason for being cautious. And there are others.' Did that mean he did not believe in economic recovery here? 'Certainly it won't be vigorous enough to meet the political objectives,' said Steve. 'It happens I've just come from Japan, which points up some interesting comparisons. Japan has a debt deflation problem basically as bad as the UK's, maybe worse in some ways. But it also has a huge balance of payments surplus, over Dollars 100bn, which reflects an excess of domestic savings. 'Japan no longer has equity and property bubbles because those markets are busted flushes being propped up by the government, but instead there's a bond bubble, so that yen bond yields are now the lowest in the world, heading down to 4 per cent. Essentially this is because Japanese investors are being forced to invest internationally but will only do so when overseas returns are higher. 'Now look at the UK. Same debt deflation, but a massive payments deficit. When the economy was stronger the gap could be covered by attracting hot money at high short-term interest rates. Now short rates are having to be slashed because the economy is collapsing. Exit the hot money. 'You could try cutting the trade deficit by increasing taxes to curb consumption but the politicians don't like the look of that either. So you have to find other investors to finance the deficit - essentially international bond funds, maybe representing the Japanese with that surplus. 'Will they buy Dollars 30bn of UK government securities this year? Only if they are offered some tempting rates, and only if sterling is looking ridiculously cheap. Of course if sterling does weaken further it will tend to boost UK share prices in local currency terms. 'But the more powerful factor will be rising sterling long bond yields, already twice as high as the equity dividend yield.' I agreed that it had rarely been a good idea in the past to buy the UK market on a yield of 4.3 per cent and certainly not on a multiple of 20 times the past year's earnings. Besides, I said, the market was being propped up by privatised utilities, which was fine while the rest of the economy was weak but would dilute any recovery. These utilities accounted for 11 1/2 per cent of the market's value, but 14 per cent of the dividends and 19 1/2 per cent of the earnings. So the rest of the market was on an average price-earnings ratio of 22.3. 'Don't worry, in Tokyo the p/e ratio is 50,' said Steve. 'Look at it like this, things could be worse. And you don't have earthquakes here, do you?'</p>

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Finnish guarantee fund prepares banking merger FINLAND'S government guarantee fund is preparing to merge Skopbank and the Savings Bank of Finland. The move is seen as a preliminary step towards a wider restructuring of Finnish banking and follows the failure of merger talks last week between Unitas and Skopbank. Mr Jorma Aranko, director-general of banking supervision, said the merger was a streamlining operation designed to produce greater efficiency in the troubled banking sector. Skopbank, which on Thursday announced a FM2.2bn (Dollars 472m) loss for the first eight months, was rescued by the Bank of Finland in September 1991 and transferred to the state's guarantee fund in June. Savings Bank of Finland will be converted into a limited liability company prior to the merger. Savings Bank of Finland was formed last month following the merger of 41 savings banks accounting for 80 per cent of the balance sheet total of all the savings banks. Skopbank is the savings banks' central bank.</p>

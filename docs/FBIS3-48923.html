A  great number of new companies emerged. No legislation on stock  market transactions and securities was passed, but a related  bill will be drafted and tabled for consideration and adoption  by the National Assembly.    The number of stock exchanges grew from two early last year  (First Bulgarian Stock Exchange-Sofia and Sofia Stock Exchange)  to thirteen at the end of the year, while stock-market turnover  totalled 131 million leva. Shares traded in 1992 at the cash  market were double the 1992 level, but trade was not monitored  and no exact figures can be published.    Leks Ltd. is the undisputed leader among companies. It  distributed 89 percent in dividends among its share holders  which increased the demand for the said securities on the  capital market. The average stock-exchange share price was 169  leva with a 100 leva par. 1994-projected dividends were  officially put at 131 percent by the company's management. The  company's financial position is stable: Metal and oil re-export  deals with Russia are among the most lucrative transactions as  are production investments in the assembly of wrangler jeeps.    First Private Bank, instituted in 1990, was ranked second in  market share. The bank's 1992 dividends were 50.4 percent for  bearer shares and 46 percent for registered shares. The 1993  dividend will be several points higher. First Private Bank will  be among a handful of profiting banks in 1993 which heightened  the interest in its shares. Last month the extraordinary  general assembly of share holders decided on a capital increase  to reach 1,000 million leva, its registered capital being 10  million leva, which is a significant market portion. The Board  of Directors has been authorized to negotiate with South Korea's  Daewoo industrial giant which is interested in the purchase of  49 percent of the registered shares. First Private Bank will  cover a World Bank loan for private sector and export funding.    Credit Bank, an international multigroup holding bank  instituted in 1991 with a 50 million leva registered capital,  was surprisingly ranked third in market traded shares worth  nearly 14.5 million leva which is due to big sales in May, June  and September.    Another private bank, the Agricultural Credit Bank, with 30  percent of its capital owned by Austria's Raiffeisenbank  distributed 50 percent in dividends in 1993, while its share  prices did not drop below the 2,000 leva mark, the par being  1,000 leva.    The shares of major state-run banks did not sell well in  1993  due to huge bad credits and financial performance throughout the  year.    Newly emerged companies opted for real property and  construction investment: Long-term material assets not affected  by high inflation. The East-West International Holding, which  guaranteed a 105-percent dividend in 1993, and TBS Hotels  constructing the Ambassador-Sofia Hotel with a 150-per cent  projected dividend, are some of them. Trakiya Commerce, working  in the field of bakery products, Maxcom Hold, Black Sea  Investment Fund, Aktiv, and Bulgarian Autotransport Co. have  elicited investor's interest because of their anticipated  progress.    Investment funds are a novelty. They aim to collect the  disposable money assets of banks and other potential investors  and invest them in lucrative projects. The Razvitie  (development) Investment Fund was ranked top on the stock  market. The bulk of its transactions relate to immoveables and  it is also engaged in the construction of a financial centre in  Sofia. The shares of Suedinenie (unity) Investment Fund,  dealing with financial investments, also elicited interest.</p>

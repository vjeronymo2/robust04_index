			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Public spending targeted for a tougher bridle - The Treasury THE Treasury yesterday stressed that its main target was to limit rises in public expenditure in its allocations to the departments. Its statement said: 'Firm control over public expenditure and a sustainable fiscal position are fundamental to the longer term prospects for the economy. The government's objective is to reduce public spending as a share of national income over time. Because of the effects of the cycle, the ratio of public spending to national income is expected to rise slightly in 1993-94, to a level still well below the peaks seen following previous recessions. Thereafter it will resume its downward trend. The achievement of the government's medium-term public expenditure objective will be supported by the new system of public expenditure control announced in July. Under the new system, expenditure will be measured against a new spending aggregate - the new control total (NCT). The NCT includes local authority self-financed expenditure but excludes the main elements of cyclical social security, privatisation proceeds and debt interest. Growth in the NCT will be constrained to a rate which ensures that total public spending - general government expenditure - grows by less than the economy as a whole over the economic cycle. The new arrangements involve a top-down approach to public expenditure planning, focusing first on what can be afforded and then on how the available resources should best be allocated to meet the government's priorities. The new expenditure plans meet the remit for the public expenditure survey set by the cabinet in July - maintaining existing cash plans for 1993-94 and restricting growth in the new control total thereafter to give average real growth over the three years no higher than 1 1/2 per cent. The new plans imply a planning total for 1993-94 of Pounds 244.5bn, the figure set in last year's Autumn Statement. Consistent with this, the new control total has been set at Pounds 243.8bn for 1993-94, and at Pounds 253.6bn for 1994-95 and Pounds 263.3bn for 1995-96. The real growth in the new control total implied by these figures is 2.3 per cent in 1993-94, 0.7 per cent in 1994-95 and 1 per cent in 1995-96. Over the three year period, the new control total is planned to grow on average by 1.4 per cent in real terms. The corresponding figure for the previous three years was 3.2 per cent. The new control totals include reserves of Pounds 4bn in 1993-94, Pounds 7bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 10bn in 1995-96. These are a little lower than the corresponding figures last year, reflecting the changed nature of the control system. The chancellor announced a series of measures to provide a substantial boost to capital spending by both public and private sectors. There will be a time-limited increase in the capital allowances available in the first year for investment in plant and machinery (excluding cars); and a special initial allowance for industrial and agricultural buildings. There will be important changes in the use of private finance to enable the public and private sectors to work more effectively together, particularly on infrastructure projects. The temporary relaxation of the local authority capital receipts rules announced yesterday will be worth over Pounds 1bn over the survey period. Restraint on current spending has also helped make room for protecting capital. The new plans include: Maintenance of the national roads programme at the level previously planned. Because of the fall in construction prices the level of new starts in 1993-94 will be nearly double the level likely to be achieved this year. Total investment by British Rail and London Transport in 1993-94 expected in real terms to be almost double the level in 1979. The leasing of some Pounds 150m new rolling stock by BR in the next three years, provided suitable leases are offered Provision for the Jubilee Line extension. Health capital spending in England at a record level next year of nearly Pounds 2.1bn. Privatisation proceeds, which are not part of the new control total and do not therefore affect expenditure, are projected at Pounds 5.5bn in both 1993-94 and 1994-95, in line with previous plans, and at Pounds 1bn in 1995-96. The planning total for the current year is forecast at Pounds 226.1bn, in line with the plans in last year's Autumn Statement after allowing for classification changes and the Pounds 750m housing recovery package. The overall objective for public expenditure is expressed in terms of the wider aggregate, general government expenditure (GGE), excluding privatisation proceeds. GGE includes all of social security expenditure and central government debt interest. Total government spending as measured by GGE as a share of national income is likely to rise to an estimated 44 per cent in 1992-93, mainly as a result of the recession. It is projected to rise a little further to 45 1/2 per cent in 1993-94. The government is determined to reduce this ratio, although it is below the recession-related peaks of 49 1/4 per cent in 1975-76 and 47 1/2 per cent in 1982-83. It is expected to fall to 45 per cent in 1994-95 and 44 1/4 per cent in 1995-96. The survey has been an extremely tough one, requiring difficult decisions of all cabinet ministers. No programme has been protected from intense scrutiny for savings. But, where possible, the government has sought to give priority to capital spending and to other expenditure that contributes to the long-term health of the economy. Pay: settlements in the public sector in the coming year will be restricted to a maximum of 1 1/2 per cent in order to keep pay bills as low as possible. Without pay restraint there would be less room for spending by government departments, the NHS and local authorities on services to the public and on capital. Transport: the cash plans agreed for the national road programme last year have been maintained, permitting increased activity as a result of lower construction prices. The plans provide for higher real investment by BR in 1993-94 than at any time in the 1980s. They also include provision of over Pounds 1.2bn over the next three years for the Jubilee Line extension, which will go ahead subject to satisfactory completion of legal agreements. The government is seeking to encourage greater levels of transport investment in the medium term through the new initiatives on private finance. To encourage the development of a private-sector leasing market for rolling stock in the lead up to privatisation, BR will be allowed to lease some Pounds 150m of new rolling stock over the next three financial years. Housing: the government made a manifesto commitment to provide 153,000 homes over three years through the Housing Corporation. The new plans should enable this figure to be comfortably achieved. The government will be looking for a growing private-sector contribution to the corporation's programme. Education: central government spending on education, including support for local authorities, will be Pounds 9.5bn in 1993-94, Pounds 0.5bn or 3 per cent higher in real terms than the equivalent forecast out-turn in 1992-93. The plans will fund an increase of 8 per cent in students attending further education and sixth form colleges next year, and a 25 per cent increase over three years, as well as the expansion of grant maintained schools outlined in the White Paper Choice and Diversity. Provision has also been made to enable participation in higher education to remain constant at record levels, following the rapid rise in numbers in recent years. Employment: the new plans provide real growth of 1 per cent in 1993-94 over the planned level in 1992-93, which will allow for 500,000 more opportunities to the unemployed, Youth Training places for a higher proportion of school leavers and the creation of a new adult training and work preparation programme. In addition Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) will have more flexibility to decide how best to use their resources in line with local labour market needs; and extra money has been provided for schemes such as Investors in People which are based on close collaboration between Tecs and local business communities. Health: planned spending on the National Health Service in England in 1993-94 will be Pounds 29bn, Pounds 1.6bn higher than the plans for 1992-93. This represents a real-terms increase of 1 per cent over forecast out-turn, and should allow for growth in hospital activity of at least 2 1/2 per cent. Capital spending by health authorities and NHS trusts is likely to be at a record level of almost Pounds 2.1bn. Defence: during the period covered by the new plans the benefits of the Options for Change review will be secured and some further savings will be made consistent with the policies underlying it. Defence spending will fall by 3 per cent in real terms next year, partly reflecting the much lower pay settlements now expected, and will continue to decline in real terms in the following two years. In total, expenditure on defence is planned to fall in real terms by 10 1/2 per cent between 1992-93 and 1995-96. Over the same period, defence expenditure will fall as a percentage of GDP from 4 per cent to 3 1/4 per cent. Social security: Pounds 3bn has been added to plans for social security spending in 1993-94, honouring existing commitments. The plans maintain the real value of social security benefits, most of which will go up by 3.6 per cent in April 1993. The increase also reflects the impact of higher unemployment, and of higher take-up rates for other benefits. The new plans take account of further action to combat fraud and recover overpayments. Local government: central government support for local authority revenue expenditure will rise by 3.7 per cent in England next year compared with the current year and total standard spending by 3.1 per cent. The total revenue to be raised from domestic taxpayers in the first year of the new council tax will be similar in cash terms to the amount being raised through the community charge in the current year. There will be a special grant of Pounds 539m next year in England, including Pounds 140m of new money, to help local authorities discharge their new responsibilities for community care. The secretaries of state for the environment, Scotland and Wales will make announcements about the details of the local authority settlements later this month. Overseas Development: planned UK external assistance will rise by 1995-96 by more than Pounds 200m in cash terms, or 10 per cent, compared with 1992-93 plans. Aid to developing countries will rise in 1993-94 by nearly 1 per cent in real terms compared with 1992-93 plans, to about Pounds 1,900m. It will be maintained at that level for the following two years. Legal departments: the new plans provide additional resources of around Pounds 0.4bn for legal aid next year. Total expenditure on legal aid is forecast to rise to Pounds 1.5bn by 1995-96. The government will be taking steps to secure improved value for money by more effective targeting and by payment arrangements which encourage efficiency and quality. Agriculture: the new plans provide for substantial increases in provision in each year, mainly reflecting the reform of the Common Agricultural Programme agreed by European Community agriculture ministers in May 1992. The reform is expected to lower the cost of the CAP to consumers by reducing prices, with compensation to farmers in the form of increased direct payments. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: The system for allocating to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the consequential effects of expenditure decisions in England remains in place. The formula has been updated to take account of the latest population figures contained in the 1991 census.'</p>

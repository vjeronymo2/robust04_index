			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIX WOMEN FILE FOR TOP STATE POSTS  </P> <P> With six highly visible women leading the way, the first formal step toward  what may be a major change in California in the 1990s was taken Friday as all  candidates for the June 5 primary had to file their declarations of candidacy  or be left off the ballot.  </P> <P> As expected, former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein will be on the  Democratic ballot for governor against Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp and  several lesser-known candidates.  </P> <P> With the aid of a much-talked-about TV ad, Feinstein moved ahead of Van de Kamp  by 19 points in the most recent Los Angeles Times Poll, a dramatic turnaround  from the Times' December survey, when she trailed him by 10 points.  </P> <P> Darry Sragow, a top Feinstein adviser, said that the new poll has generated so  many queries from volunteers and potential donors that the campaign will move  from its cramped Santa Monica headquarters to a more spacious office in the  Mid-Wilshire area.  </P> <P> "All of a sudden, Dianne is like the Miata," said Sragow, referring to a new  sports car that is so popular there are long waiting lists. "There is enormous  interest."  </P> <P> Kathleen Brown, daughter of former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown and sister of  former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr., will also be on the June Democratic ballot in  a move to launch a statewide political career that is drawing interest from all  over the country.  </P> <P> Her opponent in November could be a woman if former U.S. Treasurer Angela (Bay)  Buchanan pulls off an upset in June of incumbent Republican Treasurer Thomas  Hayes.  </P> <P> State Sen. Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach is also trying to increase the  number of women in top political office by seeking the Republican nomination  for lieutenant governor. Her major opponent on the June ballot will be state  Sen. John Seymour of Anaheim.  </P> <P> Two-term incumbent Lt. Gov. Leo T. McCarthy will have no serious opposition on  the Democratic side.  </P> <P> Currently, the only woman holding statewide office in California is Secretary  of State March Fong Eu. She has filed her candidacy for June and could have her  first major female opponent for the job she has held since 1974 if Los Angeles  City Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores wins the GOP nomination for secretary of  state in June.  </P> <P> Flores is opposed by Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Gordon Levy.  </P> <P> Reform advocate Tom Skornia and insurance agent Wes Banister will fight for the  GOP nomination for insurance commissioner.  </P> <P> State Sen. John Garamendi of Walnut Grove probably has the best name  recognition of the Democratic candidates for the job. He ran a strong race for  state controller in 1986, losing to Gray Davis, who will have no serious  opposition for the controller's job this year.  </P> <P> Garamendi's top opponents for insurance commissioner are Conway Collis, a  member of the State Board of Equalization, Walter Zelman, the former head of  California Common Cause, television commentator Bill Press and activist-lawyer  Ray Bourhis.  </P> <P> A battle for attorney general is shaping up as San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo  Smith takes on Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner in the Democratic primary.  The winner will face former Long Beach Rep. Daniel Lungren, a Republican who  helped revise the federal Criminal Code while in Congress.  </P></p>

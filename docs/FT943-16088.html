			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Child support It is rare for government bodies to acknowledge their shortcomings, still less to apologise for them. So Ms Ros Hepplewhite, chief executive of the UK Child Support Agency, deserves credit for her candid apology for the agency's failure to provide an acceptable standard of service. Improving its performance, however, will require a more realistic approach by ministers to the job of making absent parents provide adequate maintenance for their children. The difficulties in establishing the agency have been seriously underestimated from the outset. The Child Support Act floated through Parliament in 1990 on the complacent assumption that it would concentrate on extracting maintenance from the feckless and the irresponsible. Instead, it has hit solid citizens, who have often made what they regard as adequate provision for their children. Their effective campaign against the agency has drowned out the case for greater support for single parents. That case remains strong. Seventy per cent of absent parents pay no maintenance to their children. Of those that do, the amount averages Pounds 25 a week. Most single parents live on social security, usually well below the standard of living enjoyed by the absent partner. It is the children who suffer the consequences, while the state pays the cost. Attempting to improve the position of single parents by making absent fathers pay more was bound to provoke protests. Treasury greed has made the task much harder, however. The agency was set performance targets that were excessively high for a new organisation involved in sensitive work. These included a requirement to make savings of Pounds 530m in the amount of social security paid to single parents. Aiming at this over-ambitious target forced the agency to concentrate on the easiest cases with the greatest scope for higher payments - fathers already paying maintenance. They have been among the most vociferous in campaigning against the agency. The legislation was also deficient in not providing an appeals procedure for aggrieved parents. And it overturned 'clean-break settlements' where the absent parent had settled property on the mother. These settlements often left social security to support the single parent and make the mortgage payments on the transferred home. But the retrospection involved in overturning clean-break settlements flies in the face of natural justice. Ministers appear to have accepted that their excessive ambition has damaged the agency. More realistic targets have been set for this year and extra resources provided. However, addressing issues such as retrospection and appeals would require further legislation. The government is to be commended for keeping its nerve on the central aims of the CSA; steering through the necessary legislation will be a still bigger task.</p>

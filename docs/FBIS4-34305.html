			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] While in Cartagena de Indias, where he attended the  Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Guatemalan President Ramiro de  Leon Carpio discussed the Central American governments' request  to U.S. President Bill Clinton that the U.S. Government  implement the benefits approved for Central America in the  framework of the Caribbean Basin Initiative [CBI].    [Begin De Leon recording] We addressed a note to him  expressing our concern regarding the agreements reached during  GATT's Uruguay Round on 15 April, whereby the U.S. Government  would apply a tariff on its beef imports. In our note, we  pointed out that this decision would have a negative effect on  economic reactivation and the consolidation of stability in our  countries. For this reason, we emphasized in our note that the  current concept of economic development and the United States'  new foreign policy in Central America emphasize trade more than  they do aid. We told President Clinton that, to be consistent  with this policy, CBI benefits should continue to cover all of  our beef exports without volume limitations, because, as we all  know, cattle raising in Latin America plays a very important  role in economic reactivation, job creation, and, of course,  exports. We expect a favorable answer to this request. [end  recording]</p>

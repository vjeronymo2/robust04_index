			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIDGET MICE CREATED IN STUDY OF HORMONE  </P> <P> A new strain of midget mice that are only half normal size has been developed  by Ohio University researchers who accomplished the feat by modifying the gene  for a growth hormone and inserting it into the animals, the scientists report  today.  </P> <P> The researchers say the technique should work for any animal, so it should be  possible to develop small rodents, pigs and other laboratory animals that would  require less space and food.  </P> <P> The new discovery may also lead to the development of smaller farm animals that  would use food more efficiently, and perhaps even to the development of new  drug treatments for human gigantism.  </P> <P> The Ohio research also represents "an important step" in understanding the  mechanisms by which cells are stimulated to grow, according to reproductive  biologist Neal L. First of the University of Wisconsin. "This is one piece in a  whole puzzle that is going to allow us to understand the growth hormone  exactly," First said.  </P> <P> Ohio molecular biologists John J. Kopchick and Wen Y. Chen were not trying to  make small mice, Kopchick said in an interview. Instead, they were trying to  produce unusually large mice.  </P> <P> They were building on work conducted in the early 1980s by researchers such as  Ralph Brinster of the University of Pennsylvania and Richard Palmiter of the  University of Washington.  </P> <P> Brinster and Palmiter found that they could produce mice that were twice normal  size by using genetic engineering techniques to insert a growth hormone from  cows, called bovine growth hormone or bGH, into the genes of mice. The extra  growth hormone produced by the mice stimulated their growth.  </P> <P> Kopchick and Chen hoped to make the mice grow even bigger by making three small  changes in the structure of bGH before inserting it into mouse embryos. They  thought the changes might make it a more powerful growth stimulant.  </P> <P> "Surprisingly, instead of enhancing growth rate, these mutations suppressed the  growth rate of the mouse," Kopchick said. "They are normal in every way except  size," he said. The researchers now have "over a dozen" different "founder"  mice, produced independently, that have been progenitors of strains of midget  mice. Some of the strains are now in the third generation.  </P> <P> The "most exciting scientific aspect" of the research, Kopchick said, is the  light it sheds on the growth process. Growth hormones normally bind to specific  sites on the surface of cells, called receptors, thereby stimulating a chemical  reaction within the cell that leads to growth.  </P> <P> The altered bGH produced by Kopchick and Chen also binds to that receptor.  Surprisingly, however, it does not stimulate growth; it simply sits in the  receptor. Because the altered bGH is occupying the receptors, normal mouse  growth hormone cannot bind and stimulate growth, so that mouse growth is  impaired.  </P> <P> By allowing researchers to separate the two functions of binding to cells and  stimulating growth, the altered hormone thus provides a valuable tool to  explore the actual chemical changes within the cell that lead to growth.  </P> <P> The Ohio researchers have not yet tried the altered hormone with any other  animals, but "I am confident it will work in all mammals," Kopchick said.  </P> <P> The work is published in today's edition of the Proceedings of the National  Academy of Sciences.  </P></p>

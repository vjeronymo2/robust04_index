			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORWALK ASKS U.S. FOR CLOSURE OF TANK FARM  </P> <P> The City Council has called for the closure of a Department of Defense facility  where millions of gallons of jet fuel are stored in the southern area of the  city. The council accused the government of moving too slowly to make the  facility earthquake-safe.  </P> <P> Council members also said a recent fuel leak and the discovery of contaminants  in a well on the site indicate the tank farm poses a serious threat to ground  water supplies.  </P> <P> The council on Tuesday unanimously approved a resolution calling on local and  federal legislators to press for the tank farm to be closed.  </P> <P> "They (the government) were supposed to do quite a few things and I haven't  seen them deliver on any of it," said Councilman Luigi A. Vernola, one of the  main opponents of the tank farm.  </P> <P> But a military spokesman said design work to make the facility earthquake-safe  already has begun. Construction is scheduled to begin in March, 1991, and be  completed 18 to 24 months later, said Lt. Col. Pharris D. Johnson, commander of  the Defense Department's seven-state Defense Fuel Region West. Johnson said the  legal requirements of government contracting prevent the $1.7-million project  from being completed sooner.  </P> <P> "We're going to accelerate it at every point we can, but this is the government  contracting process we have to work with," Johnson said. "Everything has to be  competitively bid."  </P> <P> The tank farm has 12 fuel storage tanks with a total capacity of 38 million  gallons. It supplies bases in California, Nevada and Arizona through a series  of government and private pipelines, and by truck, Johnson said.  </P> <P> The tank farm became a source of intense city concern last summer after results  of a seismic safety study were released. The study by Libby Engineers of San  Diego said a strong earthquake could cause the tanks to leak and electrical  connections to spark, which could trigger an explosion.  </P> <P> The Department of Defense pledged to make $1.7 million in improvements  suggested by the study.  </P> <P> The earthquake safety study added to the facility's recent problems. A 1987  study by another consultant discovered about 3,800 cubic yards of soil  contaminated with heavy fuel oil. Benzene, a cancer-causing agent, was  detected. Lead was detected 27 feet below the surface.  </P> <P> The report also said relatively high levels of benzene and another solvent were  detected in water samples drawn from a test well at a depth of about 40 feet.  </P> <P> But the study concluded that the contamination of ground water was not a threat  to the public because it was far above the aquifer from which the city draws  its water.  </P> <P> (The five water companies serving Norwalk draw their water from depths of 236  feet to 1,250 feet, according to a city report.)  </P> <P> The study noted that buried waste oil was discovered in 1985 in two areas in  the southeast section of the tank farm. The report also said two spills of  unknown amounts of jet fuel occurred in 1968 and 1969.  </P> <P> The Department of Defense has begun the second phase of its study, which  includes digging additional water-monitoring wells to determine the extent of  the contamination and how to best remedy the problem. The second phase is  scheduled to be completed in August, Johnson said.  </P> <P> There is evidence of additional contamination at the site. In December, fuel  was discovered in a previously clean monitoring well, according to a Defense  Department official. The water from the well is 22 to 30 feet below the  surface, more than 200 feet above the area from which Norwalk draws its ground  water, said W.E. Goode, environmental quality division chief.  </P> <P> Goode noted there was a fuel spill last September from a pipeline just west of  the monitoring well, but Johnson said the fuel from the spill has not yet been  identified as the source of contamination.  </P> <P> About 40 gallons of unleaded gasoline leaked from the pipeline, which is  privately operated by Southern Pacific Pipeline, Johnson said. The Defense  Department ties into private pipelines, which run through the facility.  </P> <P> Seven truckloads of contaminated soil were removed from the tank farm after the  September spill, Goode said.  </P> <P> The disclosure of that leak has heightened the fears of city officials, who  commissioned their own study on Norwalk's water system last May.  </P> <P> A preliminary report made public in November indicates some of Norwalk's  underground water is contaminated with tetrachloroethane and trichloroethane,  two industrial solvents that are suspected of causing cancer.  </P> <P> Since 1982, three wells have been closed in Norwalk because of ground water  contamination. Several sites, including the tank farm, are being investigated  as possible sources of contamination.  </P> <P> The resolution approved Tuesday night was the strongest official action taken  against the tank farm to date. Some residents have opposed the tank farm for  years.  </P> <P> Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) also may be reconsidering his position on  the tank farm.  </P> <P> Torres, who previously supported continued operation of the farm for national  security reasons, plans to ask the Defense Department to study whether the tank  farm would still be needed in light of the planned closure of various military  bases, according to an aide.  </P> <P> Aide Lupe de la Cruz, who attended Tuesday night's meeting, said the  congressman thinks the Defense Department is moving ahead as quickly as  possible on the earthquake safety improvements. But she said the congressman is  concerned about the new evidence of soil and ground water contamination at the  site.  </P> <P> But Johnson said only two of the 15 bases served by the tank farm are  definitely slated for closure.  </P> <P> "The fact that those bases are closing would not eliminate the need to those  that are remaining open," Johnson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The tank farm that is now owned by the U.S. Department of Defense was built by  a private firm in the 1920s on the southeast corner of Norwalk Boulevard and  Excelsior Drive. The U.S. Air Force acquired the depot in 1951. The tank farm  was once isolated. But in the years since, housing developments have sprung up  around it. The heavily used Holifield Park is adjacent to the tank farm.  </P></p>

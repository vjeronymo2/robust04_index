Chichko, Department of Children's Diseases </F> No. 1 at the Minsk Medical Institute and Children's Clinical  Hospital No. 2; UDC 616.61-002.3-053.2:612.13:614.73]    [Abstract] The hemodynamics of 108 children aged 6-14 (87  boys and 21 girls) with acute and chronic pyelonephritis--the  most frequent urinary system disease in children with a tendency  toward persistent relapses whose principal pathogenetic  mechanisms are related to infection, chronic intoxication, and  other factors aggravated by the unfavorable consequences of the  Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident--including 76 kids from  the regions contaminated with radionuclides are examined. In  particular, the characteristic features of hemodynamics in  children permanently residing in the contaminated rayons of  Gomel and Mogilev oblasts are investigated. Tentative data on  the radiation burden were based on the information about the  radionuclide contamination of the territory obtained by the  sanitary-epidemiological station, _g_-background indicators,  and  the results of medical examinations. A higher incidence of  hypotension in children living in the regions with a  considerable level of contamination with a predominance of  hyperkinetic hemodynamics are recorded, especially at  considerable [.sup]137[/]Cs contamination levels of 5-15  Ci/km[.sup]2[/], and a higher incidence of  hypersympathicotonia and sympathicotonia are identified. A  hemodynamics analysis reveals no statistically significant  differences in the arterial pressure indicators in the groups  under study but a significant increase in the volumetric rate  indicators of blood expulsion by the left ventricle and cardiac  index in children with the disease vs. healthy kids. Yet thee  indicators turned out to have no statistical correlation with  the contamination level. The findings indicate a considerable  disruption of vegetative regulatory activity of the  cardiovascular system. Figures 1; tables 1; references 5.</p>

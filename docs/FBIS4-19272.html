			<p>BFN     [Text] Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue, left Cyprus empty-handed this  morning. Lamb had a lengthy meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader  Rauf Denktas yesterday.    In a statement to reporters afterward, Lamb said that  Denktas  still has problems with the informal UN document of 21 March.  Pressured by reporters, the U.S. diplomat said his meetings in  the occupied area reached no conclusion, adding that he is  neither a negotiator nor did he bring any new proposals.</p>

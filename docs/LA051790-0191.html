			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> ALBACORE ON THE MOVE, TUNA ACTION LOOKS GOOD  </P> <P> This could be the start of a record-breaking sportfishing year. Migrating  albacore were discovered 100 miles from Point Loma last week, possibly  indicating the start of an early summer run.  </P> <P> Anglers are waiting to see if this school of fish could be the one that  wintered at Guadalupe Island and has started its migration northward early.  </P> <P> L.A. Harbor Sportfishing's Shogun was on a five-day trip to San Benitos in  Mexico fishing yellowtail when Capt. Norm Kagaw received word of the albacore.  Anglers set the jigs out and Kagaw said 50 fish were caught with the average  weight of six to 15 pounds. Kagaw said conditions look perfect for a good  summer of tuna fishing.  </P> <P> The Shogun returned Friday with 359 yellowtail and 103 albacore. Jackpot  winners were Rancho Palos Verdes fishermen Jim Hammand with his 21 3/4-pound  yellowtail and Dean Zuchi of Torrance, who caught a 20 1/4-pound fish.  </P> <P> The King Harbor Marlin Club's annual marlin tag-and-release trip to Rancho  Buena Vista in Baja was a huge success.  </P> <P> Over 65 marlin were tagged and released during the three days of fishing. Club  member Clyde Rainwater said that after the tagging was completed, the group  fished for rooster fish, yellow-fin tuna, and cabrilla. The trip's jackpot was  awarded to Wolfgang Nachsel with a 196-pound marlin.  </P> <P> The Cabrillo Marine Museum will hold its annual Catalina marine observation  trip Saturday aboard the Shogun. Staff divers will bring up marine life for  deck observations and study. The highlight of the trip again will be shark  baiting in an attempt to lure them for close-up observation.  </P> <P> Departure time at L.A. Harbor Sportfishing is set for 6 a.m. The group will  return at 6 p.m. Information: Larry Fukuhara at (213) 548-7563.  </P> <P> Seymor Burtin of Long Beach, fishing off Catalina aboard the Toronado, caught  the big fish of the week, a 52-pound white sea bass.

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: Tapie to take finance group private MR BERNARD Tapie, the controversial French businessman and politician, has ended months of uncertainty over the future of Bernard Tapie Finance, his holding company, by returning the group to private status this autumn. The decision to withdraw from the stock market marks a watershed in the fortunes of BTF and in the rags-to-riches story of Mr Tapie, who earlier this summer was forced to resign after a seven-week stint in the French cabinet because of his involvement in a fraud case. BTF emerged in the 1980s as one of France's fastest growing companies during an acquisition spree in which Mr Tapie, who comes from a working class family, bought a series of bankrupt businesses. Two years ago, Mr Tapie pulled off the coup of his corporate career in the acquisition for FFr1.6bn (Dollars 323m) of Adidas, the German company which is one of the world's best known sporting goods groups. However, BTF struggled under the debts amassed in the Adidas deal. It was forced to sell off minority stakes in Adidas and almost all its original businesses. Last month it sold its remaining 58 per cent stake in Adidas' parent company to Pentland Industries, the UK consumer products company, for FFr1.64bn. The disposals have left Mr Tapie with a cash surplus of FFr900m which will be used to reconstruct BTF. The only industrial interests left within BTF are Testut-Teraillon, a weighing machine manufacturer, and Sciame, a small industrial concern. It is now in the final stages of negotiating to sell both companies and expects to complete the disposals this year. BTF, capitalised at about FFr900m on its suspended share price of FFr130, has begun the process of returning to private status. It plans to withdraw its quotation on France's secondary stock market on November 7, the day the Adidas deal is due for completion. The company said yesterday that an offer will be made to buy back the shares still in public issue. These account for less than 5 per cent of the total. The offer will be based on an external valuation of BTF's net asset value which is expected to be completed next month. Once BTF has returned to private status, Mr Tapie plans to reinvest his FFr900m. However, this time he is expected to look for investment opportunities in the financial and service sectors.</p>

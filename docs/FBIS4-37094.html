			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, AL-ANWAR--Arab diplomatic sources close to  the Palestinian-U.S. meetings--Yasir 'Arafat's meetings with  Robert Pelletreau, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Middle  Eastern affairs, last month and with U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia  John McCarthy the day before yesterday--disclosed that 'Arafat  raised several issues with Pelletreau and again with Ambassador  McCarthy.    Those issues include the slowdown in the receipt of funds  necessary to run the self-rule mechanism and the fate of the  Palestinian residents in Lebanon and Syria, since they are not  allowed to return under the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which closes  the door to the return of the refugees from 1948. Most  Palestinians residing in Syria and Lebanon are refugees from  1948.    According to close diplomatic sources, 'Arafat expressed a  wish for the Palestinians in Lebanon to be granted citizenship  and permanent resettlement there. 'Arafat said to Pelletreau:  Do you have any other option? The U.S. official was silent  before saying: "It is a proposal worthy of consideration."</p>

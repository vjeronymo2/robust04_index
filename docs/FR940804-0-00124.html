			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> United States Attorneys' Manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the promulgation of the rules discussed above, the Department intends to add several new provisions to the United States Attorneys' Manual to provide additional guidance to Department attorneys when they deal with represented individuals during criminal or civil law enforcement investigations and proceedings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has deliberately chosen to include certain baseline restrictions in the regulation and impose broader restrictions through provisions in the Manual. In the process of determining what the appropriate Departmental policy should be, it became clear that any regulation would have to apply to a variety of circumstances, including: white collar and organized crime investigations, complex conspiracy investigations, individuals whose counsel are paid by a third party, and individuals fearful of their counsel for various reasons. Accordingly, the Department determined that the regulation should be broad in scope and should provide unambiguous guidance that would not adversely affect federal law enforcement efforts. Thus, part 77 distinguishes between the investigative period (before indictment, arrest, or the filing of a complaint) and the prosecutive period (after arrest or the commencement of formal proceedings). It also distinguishes between communications that are part of a factual investigation and communications that occur during negotiations of plea agreements, settlements, and similar legal arrangements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The planned Manual provisions will require that government attorneys consider the principles underlying the basic prohibitions in a much wider variety of circumstances. The Department expects all Department attorneys involved in criminal or civil law enforcement proceedings to adhere to all applicable provisions in the Manual. Failure to do so will result in appropriate departmental action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The planned changes to the Manual were included in the earlier publications simply for reference and were not subject to the requirements of notice and comment that applied to the provisions in the proposed regulation itself. The Department nonetheless received several comments regarding the draft Manual provisions. The Department has carefully considered those comments and has decided that it is appropriate (though not required) to respond to them briefly in this commentary. However, none of the comments received has prompted the Department to conclude that it should alter the planned Manual provisions. The Department anticipates that the Manual provisions will be substantially similar to the draft published in March 1994. The Department envisions publishing the Manual provisions soon and integrating them in the Manual with the final rules adopted here.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were directed mainly to a draft Manual provision that would prohibit a government attorney from communicating overtly about the subject matter of a representation with a person who the government attorney knows is a ``target'' of a federal criminal or civil enforcement investigation and who the government attorney knows is represented by counsel, without the consent of the target's attorney. (The provisions, as published in March 1994, would also provide several exceptions to this general prohibition against overt contacts with targets, including the following: when the communication is initiated by the target; when the communication occurs at the time of arrest and the represented person has waived his or her  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Miranda <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  rights; when the government attorney believes the contact is necessary to protect against a risk to human life or safety; or when a senior Department official determines that exigent circumstances exist, making the communication necessary for effective law enforcement).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two United States Attorney's Offices urged reconsideration of the guideline generally prohibiting Department attorneys from directly communicating with known ``targets.'' These commenters expressed a number of concerns about the ``target'' provision_most significantly, that the determination of ``target'' status would be subjective and variable and that the proposed limitation on overt contacts with represented targets would interfere with the investigative process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department does not agree that the term ``target'' would make application of this planned restriction particularly troublesome. While determinations of ``target'' status surely are not scientifically precise, neither are a range of other similar determinations (e.g., ``probable cause'' determinations) that prosecutors are expected routinely to make. In its enforcement of the planned provision, the Department intends to give substantial deference to a federal attorney's good faith judgment regarding the likelihood that a particular person will ultimately become a defendant. Even if the attorney for the government believes that an individual probably will be named as a defendant, that individual would not be considered a target until the government has actually obtained substantial evidence linking that individual to the commission of a crime or to unlawful conduct. The government attorney's uncorroborated belief that an individual will ultimately be named as a defendant would not be enough. Thus, an individual will not be considered a target under the Manual guidelines until both the attorney for the government believes that he or she will probably be named as a defendant  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  substantial evidence has been obtained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also does not believe that the contemplated restriction on overt communications with represented targets would significantly impede legitimate law enforcement activities. It is true that in certain types of cases and under certain exceptional circumstances, target interviews may be necessary for effective investigation; for that reason, the planned Manual provisions would allow that in such situations target interviews may be approved by a high-ranking Department official. However, as a general matter and in more routine circumstances, overt communications with targets have a more limited value to the investigative process, which is outweighed by the risk that they will interfere with the attorney-client relationship and place undue pressure on the target. Because an individual who is a target of a federal investigation is typically in a clearly adversarial relationship with the federal government, the Department believes that the principles underlying DR 7&hyph;104 and Rule 4.2 are implicated and that the planned restrictions on overt communications with represented targets are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Certifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order No. 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 77  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Government employees, Investigations, Law enforcement, Lawyers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

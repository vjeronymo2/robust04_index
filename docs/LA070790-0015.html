			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> KAY WILSON WON'T RUN FOR REELECTION  </P> <P> Citing a desire to return to volunteer work, Santa Paula Mayor Kay Wilson has  announced she will not seek reelection to a second four-year term on the City  Council.  </P> <P> Wilson, a local real estate agent, also said she once made a promise to herself  not to return to public office after her term ends.  </P> <P> "I think it's necessary to get new blood on the council," she said. "I liked  what my new energy brought to the council 4 1/2 years ago, and I want to make  room for somebody else to do the same."  </P> <P> Before announcing her decision Friday not to pursue a second term, Wilson said  she talked to several potential candidates whom she might consider supporting,  but declined to identify them.  </P> <P> Two people have already announced their candidacy for three seats on the  council. John Melton, a 16-year veteran of the council, said he will run.  Robert Berrego, an aide to state Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara) and a  member of the Planning Commission, has also said he will seek a seat.  </P> <P> Councilman Carl Barringer, who has served for eight years, has said he is still  unsure of his plans.  </P> <P> The filing period for the three races begins July 16 and ends Aug. 10, Deputy  City Clerk Liz Ruiz said. Incumbents have until Aug. 15 to file, she said.  </P> <P> Wilson, who was appointed last April to a one-year term as mayor, said she  dislikes the political maneuvering that often takes place in government. She  said she wants to leave public office before becoming tempted to make decisions  simply to please the largest number of constituents.  </P> <P> "I don't like politicians who hold public office and vote in manners that make  sure they are reelected the next time around," said Wilson, who cited a pending  council vote on whether to retain an ordinance that limits rent increases at  mobile home parks when mobile homes are sold.  </P> <P> Although a vote on the matter has not yet been scheduled, Wilson said she might  be tempted to keep the ordinance if she remained a council member, to ensure  support from mobile home residents.  </P> <P> "If I was running for reelection I might be tempted to vote for the interests  of one group of people," she said.  </P> <P> Wilson has rejoined the board of the Boys and Girls Club and said she plans to  become more active in her church, the United Way and the Musical Arts Council.  </P> <P> "You name it, and Kay Wilson will probably be ready to help," she said.

			<p><P> March 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HART GIRLS LOCK UP 5-A TITLE WITH ROUT OF SANTA BARBARA  </P> <P> Had there been a fat lady at Cal Poly Pomona on Friday night the singing would  have commenced early and lasted throughout the evening.  </P> <P> The singing -- and quite likely the subsequent celebrating -- in fact, did.  </P> <P> The crescendo was Hart High's 63-49 rout of Santa Barbara in the Southern  Section 5-A Division championship game.  </P> <P> Hart's fans, who packed one-quarter of the spacious gym, began chanting early  and were singing, "Hey, hey, goodby" in the fourth quarter although several  minutes remained.  </P> <P> Their mirth was warranted. The title is Hart's first since the program's  inception in 1972.  </P> <P> "It hasn't sunk in yet," said Coach Pam Walker, who guided the Indians (25-2)  to their first Foothill League championship and 15 consecutive wins to finish  the season. "I don't think it's hit any of us. When we wake up tomorrow,  everyone will have a smile on their face . . . if we ever go to bed tonight."  </P> <P> The Indians, seeded No. 2, put Santa Barbara to bed early, leaping to a 7-1  lead and steadily increasing it.  </P> <P> Hart led, 22-11, after one quarter and, 38-22, at halftime.  </P> <P> A balanced attack, Hart's hallmark this season, checked a 25-point effort by  Santa Barbara guard Faha Banks, a former summer player for Walker.  </P> <P> Junior forward Sara Wilson, Hart's leading scorer, had 18 points to lead the  Indians. Guards Desa Pecel added 15 points -- nine in the fourth quarter -- and  Kim Posey had 12.  </P> <P> "Play like a team, win like a team," Walker said. "Everybody shined. It's the  best way to win a title."  </P> <P> Only four players scored for Santa Barbara (21-8). In the fourth quarter, which  began and ended with Hart ahead by 14, Banks (eight points) and fellow guard  Nicole Barr (six) accounted for all of the Dons' points.  </P> <P> "Coach told us before the game that Faha was the key factor," said Pecel, who  drilled four long-distance jump shots. "We held her."  </P> <P> Santa Barbara launched only two minor threats, the first in the third quarter  when Kristin Knapp, a 6-foot-3 junior center who finished with 15 points, made  a jump shot and Banks made a layup and a jump shot to cut Hart's lead to 44-33.  Hart closed the period with a 5-2 run, however.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Banks made a steal and a layup with 2:48 to play to cut  the Indians' lead to 57-47 -- their smallest since 19-11.  </P> <P> Hart, however, then took the only timeout it required in the game.  </P> <P> "We try to play like we're 10 points down all the time," Walker said. "It  didn't seem like it came easily. I don't think anyone was looking at the  scoreboard. I know I wasn't."  </P> <P> Hart emerged from the timeout and Pecel made a baseline jump shot. Wilson  followed with two free throws to give the Indians a 61-47 advantage.  </P> <P> With 12 seconds to play, Hart's entire grandstand entourage was delivering a  standing ovation.  </P> <P> Roses from well-wishers seasoned the postgame celebration.  </P> <P> "It seems like I say the same thing after every game," Wilson said. "But I just  can't explain this feeling. I can't put it into words."  </P> <P> Walker, who is in her fourth season at Hart, had an easier time.  </P> <P> "That you can set a goal and get beyond the obstacles to achieve it is a great  feeling," she said. "It kind of makes you believe in the American Dream."  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> DOW INDEX FALLS 19.67 AS BANKS SNUB RATE CUT  </P> <P> The stock market fell sharply Thursday on profit taking and disappointment that  major banks did not move to lower their prime lending rates.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.67 points to close at 2,603.69,  erasing more than two-thirds of the market's 26.23-point rise on Wednesday in a  broad rally.  </P> <P> In the broader market, declining issues led advancers, with 809 issues down and  648 up in price. Big Board volume was a moderate 143.4 million shares, down  sharply from 170.2 million shares Wednesday.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the market surged after a trend-setting Missouri bank lowered a  key lending rate, following signs that the Federal Reserve is sending interest  rates lower.  </P> <P> Lower interest rates stimulate the economy and make stocks relatively more  attractive compared to fixed-income investments such as bonds.  </P> <P> Economists said they expect other banks to follow Southwest Bank of St. Louis,  which cut its prime lending rate to 10% from 10.5% on Wednesday. But no major  banks announced cuts Thursday in their prime rates, which are tied to many  consumer loans.  </P> <P> And the Federal Reserve gave no further signs Thursday of easing its monetary  policy.  </P> <P> "The reason (for the decline in stocks) is that we are supposed to be waiting  for major money centers to lower their prime rate, but this afternoon's drop is  more severe than that," said Trude Latimer at Josepthal &amp; Co.  </P> <P> Analysts also said the market fell on concerns about the economy, underscored  by a higher-than-expected rise in the producer price index, which measures  inflation at the wholesale level.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said Thursday that wholesale prices rose 0.4% in October,  while analysts had expected a 0.2% rise.  </P> <P> After news of the rise in the producer price index, the market opened lower and  continued a narrow decline through the day.  </P> <P> Profit taking later depressed prices further, with nearly half of the day's  losses coming in the final hour of trading.  </P> <P> Corporate earnings influenced some stocks. Disney rose 1 5/8 to 124 1/2 in  moderate trading after reporting earnings that analysts said were on the high  end of their estimates.  </P> <P> Consolidated Freightways slid 2 3/4 to 27 5/8 after it said it may report a  loss for the fourth quarter while Weyerhaeuser slipped 5/8 to 25 5/8 after the  company told analysts Wednesday that its operating earnings for the fourth  quarter would be lower than third-quarter profit.  </P> <P> Among technology stocks, Wang dropped 1/8 to 5 1/4 after it said it would  eliminate about 2,000 jobs by Jan. 1, 1990. IBM rose 5/8 to 97 3/8, while  Hewlett-Packard added 1/2 to 42 7/8, and Compaq Computer slipped 1 3/8 to 91  3/8.  </P> <P> Philip Morris closed unchanged at 41 5/8 in active trading. The company said it  was selling its 29% interest in Rothmans International to a Swiss company for  $860 million.  </P> <P> Investors took aim at steel issues in late trading Thursday on the Tokyo Stock  Exchange, propelling the key market barometer to its second straight rise in  moderate trading. The Nikkei 225-share index closed up 61.83 points to  35,657.42.  </P> <P> Share prices finished lower on London's stock exchange as prices retreated in  the afternoon. The Financial Times 100-share index fell 2.1 points to 2,201.7.  </P> <P> Credit  </P> <P> Bond prices finished slightly lower in moderate trading.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond slipped 1/8 point, or $1.25 for  every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, advanced  to 7.89% from 7.87% late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Analysts said bond prices were tipped lower by traders' disappointment in  Thursday's auction by the Treasury of $10 billion in three-year notes and by  the Federal Reserve's action in draining some reserves from the market.  </P> <P> The average yield of the notes at auction was 7.77%, down from 7.93% at the  last comparable auction on Aug. 8.  </P> <P> Although the yield was the lowest since early 1988, "It was a mild  disappointment," said William Sullivan, director of money-market research at  Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted late in the day at 8.375%, unchanged from late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Currency  </P> <P> The dollar rose against most major currencies except the Japanese yen and  Canadian dollar.  </P> <P> Gold prices fell. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid for gold at 4  p.m. EST of $386.30 an ounce, down from $387.50 late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Dealers said the dollar had little reaction to a larger-than-expected 0.4% rise  in U.S. wholesale prices in October.  </P> <P> "You saw most of the market react rather subdued to the PPI report," said David  Ethridge, vice president of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.  "It wasn't a shock."  </P> <P> Currency traders said the dollar remained strong despite the market's  perception that the Federal Reserve is relaxing its credit policy, which likely  would encourage lower interest rates. Falling interest rates usually depress  the dollar's value.  </P> <P> The key factor was selling between other currencies that pushed down the dollar  compared to the Japanese yen, said Keith Raphael, an assistant vice president  at Bank Brussels Lambert in New York.  </P> <P> He said the yen rose against the West German mark and also gained ground  against the dollar in the morning. The selloff ran out of steam when the dollar  hit 142.25 yen and traders bought dollars in an afternoon rally, traders said.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 142.70 Japanese yen, down 0.27 yen from  Wednesday's close. Later in London, the dollar rose to 142.85 yen. In New York,  the dollar closed at 143.13, down from 143.18 late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Raphael said the dollar rose against the British pound because the Bank of  England expressed concern that pressure to increase wages could lead to a  recession.  </P> <P> In London, the British pound edged up to $1.5863 from $1.5860 late Wednesday.  Later in New York, the pound fetched $1.5823, less than $1.5885 late Wednesday.  </P> <P> Commodities  </P> <P> Copper prices continued their surge on New York's Commodity Exchange amid  investors' concerns over labor conditions in Chile.  </P> <P> On other markets, grain was mostly lower and soybeans higher; energy and sugar  futures were higher; gold was off while silver gained, and livestock and pork  futures were mixed.  </P> <P> Copper settled 0.70 cent to 1.35 cents higher, with the contract for delivery  in November at $1.1640 a pound.  </P> <P> Miners at Chile's four largest mines have voted to strike if the government  adopts a law that would reorganize state-owned Chile Copper Corp. The proposal  would give members of the military government power over mine operations after  the government leaves office and would reduce the power of unions.  </P> <P> Helping to boost prices was the perception the metal had been oversold in  recent weeks because of settlement of labor disputes in Canada and Mexico, said  analyst Don Tierney of Stanley Bell &amp; Co. in New York.  </P> <P> Expectations that Monday's report on stocks in London Metal Exchange-approved  warehouses will show a decline also helped prices, as did prospects that  interest rates are going down, which would increase demand, Tierney said.  </P> <P> Grain futures were mostly lower and soybeans were higher in quiet trading on  the Chicago Board of Trade.  </P> <P> Trading in corn and soybeans was subdued as investors awaited the release of  the U.S. Department of Agriculture's latest crop report.  </P> <P> The report, released after the close of trading, estimated the 1989 corn  harvest at 7.59 billion bushels, up 54% from last year's drought-shriveled  crop. The estimate was up 2% from prospects a month ago when the department  estimated this year's production at 7.45 billion bushels.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D6  </P></p>

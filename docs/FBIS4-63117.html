			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Ilyushin, chief adviser of Russian </F> President Boris Yeltsin, by Jochen Piest and Matthias Schepp;  place and date not given: "Germany is Our Closest Partner"]    [Text] [STERN] What does Boris Yeltsin want to achieve in  Bonn?    [Ilyushin] Even now, Germany is our closest partner. As a  result of such a visit, the relations will become even more  intensive and even more friendly.    [STERN] However, the relations are not completely unclouded.  There is a controversy between you and the FRG Government over  the farewell for the Russian troops in eastern Germany. Russia  wants a joint parade with the Allies, while the West is against  it.    [Ilyushin] Kohl and Yeltsin will find a dignified form.    [STERN] Kohl and the West do not know either whether Russia  will accede to the NATO program, "Partnership for Peace," like  other former Eastern Bloc states.    [Ilyushin] Proceed on the assumption that Russia's position  is determined by its president. Controversies in the Cabinet  are natural. This is democracy.    [STERN] Will Russia accede to it?    [Ilyushin] Russia will sign it. However, in the dialogue  with NATO, Russia's place and role indeed have to be clarified.  It is a mistake not to reckon with Russia in world politics.  This is shown by Yugoslavia's example.    [STERN] Rumors that President Yeltsin is fatally ill and  that the West might lose its guarantor of a predictable Russian  foreign policy continue to be heard.    [STERN] I work with him every day -- for 12, 14 hours and  more. A sick man would not be able to keep this up.</p>

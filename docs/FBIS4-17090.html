			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia's Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev has called  for Russia, the UN, the European Union, and other parties acting  to resolve the crisis in Yugoslavia to coordinate a single stand  on Bosnia. He expressed this position in Moscow on Wednesday at  the end of his meeting with the Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Peace  Conference on Former Yugoslavia Lord Owen and Thorvald  Stoltenberg. As Kozyrev said, "among the Bosnian Serbs there is  a party of war, waiting for fresh air strikes to continue the  war. It's people from this party who have been shelling  hospitals and other civilian targets in Gorazde."    However, in the interests of all the Serbs the war must be  stopped on fair terms and the lifting of sanctions should be  gradually pressed for, Kozyrev said. These interests of the  Serbs and of the other conflicting sides should be given a real  chance, he stressed. In his words, at Wednesday's session of  Russia's Security Council the Bosnian problem was discussed in  the same key and on the basis of the statement made by President  Yeltsin on Tuesday. We will do whatever we can to stop the  bloodshed in Gorazde, introduce disengagement troops and put an  end to the confrontation there. Kozyrev disclosed that in a  telephone conversation with the American Secretary of State  Warren Christopher he had asked him to send to Moscow the US  President's Special Envoy on Former Yugoslavia Charles Redman,  whose expertise, as Kozyrev put it, is as essential as that of  Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg.    Regrettably, Christopher declined to give a clear-cut  answer.  So, the door remains open, Kozyrev said.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON AGING: RETIREES CAN HELP END TEACHER SHORTAGE  </P> <P> Is there a teacher shortage? If you're talking to the National Education Assn.,  Carnegie Foundation or Rand Corp., the answer is yes. But the National Center  for Education Information, Department of Education and Bureau of Labor  Statistics say no.  </P> <P> Both sides agree that the profession has been helped by recent reforms,  including better pay and more decision-making power in the classroom. The Labor  Department contends that these changes, along with "normal market adjustments,"  should prevent shortages and may even let schools be more selective in hiring.  </P> <P> But suppose the demand for teachers does not exceed supply? One solution would  be President Bush's program to encourage "alternative certification" that would  "allow talented Americans from every field to teach in America's classrooms." A  largely untapped pool of potential teachers being eyed are those retiring from  business, industry and the military, and homemakers.  </P> <P> Given that people are living longer and many seek early retirement, launching a  second career is feasible.  </P> <P> How could this potential be tapped? A state, for example, in partnership with  local companies, could launch a recruitment campaign aimed at private-sector  employees, military personnel and homemakers. Recruits would receive 90 days of  intensive teacher training at a state university, followed by a semester of  assistant teaching under an experienced mentor.  </P> <P> For recruits coming from early retirement in the private sector, employers  could be encouraged to pay part of the teaching salaries, a subsidy made  possible by lower pensions provided to early retirees.  </P> <P> Corporations such as Polaroid, Digital and IBM have been experimenting with  creating teaching paths for early retirees, and 23 states are experimenting  with alternative-certification paths.  </P> <P> Question: Recently, my 72-year-old father and I got into an argument when I  told him I planned to mortgage my house to remodel the kitchen. He claims I'm  being irresponsible by assuming so much debt. Are these generational  differences common?  </P> <P> Answer: Your experience illustrates what one researcher contends many overlook:  that money means more than dollars and cents. Says Francis Lomas Feldman of  USC: "Money has special economic and social" connotations that usually reflect  back on "something that happened earlier in the person's life."  </P> <P> For many Americans age 65 and older, that "something" was the Great Depression.  These survivors may be "very careful about money because they remember how  important it was (in the 1930s) to save for a rainy day," Feldman notes.  </P> <P> Such conservative habits may place Depression babies at odds with baby boomers,  who grew up in a more prosperous, consumption-oriented society. In recent  years, the boomers' spending rate has jumped 15% despite evidence that their  real income has dropped.  </P> <P> Older people may feel uneasy about such spending patterns. Moreover, many view  costly contemporary products and goods as extravagances.  </P> <P> For their part, younger adults may fail to recognize that attitudes toward  money form early in life and are not easily relinquished. Also, they may not  appreciate that money and control over it often heightens a person's sense of  autonomy in the face of physical and social losses that accompany age.  </P> <P> Q: I am writing you in desperation. My 45-year-old sister was recently  diagnosed as having diabetes. Somehow, the idea of the illness is driving her  wild. She's contemplating going to Brazil for some type of cure and is also  considering using bee secretions and juniper berries, largely ignoring  conventional medical advice. How can I help her?  </P> <P> A: It is unfortunate that your sister is having such a difficult time accepting  her illness and is not working with qualified medical personnel to manager her  diabetes. Diabetes, a condition in which an individual's body is unable to  convert sugars and starches into usable energy, is incurable. But with  appropriate medical treatment, it can be managed and the diabetic can resume a  normal life.  </P> <P> Diet, exercise and either insulin injections or medications taken by mouth are  the main approaches to treatment of diabetes. Most patients whose diabetes  starts in their 40s or later can maintain a near-normal blood-sugar level  without insulin injections. Those who ignore medical advice about diabetes risk  their lives and jeopardize their health.  </P> <P> Unfortunately, your sister is not alone in her quest for an instant cure. A  study by the Department of Health and Human Services found that 25% of adults,  many of them older adults, don't believe traditional medicine offers the most  effective treatment for serious diseases.  </P></p>

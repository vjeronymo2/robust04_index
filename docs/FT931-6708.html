			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Defining earnings I RECEIVE invalidity benefit. I have a wife who is self-employed. National Insurance directive 16A states that I can claim an extra Pounds 32 per week provided her earnings are less than Pounds 43 per week. She also has investment income. Does the rule really relate to earnings or to her total income? The leaflet means what it says: 'earnings' does not include income from investments. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

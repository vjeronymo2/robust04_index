			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CHENEY SEEKS EXPLANATION OF BOMBING ERROR IN PANAMA  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has asked the Air Force to explain why it  incorrectly told him that both 2,000-pound bombs dropped on Panama by F-117A  Stealth fighters had hit their targets, the Pentagon said today.  </P> <P> Cheney learned that one of the two bombs dropped in the Dec. 20 invasion fell  "way off target" only after making inquiries to the Air Force based on a  reporter's photographs of the bomb craters, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams  said.  </P> <P> "I think the secretary was initially told (by the Air Force) in a good-faith  manner that both bombs had hit their targets," Williams said when asked at the  Pentagon briefing whether the Air Force had deliberately lied to Cheney.  </P> <P> "I don't believe there was any -- as far as I can tell -- any intent to mislead  the secretary," Williams said.  </P> <P> Immediately after the U.S. invasion, Cheney had defended the use of the  high-technology F-117As Stealth fighters in the attack, saying the pinpoint  bombing accuracy of the $106-million planes probably saved both American and  Panamanian lives.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AILING WARD LEADS TITANS PAST BUTLER  </P> <P> Agee Ward, bruised thigh and all, gave Cal State Fullerton a shot in the arm  Saturday night, scoring 25 points and grabbing 12 rebounds to lead the Titans  to a 79-76 victory over Butler before 1,201 in Titan Gym.  </P> <P> Ward, a 6-foot-5 junior who started the Titans' season opener against Lamar,  has come off the bench the last two games since being injured.  </P> <P> Ward gave Fullerton 23 strong minutes, converting four offensive rebounds into  baskets and scoring 16 of his points in the first half.  </P> <P> Center Aaron Wilhite added 12 points and forward Ron Caldwell had 10 to  complement an inside game that carried the Titans on a night their outside game  went cold.  </P> <P> Fullerton guard Joe Small made his first shot early in the game but finished  three for 16, including one of six from three-point range.  </P> <P> "No player is going to have a good game every night -- that's why it's a team  game," Titan Coach John Sneed said. "Someone else has to step in, like Agee."  </P> <P> It seemed as if no Titan was a threat in the final six minutes, when Fullerton  blew an 11-point lead. The Bulldogs scored 11 consecutive points, nine by  forward Darin Archbold, to make the score 72-72 with 2:45 left. Archbold  finished with 31 points.  </P> <P> Fullerton caved in against Butler's full-court press, turning the ball over  three times during Butler's run. Wilhite finally broke the spell with two free  throws at the 2:10 mark, and Small made a jumper and two free throws to keep  Fullerton ahead in the final 1:28.  </P> <P> Bruce Bowen blocked Jermaine Guice's three-pointer as the game ended to secure  the victory.  </P></p>

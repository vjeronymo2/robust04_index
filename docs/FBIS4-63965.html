			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Boris Sitnikov] </F>   [Text] United Nations, 25 May -- Ukraine is calling upon  the United Nations to support its possible actions in Crimea "to  ensure unconditionally the territorial integrity of the state."  Thus runs a letter from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy  Zlenko to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali which was  distributed today as a General Assembly and Security Council  document.    "On 20 May 1994, the Supreme Rada of the Republic of Crimea  adopted a decision on re-enforcing the constitution of the  Republic of Crimea of 6 May 1992. This act is aimed at changing  the legal status of the autonomous republic as a component part  of Ukraine," it indicates the document points out. Having  described these actions by the Crimean parliament as "a  violation of the Constitution of Ukraine," A. Zlenko stated that  "a threat is thereby being created to peace and stability in the  region and in Europe as a whole."    The minister expressed the hope that "the UN secretary  general will personally show understanding and support" for the  actions of the government of Ukraine in "averting the possible  negative consequences of the anti-constitutional decision  adopted by the Supreme Rada of Crimea." In the event of a  deterioration in the situation, Ukraine reserves the right to  take all the necessary measures to provide for the territorial  integrity of the state, the document stresses.</p>

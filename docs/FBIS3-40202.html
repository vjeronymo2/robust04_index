Opinions on the subject vary. Some people are satisfied:  This  year everything else is going up, but household-use electricity  prices are steady. The price of household electric power in the  Beijing region is 0.164 yuan per kilowatt-hour (including a  municipal public service fee of 0.14 yuan which goes into local  revenues). This was the price in 1958 and this was the price in  the first half of this year.    Some people complain that state-set electricity prices are  too low, and that there is an urgent need to raise them. Some  people are angry: "Going up again? It's costing us about a yuan  per kilowatt-hour already. Is there any rhyme or reason to it?"    Some people sound a warning note: "There's already a lot of  pressure to raise everything, so they shouldn't be in any hurry  to raise electricity prices."    Some people are impatient: "I'm not in the mood to talk  about  the price of electricity: what I'm concerned with is the power  shortage. The power's just on and off here. Why doesn't the  state put a little more effort into it?"    Everybody thinks that he is right. In the past few years,  the  reform of the price of electricity has made some progress and  has taken a few steps. The program for more thorough reform of  electricity prices that was issued this July resulted in a rise  in household electricity prices, which had been steady for  several decades. It, too, brought forth a chorus of differing  opinions. Just what are we to think about electricity prices?  <H3>  If State Electricity Prices Are Not Adjusted, the Electric  Power Industry Will Lose Money Across the Board </H3>   The electric power industry relies on the extensive form of  expanded reproduction: the more power you want to generate, the  more equipment you need; and the more equipment you need, the  larger the investment that is required. Where does the  investment come from?    That the electric power industry should rely primarily on  the  funds that it accumulates itself and should engage in  self-supporting development is a basic principle of electric  power development throughout the world. In Japan, 80 percent of  the funding for the expanded reproduction of the 10 largest  companies is furnished by the companies themselves.    But countries differ greatly in their circumstances. China's  centrally subordinate power companies had a debt of fully 96.7  billion yuan at the end of 1992 and the amount is rising at a  rate of more than 10 billion yuan a year. This crushing burden  gives them no breathing space.    The principal cause of the problem is the price of  electricity.    Up to 1985, power industry construction in China was  supported primarily by the central authorities, and the  electricity price structure was uniform, with the prices set by  the state (i.e., directive pricing). When the prices of fuel and  transportation were raised, there was a corresponding rise in  the price charged for electric power; thus, state-specified  prices for electric power, which had not previously been  adjusted, rose somewhat.    Although the rise in the price of electric power compensated  most of the great increase in power production costs that was  brought about by increased fuel and transportation prices, the  contribution of materials and equipment to power production  costs had to be covered entirely by the enterprises themselves,  and, as a result, the full cost of power production was still  not adequately compensated by the price of electricity. In 1992,  the cost of producing a kilowatt-hour of electricity in the  centrally subordinate power companies was 2.5 times what it had  been in 1980, but the average price charged for electricity had  increased by a factor of only 1.3. As a consequence, the profit  on each unit sold had decreased by 50 percent. The profitability  rate of funds was 14.5 percent in 1985 but only 3.13 percent in  1992, far lower than the current Construction Bank interest rate  on loans for electric power construction (11.16 percent for  periods of five years or more). All of the earnings so arduously  accumulated by the centrally subordinate power companies were  inadequate to cover even the interest on the loans. Under last  year's conditions, they lost nearly 20 yuan on each 100 yuan of  expenditures. Since they were unable to accumulate funds, an  infusion of funds from outside was unlikely.    After the policy of replacing state allocations by loans was  instituted in 1980, it was long impossible to recover electric  power construction funds invested by the central authorities,  and it became increasingly difficult to increase investments in  electric power. In 1991, investments by the central authorities  had fallen to 45.6 percent of total national investments in  capital construction for electric power, compared with 81.6  percent in 1985.    Borrowing money from banks was even more difficult.  Recently,  new bank loans, even for state key electric power construction  projects, often required a great deal of coordinating work by  the relevant departments before the banks could be induced to  agree. It is not surprising that the banks were unwilling to  provide the money, because the power companies were not in a  position to repay it. By the end of 1991, the bank debt of the  electric power industry had reached 30.9 billion yuan.    In 1992, when the World Bank voted on the evaluation of the  Zou Xian (Shandong) power plant project, the U.S. representative  abstained; one of the chief reasons was that the price charged  for electric power was too low.    To compensate for the inadequate investment in capital  construction for the power industry, between 1988 and 1991 the  Ministry of Electric Power was authorized to issue more than 7  billion yuan in bonds of various types to the public; the  accumulated capital and interest on these bonds was more than 10  billion yuan. This year, with repayment at its peak, more than 6  billion yuan is required. Unless new prices for electricity are  instituted, where will this more than 6 billion yuan come from?  If the industry cannot pay off its old debts, how will it be  able to issue new bonds?    The time has come for adjustment of the seriously inadequate  directive prices for electricity.  <H3>  The Climate Is Excellent for Raising Funds for Electric  Power; Prices Are the Key to Loan Repayment </H3>   In view of the threadbare state of the centrally subordinate  electric power companies, in 1985 the central authorities issued  a new policy encouraging more organizations to produce power and  instituted diversified electricity prices. As a result, the  Huaneng group went into the power business, localities invested  in power production, and joint power production bodies sprang up  vigorously, producing an excellent situation. The key to raising  funds for power production is "loan-repayment" power prices, or,  in other words, prices sufficiently high that the power  companies will be able to repay their loans and interest on  time: these are "guided" rather than directive prices. This  pricing system not only gave the investors access to electric  power, but assured them of profits when the loan and interest  were repaid. When the policy of diversified electricity prices  was instituted, there was an abundant influx of funds: the  diverse electricity prices policy not only made the Huaneng  Group, which used primarily foreign capital, essentially capable  of self-sustaining growth, but also brought about a burst of  enthusiasm for local power production. In 1992, generating sets  for which the investment funds came from the localities,  enterprises, and foreign capital accounted for two-thirds of all  newly commissioned sets nationwide.    Electricity is a unique commodity. It cannot be stored and  it  must be consumed as it is generated, and thus optimized power  grid layout and scheduling are needed in order to achieve the  maximum economic effect from the generation and circulation of  electric power. It must be admitted that the policy of allowing  fund raising for power production promoted the development of  the power industry, and revealed a new mechanism for power  generation, and has resulted in successful experience. But we  now know that before the new situation had taken shape,  uncoordinated efforts to raise funds and go into power  production also led to abuses. The investors called the tune and  tended to emphasize their own particular benefits, which in turn  sacrificed the overall interests of the power grid, so that it  was difficult to assure optimization of the power grid and  implementation of state energy policy.    But why should we not make this sovereign remedy of  loan-repayment pricing available to the centrally subordinate  power-industry departments, so that they too will have the clout  to raise funds for power production?  <H3>  Experience Shows That the People Can Bear Electricity Price  Reforms </H3>   A rise in the centrally controlled power companies, which  account for 70 percent of the national total, will not be a  trivial matter. The power industry is a basic industry, and if  the prices charged by a basic industry are adjusted, price rises  throughout the economy may result, and the people's livelihood  may be affected. The state is taking a cautious approach to such  matters. At present, the prices of coal and of most other raw  materials, as well as the prices of grains and edible oils, have  been allowed to float, and electricity price reform is bringing  up the rear.    But just how great an effect will changes in electricity  prices produce?    It is calculated that, given the fluctuations in the prices  of coal and transportation, if loan-repayment prices were  instituted in one step, the national average price of electric  power would have to increase by only 34 percent above the 1992  price, or about 0.05 yuan.    Assuming that a family of three consumes 60 kWh of  electricity a month, an increase of 0.05 yuan per kWh would mean  an additional outlay of 3 yuan per month, equivalent to one  serving of ice cream per family member.    In the case of the enterprises, an adjustment of the price  of  electricity would have a large effect only on those with high  power consumption, but these represent only a small fraction of  all enterprises nationwide, and since their product prices have  already been allowed to float and to come into line with  international market prices, they are fairly well situated to  bear an adjustment of the price of electricity.    In certain economically developed regions with significant  power shortages, people are well acquainted with "high  electricity prices." To meet the needs of economic development,  these regions have made extensive use of small fossil-fired  power plants. The fuel consumption of these plants is an order  of magnitude higher than that of large fossil-fired plants, and  the prices that they charge for electricity are correspondingly  higher. Guangdong Province has 1 million kW of kerosene-fired  generating equipment, and the cost of the electricity produced  by these plants is as high as 1 yuan per kWh. Shenzhen  instituted new prices for electricity as early as 1989, and  users all stated that the price reform was necessary and that  they could tolerate it. Experience shows that the more highly  developed a region's economy, the greater the ability of the  users to tolerate increased electricity prices.  <H5>  Adjust Electricity Pricing, But Rectify It Well </H5>   Electricity prices vary from place to place; this is  acceptable, because at present the distribution of primary  energy resources is not in balance (electricity produced by  fossil-fired power plants is a secondary energy resource that  has been converted from coal and other primary energy  resources). If loan-repayment electricity prices are instituted,  a rational average nationwide electricity price level would be  about 0.30 yuan per kWh; a price level of 0.5 to 0.6 yuan would  be very high. At this point, some readers may exclaim, "Our  electricity prices are well above that!"    It is true: in many areas of the country, primarily rural  areas, the prices that users are actually paying for electricity  have long exceeded the loan-repayment price. It is reported that  rural electricity prices on Hainan Island were rectified,  lowering them from 1.35 yuan to about 0.8 yuan per kWh. The  highest prices on rural Hainan Island exceeded 4 yuan per kWh.  Excessive prices for electricity have forced the peasants in  certain areas to go back to oil lamps in place of electric  lights.    Why is it that these electricity prices are so much above  the  standard? While in some locations power generation costs are  indeed very high, the primary reason is that electricity price  management is chaotic, and, in particular, that guided  electricity prices are out of control in some localities.    There are more than 10 state-approved categorized guidance  prices for electricity. Many provinces and municipalities  implement an overall use surcharge to guidance prices, in which  the price excess above the directive prices is spread out over  the power use of the entire area. Because most of the income  from guidance prices for electricity is available for local  distribution, if local governments at various levels approve  guidance prices, the result may be the setting of high prices,  price increases at each level, and collection of increased fees  for electric power. Because electric power payments are easy to  collect under the rubric of fees, a great variety of local  policies involving "piggyback" fees have emerged: "Surcharges  are a basket that you can put wherever you need it." Some  localities even include birth control fees, highway construction  fees and entertainment fees in the price of electricity. There  are also cases when electricity fees for goodwill, influence,  and connections are imposed on users. Thus electricity fees have  become a catchall for a multitude of charges. In one city, the  combined price rise included fully 35 components. One fee  collector told a reporter: "It used to be that when you  collected the electricity fee, you wrote out a bill; now you  write out a whole stack of them."    The director of the Guomian No. 3 power plant in Jinan said  angrily, "The enterprises are paying more money for electricity,  but is this money really being used to support power-industry  construction?"    The electric power departments also have their complaints.  Director Qi Xinpei [2058 2450 1014] of the Jinan Power Supply  Office stated: "Some users are accusing us of disguised robbery,  but they don't realize that we are actually collecting the money  for others: we're just the scapegoats."    It would appear that while adjusting electricity prices, we  should also rectify pricing and prescribe uniform electricity  price management standards. Otherwise, a plethora of  "electricity tigers" will open their jaws, and the situation  will become intolerable for everyone.  <H5>  Electricity Prices Will Not Rise Sharply </H5>   A kilowatt-hour of electricity can be used to produce  several  yuan or even several dozen yuan of industrial output value, but  its price is only a few hundredths or tenths of a yuan. Those  who understand the situation consider that the time has come for  price adjustment.    There has been some psychological preparation for the  adjustment of electricity prices. Many plant directors have  stated that so long as they get enough electricity, they will  put up with any price in preference to power outages.    Many members of the public state that they would prefer air  conditioning to low electricity prices. But some comrades are  concerned that since the electric power industry is highly  monopolistic, if electricity prices are allowed to float, they  might rise precipitously. This concern is unwarranted, however.  Although the power industry must adapt to a market economy, it  is a public utility; all countries have strict electricity  pricing principles, and as public utilities, the power companies  are not permitted to earn high profits. What profit rate is  suitable for electric power enterprises? Experts believe that in  this country, an average profitability rate of funds in the  range of 12 to 15 percent would promote the self-supporting  development of the electric power industry. Head of the Ministry  of Electric Power's pricing office Huang Yongda [7806 3057 6671]  believes that, "In the future, China should adopt a funds  profitability model when evaluating and adjusting electricity  prices."    This July, the State Council approved a new electricity  price  reform program which raised the standards for price increases  based on the costs of coal and transportation; in addition the  central authorities took the initial steps toward loan-repayment  prices and approved the first increases in household electricity  prices. Furthermore, the accumulated price rises based on the  cost of coal and transportation will be combined in the list  price for electricity, providing an excellent basis for the  rationalization of electricity prices. We are told that in the  next few years, the Ministry of Electric Power plans to reform  the procedure for increasing prices on the basis of coal and  transportation costs, to implement loan-repayment pricing across  the board, to institute peak and off-peak electricity pricing,  and ultimately to arrive at rational pricing. Electricity  prices are the lifeline that will bring the power industry to a  beneficial cycle.    Aristotle stated, "Give me a place to stand and I will move  the earth."    A high official in the Ministry of Electric Power stated:  "Give us the electricity price lever, and we will make the power  industry take off."</p>

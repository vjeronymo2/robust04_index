December 26 of this year marks the centenary of the birth of  Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of various  nationalities throughout the country and the founder of the CPC,  the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the PRC.    During the days when the entire party and the people  throughout the country ceremoniously commemorate the centenary  of the birth of Mao Zedong with great respect, the vast number  of party members, cadres, and the masses of Beijing  Municipality, like the people in other areas of the country,  cherish the deep memory and particularly warm feeling toward  Comrade Mao Zedong. As early as the 4 May Movement, Comrade Mao  Zedong came to Beijing twice to explore the truth of revolution  and the road to the liberation of the Chinese nation and,  enlightened by Marxism-Leninism, became a firm communist. On  the eve of the national victory in the Chinese revolution, Mao  Zedong and his comrades-in-arms devised strategies in Beijing  and commanded the great army of a million people to cross Chang  Jiang, occupy Nanjing, and put an end to the reactionary rule of  the Kuomintang. On 1 October 1949, Comrade Mao Zedong  personally raised the first five-star red flag of the new China  on the rostrum of Tiananmen and solemnly declared to the world  that Chinese people were standing. After the founding of the  country, Comrade Mao Zedong lived and worked in Beijing all the  time. In the process of leading China's socialist revolution  and construction, he was always concerned with the people and  the various works of the capital. He left footmarks in many  places and gave instructions to many people. This is what the  people of Beijing Municipality will not forget. The purpose for  the Beijing municipal party committee, people's congress  standing committee, government, and committee of the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference and the Beijing  Garrison in holding this forum marking the centenary of the  birth of Comrade Mao Zedong today is to review Comrade Mao  Zedong's great achievements, further study Mao Zedong Thought,  always hold high the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and  advance bravely; and to pursue the road to socialism with  Chinese characteristics that was pioneered by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, persist in reform, open wider to the outside world,  and express our deep memory of Comrade Mao Zedong with  outstanding results in various work.  <H6>  1. </H6>   Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist and a great  proletarian revolutionary, strategist, and theorist. His  greatest historical achievement was to integrate the fundamental  tenets of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of Chinese  revolution, lead our party and people to find a correct road for  new democratic revolution, fulfill the task of opposing  imperialism and feudalism, and put an end to the Chinese history  of semi-colonial and semi- feudal society; and to eliminate the  exploiting class and the system of exploitation and establish a  brand-new socialist system. Proceeding from China's reality, he  then began to explore the road of building socialism. Based on  the fundamental tenets of Marxism-Leninism and with Comrade Mao  Zedong as the major representative, the Chinese communists came  up with a theoretical summary of the series of original  experiences in China's long practice of revolution and  construction to form a scientific guiding thought compatible  with China's conditions which we refer to as Mao Zedong Thought.    Mao Zedong Thought is extensive and profound. It has  enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism with its original theory  in the fields of philosophy, political economy, scientific  socialism, military science, culture and art, and party  building. It is the treasure-house of the theory of our party  and the spiritual pillar of the Chinese nation and is the  constant guide to our building of a modern socialist country.    In the practice of leading the revolution and construction  of  China, Comrade Mao Zedong attached high importance to the great  role of ideological theory. He demanded that we arm the whole  party with Marxism-Leninism, regard the adherence to Marxist  dialectical materialism as a conspicuous part of the party's  building of ideological theory, and wage an unremitting struggle  against idealism and metaphysics that deviate from dialectical  materialism.    Comrade Mao Zedong made many profound and brilliant  expositions on the extremely great significance in studying and  grasping Marxism-Leninism. He highly praised the following  remarks of Lenin: "Without the theory of revolution, there would  be no revolution movement." Comrade Mao Zedong maintained:  Without the theory of revolution, it is impossible to achieve  success in guiding a great political party of revolutionary  movement. He pointed out: The salvos of the October Revolution  brought us Marxism-Leninism. The October Revolution helped  advanced elements of the whole world and of China to use the  proletarian world outlook, that was regarded as the instrument  to observe the destiny of our country, to reconsider the issues  of their own." Chinese Communists, represented by Comrade Mao  Zedong, found the proletarian world outlook, a sharp weapon we  used to observe the issues of China, initiated the  Chinese-oriented Marxism-Leninism--Mao Zedong Thought, and  guided the whole party and all the people in the country to win  a victory in the new democratic revolution. Right after the  founding of the PRC, he again explicitly pointed out: "The  theoretical foundation that guides our ideology is  Marxism-Leninism." The Chinese Communists were able to make  difficult and tortuous explorations in the revolution and  construction of China and in the march from victory to victory  precisely because they were armed with Marxism- Leninism-Mao  Zedong Thought.    In studying Marxism-Leninism, what should be studied first?  Comrade Mao Zedong maintained: What is most important is to  grasp -- dialectical materialism and historical materialism, the  essential components of Marxist philosophy. He repeatedly  admonished the whole party: "Marxism-Leninism is science" and  truth. The founding of Marxism-Leninism is an unprecedented big  revolution in the history of mankind's understanding. Marxists  and Communists "have applied materialist dialectics to many  fields of the analysis of mankind history and the analysis of  natural history and to many fields of the change in society and  the change in nature, thus obtaining extremely great success."  Comrade Mao Zedong called on the whole party to conscientiously  grasp the proletarian world outlook and methodology of  dialectical materialism and historical materialism, in  approaching, analyzing, and solving the practical problems of  China by studying the fundamental theory of Marxism-Leninism.  Comrade Mao Zedong himself set a glorious example for us with  his immortal philosophic works, such as "On Practice," "On  Contradiction," and "Whence the People's Correct Ideas?," will  radiate with the light of truth forever.    Comrade Mao Zedong constantly stressed that the key to  studying Marxism and Leninism is to be well acquainted with  their stands, viewpoints and methods, and oppose subjectivism,  dogmatism, idealism and metaphysics. In the study of Marxism  and Leninism, if we fail to exert efforts to grasp their stands,  viewpoints and methods, and understand only some phrases, we  will surely fall into idealism and metaphysics; if we use them  to guide our work, we will surely commit subjective and dogmatic  mistakes. Comrade Mao Zedong firmly defended the Marxist  dialectical materialism. He pointed out explicitly and  profoundly that Marxism is a "theory which can be used as a  criterion all over the world," that we should not treat it as a  dogma but a guide to action, and that we should not "only study  some phrases and sentences of Marxism and Leninism but study it  as a science of revolution." Mao Zedong believed that  subjectivism, dogmatism, and empiricism was all ideology and  metaphysics, and that they all have the "characteristics of  dividing subjectivism and objectivism and disconnecting  recognition and practice." The ideology of bourgeois  liberalization that negates the four cardinal principles emerged  in the course of reform and opening up, while "leftist" ideology  that negates reform and opening up has not conformed to reality  and the national conditions of our country. As far as the source  of the theory of knowledge is concerned, it also separates  subjectivism from objectivism and disconnects theory from  practice. Therefore, only by grasping the stands, viewpoints  and methods of Marxism and Leninism well can we be able to  uphold a correct viewpoint, correctly sum up experience,  overcome difficulties, make less mistakes and do more work.    Why should we study and grasp Marxism and Leninism ? It is  because we want to apply them to solving practical problems.  Comrade Mao Zedong stressed: " We should purposefully study  Marxist and Leninist theories," "have a definite object in  view," and "use the arrow of Marxism and Leninism to shoot the  target of the revolution of China." He particularly criticized  the aimless attitude of studying the stands, viewpoints and  methods of Marxism and Leninism not for the purpose of solving  the theoretical and strategic issues of the revolution of China  but "to simply study theories," and strictly criticized the bad  study work style of merely taking the "arrow" of Marxism and  Leninism "in the hand, praising it repeatedly, saying that it is  a `good arrow,' but not wanting to shoot it out." He pointed  out sharply that if we fail to clarify and solve this issue  well, "our party's theoretical level will never be raised and  China will never win a victory in its revolution."    Comrade Mao Zedong always upheld the viewpoint of attaching  prime importance to the practice of dialectical materialist  theory, constantly undertaken investigations and studies, and  stressed that while correct ideology and understanding can only  come from practice, they must be tested by practice. He  believed that the "correct ideology of man can only comes from  social practice," and that "a correct understanding can be  formed through repetition, such as turning material  understanding to spiritual understanding and spiritual  understanding to material understanding; in other words,  practice into understanding, and understanding into practice."  We should test and develop truth in the course of practice. He  held that our party's correct and unshakable tactics could never  be formulated by a small number of people who stayed at home to  "cudgel their brains to `think of ways' and `make decisions'"  "based on their subjective desires," and that we should "learn  about social conditions and conduct realistic investigations  often." Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong advocated within the  party the need to vigorously conduct investigation and study.  "No investigation, no right to speak," "No correct  investigation, no right to speak, either" were his famous  maxims. It was our efforts to uphold and carry forward the  party's fine tradition of investigation and study and to adhere  to Comrade Mao Zedong's line of dialectical materialist theory  of knowledge -- "practice-knowledge-again practice-again  knowledge -- that enabled our understanding to be improved to a  new height following developments in practice and enabled the  cause of our party and people to advance in the practice of  continuous exploration.    Comrade Mao Zedong advocated the need to extensively launch  an education movement to study Marxism-Leninism in the entire  party and among the people throughout the country. He  maintained that everyone should study some philosophy. Soon  after the war of resistance against Japan, he called on the  entire party to launch an emulation in studying Marxism-Leninism  to "see who has truly learned something, learned more, and  learned better." In 1942, he personally led the Yanan  rectification movement and launched an extensive  Marxism-Leninism education movement for studying dialectical  materialism, historical materialism, and Comrade Mao Zedong's  basic works on the rectification movement, such as "Transform  Our Study," "Rectify the Party's Work Styles," and "Oppose  Stereotyped Party Writing," thus liberating the vast number of  party members from the mental shackles of dogmatism, empiricism,  and, especially, Wang Ming dogmatism and then enabling the  entire party to achieve unprecedented unity and further maturity  and ensuring the victory of the war of resistance against Japan  and success in the new democratic revolution in the country.  After the founding of new China, he again issued calls on many  occasions for extensively studying Marxism-Leninism and  organizing "a powerful theoretical contingent in which millions  of people study the theoretical foundation of Marxism, namely  dialectical and historical materialism, and oppose various types  of idealism and mechanical materialism." He called for  "liberating philosophy from the classrooms and books of  philosophers and turning it into a sharp weapon of the masses."  This weapon, once mastered by the masses, will become a  tremendous material force to transform society and the world.  Thanks to Comrade Mao Zedong's advocacy and promotion, an  atmosphere of attaching importance to theories and studying  theories took shape in the party, which still benefits us a  great deal.  <H6>  2. </H6>   The second-generation leadership collective of the party  Central Committee with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core  scientifically accomplished the important task of correctly  appraising Comrade Mao Zedong and safeguarding the historical  position of Mao Zedong Thought, a task concerning the future and  destiny of the party and the state, and pooled the wisdom of the  entire party and the people of the whole country with the  tremendous political courage to blaze a new road of building  socialism and the tremendous courage to pioneer a new realm of  Marxist theory. It established, in a creative manner, the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This  represented another, even greater historical leap after our  party successfully found a road for new democratic revolution  and established the socialist system. It unfolded before the  entire party and the people of the whole country a magnificent  prospect for a prosperous, democratic, civilized socialist  modern country.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping inherited and developed Mao Zedong  Thought, regarded adherence to and defence of Marxist- Leninist  philosophy -- dialectical materialism and historical materialism  -- as the most important and fundamental link, and used this  philosophy to guide practice in China. He particularly paid  attention to using the dialectical materialist theory of  knowledge to guide the practice of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics.    Following the "Cultural Revolution," Comrade Deng Xiaoping  upheld the Marxist materialism and brought order out of chaos in  the field of knowledge with a great Marxist's boldness of  vision. After the smashing of the "gang of four," he took the  lead in resisting and criticizing the erroneous principle of  "two whatever," and supported, guided, and promoted the  nationwide discussion of regarding practice as the sole  criterion for testing truth, thus breaking with the trammels of  "leftist" ideas. He always maintained that "true Marxists and  Leninists must understand, inherit, and develop Marxism-Leninism  in accordance with the present situation." "Marxists refusing to  use new ideas and viewpoints to inherit and develop Marxism are  not true Marxists." In light of the confusion and misgivings  among some comrades within the party, he repeatedly stressed the  necessity of "completely and accurately understanding Mao Zedong  Thought," and the necessity of "being good at studying,  mastering, and applying the system of Mao Zedong Thought to  guide all the work. This is the only way to prevent us from  cutting apart and distorting Mao Zedong Thought and from  damaging Mao Zedong Thought." This enabled the whole party to  again go back to the correct Marxist line of knowledge and laid  ideological and theoretical foundations for the convocation of  the third plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee,  which is of great historical significance.    Another major contribution made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping to  the party's ideological and theoretical building is the  establishment of the ideological line of emancipating the mind  and seeking truth from facts using Marxist dialectical  materialism as the weapon. Comrade Deng Xiaoping proceeded from  China's reality to form the theory of the initial stage of  China's socialism to formulate the party's basic line of "one  central task and two basic points," and to seek the road of  developing the socialism with Chinese characteristics, precisely  under the guidance of the Marxist line of knowledge, thus making  China's socialist cause embark on a new period of vigorous  development. Also, precisely under the guidance of the Marxist  line of knowledge known as emancipating the mind and seeking  truth from facts, Comrade Deng Xiaoping thoroughly overhauled  the long-standing conclusion of plans being the essential  characteristic of socialism and pointed out "that having more  plans or more markets is not the essential difference between  socialism and capitalism. While a planned economy is not  tantamount to socialism and capitalism has plans; a market  economy is not tantamount to capitalism, and socialism also has  markets. Both of plans and markets are economic means."  "Whatever is conducive to the development of productive forces  can by utilized." The third plenary session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee adopted the "CPC Central Committee's decision  on some issues of establishing a socialist market economic  structure," in line with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  guidelines of the 14th CPC Congress. This is an extremely  important contribution made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping to the  treasure-house of the Marxist theory.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has specifically and flexibly applied  the development view of dialectical materialism of  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought to the reality of building  socialist modernizations. His noted inference is that "only  development represents an essential criterion". All things in  the world are in the course of ceaseless movement, development,  and changes. They never remain in a period or at a level  forever, so does socialism as long as it has become a brand-new  social system. In dealing with this issue in the past, we  lacked the viewpoint of Marxist theory of dialectical  materialism; somewhat had one-sidedness in understanding the  socialist essence; did not stress "the emancipation of  productive forces through reforms"; and did not totally master  the meaning between "emancipating productive forces and  developing them". All of these have enabled us to experience a  tortuous path and to pay for them. By studying Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and particularly studying his viewpoint and  thought relating to development, we have suddenly seen the light  and upgraded our understanding on socialism to a new realm.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Poverty does not mean  socialism and extremely slow development does not also." By  being divorced from development, we cannot firmly grasp the  upholding of socialist systems, direction, and road. "The most  fundamental task in this regard is to develop productive forces.  In the final analysis, the socialist superiority should give  expression to productive force development being faster or  higher than that of capitalism and to steadily improving the  people's livelihood based on developing the productive force".  Then, "efforts should be made to prepare a foundation for  entering the age of Communism". "By not doing so will we never  be able to develop productive forces, to do away with the  egalitarianism and the practice of eating from the same big pot,  to improve the people's livelihood, and to bring the people's  enthusiasm into play". Thus, the socialist undertakings of  modernizations will come to nothing. Comrade Deng Xiaoping also  pointed out: "We should not block localities that are able to  achieve development and localities whose conditions meet should  engage in development as faster as possible. It is nothing for  us to worry about as long as these localities stress economic  results and quality and develop the export-oriented economy".  Based on this development ideology, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has  formulated for the entire party a set of strategies, principles,  and policies for accelerating the socialist development. The  entire party and the people throughout the country should arm  themselves with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thought on development  being an essential criterion and extremely play their enthusiasm  and creativeness so as to promote the construction of socialism  with Chinese characteristics to forge ahead and bring about  changes day after day.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping has applied the Marxist philosophical  viewpoint of practice being the first to the practice of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and urged the  entire party to dare to try, to pioneer, and to take risk in  building socialism. Upholding practice being the first,  respecting the objective law, bringing the subjective initiative  into full play, and "daring to try and pioneer," truly represent  the upholding of Marxist theory of dialectical materialism.  Marx once said: "Philosophers only adopt different styles to  explain the world, however, the issue in this regard lies in  changing the world". Those who have just sat there to talk  about theories, indulged in empty talks, and not dared to do  this or that, do not know Marxism even slightly. Comrade Mao  Zedong once pointed out: In fighting the revolutionary wars,  "we have not learned them well in advance but we begin to study  them after we have engaged in. Thus, fighting means learning."  Comrade Deng Xiaoping also repeatedly emphasized that socialism  is achieved through hard work. He said: Socialism with Chinese  characteristics that we are developing has been "unheard of in  China's several thousand years of history" and "an undertaking  never developed in other socialist countries. Therefore, there  is no ready experience to learn from. We can only learn in the  process of work and explore in the process of practice." He  urged us to "boldly experiment and blaze new trails regarding  the endeavors whose worth we are certain" and never act slowly  and overcautiously like women with bound feet. Otherwise, we  "will be unable to blaze a good road or a new road and unable to  pioneer a new cause." He repeatedly reminded people: "It is  necessary to overcome fear and have courage. There must be  someone to conduct the first experiment in any field. Only then  can a new road be opened. We should be prepared for failure  when conducting the first experiment. Failure is nothing  serious." What is important is that we should have the ability  to summarize experiences and "persist in what is right and  rapidly correct what is wrong." This philosophical idea of  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's has greatly encouraged and inspired our  spirit and has extremely important guiding significance in  accelerating China's reform, opening up, and modernization drive.    Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that in studying Marxist  theory, we should achieve proficiency, find use for, become  familiar with, and master the fundamental tenets. The classical  works of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought are as vast as the  open sea. In studying them, we should adhere to the principle  of studying less more proficiently, and make them useful.  Comrade Deng Xiaoping earnestly said to new and old cadres on  many occasions: "Time and tasks are different for our current  endeavor to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, and  there is indeed plenty of new knowledge to study. This requires  that we master the basic theory of Marxism to comply with the  new reality because only then can we improve our skills to use  basic principles and basic methods to actively explore ways to  resolve basic political, economic, social, and cultural issues."  We should "familiarize ourselves with the basic theory of  Marxism to acquire a stronger sense of adherence to principles  in work, a systematic approach, foresight, and creativity." He  particularly pointed out: "The several hundred members of the  party Central Committee and the several thousand central and  local high- ranking cadres should take the lead in assiduously  studying modernized economic construction." Standing at the  crest of the tide of this era, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is not only  a brilliant example for the entire party in emancipating the  mind and conducting exploration bravely but also a brilliant  example in the creative application of the fundamental tenets of  Marxism-Leninism.    Thanks to his mastery of the historical law governing social  development with Marxist historical materialism, Comrade Deng  Xiaoping is confident in the success of Marxism and communism.  In view of the abrupt changes in East Europe, the  disintegration of the Soviet Union, the serious setbacks and low  tide of socialism in some countries, and some people's doubts  and waverings about Marxism, Comrade Deng Xiaoping showed great  foresight to point out: "I firmly believe that people who  approve of Marxism will increase in the world because Marxism is  a science, which uses historical materialism to bring to light  the law governing the development of human society." This fully  shows Comrade Deng Xiaoping's adherence to truth, loyalty to  Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought, and firm faith in working  hard all his life for the communist cause.    Comrades! When we commemorate the centenary of the birth  of Comrade Mao Zedong, the most fundamental task is to uphold  the theoretical foundation of the Marxist dialectical  materialism, arm the whole party with Marxism-Leninism-Mao  Zedong Thought and with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, actually  strengthen the building of the party's ideology and theory, and  guide and promote the sustained, rapid, and sound development of  the capital's reform, opening up, and economic construction.    First, we should profoundly study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping in close combination  with realities. Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping has collected Comrade Deng Xiaoping's most  important and most creative works written in the process of  forming and developing the theory of building the socialism with  Chinese characteristics, thus being a scientific guide to our  continuous advance. The central authorities have already  adopted the decision of studying Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping. We should carry forward the style  of study of integrating theory with practice, that was initiated  by Comrade Mao Zedong. In studying this book, we should have a  good command of focal points, study and read original works in  deptb, and profoundly comprehend the essence of guidelines. In  close combination with the realities of work and ideology, we  should conscientiously summarize the experiences gained from the  practice of reform, opening up, and economic construction over  the past dozen of years, further clarify all sorts of confused  understandings of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics, and strive to master the theory of building the  socialism with Chinese characteristics in an all-round and  specific manner rather than in a fragmentary and empty manner in  order to continuously push forward the cause of reform, opening  up, and economic construction.    Second, we should persistently implement the knowledge line  of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts,  continuously renew our concepts, continuously break with the  trammels of idealism and metaphysics, and strive to avoid  subjective one-sidedness. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out:  "Emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts are the  quintessence of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and are the magic weapon to ensure that our  party will be vigorous and vivid forever." By emancipating the  mind, we mean extricating the people's ideas from the yoke of  idealism and metaphysics; making ideas conform to practice and  subjective things conform to objective ones; and persisting in  dialectical materialism and seeking truth from facts.  Emancipating the mind precisely means seeking truth from facts.  On no account should we separate the emancipation of the mind  from the seeking of truth, still less set any of them against  the other. In recent years, we have launched mass discussions  on emancipating the mind on four occasions in succession  throughout the municipality, and every mass discussion has  brought us a new leap in ideology and understanding and brought  big enhancement to all items of work. It should be noted that  the objective world undergoes constant change, and the ideas and  concepts that reflect the objective world are also undergoing  constant change. There is no end to the emancipation of the  mind as a process of continuously deepening the understanding of  the objective world. If we do not understand this point and pay  no attention it, our ideas will become stagnant, rigid, and fall  into subjective one-sidedness. At present, we should emancipate  our minds to focus on the endeavors to accelerate the  establishment of the socialist market economy system, to extend  the degree of reform in establishing the modern enterprise  system, to seize the opportunity to accelerate development and  promote the economy of the capital to a new height every few  years, and on the long-standing difficulties and hot issues that  have prevented various departments and units from advance and  the fear of difficulty resulting from this. Rapid construction  of the capital and comprehensive progress in all sectors of  society can be achieved only when we continuously emancipate our  minds, eliminate ideological obstacles, free ourselves form the  fetters of subjectivism and metaphysics, seek truth from facts,  and proceed from reality in doing everything.    Third, we should continue to vigorously develop the trend of  investigation and study to put our policy decisions on a more  scientific and reliable base. "No investigation, no right to  speak." As far as the leaders of a locality or a department are  concerned, no right to speak means no right to make decisions.  Leading organs and leading persons who cannot make decisions, in  reality, have no right to leadership although they assume  leading posts. The investigation and study activities  extensively conducted throughout the municipality since the  beginning of this year have not only helped cadres enhance their  understanding of the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics but also built a bridge to integrate theory with  practice. Through investigations and study, many leading cadres  have achieved a good command of knowledge, namely emancipating  the mind and seeking truth from facts, and learned to use the  Marxist stand, viewpoints, and methods to analyze and summarize  the new problems and new experiences in reform, opening up, and  economic construction. Many new ideas, new measures,  large-scale moves, and creations compatible with their  respective localities and departments have been put forward, and  the work of their units have also taken on a new look. The  vigorous trend of investigation and study has had a good  beginning in the municipality. The municipal party committee  has conducted investigation and study four times this year.  Next year, it should set forth topics for investigation and  study, include it in its plans, assign persons to be responsible  for it, and conduct it four times. The good tradition of  investigation and study must persist on a long-term basis.    Fourth, we should make continuous efforts to resolve the  issues on world outlook and the outlook on life and truly join  the party ideologically. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "A  change in world outlook is a fundamental change." Only when we  master the scientific, dialectical materialist, and historical  materialist world outlook, can we embrace a firm communist  outlook on life, truly join the party ideologically, never be  subdued by force or shaken by poverty, be impervious to the  temptation of wealth and high position, and never shake our  communist faith under any circumstances. Many revolutionary  martyrs did not yield or bend their will even when faced with  the knife of the enemy. Today, as long as we embrace a firm  communist world outlook and outlook on life, the plot of western  hostile forces to effect our peaceful evolution will never  succeed. Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping, and other old  proletarian revolutionaries firmly embraced the communist world  outlook, the communist faith, noble moral character, and the  spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, thus becoming  models for our times. Comrade Mao Zedong always stressed: "At  any time and any place, communists should not put their personal  interests at the fore, but should subjugate their personal  interests beneath the interests of the Chinese nation and the  people." He sharply criticized: "Selfishness, slackness in  work, corruption and embezzlement, and the practice of being  fond of the limelight are most contemptible." Those who indulge  in such practices "do not understand at all what the proletarian  idea is, what communism is, and what the party is." Under the  new situation of developing the socialist market economy, we  should guide the vast numbers of party members, leading cadres  of the party in particular, to firmly embrace the communist  world outlook and the communist outlook on life, to consciously  resist and overcome the inroads of corrosive capitalist and  feudal ideas, to consciously resist the influence from money  worship, extreme individualism, and corrosive style of life, to  honestly perform official duties, and to work diligently for the  people so that they can truly become "noble persons," "pure  persons," "persons absolved of bad taste," "persons conducive to  the masses," and "persons with lofty ideals, moral integrity,  cultural accomplishments, and a sense of discipline, so that  they can struggle for the communist cause all their lives. If  we pay no attention to remolding the outlook on the world and on  life, we will eventually be eliminated by the times, and will  certainly witness the situation pointed out by Comrade Mao  Zedong in which some persons always think: "What on earth are  proletarian ideas, and isn't it the same old stuff? How can  they know that it is not easy to obtain it." These persons will  "have lack communist flavor all their lives, and thus they  cannot but deviate from the party."    Fifth, we must closely combine the building of ideology and  theory with the implementation of the party's political line.  The party's basic line of "one central task and two basic  points" was formulated under the guidance of the ideological  line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts and  by proceeding from the basic conditions of our country.  Therefore, this line has manifested the fundamental interests  of the people throughout the country, is in keeping with the  realities, and is scientific, correct, and unchanging for a long  time. Only by understanding the scientific nature and  correctness of this line in ideology and theory, can we even  more consciously persist in the party's basic line without  deviation for a hundred of years in line with the demands set by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping. We should educate the vast numbers of  party members, cadres, and the masses to always pay attention to  the central task of economic construction, to always set to  right the relationship between reform and opening up and the  adherence to the four cardinal principles, and to always persist  in the principle of "taking a two-handed approach and being  tough with both hands." At the same time, we must continuously  get rid of the interference from the erroneous "left" and right  ideas. We should guard against the right, but should primarily  prevent the "left." Only by unswervingly upholding the party's  basic line, can we ensure that our country will maintain  long-term stability and order, can we put our socialist cause in  an invincible position, and can we again win the glory of the  Chinese nation.    Sixth, in studying Marxist theories we should particularly  apply the Marxist "theory" at present to aim at overfulfilling  the municipal "target" of becoming better-off in three years.  In line with the current world situation and our country's  reality, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has formulated the grand  blueprint for the entire party and the people throughout the  country regarding the realization of socialist modernization in  three steps. As a matter of fact, people should eat their meal  one mouthful after the other and cultivate their fields one by  one. According to this saying, the current task of Beijing  Municipality is to overfulfill the target of becoming better-off  based on the results of having had the people dress warmly and  eat their fill. We should accelerate the pace in reform,  opening up, and economic development in line with the guiding  principle of it being favorable for developing socialist social  productive forces, for enhancing the comprehensive strength of  socialist countries, and for upgrading the people's livelihood.  Localities where conditions allow faster development should  strive to achieve development as quickly as possible to  contribute to the national undertakings of socialist  modernization and to realizing the strategic target in three  steps.    Comrades: The Marxist theories of dialectical and historical  materialism constitute a system of revolutionary ideological  theories, which is most perfect, systematic, and scientific.  The more than 100-year history has eloquently proven that the  powerful ideologically theoretical weapon of dialectical  materialism is invincible. The law of human historical  development, which has been exposed by the dialectical  materialism, tells us that socialism will replace capitalism as  capitalism did in the feudalist society. Such historical  progress cannot be changed by anybody. China is determined to  become prosperous and the victory scored by socialism with  Chinese characteristics in China cannot be blocked by any force.  We should rally round the CPC Central Committee with Comrade  Jiang Zemin at the core; uphold the dialectical materialism;  earnestly study Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought; study  contemporary Marxism in China, Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics; and boldly  march forward in line with our fixed fighting targets. We must  realize the teaching by Comrade Mao Zedong during his life time,  which reads that "China should make greater contributions to  mankind." We must make efforts to build China, whose population  accounts for one fifth of the total of the world, into a rich,  strong, democratic, civilized, and socialist country. A  success, itself, made by us in this regard represents an  important contribution to mankind and will become the best  commemoration offered by us to Comrade Mao Zedong.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / De Klerk to quicken pace of constitutional reform PRESIDENT FW de Klerk indicated yesterday that he would quicken the pace of constitutional reform in South Africa. Mr de Klerk, buoyed by the white electorate's overwhelming endorsement of negotiations with black political leaders, said 'a sense of urgency' and 'dynamic negotiation' was needed to end any uncertainty about the country's political future. Echoing the need for rapid progress, Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, urged Mr de Klerk to act quickly. Mr Mandela told a press conference in Cape Town: 'Our demand is that the interim government must be introduced this year, and we think that is possible.' 'We sincerely hope, now that Mr de Klerk has got an overwhelming endorsement for his role in the negotiations, that he will now be able to move with speed.' Mr de Klerk, who was speaking in Cape Town after a meeting with Mr Pierre Trudeau, the former Canadian prime minister, declined to put a timetable on the reform process. 'The basis of negotiation is consensus so no one can say how long it will take,' said Mr de Klerk. But he made clear that Tuesday's referendum, in which 69 per cent of the white electorate voted for constitutional talks, had given impetus to the negotiations. Officials from the government and the ANC believe that an interim government could be in place by the end of the year. The combination of the size of the 'yes' vote in the referendum and the success of the national side in the World Cup cricket tournament in Australia, has left most of white South Africa feeling in better heart than it has for years. The response from the business community, fearful that sanctions would be reimposed in the event on a 'no' vote, has bordered on the euphoric. 'Thank you for saying 'yes',' read one company-sponsored full-page advertisement in the country's leading daily newspaper. A sizeable exception to the rejoicing is represented by the parliamentary caucus of the rightwing Conservative party, for whom the referendum was a disaster. The caucus met yesterday to consider its strategy in the face of Tuesday's rebuff. Many observers expect a split in the party, which persuaded 31 per cent of whites to oppose reform - well below their expectations. Some Conservative MPs believe the party should now participate in constitutional talks, which so far it has boycotted. Mr Andries Treurnicht, the party leader, gave no clue yesterday of his plans, but warned that Mr de Klerk 'will be the victim of his own reform.' 'Mr de Klerk is negotiating his own government out of power,' said Mr Treurnicht.</p>

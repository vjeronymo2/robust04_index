			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / UK Company News: The end is nigh for Bank of Edinburgh Bank of Edinburgh, a vehicle set up by three years ago to acquire small and medium-sized building societies, is close to being wound up at a substantial loss after its failure to take over any societies. Bank of Edinburgh has been searching for new owners after its shareholders, led by Scottish Amicable, asked to withdraw following the collapse of its attempt to take over the Heart of England Building Society last March. The Bank of England disclosed yesterday that the bank had given up its banking licence. This was used to raise a small amount of deposits, and to earn money by lending the bank's Pounds 5.9m capital and liabilities to other banks. Mr Russell Frith, finance director of the bank, said it had not yet decided to close. 'We have decided that we must either find a new parent, or return the money to the existing shareholders.' In its last published accounts, for 1992, the bank had some Pounds 5.2m of capital remaining from the Pounds 8m it drew from institutional investors. The failure of the Heart of England bid led to a Pounds 1.58m write-down of capital. After repaying deposits to about 60 depositors, the bank is expected to be able to repay only about half the capital it drew. Apart from Scottish Amicable, other investors include life insurance companies and venture capital groups. The bank gained a licence when it took over the banking arm of Goode Durrant, the financial services company, in 1992. Its original intention was to acquire a number of societies and merge them into a single financial services group.</p>

[passage omitted]    "The leadership has supported in a way the ethical aspect of  the call," said Baudys, adding that the dismissal of a minister  should be preceded by the talks of the coalition parties about  this move. The ethical aspect of his appeal should not be  suppressed by formal shortcomings, he said.    The KDU-CSL meeting was not attended by Josef Lux, the party  chairman.    On Monday [21 February] the Executive Council of the Civic  Democratic Party (ODS, the largest coalition party), recommended  to Premier Vaclav Klaus that he take strict measures, perhaps  even Baudys's dismissal.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UN and EC deplore fighting UNITED NATIONS and European Community negotiators yesterday deplored the continuation of heavy fighting in eastern Bosnia while peace talks under their auspices were taking place in New York. Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen deplored the fact that despite numerous assurances, as well as Security Council calls for the observance of international humanitarian law, land relief convoys were still blocked. The joint mediators urged immediate access and measures to enable the wounded to be evacuated. They also expressed concern about new displacements of innocent civilians. Their statement was issued after President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia-Hercegovina raised the matter with the mediators at the outset of his first meeting with them since the talks were transferred from Geneva. On Monday he told reporters in Washington that he was bringing proposals to the UN for a US role in a ceasefire and military disengagement, but no details of this were immediately avail-able. Responding to the Bosnian leader's insistence that he would not take part in full-scale negotiations, Mr Fred Eckhard, the conference spokesman, observed: 'I think his presence here this morning is the answer.' However, there was still no indication if or when a negotiating session including all the parties would take place in New York.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Speaker of India's Parliament, overruling opposition objections, declared  that the government need not release all sections of a report implicating a  senior aide to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in her 1984 assassination.  Opposition politicians charged that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had not  fulfilled a pledge when on March 27 he released part of the findings from the  investigation into his mother's death. The document had been suppressed on  national security grounds since 1986, but publication in an anti-government  newspaper of allegations concerning aide R. K. Dhawan and a subsequent  parliamentary uproar compelled Gandhi to try to defuse the dispute. The  government also said its own inquiry had cleared Dhawan.  </P></p>

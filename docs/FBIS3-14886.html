			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The press service of Ukraine's border troops has  denied reports by some Ukrainian newspapers that Russia is  allegedly building a so-called Berlin Wall at the border between  Belgorod and Sumy and Kharkov oblasts. As a rule, there is no  smoke without fire. So, a scan of the Russian press has  straightaway made it evident that this information arose from  the head of the Belgorod Oblast administration's resolution on  steps to implement the law of the Russian Federation of 1 April  1993 on the Russian Federation's state border. This resolution  envisages the establishment of a border zone up to 5 km deep on  the territories of a number of Belgorod Oblast rayons, with the  depth of the zone to be measured from the former administrative  border between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine, and the  introduction of a border regime from as early as 1 January 1994.    So what is it that Russia is building?    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] Regrettably, we failed to  obtain information from officials, as both the leadership of the  Grayvoron border post and Belgorod border detachment declined  interviews. The builders, however, were more open.    [Unidentified interviewee] The construction of a customs  passage between Ukraine and Russia is under way here. It is a  complex of dwellings for border guards and border posts for the  passage of motor transport.    [Correspondent] How intensive is the work being done here?    [Interviewee] Very intensive.    [Correspondent] When will you have to finish it?    [Interviewee] Well, some time at the end of March or  beginning of April. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

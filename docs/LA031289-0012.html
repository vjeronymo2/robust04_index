			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: COMING TO AMERICA?  </P> <P> Touchstone Pics has just optioned Gerald L. Posner's grim and ultraviolent  "Warlords of Crime: Chinese Secret Societies -- The New Mafia." It's the true  saga of the secret Chinese Triads that dominate the world heroin trade. From  McGraw-Hill in 1988, it was dubbed by a NY Times reviewer as "powerful,  frightening and, unfortunately, nonfiction."  </P> <P> The book spans generations and continents, and Posner is curious about how  Hollywood will adapt it.  </P> <P> "It's episodic," he told us. "There's not a central character who weaves  throughout. You could almost make a dozen different movies from it."  </P> <P> But, he continued, "(film) audiences have already responded to really wonderful  movies -- like the 'Godfather' films -- about organized crime. This is even  more sinister, plus it's exotic."  </P> <P> He said there's an added twist to his mobster material: Because Hong Kong  reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, the crime syndicates there -- which  deal in "tens of billions of dollars annually" -- are seeking "new homes" and  are headed to the U.S.  </P> <P> Touchstone, said a source close to the film, is now looking for a writer "to  research the book and create a story."

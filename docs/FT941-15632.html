			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Lobbyists bombard Clinton health plan with heavy criticism Lobbying against President Bill Clinton's health care reform plan is intensifying as Congress prepares to return to Washington this month for a session likely to be dominated by health legislation. A group of right-wing economists - including Professor Milton Friedman, a monetarist Nobel prize-winner, and Mr Michael Boskin, former President Bush's top economic adviser - yesterday issued a letter attacking any inclusion of price controls in a reform plan. 'Your plan sets the fees charged by doctors and hospitals, caps annual spending on health care, limits insurance premiums and imposes price limitations on new and existing drugs,' the 565 economists said. Mr Alan Blinder, a member of the White House council of economic advisers, retorted that market incentives and competition formed the first line of defence in the administration plan, with caps on the growth of medical spending serving only as a back-up. But Professor Alain Enthoven, the Stanford University economist whose concept of managed competition provided the germ for Mr Clinton's plan, said separately that the plan was flawed by the inclusion of price controls. Also, the New York Times reported that the American Medical Association was circulating to other medical lobbying groups a list of 37 changes it wants in the Clinton plan, including demands for an exemption for doctors from anti-trust laws and the elimination of curbs on doctors' fees. The AMA has been ambivalent about Mr Clinton's reform plan, backing away at its half-yearly congress last month from earlier support for the idea of obliging US employers to pay most of the cost of their employees' health insurance - the central financing plank of the Clinton plan. But associations of general practitioners, paediatricians and nurses have been much more enthusiastic about a reform plan that is expected to shift earnings away from the specialists who dominate US medical practice. The employer mandate is also expected to be the main target for attack by Republicans and centre-right Democrats when the reform legislation is debated in Congress. Doubts about core elements of the plan could undermine Congressional enthusiasm for passing any kind of ambitious reform in this election year. Some Republicans are already arguing that there is no urgent need for sweeping reform. White House officials were dismayed when Senator Pat Moynihan, Democratic chairman of the Senate finance committee, also declared last weekend that there was no health care crisis, insisting that he would not allow welfare reform to be pushed aside in favour of health legislation.</p>

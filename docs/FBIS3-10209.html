			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish of 10  February 1994 on page 4 reports that the Banco del Campo  (Bancam) is scheduled to open in April. The new bank was  organized by the National Union of Farmers and Cattlemen (UNAG),  whose 125,000 members will more easily receive credit, according  to UNAG President Daniel Nunez. The article notes that Bancam  will give priority to small and medium agricultural and  livestock producers. Bancam manager Luis Morales Uriarte  stresses that the bank will offer all the services available at  any commercial bank: "We are aware that in the beginning we will  not respond to all the credit needs of small and medium  producers, but within four or five years we hope to have a  strong presence in the financial sector." Bancam is receiving  financial support from Rabo Bank of the Netherlands, Credit  Agricole of France, HIVOS, and Stichting Doen.</p>

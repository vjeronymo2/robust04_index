			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SOCIALISTS IN GERMANY, EMPTY STREETS;  </P> <P> ELECTION: A SERIES OF DISASTERS HAVE SET THE PARTY UP FOR A LIKELY DRUBBING IN  UNIFIED NATIONAL VOTING.  </P> <P> With flags flying and loudspeaker blaring, the bright little car trundled  optimistically into this eastern German farming community -- a one-vehicle  caravan dispatched to spread the socialist message among those preparing to  vote in Sunday's national elections.  </P> <P> There was only one problem: the streets were empty.  </P> <P> Stopping only long enough for a few curious residents to peer out their windows  and see the letters "SPD" -- Social Democratic Party -- on the flags, the car  spewed forth a brief, indecipherable message followed by a few bars of heavy  "oom-pah" music, then exited as it came.  </P> <P> Although only a fleeting moment in a long campaign, the incident in many ways  captured the poorly organized, occasionally farcical effort that has  characterized the Social Democrats' attempt to wrest power away from Chancellor  Helmut Kohl's center-right coalition.  </P> <P> This disorganization is part of a wider set of problems plaguing the  traditional party of Germany's moderate left, turning what by rights should be  its hour of triumph into an electoral struggle that carries all the earmarks of  an impending disaster.  </P> <P> Former Social Democrat Chancellor Helmut Schmidt dismayed his party colleagues  as much by the truth as by the lack of tact in his recent comment to a Dutch  newspaper that not only would the party lose the first free all-German  elections in nearly 60 years next Sunday, but it deserved to lose.  </P> <P> Despite the upbeat rhetoric of the party's ill-chosen chancellor candidate,  Oskar Lafontaine, leading political opinion polls show that with the election  only days away, the Social Democrats trail Kohl's Christian Democrats by 10 to  12 percentage points and the combined total of Kohl's coalition parties by as  much as 22.4 percentage points.  </P> <P> "No one with such a large lead has ever before been overhauled," said Reichard  Schneider, an election pollster at the INFAS opinion survey organization in  Bonn.  </P> <P> Instead of contemplating victory, the SPD officials are considering the very  real prospects of their worst drubbing since the party was revamped into a  mass-based party in the late 1950s.  </P> <P> Just over a year ago, they exuded confidence. The party was level or ahead of  Kohl's Christian Democrats in the West German opinion polls, and its leaders  spoke confidently of a built-in majority among the predominantly northern,  Protestant -- and traditionally socialist -- regions of eastern Germany.  </P> <P> It was a majority that would likely ensure the party's dominance for decades  once unification occurred, they believed.  </P> <P> But instead of guaranteeing the Social Democrats power, the unification process  brought a series of setbacks that, collectively, completely reversed party  fortunes.  </P> <P> The problems first surfaced a month before the Berlin Wall collapsed in  November, 1989, when a group of East Germans founded an eastern Social  Democratic Party in defiance of the Communist authorities still in power there.  </P> <P> Unsure at that point if the East German Communist regime would survive, the  party's western leadership hesitated for weeks before extending its official  recognition to the new group. This move poisoned relations between the party's  eastern and western wings after the subsequent Communist collapse, and it  remains a sore point, inhibiting meaningful cooperation.  </P> <P> Such hesitation characterized later moves.  </P> <P> Reluctant to forsake years of carefully constructed political contacts with  East Germany, the West German Social Democrats found themselves both incapable  of adjusting to the speed of unification and hopelessly out of touch with the  public mood in the east.  </P> <P> They argued for a slow, deliberate course toward unity when most East Germans  wanted it immediately. They tried to put off national elections when East  Germans wanted them soon. They stoked fears about the huge costs of unity when  the nation wanted most to savor its reunion.  </P> <P> As Kohl sensed the moment and threw himself behind unification, Lafontaine  seemed to resist events.  </P> <P> The results were disastrous.  </P> <P> Instead of winning the East German national elections last March as they  assumed they would, the Social Democrats won only 21.8% of the vote and were  crushed by the Christian Democrats.  </P> <P> In May, the SPD lost local government elections and in an October vote managed  to gain power in only one of the five new federal states created from what had  been East Germany.  </P> <P> The dismal showings have only deepened differences within the party.  </P> <P> Serious, sometimes open, clashes over policy and tactics have left Lafontaine  isolated from the party's mainstream and adopting almost a flip, uncaring  attitude in the final days of the campaign.  </P> <P> An April assassination attempt against him also left Lafontaine noticeably more  detached from the political debate.  </P> <P> While Lafontaine, despite the party's difficulties, has drawn well in western  cities nearer his Saarland home, Social Democrats' efforts in eastern Germany  have been hampered by the sense of futility that characterized the party's  recent foray into this small village.  </P> <P> On the Magdeburg city square, where 70,000 greeted former Social Democratic  Chancellor Willy Brandt last December, barely 1,000 turned out for Lafontaine  in September.  </P> <P> "The collapse of Stalinism should have begun a decade of social democracy," a  senior party official in Bonn said recently. "Instead, there will be a search  for scapegoats, for what went wrong and for a new identity."  </P></p>

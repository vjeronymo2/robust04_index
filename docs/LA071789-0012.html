			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIRE DOES $500,000 DAMAGE TO BRIDGE; 3 BOYS ARRESTED  </P> <P> Three youths are believed to have ignited a fire Saturday afternoon that caused  about $500,000 damage to a bridge and roadway in San Marcos, authorities said  Sunday.  </P> <P> The youths, boys ranging in age from 10 to 13, were arrested Saturday by  sheriff's arson investigators on suspicion of starting an unlawful fire,  according to Sgt. Julie Sutton.  </P> <P> Witnesses saw three young boys running from the area where a bridge on Valpreda  Road near Mission Road was engulfed in flames, Sutton said. Sheriff's  investigators found a large gasoline can near the fire's origin underneath the  bridge.  </P> <P> The boys told authorities that they emptied the can into a stream running  underneath the bridge, Sutton said. One of the boys ignited the gasoline and  the bridge, which was made of a combination of asphalt and timber, immediately  caught fire.  </P> <P> "It put out a pretty good column of smoke," said San Marcos Fire Capt. Michael  Marks. No one was injured in the blaze and no vehicles were damaged, Marks  said. The bridge, about 25 to 30-feet, is closed to traffic pending a  structural analysis, Marks said.  </P> <P> The boys were taken to the sheriff's substation in Vista and later released  into the custody of their parents, Sutton said.  </P></p>

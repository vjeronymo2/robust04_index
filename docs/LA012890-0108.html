			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL BUSH LET THIS ONE GET AWAY?;  </P> <P> TAX CUT: THE GOP SHOULD LEAP AT MOYNIHAN'S ORPHANED PROPOSAL, AND ADD A FEW  OFITS OWN TO BRING THE REAGAN REVOLUTION TO THE MIDDLE CLASS.  </P> <P> While one is hesitant to hand out advice to a President "rocking along" at 80%  public approval, George Bush is making a terrible mistake not seizing on Pat  Moynihan's Social Security tax cut.  </P> <P> The biggest fish of the year, a whopper, is sitting right in front of his boat.  All Bush has to do is gaff it, grab this $55-billion tax cut, add on his own  popular capital-gains tax cut, attach Lloyd Bentsen's IRA proposal, rechristen  the package, "Peace Dividend," and make it his first priority on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> Congress could not resist. Liberals and conservatives would be scrambling to  endorse. The GOP's best issue -- they are the party of taxes; we, the party of  tax cuts -- would be driven home to those working- and middle-class Americans  who missed out on the Reagan Revolution.  </P> <P> A Social Security tax cut is an engraved invitation to the Bush Party of the  '90s, for all who did not get in on the Reagan Party of the '80s. Here is a way  to reach black America that does not alienate white America.  </P> <P> When the Peace Dividend passed, every worker in the nation could be sent a  message just before November's election: "Beginning Jan. 1, your paycheck will  be increased by X amount of dollars." Signed, George Bush. For working couples,  the increase in take-home pay could run to $1,000 a year. Every investor could  be told in a national address: Hold your assets until Jan. 1, then, take those  capital gains and reinvest.  </P> <P> Making this tax cut the altarpiece of the Bush program will shove onto the back  burner the entire Democratic social agenda. The Dodd day-care bill could be  shunted onto a side track, with the argument that, with this tax cut, we are  giving working parents both the money and the freedom to choose what kind of  day care they prefer. Tax cuts are a win-win proposition for the GOP. How can  the party of the people lose a bidding war where the winner is one who cuts  deeper into the diet of Big Government?  </P> <P> Budget Director Richard Darman calls the Moynihan tax cut the "most  irresponsible idea of the '90s," a "grenade . . . thrown into the middle of the  House and Senate." From the paralyzed reaction of Speaker Tom Foley and Senate  Leader George Mitchell, however, the only thing wrong with that grenade is that  it was not a cluster bomb.  </P> <P> Has anybody seen Jack Kemp? Ten years ago, he, Bill Steiger and Bill Roth in  the Senate led the GOP in proposing a tax cut in the teeth of Jimmy Carter's  deficits. Seized upon by Ronald Reagan, that idea helped lead to the  Conservative Decade of the 1980s.  </P> <P> Critics claim that tax cuts cause deficits, but deficits did not harm the party  in '84 or '88. And deficits have benefits: First, they converted the Democrats,  rhetorically at least, to the theology of balanced budgets; second, they killed  all enthusiasm for new social spending. The only major social program enacted  in the Reagan Decade was catastrophic health insurance, later repealed. The  GOP's strategic deficit has given the Big Spenders a 10-year cold shower.  </P> <P> To borrow the title of Edgar Allen Poe's short story, tax cuts, combined with  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit targets, are The Pit and the Pendulum of the  Great Society, an infernal machine for down-sizing the welfare state and  defunding the left.  </P> <P> Under the pressure of tax cuts and Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, federal spending has  fallen from 24% of gross national product to 21% in the coming fiscal year,  while revenues, thanks to Ronald Reagan, still take 19%. If the GOP can cut  revenues back to 18%, spending must fall to 20% of GNP, then 19%, then, 18%.  Why would the party of Bob Taft oppose that?  </P> <P> Does Gramm-Rudman-Hollings hit defense spending too hard? Yes, but the  President can use the bully pulpit, and supplemental appropriations, to keep  defense strong, and force Democrats to pay the price of selling out national  security.  </P> <P> There are vast areas of government that need a sharp knife: foreign aid and  farm subsidies (which totaled $105 billion in the last five years), and aid to  the cities. Indeed, why do Republican Presidents run deficits to send tens of  billions to cities led by Democratic mayors? Why should GOP Administrations  subsidize the subways of Mayors David Dinkins and Marion Barry? A rollback of  urban spending would force governors and mayors to cut their own spending (and  take the heat), or raise local taxes (and take the heat). Considering the  plight of the Little Duke in Taxachussetts, the budget crisis of Mario Cuomo in  New York, can not Republicans see that, with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings in place,  tax cuts are an automatic formula for rolling back the Great Society and  capturing all the heights of national politics?  </P> <P> Ten years ago, the Republican Party of Gerald Ford could not see the benefits  of tax cuts. If the party of President Bush cannot see the merit of seizing on  the Moynihan bill, of making tax cuts the GOP agenda of the '90s, then  conservatives must show the way, as they did a decade ago.  </P></p>

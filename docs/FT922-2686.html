			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Surge in foreign bank loans in US FOREIGN BANKS now control nearly half the commercial and industrial loan market in the US, according to a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The study, in the New York Fed's Quarterly Review, says a recent surge in the offshore booking of foreign bank loans to US companies gave non-US banks 45 per cent of the loan market at the end of 1991, compared with 18 per cent in 1983. The Fed study attributes the build-up in foreign bank corporate loans to two main factors: European and Japanese banks have enjoyed lower funding costs than their US counterparts, allowing them to accept smaller spreads on loans; Some non-US bank lenders, benefiting from their global presence at a time of US retrenchment, have been more attractive to many US corporate treasurers because they offer a wider range of services and knowledge of international banking. US banks had Dollars 428bn (Pounds 230.5bn) of total commercial and industrial loans outstanding at the end of 1991, while foreign banks had Dollars 348bn. Offshore-booked foreign bank loans to US companies jumped to Dollars 152bn by the end of 1991, from Dollars 20bn in 1983, while US bank lending booked offshore rose from Dollars 17bn to Dollars 22bn. Also between 1983 and 1991, the amount of loans by foreign banks booked in the US increased from Dollars 66bn to Dollars 196bn. Loans by US banks booked in the US rose from Dollars 364bn to Dollars 407bn. The Fed points to three implications of the rapid rise in offshore credits to US business: The accumulation of debt by US companies was more rapid than previously thought, and the recent drop in bank lending far less striking; More of the corporate funding for US companies was supplied by banks, both US and foreign, and less by the securities market than was thought; Commercial bank lending has become a more foreign-dominated US business sector than the US car or chemicals industries. Mr Jim McDermott, president of New York bank analysts Keefe Bruyette, said: 'There has been a gun-shy attitude on the part of many US bankers because of the three main loan debacles of recent years - the less developed country problems, the energy loan portfolio losses and the commercial real estate loan problem.'</p>

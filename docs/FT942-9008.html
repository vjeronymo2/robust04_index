			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Brown's bandwagon starts to roll The complexities of Labour's leadership battle deepened yesterday as friends of Mr Gordon Brown suggested that he might stand against Mr Tony Blair, his close ally, and Mr Jack Cunningham re-emerged as a potential candidate. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, was also said to have put off a decision on whether to stand until after the European parliament election on June 9. Aides of Mr Brown, the shadow chancellor, said he was being urged to stand by union officials concerned about the media bandwagon building up behind Mr Blair, the shadow home secretary. Friends of the men had earlier indicated that one of the two would stand down to avoid blurring the so-called 'modernist' message to which both subscribe. Mr Brown's friends said, however, he believed it would be possible for both to stand without damaging their friendship. Mr Brown is expected to proceed only if it appears that his support among constituency members and trade-union levy payers is significantly stronger than Mr Blair's. Most MPs said Mr Brown's position appeared untenable, given the strong support within the parliamentary party for Mr Blair. Others said the outcome would be uncertain if several candidates decided to take advantage of the preferential voting system to stand. Mr Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, was said to be thinking of standing if he could rely on the support of about 60 MPs.</p>

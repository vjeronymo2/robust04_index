			<p>BFN     [Text] A senior spokesman for the Sri Lankan Government  told LANKAPUVATH yesterday that the fresh peace talks offer made  by the LTTE [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam] terrorists  through the BBC fell far short of the requirements for the  government to resume negotiations between the government and the  terrorist organization [words indistinct]. He described the new  peace talks offer made by the LTTE ideologist, Anton  Balasingham, to the BBC in Jaffna as an old song with a new  tune. The only concession the Tigers had made was the  cease-fire which is tantamount to the laying down of arms, which  is one of the preconditions laid down by the government. If the  LTTE was genuinely interested in settling the problem they  should contact the Sri Lankan Government direct and not use  intermediaries as ploys. They should inform the government of  the framework of their proposals. The senior government  spokesman said that the Sri Lanka Government has a precondition  also stated that the LTTE leader Prabhakaran should deal direct  with the government and not through his spokesman and  intermediaries. In addition, the government requires that all  political parties should take part in the peace talks. Once  these preconditions were met, the Sri Lankan Government was  willing to (?listen) to them resuming negotiations to end the  crisis and terrorism.    Meanwhile, a military spokesman told LANKAPUVATH that  preparations were being finalized for an all out onslaught which  would end LTTE terrorism and restore peace in the northeastern  region.</p>

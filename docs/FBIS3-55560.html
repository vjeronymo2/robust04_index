Among the address' authors were directors of Kurchatov's  Institute of Nuclear Physics, Institute of Physics of Russia's  Academy of Sciences, Institute of Physical Chemistry, Russian  Research Centre of Applied Chemistry and the All-Russian  Research Institute of Electric Machinery.    The letter was written in response to a resolution adopted  in  December 1993 by the presidium of the Russian Academy of  Sciences. The resolution said that the modern crisis of "the  eldest scientific organization of the country" was largely  caused by the lack of budgetary funds "passing through the  Ministry of Science."    The presidium of the academy urged to reshuffle the Ministry  of Science to the corresponding state committee which would  focus solely on federal R &amp; D programs, and not on  independent R  &amp; D projects. In other case, the academy leaders warned they  would submit a resolution of no confidence to Science Minister  Boris Saltykov.    However, scientists who addressed Yeltsin wrote that such a  policy would even further aggravate the collapse of science in  Russia protesting against "the departmental principle of money  distribution" as it "will result in equal empoverishment (of all  institutions)." On the contrary, it would be better to keep  pursuing the ministerial policy aimed at financing priority  studies, they concluded.</p>

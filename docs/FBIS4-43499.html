			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rainer Nahrendorf: "The Free Democratic Party </F> Wants the Solidarity Surcharge To Phase Out as Soon as Possible"]    [Text] Bonn, 15 Jun -- According to Economics Minister  Guenter Rexrodt, the upswing should not lead anyone to postpone  a solution to structural problems, which in the minister's view  include high labor cost, high tax burdens, and the inflexible  labor market.    Federal Economics Minister Rexrodt considers it possible  that  economic growth in all of Germany will be more than 1.5  percentage points in 1994. He does not know by how many tenths  percentage points higher economic growth might be, but it could  be about 2 percent, he said in a HANDELSBLATT interview.    The upswing in the new federal laender is under way, and the  flourishing landscapes are coming. Rexrodt is soon expecting a  self-supporting recovery process.    Rexrodt considers it very likely that the price increase  rate  in 1994 will be less than 3 percent on an annual average. The  minister also sees a good chance that the price increase rate  will develop in the direction of 2 percent in 1995 -- however,  with a GDP growth of at least 2.5 percent, it is likely to be 3  percent.    The cyclical tail wind should by no means lead anyone to  relax efforts to solve the structural problems of the German  economy or even postpone a solution. The 1994 pay negotiations,  which involved the renunciation of pay increases, have generally  gone well, according to Rexrodt. The wage and salary  settlements were in accordance with the situation. What was  even more important, however, was the fact that the beginning of  the flexibilization of working hours had been successful.  Rexrodt said that a return to full employment required the  comprehensive flexibilization of the labor market.    Commenting on collective pay negotiations in 1995, 1996, and  1997, Rexrodt said that if economic development improved, it  would not be economically possible or defensible for real  incomes to decrease further. However, Rexrodt also assumes that  the trade unions are aware of the changes in international  competition. He hopes the trade unions have realized that there  is no scope for redistribution, and the development of wages in  the next few years must be strictly oriented at productivity.  "If we deviate from the productivity-oriented course just  because the cycle has improved a bit, Germany will miss the  opportunity to improve the competitiveness of its economic  sector."    To create more flexibility on the labor market, changes  would  have to be made in the pay agreements and legal framework  conditions. An important element was the abolition of the  Federal Employment Office's monopoly regarding finding  employment. In addition, more flexibility should be introduced  without extending standard working hours. Under certain  conditions, it should also be possible to work on weekends.  Compensation periods for average weekly working hours should be  expanded. Over the long term, annual working hours would be  required. This was the best way to balance seasonal  fluctuations. Rexrodt also advocated abolishing the declaration  of general application of collective agreements, and orienting  collective agreements to a larger degree at the development of  sectors, regions, and companies. He also called for revision  clauses in collective agreements to allow companies to take a  deterioration or improvement of the situation into account.  <H5>  Taxes </H5>   Rexrodt said the taxes and surcharges in Germany were too  high and in some areas even prohibitively high. The Free  Democratic Party [FDP] intended to reduce the tax burden. The  liberals wanted the solidarity surcharge to be abolished as soon  as possible. Rexrodt went beyond the decision on the solidarity  surcharge that the FDP made at its party congress in Rostock.  As economics minister, he would like to achieve agreement on  the phasing out of the solidarity surcharge. In this context, a  step-by-step reduction could be agreed upon. Such timeframe  would be the right economic and political signal. The citizens  would then believe the coalition that it considered the  solidarity surcharge a special burden caused by the former GDR's  old debt, and no new tax that was secretly imposed for an  indefinite period of time.    In addition, such an agreement on the timeframe could  produce  a useful effect on the consolidation of public budgets, even  though he recognized that Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel  was seriously working at the consolidation. Rexrodt admitted,  however, that it was currently impossible to agree with the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU] on  the phasing out of the solidarity surcharge.    Reducing and finally abolishing the solidarity surcharge  was also necessary to lower the whole tax rate, said Rexrodt.  He said 1997 was a realistic and timely perspective for the  abolition of the solidarity surcharge and a linear reduction of  the whole tax rate. The leeway that would be created in the  1996 and 1997 budgets should not be used to give in to new  demands.    Rexrodt advocated the abolition of the trade capital tax and  a 50-percent reduction of the trade income tax as well as  abolition of the company capital tax.    If the Federal Constitutional Court were to declare the  standard values unconstitutional, too high taxes on commercial  or private real estate property should be prevented. Real  estate investment should continue to be worthwhile.    Rexrodt said the reduction of the tax rate for business  incomes, which was introduced with the law on safeguarding  Germany as an investment center, should be extended to all  incomes. The wage and income tax rate should be reduced. The  FDP demands in its election platform that the high income tax  rate be reduced to less than 45 percent over the medium and long  term.    If the trade tax was abolished or reduced, the splitting  system for private and business incomes would no longer be  necessary, said Rexrodt.    The economics minister believes that the introduction of tax  allowances for risk capital according to the example of Section  16 of the former law promoting the Berlin economy should be  considered. Under that law, funds that were made available for  investment in Berlin were deductible.    However, Rexrodt also rejected new subsidies or tax  allowances for medium-sized companies. Lower tax rates would be  much more helpful for such companies, he said. Therefore, they  should be introduced as soon as possible. Announcing subsidies  and allowances would only cause investors to adopt a  wait-and-see attitude, and was always connected with a steering  of investment. Rexrodt: "The taxes must be reduced. This is  the best way to promote medium-sized companies."    Rexrodt warned about changing the inheritance tax and the  property tax. He said this would only deprive people of the  success of their work. It would not serve investment and would  frustrate people.  <H5>  Ecology </H5>   According to Rexrodt, ecological taxes can only be  introduced  in the European context. In addition, the introduction of an  ecological component into the tax system would have to be  connected with a net tax relief for companies and citizens.  Only if these conditions were met, could ecological elements be  introduced into the tax system to reduce energy consumption and  the emission of pollutants.    He said the FDP advocated introducing market economy  elements  into ecological policy. A carbon dioxide tax would be such an  element. Basically, this tax would reward those who helped the  environment, and punish those who excessively burdened the  environment. This would be a good and consistent approach.  Rexrodt doubts, however, that an energy/carbon dioxide tax can  be introduced in Europe by 2000 under the stated conditions. He  said German politicians were working on this project.    In Rexrodt's view, the transition from car tax to petroleum  tax should be linked to the introduction of a carbon  dioxide/energy tax. It should not be touched prior to the  introduction of that tax. Private and professional drivers are  facing enough burdens already. With a view to the unavoidable  energy tax, no more experiments should be made with the  petroleum tax.  <H5>  Consolidation </H5>   Rexrodt said that the thorny path of general consolidation  in  public finances must be continued. This includes economizing in  all fields of expenditure, including traditional subsidies.  This Sisyphean task must be undertaken on drawing up each new  budget. The coal subsidies will have to be further reduced in  the medium term. However, this will not be possible until after  the year 2000, when reductions set in. Shipping and shipyards  in Europe also urgently require a general cut in subsidies.  Anyone touching agricultural subsidies must be aware of the  fact that this means attacking one of the pillars of a common  Europe. Economically speaking, cuts in agricultural subsidies  may be urgently necessary, but one should apply caution due to  European aspects, Rexrodt said. The thorough screening of the  entire budget does, of course, also include social items.    Each new subsidy must be limited in time and as degressive  as  possible. This also goes for subsidies in the new laender.  Rexrodt admitted, however, that this principle could hardly be  sustained in agriculture.  <H5>  Postal Reform II </H5>   Rexrodt fiercely criticized the behavior of the German  Postal  Trade Union in applying the social wage agreement under phase II  of the postal reform. What he finds hard to understand is not  only the behavior of the trade union, but also the resonance  that the union has with the Social Democrats. In view of the  German telecommunication industry's competitiveness, the postal  union's behavior is irresponsible in the medium and long term.  This behavior endangers jobs in one of the few growth sectors.  Rexrodt fears that other postal companies will take over most  of the business if the German post enterprises cannot operate at  the same conditions as other private enterprises.</p>

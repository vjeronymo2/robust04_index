With the details Nikolay Mamuashvili.    [Mamuashvili] Apart from the signing of a large, so-called  Framework Treaty on friendship and good-neighborliness, the  sides examined and signed a whole package of agreements  envisaging cooperation between the countries in virtually all  spheres and fields. I will remind you that before the official  signing ceremony, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the head  of the Georgian state, Eduard Shevardnadze, had a one-on-one  meeting. The heads of the Georgian and Russian foreign  political departments -- Aleksandr Chikvaidze and Andrey Kozyrev  -- also had talks and a discussion on questions of mutual  interest behind closed doors. Otar Patsatsia, the republican  prime minister, met with Oleg Soskovets, and Jaba Ioseliani, a  Georgian parliament deputy, had talks with Russian Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev.    At the conclusion of these meetings the sides stressed that  they were completely satisfied with the results achieved. In an  interview for an IPRINDA agency correspondent, Andrey Kozyrev  said, I quote: We see the Interstate Treaty as a symbol for  settling the conflict in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, solving the  problem of the republic's Russian-speaking population, and other  no less important issues.    The so-called military part of the talks is also evoking  undoubted interest. Russian Defense Minister Grachev, after his  meeting with Jaba Ioseliani, said that he was also happy with  the talks. He said that it was possible that three Russian  military bases would be deployed in Georgia. As far as the  subunits of Russian troops stationed in Abkhazia are concerned,  they are now subordinate to General Fedor Reut, the commander of  the Transcaucasian Group of Troops -- all with the exception of  the 345th Parachute Assault Regiment that remains subordinate to  Moscow, and Jaba Ioseliani said that all that the sides are now  doing is being done on mutually advantageous conditions without  any encroachments [ushchemleniya].</p>

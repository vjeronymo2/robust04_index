			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ADVENTURES IN BABY-SITTING: MEET THE "AU PAIR FROM HELL"  </P> <P> A nanny from Montana became the "au pair from hell" to a couple who says she  wrecked their car and racked up more than $70,000 in bad checks.  </P> <P> Laurie Bronson and Robert Dolinko said they wanted a wholesome live-in from the  heartland to help out while Bronson spent the rest of her pregnancy with her  second child in bed, on her doctor's advice.  </P> <P> "We'd heard horror stories about the foreign girls who just want to come to  California for a good time," said Bronson, a psychotherapist. "So we thought,  'Oh great, we'll get someone from the Midwest.' "  </P> <P> But the couple ended up with an "au pair from hell story," she said.  </P> <P> They hired 18-year-old Angela Marie Sandberg on July 16 through All-American  Childcare Inc., an Orange County company that supplies au pairs.  </P> <P> Sandberg, of Lolo, Mont., promptly wrecked the couple's car after driving it to  a nightclub, Bronson said.  </P> <P> They fired her July 30, then their telephone started ringing. Clothing boutique  owners and grocers left with their ex-nanny's checks wanted their money,  Bronson said.  </P> <P> Berkeley police arrested Sandberg on Sept. 7 at an Emeryville motel after her  boyfriend tried to cash a $15,000 check she had written to him so he could  start his own business, Police Cpl. Michael Sloan said.  </P></p>

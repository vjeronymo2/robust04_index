			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Chernobyl decision urged by France France said yesterday the Group of Seven should decide in Naples to help furnish Ukraine with an alternative nuclear energy supply to Chernobyl - using Ukrainian, even Russian, equipment if western suppliers remained hesitant because of unresolved civil liability problems. Ms Anne Lauvergeon, the French summit 'sherpa' who has visited Ukraine to try to work out a plan for Chernobyl, said Ukrainian and Russian companies could do much of the work. She was responding to a warning at an international conference this week that western suppliers' fears about their liability for possible claims arising from equipment supplied could undermine any decision in Naples. Lord Marshall, a former UK nuclear industrialist who chaired the conference on nuclear liability, organised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, said special immunity agreements which the US had reached with Ukraine and Russia, and which the European Union hopes to negotiate soon, still provided inadequate cover for western nuclear suppliers. Nor were Russia and Ukraine yet ready to follow east European countries in signing the Vienna convention on nuclear liability, partly because no large western countries had. As a result, he said, western companies found it 'hard to justify to their shareholders why they should supply nuclear equipment to the east, for not much profit and the small possibility of a big loss'. Ms Lauvergeon said the G7 had to convince Ukraine it was not just acting as the mouthpiece of western anti-nuclear lobbies. It was also important to offer Ukraine the same sort of general financial backing for its economic reforms and political stability as had been offered Russia. The plan, discussed in the G7 since 1992, to close Chernobyl's four reactors, finish three other near-completed reactors elsewhere in Ukraine, and bring them up to western safety standards would cost Dollars 1.5bn, the Elysee official said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Tae-yong] </F>   [Text] Seoul, Jan. 20 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's  view of North Korea and unification seems little different from  those of his predecessors, but he does have a stronger desire to  improve inter-Korean relations than they did.    Kim clarified this view on Thursday, after a policy briefing  from Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok.    In the current international situation, where every country  is competing fiercely, the Korean people cannot survive unless  they realize unification as soon as possible, he told Yi.    Kim instructed his minister to develop inter-Korean  relations  so that a South-North Korean commonwealth is established during  his term in office, which ends in February 1998.    Although he is eager to see inter-Korean relations improved,  he has one condition: Settlement of the North Korean nuclear  problem.    "The government should solve the nuclear problem, which is  blocking improvement of inter-Korean relations, this year  without fail to revitalize inter-Korean reconciliation and  cooperation," he told Yi.    Once the nuclear problem is solved, the government should  push ahead with the promotion of mutual interests and  improvement of relations, Kim said.    "First of all, the government should make a breakthrough in  solving the nuclear problem through an exchange of special  envoys, and then it should push ahead with exchange and  cooperation with North Korea," he said.    Inter-Korean relations were cool last year because of the  suspicions about North Korea's nuclear development program.    Kim told Yi that he was sure that North Korea had no choice  but to change its policies soon, and said that the government  should use the change as an opportunity to improve inter-Korean  relations.    Since North Korea is in a very difficult situation at home  and abroad, it cannot avoid changing its policies. When North  Korea begins to show a willingness to solve the nuclear problem,  the international situation surrounding the Korean peninsula  will change rapidly, he said.    The government should use the change for a stable  improvement  in inter-Korean relations and, ultimately, to realize peaceful  unification.    "For those goals, the National Unification Board should push  ahead with diverse inter-Korean talks and North Korea policies,"  Kim said.    He reassured Yi that he will not seek absorption like in  Germany, but warned him that the people should guard against  sentimental theories of unification.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / International Company News: Longuet favours Renault link with Mercedes-Benz Mr Gerard Longuet, the French industry minister, said yesterday that he favoured closer links between Renault, the state-owned motor group, and Mercedes-Benz of Germany. 'I would like every opportunity to be seized for Mercedes and Renault to co-operate, be it in trucks or cars,' he said at the Paris motor show. Mr Longuet's comments are the latest indication of mutual interest between the two groups. Last week, Mr Helmut Werner, chairman of Mercedes, described Renault as 'a very attractive partner'. In an interview with Le Figaro newspaper, Mr Werner said that discussions had been held with Renault. He raised the possibility of co-operation in the development and production of components, arguing that increased competition in the international motor industry was forcing companies to find economies of scale. 'There are many things we can do together,' said Mr Werner. He rejected, however, the idea of a merger. 'Mercedes is not for marrying,' he said. Following the collapse of its merger plans with Volvo of Sweden at the end of 1993, Renault is also seeking to forge partnerships to reduce costs. Earlier this year, for example, it announced an agreement with Fiat of Italy for the joint production and development of truck cabins. Renault already has agreements for the co-production of components with other car groups, including Peugeot, its domestic rival. Mr Longuet said Renault had attained a level of quality which made it an acceptable partner for Mercedes. The French government is launching a partial privatisation of Renault, which will bring its shareholding down from 80 per cent to just above 50 per cent. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has said that a complete privatisation must await the formation of industrial partnerships which can secure Renault's position in the international industry. Analysts expect strong demand for shares in Renault's flotation, partly because of the limited nature of the operation and the strong performance of the company. In an interview in the weekly magazine, La Synthese Financiere, Mr Louis Schweitzer, Renault chairman, repeated his prediction that the group would see a sharp increase in profits this year. In 1993, Renault reported profits of FFr1.07bn (Dollars 200m).</p>

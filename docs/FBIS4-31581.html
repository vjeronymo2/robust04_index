			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eva Zelenayova] </F>   [Excerpts] The first Wednesday of each month only  seemingly belongs to the residents of Bratislava. No one with  even the slightest chance of getting into Bratislava to attend  the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] rally misses an  opportunity to hear Vladimir Meciar and his coworkers speak.  This week, too, the banners in the "Na Pasienkoch" indoor  stadium revealed that people from Prievidza, Topolcany, Nove  Zamky, and Komarno, as well as Slovaks from the United States,  were present. [passage omitted]    As usual, HZDS Chairman Vladimir Meciar was the first to  take  the floor: [passage omitted] "Esteemed ladies and gentlemen,  allow me to thank all of you who have come here this evening to  meet HZDS members and leading officials and their present and  future coalition partners. (applause, followed by the reminder  that today is the Day of the Child) Our rallies will soon  require a bigger stadium. (....) The rallies attract  considerable attention; no lesser person than the president  himself is their commentator. (applause) Whenever we meet, it  creates ripples, and there is something to write about. (....)  Over the past two weeks, I crisscrossed Slovakia from east to  west, and everywhere I came across uncertainty, irritation,  unrest, and a longing for action. It is becoming apparent that  it was a big mistake to postpone the elections until September.  They should have been over by the end of June because  parliament and society (unceasing applause) are getting into a  deep depression and parliament into a profound moral and  political crisis. Of course, the developments of the past few  weeks raise questions and call for answers. First of all, I  would like to pause to consider some activities of the  government that distress us. There is nothing to praise, nor  will there be anything to praise. But there are plenty of  things to rail against and many reasons to swear. First of all,  the political background of the government had been shrouded in  fog and concealed. Everyone was telling us that we were lying  when we spoke about the existence of an eight-point agreement  between the government and the Hungarian political parties.  (noise in the hall) Although we can deduce from reports what  these eight points are, we emphatically ask the government to  publish the secret agreements so that we can learn whose vassal  it is and whom it wants to serve. (applause) We want to know  why the government accepted and pledged to implement the program  of the Komarno appeal of January 1994 [containing demands of the  ethnic Hungarian minority], which has been condemned by the  majority of the citizens of Slovakia. Whose government is this?  Who does it represent?"  <H5>  Balladur Plan Is Superfluous </H5>   Vladimir Meciar then devoted himself to the itinerant  activities of the Moravcik government and said, among other  things, that he considers the Balladur plan superfluous in view  of existing agreements. "We want the same rules for all  minorities to be adopted in Europe and for them to have the same  level of protection (applause) in our country that they have in  the West. We are in favor of the codification of those rights,  and then it will not be necessary to conclude agreements calling  in question our position and our situation."    The Socialists' victory in Hungary means no change in policy  regarding the minorities, Vladimir Meciar continued, and  stressed that there will not be any staking out [of  Hungarian-inhabited territory] by means of signposts! "We also  find distressing the questions of guarantees of democracy. We  are turning to citizens before decisive moments. We did not  seek parliamentary intrigues, the disintegration of other  parties, and the infliction of damage on our competitors. We  were looking for a way of expressing the citizens' will. A  constitutional law has been passed, according to which there  will be elections. As we see, however, pressure for the  acquisition of 90 votes [needed to pass constitutional laws]  continues in the National Council, and, as this pressure keeps  growing, fears justifiedly arise about whether we will be able  to defend the election date on parliamentary soil, so that the  elections really take place on 30 September 1994. Therefore, as  soon as the law on referendum is passed, we will initiate a new  collection of signatures for a referendum. (applause)"  <H5>  There Should Have Been a Referendum </H5>   Meciar explained how they became convinced that the  referendum should have been called. The number of valid  signatures that were collected was sufficient: 372,000. He said  that the government's travels were very costly, adding that  "they travel because they know it is the last time." And how  did Vladimir Meciar assess some economic steps of the  government? "We are rightly distressed by what the government  has done. While they proclaimed that they would take over our  policy and carry on what we had done, they are acting in the  typical Moravcikite way--two steps on the spot, the suggestion  of a step forward, and two steps back. Our policy was guided by  a simple philosophy, which said that it is impossible to  economize any more and that, to be able to spend more, it is  necessary to earn more money and to raise earnings. The present  government's policy says that it is still necessary to save.  These savings should squeeze out of citizens about 7.5 billion  korunas, which will be felt mainly by poor people who cannot  afford it. But entrepreneurs should not think that this does  not concern them because, when the tax on repairs and services,  including public catering, goes up 20 percent, their market will  be reduced in size and many small businessmen will be driven by  this policy to bankruptcy. (....) Because the government  neglects monetary flows, bank credits are becoming more  expensive, and the interest rate on loans has reached 30  percent.... We cannot agree with that. Nor do we identify with  the approach toward privatization. (....) We are against  pseudoprivatization."    Turning to the HZDS program, Meciar said: "We do not  renounce the national program, but it is not the sole pillar; it  is one of the pillars of our program. The time has not yet come  for us to say that the state has become so stable that  everything has been resolved. As long as the process of  definite stabilization is not completed, we do not have the  right to renounce this program, in contrast to those who do not  want to respect either the state or the national program."  [sentence as published] (applause)  <H5>  Sixth Government in Four Years </H5>   At the close of his address, the movement's chairman said:  "We consider it appropriate to adopt, shortly after the  elections, measures to stabilize the political system. The  Slovak Republic cannot continue like this. It will have the  sixth government and the fourth parliament in four years. This  brings enormous losses, which are also expressed in terms of  money." And, before [moderator of HZDS rallies] Gabo Zelenay  grabbed his microphone for a while, he said: "We do not have a  program for ourselves, we have it for Slovakia. (applause) We  are not going to fight against Weiss or Carnogursky. We want to  fight for the Slovak Republic." (applause)    It was time for the citizens' questions. [passage omitted]  An interesting question was addressed to Meciar: What should be  done with deputies so they do not betray again? "First of all, a  law will have to be passed regulating the loss of mandate [of  deputies who leave the party for which they ran in the  elections] because moral and ethical norms have insufficient  impact. A group of subversives cannot be allowed to seek the  state's weakness in the weaknesses of people. [sentence as  published] We assure you that instances of suspected corruption  of people who have left us will all be investigated." [passage  omitted]    [Former Defense Minister] Imrich Andrejcak received  questions  bearing out that, even in the Army, not everything can be kept  secret. "Why did the president appoint Docent Zak, an officer  of Czech nationality, as rector of the Military Academy at  Liptovsky Mikulas? Do we not have enough Slovak officers? He  was appointed because he had been proposed by the minister of  defense, and we do have Slovak officers. The same mistake  occurred in Kosice [seat of the Air Force Academy]. The rector  there is admittedly a Slovak, but a person who cannot himself  fly is training pilots there. (laughter) Under Docent Zak,  teaching in the Czech language was resumed in Liptovsky Mikulas  (booing) and is being tolerated despite Slovak officers'  protests. (....) Here is one long question, which I am not  going to read. I will only say in response that I will propose  to our deputies in parliament that they initiate an inquiry into  whether some functionaries of the Ministry of Defense and the  Ministry of Foreign Affairs are citizens of the Slovak Republic  in the first place." (commotion in the hall) [passage omitted]    At the end, it was again Meciar's turn. Asked about the case  of [Deputy Prime Minister] Roman Kovac, he replied: "He has not  filed any suit against me thus far nor will he file one because  he is afraid of it like the devil of holy water because many of  us heard this admission. It is to this government and  parliament's disgrace that they keep him among themselves. And  it is also his personal disgrace." Replying to a question about  the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL], he said: "We do not  identify the entire SDL with Weiss, Ftacnik, Siroky, and  Dorotin. They represent a deviation [uchylka] in the SDL. SDL  members should therefore ponder what to do when their leadership  deflects." Asked whether it is true that [former chairman of  the Public Against Violence Movement] Fedor Gal is Weiss's  extended arm in Prague, he said: "I cannot confirm that because  I have no information about it. What I do know, however, is  that on Easter Monday in 1992, when the balance of power in  Slovakia was already clear, Messrs. Weiss and Filkus had been  invited to the president [Havel] for talks, the contents of  which we have never been informed. Although we were party  colleagues then, we do not know what happened at the Castle that  day." He explained, furthermore, how two members could  nonchalantly move from one government to the next: "They claim  with haughty calm that everything is okay. They say with haughty  calm that one must not be confrontational. At the same time,  they regard as confrontational everyone who has a different  point of view from that of the present Politburo. But evil must  always be countered. Evil must be resisted even if that means  confrontation. (applause) We are not transcending the limits of  democracy, but we are not going to pretend that everything is in  order only to avoid being labeled confrontational.... According  to this government's understanding, being nonconfrontational and  understanding means being stupid. Don't get excited, they tell  us. We are only going to suck the blood out of you (laughter).  True, that is exactly what they are doing with us. They have  only taken money out of our pockets. They are only threatening  us with the division of the state. They only undignifiedly  represent us abroad and behave there as representatives who are  incapable of managing their own affairs. They only damage social  relations. Otherwise, they have done nothing to harm us, so why  are we not satisfied? All of this is enough for them not to be  where they are now. (....) For this reason, it is necessary that  this dispute be decided by the citizens as soon as possible, and  we must consider which democratic means to use within the  framework of the struggle against them." [passage omitted] The  participants in the rally applauded. The three-hour marathon of  words was coming to an end.</p>

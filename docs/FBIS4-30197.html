			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- Recently, Yun Chin-ok  in Songnam-tong, Kim Chaek City, North Hamgyong Province in the  northern area of Korea, received a 100th birthday table from the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Such a great honor was also granted some time ago to Mrs. Om  in Okchon-ri, Kim Chaek City, Kim San-ok in Wonsan City, Kangwon  Province, and Choe Kyong-ok in Pyongwon County, South Pyongan  Province, on their 103rd, 101st and 100th birthdays.    The number of centenarians is ever increasing in Korea where  the most ideal health policy centred on the popular masses is in  force.    Entering this year, many folks greeted their 100th  birthdays,  among them Chong Chae-myong and Pak Yong-sun in Tokchon City,  South Pyongan Province, Kim Chang-yong in Onchon County, South  Pyongan Province, Kim Kyu-chul in Sonbong County, North Hamgyong  Province, An Sang-o in Naknang district, Pyongyang, and Mrs.  Kwon in Hoeyang County, Kangwon Province.    Deep, indeed, is the loving care of Comrade Kim Chong-il for  them.    Regarding the increasing number of centenarians as a great  pride of the country, he sent birthday tables to all of them and  took various measures so that health care institutions  throughout the country might look after their health with  special care.    In recent years, gerontology departments have made their  appearance in the hospitals of the provincial universities of  medicine and all the macrobian people throughout the country  have been registered again and their health checked up. The  registered long-livers enjoy medical care at central hospitals,  wherever they may live.    The state allots a large amount of fund to the recovery of  their health.    To cite an example, in February, Yi Pong-hwa, 94, in  Hyuam-tong, Sadong district, Pyongyang, had his pneumonia cured  at the Red Cross General Hospital of Korea through a 50-day free  medical treatment that costed the state money equivalent to the  two-year wages of an ordinary worker.    The constant increase in the number of macrobian people in  Korea is attributable to the popular policies of the Workers'  Party of Korea and the DPRK Government, the rapid development of  health services, effective use of many mineral springs, the  systematic improvement of the people's living, the custom of  respecting the old folks that prevails in the society.</p>

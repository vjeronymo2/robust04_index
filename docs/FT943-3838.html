			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Emerging: Markets: Market seeks liquidity to join party - The Emerging Investor In a country with a seemingly unending flow of good economic news, capped in July by an upgrading of its investment rating by Standard &amp; Poor's, the Czech Republic's stock market has been noticeably unable to join the party. A severe liquidity shortage, caused by a spate of rights issues from quoted companies wishing to boost capital, has left the market drifting sideways. Turnover has fallen sharply from levels seen seven months ago when the market peaked, driven by strong domestic and foreign interest. 'Liquidity should improve after the shares in the second wave (of voucher privatisation) are released,' says Mr Pavel Sobisek, head of capital markets research at Zivnostenska Banka in Prague. Some 860 companies are being sold in the second wave, which is due to be completed before the end of the year. In the first wave, launched in 1992 when the country was part of federal Czechoslovakia, 185 investment privatisation funds (IPFs) received about 72 per cent of the vouchers from individuals. There are 349 IPFs involved in the second wave, with 64 per cent of the vouchers. Mr Sobisek believes that the combination of more IPFs, a greater number of individuals who did not entrust their voucher points to the IPFs, and the smaller number of companies is likely to lead to widely dispersed shareholdings. 'Some of the funds taking part are too small to be long term investors, and they will be forced to trade,' he says. Turnover currently averages between Dollars 10m and Dollars 15m per trading session, compared to up to Dollars 40m when the market peaked on February 1. Share prices have collapsed, too. The widely quoted HN-Wood index of the top 30 shares is trading between 2,050 and 2,150, a long way from its peak of 3,805, though about 10 per cent above its low point of 1,836 on June 7. Analysts agree that the favourable economic climate in the Czech Republic provides a sound basis for the market to move ahead. Gross domestic product is expected to rise by 2 per cent this year, reversing four years of declines. Unemployment, at 3.2 per cent in July, remains remarkably low. The rapid growth of the services sector in the past three years has created thousands of jobs to offset losses in traditional industries. Industrial output in June grew by 3.3 per cent, and construction activity expanded 6.7 per cent in the first half of the year. Worries over a rise in inflation, however, have been fuelled by a big rise in capital inflows. Last month the Czech National Bank revised its estimate of net inflows to Kcs100bn (Dollars 3.4bn) from Kcs60bn and raised the minimum reserve requirements of Czech banks from 9 to 12 per cent to dampen its inflationary impact. The CNB estimates that official reserves will reach Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn) by the end of the year, but it is confident that it can meet its year-end inflation target of 10 per cent. Official reserves stood at a preliminary Dollars 5.4bn in July. Against this background, analysts say that the upgrading of the country's investment rating by Standard &amp; Poor's from BBB to BBB+ in mid-July has increased the attractions of investing in the Prague stock market to foreign investors. There is already evidence that they are slowly returning. Mr Alexander Angell, director of sales and trading at stockbrokers Wood &amp; Co, says the market has seen 'the first signs of German institutional interest' in the last three months, much of it focused on the Czech Power Company (CEZ), the biggest and most liquid stock on the market. Mr Angell says there is also growing interest from specialist investment funds and from 'some investors who may not be able to find the Czech Republic on the map', such as dedicated traders, mainly US-based, in closed-end investment funds, which are behind a sharp rise in the share prices of some of the quoted IPFs. Trading in IPF shares accounted for up to 40 per cent of market turnover over the past three months, and dealers say about Dollars 40m was ploughed into the funds by outside investors in that period. The interest is mainly in those IPFs - such as Harvard Dividend and Growth Funds, IPF Creditanstalt, and the IPFs run by Ceska Sporitelna and Komercni Banka, the two biggest Czech banks - seen as having quality portfolios and good management, and which trade at substantial discounts to net asset value. Dealers say that the IPFs offer the best means of getting wide exposure to the Czech economy, and that more selective buying will have to await the ending of the privatisation programme. Meanwhile, the Prague stock market is set to move to daily trading from September 19 in an attempt to increase turnover and attract more business from the RM-System, a rival exchange which has a nationwide network of branches and affiliated brokerage houses. The PSE currently trades on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, while the RM-S offers continuous trading. The RM-S, a privately owned company, was set up to capitalise on the voucher privatisation programme, and has been the main forum used by thousands of small shareholders to trade in shares.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Ten best performing stocks  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Stock                        Country    Friday    Week on Week  change                                         9/9/94       Dollars       %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Commercial Bank of Korea     S Korea   10.5579        2.1408     25.43 Turkiye  IS Bankasi (C)       Turkey    0.2091        0.0361     20.85 HM Sampoerna               Indonesia    4.9555        0.7279     17.22 Daewoo Securities            S Korea   34.9847        5.0128     16.72 Bank Bali                  Indonesia    2.7072        0.3636     15.52 Bank of Seol                 S Korea    9.8332        1.2662     14.78 Lucky Securities             S Korea   21.8654        2.7583     14.44 Magnum Corporation          Malaysia    2.5425        0.3086     13.81 Madeco                         Chile    3.4090        0.4045     13.46 United Tractors            Indonesia    2.9596        0.3058     11.52  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

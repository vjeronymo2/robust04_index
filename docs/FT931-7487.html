			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: SmithKline Beecham With one fifth of its profits coming from consumer brands such as Ribena and Horlicks, SmithKline Beecham was always likely to fare better than pure pharmaceuticals companies when the market turned. Having roundly outperformed Glaxo over the last year, the rating difference between the two stocks no longer looks such an anomaly. Last year's performance in pharmaceuticals was at least as impressive as its rival. While Glaxo is agonising over a strategy for over-the-counter medicines, SB already has the pieces in place, thanks, not least, to its alliance with Marion Merrell Dow. Since the US patent of Tagamet, its big selling anti-ulcer drug, expires in May next year the company has good reason to explore new avenues. A strategy for OTC medicines by no means guarantees future earnings growth. The US authorities may never allow anti-ulcer drugs like Tagamet or Glaxo's Zantac to be sold without a prescription. Regardless of President Clinton's initiative on healthcare, though, the pressure on prices in prescription pharmaceuticals looks like getting worse. In that case SB's consumer brands business no longer looks a dead weight.</p>

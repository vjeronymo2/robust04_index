			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Bar Council urges formal system of plea bargaining THE BAR COUNCIL, the governing body for barristers, yesterday called for the introduction of a formal system of plea bargaining in England and Wales. A system under which the judge indicates the likely sentence if a defendant pleads guilty and does not opt for a contested trial would cut delays and improve the efficiency of the Crown Courts, it says. That type of arrangement is common in the US but remains illegal in England and Wales, although not all forms of plea bargaining are outlawed. Arrangements by which the prosecution agrees not to proceed with a more serious charge if the accused pleads guilty to a lesser offence are common. The difference between those arrangements and the US system is that no guarantees are made in the UK in respect of penalties or the sentence the accused will receive. In a report on ways of improving the efficiency of Crown Courts, the Bar says: 'It is our belief that many guilty defendants would plead guilty if they knew what the sentence would be and that such a system would command public confidence.' At the moment, it says, defendants who know they are guilty will opt for trial and take a chance that a jury may acquit them. 'Many would regard this as a complete waste of precious public resources,' the report says. The Bar rejects the Appeal Court's view that plea bargaining would impose 'improper' pressure on defendants to plead guilty. Safeguards could be introduced to protect the defendant's rights, the report says. All discussions on the deal should take place in the presence of the defendant and his legal advisers, it says; discussion should be recorded; and indications of sentence should be formally made in court. The report recommends that the Appeal Court should issue minimum percentage discounts on custodial sentences where a guilty plea is put forward. It should make clear that a defendant is entitled to a credit for a guilty plea in all cases except where the sentence is fixed by law or the offence is so serious that only a sentence in accordance with the full tariff is appropriate. The earlier the plea is made, the greater the reduction. The Efficient Disposal of Business in the Crown Court, The Bar Council, 3 Bedford Row, London WC1. Free.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Cash-rich M&amp;S earmarks Pounds 1bn for store expansion Marks and Spencer said yesterday that it was accelerating its expansion programme and expected to spend more than Pounds 1bn over the next three years. The company said annual capital spending would rise from last year's Pounds 281m, and might reach Pounds 450m if the right opportunities were available. Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman, said: 'There really isn't any constraint. We have got plenty of cash and we are in an aggressive mood regarding expansion.' Comparatively little would go on new UK stores. M&amp;S eventually plans 25 out-of-town centres, but already has 17. Rather more would be spent on expanding existing town-centre stores. Sir Richard said stores now needed between 80,000 sq ft and 120,000 sq ft of space to accommodate the full range of clothing, food and furnishings, but added that many were smaller. The second focus for expansion would be continental Europe, where sales rose 3 per cent last year to Pounds 243.3m although profits slipped from Pounds 27.3m to Pounds 27.1m in a difficult trading climate. The emphasis would be on France and Spain, with new stores opening on the Rue de Rivoli in Paris, and in Valencia. The third focus would be east Asia, where sales grew 38 per cent to Pounds 56.6m, and profits 43 per cent to Pounds 15.2m. Sir Richard expected his main task as chairman would be building the business in continental Europe, leaving east Asia for his successor. But the company's stores in Hong Kong and elsewhere have exceeded all expectations, forcing him to move more quickly. In addition to south-east Asia, the company is under pressure to take its retailing expertise into Japan and China - in the former from trading companies, and in the latter from the government. Sir Richard said both markets offered huge opportunities, but start-up costs were high and caution would characterise M&amp;S's approach. In the US, the emphasis was on bringing the performance of Brooks Bros up to the standard of the rest of the group.</p>

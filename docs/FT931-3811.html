			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Records: Monstrous many notes] - Max Loppert on the merits of Mozart opera on period instruments Mozart: Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail: 1. Monteverdi Choir, English Baroque Soloists/John Eliot Gardiner. DG Archiv 435 857-2 (two CDs), and 2. Academy of Ancient Instruments Orchestra and Chorus/Christopher Hogwood. L'Oiseau-Lyre 430 339-2 (two CDs) Mozart: La finta giardiniera. Concentus Musicus Wien/Nikolaus Harnoncourt. Teldec 9031-72309-2 (three CDs) DID THE Emperor Joseph really remark, after the premiere of Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail, 'Too beautiful for our ears, my dear Mozart, and monstrous many notes'? The anecdote, often quoted, is probably apocryphal; but it contains an astute observation, which is perhaps the cause of its regular re-cycling. There is indeed a discernible imbalance at the opera's centre - between the slightness of its Singspiel genre and subject matter and the splendour, exuberance and sheer abundance of its musical substance. Every bar overflows with marvels heightening the listener's delight and simultaneously putting at risk the spectator's sense of dramatic continuity. In every Entfuhrung performance, whether in the theatre or on record, a basic problem of scale needs to be addressed at the outset  - in oversimplified terms, the twin prongs of the dilemma are fulfilment of the score's extravagant demands, on singers and instrumentalists alike, versus maintenance of the necessary lightness of dramatic touch. Two of the most recent recordings solve the problem more surely than most performances of the opera I have heard. It can be no coincidence that, unlike all previous Entfuhrung recordings, these employ 'period'-instrument orchestras: seldom have the merits of doing so - tonal mass solid but not oppressive, at-one-ness with voices, keenness of colour - seemed so obvious (and, since the playing is expert on both recordings, the familiar failings are entirely avoided). In both sets the dialogue is given in full (less on DG); so are the musical numbers (with, for instance, those hair-raising bars of far-flung decoration usually nipped out from Constanze's 'Martern aller Arten') - yet not for a moment does the long opera drag or lag. Hogwood's is the more intimate. He leaves the music to find its own shape and direction; he does not make it his business to underline every rhythmic accent or highlight every dynamic contrast. This works particularly well in the popular-song-type numbers such as the final vaudeville, an andante of the sort Gardiner tends to urge a degree too forcefully forward. L'Oiseau-Lyre's leading singers are matched to the conductor's relaxed Mozart manner: the quiet-spirited, gentle-toned Lynne Dawson and the touchingly ardent Uwe Heilmann prove an unfailingly sympathetic leading couple, but their ability to cope with the numerous technical challenges Mozart threw their way is relatively modest - the brilliance that he relished in his first Constanze, Caterina Cavalieri, is here considerably dimmed. The DG is based on the semi-staged Entfuhrung production that Gardiner toured around Europe two years ago. There is a fizz, an on-the-toes quality to the execution that amply compensates for the conductor's occasionally over-rigorous beat: Gardiner's vitality, issuing as it plainly does from the desire to tap as much as possible of the opera's peculiar musical energy, is a fault on the right side. His Constanze, Luba Orgonasova, and Belmonte, Stanford Olsen, sing with ease, a quiet mastery of style, beautiful tone. They are true Entfuhrung virtuosos, less affecting, in places, than their Oiseau-Lyre counterparts, but much more vocally assured. DG's servant couple is preferable; neither Osmin, curiously, is quite up to standard; both Selims make a strong effect. I shall want to return occasionally to the old Beecham recording, for the incomparable charm and gaiety of his conducting; I shall want to hear again such recorded Entfuhrung singers of the past as Patzak, Dermota, Wunderlich, Gerhard Unger, Edda Moser and Gottlob Frick. But for now at least, these are the Entfuhrung recordings of choice. Similar points can be made about the Teldec Finta giardiniera, latest in Harnoncourt's recorded survey of all the Mozart operas. This work, written seven years before Die Entfuhrung, is even more difficult to keep in balance  -an opera buffa which along the way disgorges two astonishingly grand, richly elaborated act-finales, a pastoral comedy for a septet of romantically entwined characters which becomes darkened by episodes of intrigue, jealousy and madness. Again, the 'period' orchestra is a source of new-minted pleasures and long-range dramatic possibilities unavailable on earlier Finta giardiniera sets; and an even longer Mozart opera is here also given in full, without making the listener long for the pruning scissors. Those expressive tics - self-consciously underlined orchestral articulation, extremes of tempo choice - that tend to divide the musical world into Harnoncourt admirers and Harnoncourt detractors are less in evidence here; the recording was taken 'live' at a 1991 Vienna concert, but intrusive noises are few, atmospheric excitements plentiful. Violante, the aristocrat disguised as the garden-maid Sandrina, is Edita Gruberova - pure and precisely focused, prodigious as ever in throwing off passages of ornate vocal tracery, but notably lacking lacking in spunk and spirit (she seems to have adopted some of the moonier mannerisms of the middle-period Sutherland). Belfiore, whose jealousy has driven Violante into hiding, is Uwe Heilmann - more secure than in the L'Oiseau-Lyre Entfuhrung and every bit as involving. Other parts are less remarkably taken - from this generalisation I except Dawn Upshaw's sparky Serpetta. It is the trim cut and thrust of the ensemble and the nimble movement through the opera's picaresque situations and mercurial humours that afford the set its distinctive character, and win it an enthusiastic recommendation.</p>

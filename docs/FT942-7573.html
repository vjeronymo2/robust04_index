			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Competitiveness - The White Paper: Business flights may use RAF base - Airports The government is considering allowing business and general aircraft to use the Royal Air Force airfield at Northolt, west London. The white paper said the government would seek views for developing civil aviation at the RAF airfield because of the increasing pressure on facilities for general and business aviation in south-east England. BAA, the airports operator, said it would welcome a move to transfer general aviation and business services from nearby Heathrow to Northolt as long as it was beneficial to all. Heathrow airport is heavily congested, and take-off and landing slots have become a rare commodity. Slots are granted to business users at Heathrow only if they are not required by commercial airlines, or if an airliner fails to show up. An additional problem is that a small jet takes up two slots so as not to be caught up in the slipstream of larger aircraft. BAA also sought to discourage business jets using Heathrow at peak times by charging a small aircraft the same landing fees as a 400-seater jumbo during busy periods. This has led to a 7 per cent fall in the number of business aircraft flights into Heathrow between 1992 and 1993. There are also proposals to transfer the Queen's flight from RAF Benson in Oxfordshire to Northolt, which already serves as a base for VIP flights for royalty and government officials. Plans to expand civil aircraft services at Northolt are expected to spark fierce local opposition on the grounds of noise.</p>

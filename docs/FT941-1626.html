			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: 14.4% take up CSC offer The Pounds 73m public offer for Capital Shopping Centres, one of the largest flotations of 1994, has been only 14.4 per cent subscribed by the public. The remaining 85.6 per cent will be taken up by institutions. The public offer for the regional shopping centre company was affected by adverse conditions in the stock market, but brokers argue that it was too aggressively priced. The shares were issued at a 13 per cent premium to asset value. However, Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of TransAtlantic - the insurance and property group which retains a 75 per cent stake in CSC - said that CSC had achieved its objectives in the offer. He said: 'We have got a good share register, and hopefully not too many stags in the wings'. He said CSC had always been marketed as a long-term institutional stock, and the only reason for the public offer was the 'insistence of the Stock Exchange'. Robert Fleming, the lead sponsor, placed 65 per cent of the Pounds 209m offer with institutions, and the remaining 35 per cent was placed subject to clawback for the public offer. The public have taken up 4.58m shares, out of the available 31.85m. Mr Gordon said that the total offer had been over-subscribed by institutions and that these would remain committed to the company, despite the reaction of the public. 'I think we priced it dead right', he said. Few have argued about the quality of the company, which has a unique and defensive property portfolio, but a number of institutions suggested the shares were expensive. At the time the offer was first announced, the property sector was trading at an average premium to asset value of about 20 per cent. According to Warburg Securities, the premium has now narrowed to 5 per cent. Some brokers have suggested that the shares could trade at about 210p, compared with the issue price of 230p, after dealings begin next Wednesday.</p>

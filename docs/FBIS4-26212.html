			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 18 (XINHUA) -- China's Huaneng  International Power Development Corporation will be granted ADR  (American Drawing Rights) to list stocks on the New York Stock  Exchange from June 23.    According to the Shanghai Stock Exchange, this will be the  first of China's second batch of five state-owned enterprises to  be listed worldwide.    The other four are China Eastern Airlines, China Southern  Airlines, the Shandong Huaneng Enterprise Group and the Tianjin  Steel Tube Plant.    "This indicates that China's reform of its joint stock  system  is bringing this sector into line with the international  standards and that its state-owned enterprises are arousing  greater interest of business people overseas," an exchange  official said.    The first batch of three Chinese state-owned enterprises  listed on the New York Stock Exchange are operating smoothly.</p>

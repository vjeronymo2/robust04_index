			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Somerfield at Pounds 33.5m following restructure Somerfield, the supermarket group formerly Gateway, said yesterday it hoped for a stock exchange flotation within the next few years, as it reported pro-forma pre-tax profits of Pounds 33.5m for the 53 weeks to April 30. The results are the first since the financial restructuring of the Isosceles/Gateway group last July. There are no comparative figures. However, the profit, after interest charges of Pounds 32.8m, was the first post-interest profit the group has made since running into financial difficulties in the early 1990s, and suggested it was staging a recovery. Before profits of Pounds 300,000 on the sale of fixed assets, the operating profit was Pounds 66m, on turnover of Pounds 3.11bn. Mr David Simons, chief executive, said the 'price check' programme of price reductions the group launched in May last year had led to like-for-like sales growth, which excludes new stores, of 13 per cent and which was the highest in the industry. He said like-for-like growth since the year-end was still running at 5 per cent, in spite of moving into a period of stronger comparative figures from last year, suggesting there was no need to cut prices further. 'This is the first time in five years we have seen an upturn in sales, and represents a dramatic turnround,' Mr Simons said. 'We think a fragile equilibrium has returned to the grocery market, and we have no plans to cut prices further ourselves. But we will definitely respond to any moves by our competitors.' Mr Simons added that the sales increase had lifted Somerfield's market share from 8.6 per cent to 9.2 per cent. Capital spending in the year was Pounds 76m, mostly spent on refurbishing the stores and installing checkout scanning systems. Some 47 stores had been refitted and converted to the Somerfield name by April 30 - in addition to 60 stores already trading as Somerfield. A further 40 stores had been converted since the year-end, taking the total to 150. Refitted stores had experienced average sales increases of more than 10 per cent. The group also opened five Food Giant discount superstores, taking the number to 26. Mr Simons said the group was talking to a potential partner from outside the UK about developing the chain further. In last year's financial restructuring, Somerfield was ring fenced from all but Pounds 500m of the Pounds 1.4bn debt of its parent, Isosceles. Average borrowing for Somerfield this year was Pounds 438m. No dividend is being paid by Somerfield to its parent, but Mr Simons said this was not required under the restructuring agreement. 'The prime objective is to develop and strengthen the business, get the profits moving upwards, so we can move to a flotation. We have Pounds 3bn turnover; we should be a quoted company,' Mr Simons said. Proceeds of the flotation would be used to reduce Isosceles' debt. Mr Simons said he could not say when a flotation might take place, but was hopeful it could be before 1998.</p>

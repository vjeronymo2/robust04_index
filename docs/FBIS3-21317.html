Katyal: "Pakistan Terms for Talks </F> Rejected"; quotation marks as published]    [Text] New Delhi, Jan. 19--India today rejected--in  forceful, categorical terms--Pakistan's suggestion for the  future bilateral talks focussing on "modalities for the holding  of plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir [J &amp; K]." Pakistan's plea  contained in a non-paper given to the Indian High Commissioner  in Islamabad yesterday, was seen as a restatement of the  pre-conditions for continuing the dialogue, raised at the  foreign secretary-level talks earlier this month.    India, however, reiterated its readiness to discuss with  Pakistan all issues pertaining to bilateral relations in  accordance with the commitments and mutual obligations of the  two countries under the Shimla Agreement.    In a statement, the Foreign Office spokesman here dealt with  the plebiscite issue thus: "India categorically states once  again that Jammu and Kashmir is an integral part of India. The  question or the need for conducting any plebiscite in any part  of India including in the State of Jammu and Kashmir simply does  not arise. The people of the State of Jammu and Kashmir have  exercised their democratic rights repeatedly as people in other  parts of India, unlike the case in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and  what Pakistan has labelled as `Northern Areas'.    Apart from plebiscite modalities, Pakistan, in another  non-paper, dealt with "measures required to create a propitious  climate for peaceful solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute  and other issues." The Indian statement regretted that Pakistan  was attempting "through their propaganda exercise to obfuscate  the realities of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.    India drew attention to three points. One, the violence in  Jammu and Kashmir was being perpetrated with the connivance and  active support of Pakistan. Two, the government had the will and  commitment to counter terrorism, while continuing efforts to  enable the people of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise their  democratic rights. Three, the level of security forces deployed  in the State corresponded to the level of violence created by  the militants; cross-border terrorism was a major concern of the  government and a hurdle in India-Pakistan relations.    Pak. support to militants: Dealing with Pakistan's  involvement in terrorist violence, the statement said: "There is  a climate of violence in which the people of Jammu and Kashmir  have had to live through in the recent period. This violence is  being generated by militants and foreign mercenaries who have  been trained and equipped on Pakistani soil and who have  infiltrated into India with the connivance and active support  of Pakistan, with the sole objective of eroding the territorial  integrity and political stability of India. We have repeatedly  called upon Pakistan to desist from sponsoring trans-border  terrorism which contravenes the very basic norms of inter-State  conduct and good-neighbourly relations."    The resolve to counter the designs of militants was  reiterated in the following words: "While the Government's  endeavour continues to be to provide full opportunities for the  people of Jammu and Kashmir to exercise their democratic rights  and no efforts which could lead to this process is out of  consideration, we will not spare any effort to oppose any moves  directed against the country's unity and territorial integrity.  Pakistan should not have any doubt whatsoever on this score."    Setback in talks: The process, set in motion by  the talks by the two foreign secretaries, Mr. J.N. Dixit, and  Mr. Shahryar Khan, suffered a setback, as a result of Pakistan's  stand, as conveyed through the non-papers. The copies of the two  documents were given to Mr. Dixit by the Pakistan High  Commissioner here, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, yesterday. The first  reaction of Mr. Dixit was reflected by a query regarding  Pakistan's intentions. The contents of the Pakistani non-papers  served to harden India's stand. This was evident, apart from the  tone of today's statement, by the absence of any reference to  the six proposals, intended to be submitted by India to give a  positive twist to bilateral ties.    According to Pakistani sources, the door for negotiations  had  not been closed and that Islamabad continued to be interested in  a dialogue and wanted the environments to be improved for this  purpose. Pakistan, perhaps, would like the Kashmiri leaders like  Mr. Abdul Ghani Lone and Syed Ali Shah Gilani to be released to  create proper atmosphere.    At the Islambad meeting, the initiative was with India, as  Mr. Dixit promised to submit proposals on six subjects including  nuclear non-proliferation, other confidence-building measures  [CBM], stabilisation of the Line of Control [LoC] in Jammu and  Kashmir. The rationale was clear--that the two sides try to  foster confidence and mutual trust, as they engage themselves in  substantive discussions on Jammu and Kashmir. Because of the  sensitive nature of these subjects, there was no escape from  intensive internal discussions by the External Affairs Ministry  and other concerned ministries. This exercise took time, but the  package was getting a final shape. On nuclear nonproliferation,  for instance, India intended proposing expansion of the existing  treaty on non-attack on nuclear facilities, with a provision,  among other things, for observers to watch the functioning of  nuclear reactors in the two countries. The two non-papers,  perhaps, represented Pakistan's bid to wrest the initiative from  India.    It would be a pity if the advance, represented by the  newly-resumed dialogue, was allowed to peter out. It was worth  preserving and building upon. Despite harsh words, the two sides  had not given up the path of negotiations.</p>

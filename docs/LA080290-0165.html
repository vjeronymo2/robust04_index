			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICO RIVERA HIRING 'MAINTENANCE' AIDES TO CURB CRUISING BY YOUTHS  </P> <P> City officials are interviewing candidates to become bargain-rate soldiers in  the war on the city's legendary cruising problem.  </P> <P> The city plans to hire 15 to 20 "maintenance aides" to set up or move  traffic-control barricades at the direction of officers from the Sheriff's  Department and California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> The aides will work from about 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Wednesdays and weekends and  save the city up to $200,000 in salary costs.  </P> <P> Local law-enforcement agencies typically set up barriers to prevent cruisers  from entering residential neighborhoods and to keep the traffic flowing. On a  busy cruising night, up to 100,000 youths will descend on Whittier and Rosemead  boulevards to show off their cars and socialize, slowing traffic to a crawl.  </P> <P> Pico Rivera spent about $400,000 last year to control cruising. The city had  been paying public-works employees overtime to set up barriers. That cost the  city about $18 an hour per worker.  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / People: Barber picks Pictet Stephen Barber, who resigned from Invesco MIM at the end of March, is teaming up with his longstanding colleague and friend Nicholas Johnson at Swiss private bankers Pictet. Barber, 38, who was chief executive of Invesco's unit trust operation, joins as executive director of the two London companies, Pictet Asset Management UK and Pictet International Management. Johnson and Barber have worked together for some 13 years. The former joined Pictet, as chief investment officer, from Invesco earlier this year. 'Pictet wants to build a global institutional fund-management business based in London,' explains Barber, pointing out that the group's funds under management - around Dollars 30bn globally - are currently dominated by private client monies. French and German speaking countries will still be handled from the Geneva headquarters. Barber exchanges the turmoil at Invesco for the rarified atmosphere of a Swiss banking partnership where he has already met six of the seven partners. A fluent Japanese speaker who spent five years in Japan for Invesco, Barber says he will oversee the Asian equity business and the quantitative side as well as becoming involved in general management issues.</p>

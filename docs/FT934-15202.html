			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Business and the Environment: A dirty and dangerous legacy - The German government's clean-up plans for former Soviet-run uranium mines Some of the road signs in deepest Saxony are rusty. But there is no mistaking the route to Wismut, one of the largest uranium mines on the European continent. Follow the direction leading to the giant, brown mountains of waste dug out from the mines. Then, just a few kilometres before the small town of Aue, turn off and drive along a small road. There, former miners who spent years underground are now working on state-financed job creation schemes, weeding, mending the roads and putting up fresh signs. Before German unification, there was hardly any need for signs. Wismut was out of bounds. 'Wismut was a state within a state,' says Jana Bienick, a 29-year-old official at Aue's city hall. 'It had its own hospitals, its own kindergartens, its own transport system. It was a system within a system. But not anymore,' she added. 'But please, just remember, it was not that bad. There has been a lot of negative propaganda about Wismut. When the press was allowed to come here in 1990, some journalists were afraid to get out of the car in case they would get contaminated. They did not understand that it was not like that at all. We want companies to invest here.' The uranium mines in eastern Germany straddle the states of Saxony and Thuringia. Dating back to medieval times, they provided a livelihood for the local population because they also contained silver deposits. But when the Red Army took control of the former East Germany after the second world war, it was not interested in silver, but uranium, crucial for building up its nuclear capability. The Soviets were set on tapping the potential of the hydrothermal vein deposits near Aue which contained high percentages of uranium. As a means of seeking war reparations, the Soviet Union confiscated the mines and, in 1947, placed them under a company called the Sowjetische Aktiengesellschaft (SAG) Wismut. Seven years later, Moscow euphemistically created a joint venture in the region, called Sowjetisch-Deutsche AG (SDAG) Wismut. Soviet miners and engineers were moved to the region to supervise the digging of the mines. The Soviet Ministry of Defence issued the instructions. Wismut was worth the reparations. Between 1946 and 1990, more than 220,000 tonnes of uranium were mined and shipped to the Soviet Union. 'That was about a third of the world's production,' says Werner Runge, spokesman for Wismut. Throughout this period, a top security network, employing 40,000 people, was created. 'The entire system was tightly controlled,' explains Runge. 'Special buses collected the employees to and from work. It was a highly organised state within a state. People's lives were intrinsically linked to Wismut. It is difficult for them now to adapt to the new conditions. Less than 4,500 workers are today employed on the sites. Not to mine, but to clean up.' The task is awesome. As soon as the German government secured control of the mines after October 1990 and closed them down, Klaus Topfer, the country's environment minister, moved quickly to assess how long and how much it would cost to try to decontaminate, or stabilise, the sites. Under Soviet control, the waste rock from the mining was normally piled outside mine-shafts, with little effort made to replace it into the exhausted mine volumes. The waste rock contains small but significant amounts of radioactive, unprocessed low-grade uranium. Vast piles can be seen near Aue: 42 of them cover an area of 310 hectares and a volume of 45 cu m. At the Ronnenburg site in Thuringia, the amount is even larger - 100 cu m of waste. The federal authorities have embarked on a massive two-stage investment programme totalling DM13bn (Pounds 5.2bn). First is an attempt to level off the high piles to avoid mini-avalanches. The piles cannot be disposed of due to their size and because there are no suitable alternative sites in this fairly densely populated area. Plans also include creating channels to run down the piles to prevent rainfall seepage and contamination of what remains of the uncontaminated water supply. Progress so far has been remarkable. More than 30 hectares have been recultivated. Although no vegetables fit for human consumption will be grown, some grass and plants have been sown. The second stage of the programme is more difficult. When digging in mines stops, the water levels, contained during the mining through pumping, rise. The underground water in Wismut is contaminated so the authorities have to be careful to avoid further contamination by flooding. Dietmar Rosmej, an engineer who worked at Wismut until all mining was stopped in late 1990, says this task is vast. 'As part of the programme, we have to prevent any fresh rain water coming into contact with the underwater levels.' The government estimates it will take 15 years to stabilise the region. The inhabitants of Aue have mixed feelings about the clean-up. Some regret the loss of job security. 'The closure of Wismut means very high unemployment,' says Michelle, a mother on a job creation scheme at the city hall. Others are almost defensive about the past 40 years. 'Oh, well. We were born here. We worked all our lives here. It was OK. We had everything we wanted,' says Heinrich, a technician who is helping with the clean-up at Wismut. But most agree that the closure will mean a healthier and safer environment for the next generation. One official at Wismut reckons more than 8,000 people have serious health problems, particularly cancer, from working at Wismut. Even those who did not work directly with the mines were affected, as the contaminated underground water levels seeped through the cellars of houses. 'Some homes will have to be specially insulated,' says Runge. Yes, it was pretty bad at times. But now we have to look towards the future.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Peter Eyerer, head, Institute for </F> Plastics Testing and Plastics Science (IKP), Stuttgart, under  the rubric "Production": "IKP Head Professor Peter Eyerer:  'One-Sided Mentalities Are Not Suited for Solving Complex  Environmental Problems'. The Ecobalance Is Becoming a  Decision-Making Tool"; first paragraph is VDI NACHRICHTEN's  introduction]    [Text] Stuttgart, 7 Jan 94 (VDI-N)--"Avoid Using and  Disposing Of" goes a well known motto of the German  environmentalists on the way toward the recycling economy. The  recycling of materials is accordingly a duty. But Professor  Peter Eyerer, a doctor of engineering, wonders whether the devil  is not being cast out by Beelzebub here. Together with his team  of experts at the Institute for Plastics Testing and Plastics  Science (IKP) in Stuttgart, in what follows he advocates the  trend that has begun toward comprehensive balancing of the  environmental impact of products.    The recycling of used materials into the production cycle is  certainly a sensible move toward reducing the quantities of  waste that accrue. But if the logistical expense to be incurred  or the energy requirement for returning materials to the  materials cycle go beyond a justifiable level, the  reasonableness of such a course of action has to be examined.  This applies likewise to recycling procedures or processes whose  consumption of energy and emissions are higher than those of the  primary process of producing the material.    Every individual angle has to be weighed here. For this  reason a suitable aid has to be developed in order to make  transparent and to categorize the individual benefits or  burdens: The ecobalance will become a decision-making tool. For  it will be possible to arrive at a judgement only by the  complete consideration of every relevant aspect, i.e., the  technical, economic and ecological viewpoints, and not just from  a single-cause viewpoint.    But the ecobalance cannot be a sole aid as an assessment  method for environmental aspects. Though it is excellently  suited for showing the appropriateness of individual process  options, nevertheless it fails when it is a matter of  considering the overall model taking economic and technical  criteria into account.    For instance, plastics recycling is today largely well  masterable technically and sensible when true-to-type clean  waste whose composition is known is at hand. But problems arise  when economic limiting conditions, like the recyclate's price  compared to the new product, for example, speak against the use  of recycled materials. For instance, today 1 kg of polyethylene  (PE) from East European countries costs around one German mark  [DM]. The comparable product from West Europe is quoted at  almost DM1.10 per kilogram. And by contrast polyethylene from  recycled material costs about DM2.5 per kilogram today. Is it  sensible all the same to recycle popular plastics like  polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene? Certainly not at all from an  economic standpoint! But the material is indeed too good to  throw away, and also too expensive at today's dumping costs. But  the consumers or, as the case may be, buyers of plastics users  are not willing to fall back on secondary products. Technical  specifications are often even worded so that the use of  secondary raw materials is not even possible. Of course, with  that a sales market at the going price anyway also needs to be  able to be obtained. Thermal recycling presents itself,  especially for popular plastics like PE and PP. Instead of  burning petroleum in the form of heating oil, petroleum in the  form of plastics can be burned just as well, only with the  difference that here still another mission would be fulfilled as  well in the meantime.    But thermal processes are still encountering rejection  because of the strong feeling of insecurity among the public.  This debate is based for the most part on a large deficiency of  information that is attributable on the one hand to the lack of  education by operators, but on the other hand also to strongly  politically motivated opinion molding. Factual arguments are  often too weak in this subject area to get around the  emotionalizing of the groups concerned.    Hence comes the need basically to compare all waste disposal  and recycling technologies and to examine the suitability of the  individual processes for the most different waste products or  old components that accrue. Transparency for operators and the  public has to be provided precisely here by way of an  all-embracing consideration of every aspect. Accordingly, an  ecobalance that describes just environmental aspects is not an  adequate tool. Rather, the system description has to come after  a comprehensive way of viewing the question.    For example, for metals there has been recycling for  decades,  motivated by economic factors. However, very often there has  been no direct recycling (closed-loop recycling) for a  particular use, but the recycling of materials in other fields  of use (open-loop recycling).    However, there have been strong efforts to recycle for the  same use scrap that accrues from primary uses. Far greater  success has been achieved here for metallic materials than for  polymer materials. But is this effort also really sensible? Why  does high-grade steel absolutely have to be remade into  high-grade steel? When there is a market for less exacting uses,  one has to consider well what expense matches which results.    The problem for metals, of amassing individual particular  alloys separately and true to type, is similar to that for  plastics. Proportionate expense has to be incurred here too in  order to achieve closed-loop recycling.    As are plastics, metals are also used mostly in composite  designs and less frequently in pure form. On the one hand it is  precisely these uses that result in special problems for  recycling, but on the other hand it is also these uses that are  distinguished by exceptional property profiles.    But worth the real attention here is the question whether  the  closed- loop recycling of metallic materials for a particular  use is sensible as a principle. A worldwide market for secondary  uses, i.e., uses having lower requirements for the materials,  has developed over the course of time for metals. The decisive  problem to be solved is whether the introduction of the material  into a recycling cascade or, as the case may be, the approving  acceptance of a putative material assessment generally  represents a worse solution.    The answer to this question can be given again only by  considering every important influencing factor from ecology,  economics and technology. The comprehensive balance will become  the valuable aid toward getting a more complete picture of the  situation.    One-sided and single-cause mentalities are not suited for  solving complex circumstances like the problems of recycling.  Firm solution possibilities will be found only via a  comprehensive way of viewing the question that includes economic  aspects too in addition to the technical and ecological aspects.  Comprehensive balances by way of ecobalances expanded in  important aspects are such a tool. This decision-making tool  must be applied separately for company-, product- and  site-specific aspects. In addition, the entire product life  cycle must be considered. Sound materials and process decisions  can be made only on this basis.    In addition to optimization in the purely materials area,  however, work also has to be done on a resource-minimized  product cycle for components already at the design stage. In  addition to the avoidance of non- disassembly-friendly designs,  the use of specific combinations of materials in composite  components and the general selection from the diversity of  materials has to be thought over, both for polymer materials and  for metals.    The advantages and disadvantages of individual options must  be submitted to a comprehensive balance already at this early  stage of product development, in order to be able to reveal  weaknesses in good time or to make sound selection decisions.  For this reason the comprehensive balance takes on central  importance as a tool in the development process and in  simultaneous engineering.</p>

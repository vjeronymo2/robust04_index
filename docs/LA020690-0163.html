			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> 2 TEAMS OUT OF NEW GRID LEAGUE  </P> <P> Teams in Rome and Milan were dropped from the inaugural season of the  International League of American Football today because of a conflict with  soccer's World Cup, which will be played in Italy this summer.  </P> <P> There are six clubs left in the league for the opening of play in April.  </P> <P> They are in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Helsinki, Munich, London and Birmingham,  England.  </P> <P> Rome and Milan will join the league in 1991, officials said.  </P> <P> Flaminio Stadium, which was to have been the home field for Rome, will be used  in the World Cup competition.  </P> <P> The loss of the two teams for 1990 is a setback to the ILAF in its efforts to  gain a foothold before the World League of American Football, an NFL-sponsored  spring league in Europe and North America, begins play in 1991.  </P> <P> Each of the six remaining teams will play a 12-game season from April 14 to  June 30, followed by playoffs. Each team will include 12 Americans and 24 local  players.  </P></p>

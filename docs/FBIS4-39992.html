			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Oksana Hutsul: "Crimea. What Will Come of It?"] </F>   [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Here is how deputies commented  on the Crimean problem behind the scenes.    Anton Buteyko: The Ukrainian Supreme Council has the right  to dictate its will and should do this, while other entities  must obey. Crimea is an entity subordinated to Ukraine. In a  situation like the one that has recently developed in Crimea,  which can be qualified as a violation of territorial integrity  and national sovereignty, the law "On State of Emergency"  provides a solution. The introduction of that law is also  envisioned by international laws, however UN bodies have to be  informed about such intentions in an appropriate manner. I do  not think that we should resort to these measures now, however  such a possibility should not be ruled out.    The draft law suggested by the president is just another  postponement, while we are expected to make concrete steps.    Leonid Kuchma: The essence of the Crimean issue lies in the  economy and not in politics. I am an advocate of negotiations  and vaster economic independence. Look what is going on in  Crimea: The adoption of a soft tax policy has caused an inflow  of capital. According to my data, more than 600 billion  karbovantsi have recently been transferred to Crimea by means of  Ukraine's commercial banks. Crimea should suspend its decision  regarding the constitution, while the Ukrainian Supreme Council  should adopt a ban on the use of force. With regard to the  proposals to create the Constitutional Court -- can our  legislature create it? In our state politics is ahead of the  economy. Ukraine is actually approaching collapse, because with  an economic plunge of 50 percent (this is how production has  shrunk in Ukraine's light industries), states usually  disintegrate.    Borys Oliynyk: The Crimean issue should be resolved by means  of the Constitutional Court. However a limited period of time  should be set aside for forming this court. I do not think that  anybody would dare blame us for failure to do everything in our  power to peacefully resolve the conflict. Introduction of  presidential rule in Crimea is out of the question; we should  act in line with the logic of our resolution. However we must  determine certain time limits for a response from Crimean  authorities.</p>

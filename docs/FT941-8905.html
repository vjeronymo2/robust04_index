			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Rhone-Poulenc Rhone-Poulenc's predictions have proved erratic in the past and it therefore came as a relief that its 1993 results were only as dire as forecast at the time of privatisation. The company warned last year that the chemicals industry was experiencing its most difficult trading conditions since the second world war. The 36 per cent fall in net income bears out the point. But Rhone-Poulenc's appeal lay in its big exposure to the next upswing in the chemicals cycle. The more worrying aspect to yesterday's statement was that the company foresaw no significant profits rise until 1996, or later. A higher dividend than many expected will help sugar the pill in the meantime. Some of the financial ingredients on Rhone-Poulenc's balance sheet should also work to its advantage this year. Lower debt, an expanded equity base, and improved cash flow combined with the reduction in French interest rates will significantly ease the financial strains. Bright spots, such as the 20 per cent profits rise from North America, provide additional encouragement. The FFr1.2bn of restructuring provisions taken last year also illustrate how the company is happy to endure pain today to deliver earnings growth tomorrow. Nevertheless, a share rating of 38 times 1993 earnings anticipates a lot. Rhone-Poulenc's experience hardly provides the most encouraging backdrop for the next wave of French privatisations. No one pretended the privatisation offers would produce quick returns. Yet few forecast just how long the wait would be.</p>

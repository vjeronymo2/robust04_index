			<p>BFN     [Text] The decision to carry out air strikes against the  Serbs should be taken in Brussels by the NATO command, which  would need the UN green light. This afternoon the international  community seems determined to make sure that this new ultimatum  is respected, even if President Mitterrand thinks that it will  be unnecessary to resort to air strikes. Francois Mitterrand  was interviewed by Ralph Pinto in Tashkent, Uzbekistan:    [Begin Mitterrand recording] I believe that the UN forces  are  thinking that the ultimatum is going to be respected by the  deadline. I have nothing else to add. My wish, naturally, is  for military intervention to be avoided if it is not deemed  necessary -- that is, if Serb forces and their positions conform  to the conditions set by the international community. You will  then be informed and so will I.    I hope that all this will be settled in a peaceful way, and  that is why France took the initiative to call for the holding  of an international conference -- and it is a good thing that it  has been taken up by others. Unlike what happened in the past,  this conference will be held parallel to the ultimatum and  attended by at least the United States, Russia, and the EU  [European Union] under the aegis of the United Nations.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yevgeniy Skukin account of interviews with Vasiliy </F> Lipitskiy, chairman of the People's Party of Free Russia;  Vladimir Lysenko, cochairman of the Republican Party of the  Russian Federation; and Viktor Ilyukhin, representative of State  Duma communist faction; place and date not given: "We Are  Discussing the Draft Agreement on Civil Accord"]    [Text] Stabilization Means a Change of Policy    Vasiliy Lipitskiy, State Duma deputy and chairman of the  People's Party of Free Russia: The worrying thing about this  voluminous document is that, despite the general nature of its  wording, it contains harsh sanctions for violations, the  majority of which can be interpreted liberally, like, for  example, "destabilizing the situation within society."    At the same time the agreement allows the application of  sanctions up to and including the dismissal and removal of a  deputy from his seat. I consider that the agreement may become  a cause for limiting political freedom, and this cannot be  allowed.    One more point. In order to achieve accord there should be  policy changes.  <H5>  Agreements Must Be Implemented </H5>   Vladimir Lysenko, State Duma deputy, chairman of the  subcommittee for developing federal relations, and cochairman of  the Republican Party of the Russian Federation: The way I  regard the draft is complex, as the president has already signed  various documents of this type on many occasions, but not one of  them has played a significant role as they were subsequently  violated. What is more they were not violated by political  forces but by the president. For example, an agreement was  concluded with 15 parties in 1991 which subsequently faded into  oblivion. So you cannot really rely on the agreement being  equal at the moment. But the draft does contain positive  elements. For example, with regard to a moratorium on changing  a Federation component's status and the borders between  Federation components.  <H5>  We Are Ready To Present Our Own Solutions </H5>   Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the State Duma Security  Committee and representative of the communist faction: An  accord is possible if several of our demands are met. First, if  there is a change in the direction of the Russian reforms. It  is not possible to reconcile oneself to the masses becoming  impoverished. As the government is not putting forward any ways  of extricating ourselves from the crisis, we will present our  own solutions.    Second, the team which has brought the country to collapse  has still not been changed to this day.    Third, we consider that the authorities should undertake  never to use the Army for punitive purposes against the people.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Second half surge at Bilston Enamels Bilston &amp; Battersea Enamels recovered from its interim loss to produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds 120,000 from turnover of Pounds 3.99m for 1991. In the previous year the profit was Pounds 336,000 from sales of Pounds 4.83m. Earnings per share dropped to 2p (5.1p). The dividend is omitted (against a total of 3p) in view of the results and substantial cash outflow at the beginning of 1992 resulting from the new arrangements with Halcyon Days. Profit in the second half was Pounds 172,000 (Pounds 114,000) on turnover 9 per cent lower, and was a direct result of further reductions in costs and staffing and profits from Fine Ceramic Transfers. Sales for the first quarter of the current year were ahead of 1991, and the the level of new inquiries had also measurably improved, directors stated.</p>

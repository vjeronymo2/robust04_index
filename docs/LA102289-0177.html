			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELORS -- VIEWS ON EUROPE, TRADE  </P> <P> Here are excerpts of comments made by Jacques Delors, president of the European  Community Executive Commission, during an interview in his Brussels office:  </P> <P>  On the trade disputes between the United States and the European Community and  managing American concern:  </P> <P>  "There's a close link between the spirit of the overall relationship between  the U.S. and Europe on one side and the process of solving commercial disputes  on the other. . . . It seems to me that if the president of the European  Council plus the president of the European Commission would have the  opportunity to meet the President of the United States and the secretary of  state two times a year for a global assessment of the situation . . . this  would be a good solution."  </P> <P>  On European Community relations with Japan:  </P> <P>  "Japan has refused its world responsibilities. It manages, and very  intelligently from my point of view, a global strategy in the world economy,  but in a (secretive) fashion -- and that explains the worry of many Americans  and why they watch Japan. It's a real political problem to pursue, to convince,  to press Japan to accept the burden-sharing of the world. My desire is that we  won't have the same attitude toward the United States as to Japan. A more open  attitude toward the U.S. (is possible) because history, the spirit and (our  common) experience is very good. But vis-a-vis Japan, Europe must become  tougher and tougher."  </P> <P>  On meeting the December, 1992, deadline for completion of the community's  internal market:  </P> <P>  "The speed is good. The political will is very good also. (There is) no  problem."  </P> <P>  On the issue of a single European currency:  </P> <P>  "We've made progress toward a consensus on the first stage of European  monetary union. It is very important that the British prime minister has  accepted the first stage. . . . I have a vision, but to fulfill this vision  it's necessary to become more pragmatic and to pay attention to the national  problems."  </P> <P>  On the EC's political role in Eastern Europe:  </P> <P>  "The question is . . . how to avoid a return to totalitarianism and the Cold  War. One way -- not the only one -- is to offer a very solid front of the 12 EC  countries and the possibility for each Communist country to have close  cooperation with the 12 to modernize their economies and consolidate their  steps toward more freedom and democracy. . . . We must accelerate the political  construction of (the community) to offer solid ground."  </P> <P>  On the answer to the so-called German question and a possible European  Community role in it:  </P> <P>  "The only way to convince the Russians, the Americans, the other European  countries to find a good, acceptable solution to the two German nations is  inside the community -- within the framework of the community. I don't speak of  reunification but . . . of closer relations between the two German peoples  because the framework of the community, with a touch of federalism, offers a  possible solution."

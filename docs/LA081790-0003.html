			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEFENSE RESTS IN RETRIAL OF ACTOR TODD  BRIDGES  </P> <P> The defense in the assault retrial of actor Todd Bridges rested Thursday  without Bridges taking the witness stand, even though the actor's lawyer had  told jurors he would testify.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Johnnie Cochran told reporters that he decided not to call  Bridges, 24, as a witness after prosecutors did not call the shooting victim or  an alleged accomplice as witnesses.  </P> <P> "I figured why put Todd up there?" Cochran said.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman rested his case Wednesday after presenting  only one day's worth of witnesses. Hodgman declined to comment on why he did  not call the alleged victim, convicted Texas drug dealer Kenneth "Tex" Clay, or  an alleged accomplice of the defendant's, Harvey Duckett.  </P> <P> Clay testified at the first trial that Bridges shot him eight times on Feb. 2,  1989, inside a South-Central Los Angeles cocaine rock house.  </P></p>

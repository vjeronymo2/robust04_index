			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS: I WON'T BE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS  </P> <P> For Travelers, there is inevitably a moment when the exhilaration of discovery  gives way to an acute sense of being a stranger in a very foreign place. As  soldiers, diplomats and foreign correspondents know, that sense of displacement  may be keenest at times of traditional togetherness and homecoming. Here,  current and former foreign correspondents share some of their most memorable  Christmases away from home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LONDON, 1974  </P> <P> When I needed a good quote in my days as a London correspondent, I always  turned to Mr. Herbert, the friendly wine merchant who spoke in word bites for  newspapermen. What did Londoners think of their economy? What does bad weather  do to the English soul? Ask Herbert.  </P> <P> One day he disappeared, off to Australia to live, he was. It seemed to be a  plot to deprive an American reporter of his ration of pithy quotes. But,  suddenly, six months later, he was back for good. And still in form.  </P> <P> "Living in Australia," he said, "was like living in a brand-new railroad  station where the train never comes."  </P> <P> I think of the quote when I think of London during the holidays because that's  like living in an old railroad station where the train never comes. London at  this time of year gives a whole new meaning to the word boring.  </P> <P> The city seems to close down for days on end. Where is everyone? Are they all  in Mallorca? Are they hiding out and sharpening elbows to prepare for the  annual Harrods sale? What's happening in the world?  </P> <P> All this is an exaggeration, of course, but it doesn't seem to be if you live  through it, and we lived through seven of these "festive" seasons in London,  from 1967 to 1974. No tubes, buses or trains run on Christmas Day and no  newspapers are published.  </P> <P> The British Museum, and the Victoria and Albert, traditional great escapes,  close down for four days. One of my favorite restaurants, the White Tower, puts  away its wonderful Greek cuisine from Dec. 21 until after New Year's. The  after-Christmas sales at the major stores do not begin Dec. 26, but the 27th,  and the hectic, uncivil Harrods sale is not until Jan. 4.  </P> <P> So what did we do? We watched the annual Christmas message from Queen Elizabeth  II on televison and, for extra excitement, we watched it again.  </P> <P> Sometimes, we looked at some of the other holiday fare on the BBC -- the habits  of either the Slavonian Grebe or the elusive Tree Creeper and, if the kids were  asleep, we clandestinely viewed a documentary on the future of rubbish in S.W.  1.  </P> <P> Perhaps part of the problem was that we were never invited to the country with  the posh, who spoke later of groaning boards and black ties during the season,  a tradition the British noblesse stole from the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite.  </P> <P> We stayed behind and waited, waited for London to get back to its normal self.  </P> <P> One thing we did while waiting for the city to revive was to plan summer  holidays before all the reasonable "all-in" package trips were booked. For by  Christmas Day, every home in the nation had a pile of just-published brochures  from the British tour operators who knew that people, including expatriate  Americans, were looking for something, anything, to read.  </P> <P> So, we considered two days in Leningrad. The tulip season in the Netherlands  had an appeal. And, we thought, one day in Mallorca would allow us to see  whether any Londoners were left over from Christmas.  </P> <P> On balance, there are worse places to be this time of year and there is  certainly nothing wrong with the place the rest of the year. Sometimes, I  wonder what Mr. Herbert would say about London's holiday wonderland. I'll ask  him for a quote the next time I see him. ALVIN SHUSTER, Shuster, the Foreign  Editor of The Times, lived overseas from 1967 until 1977 as the bureau chief  for the New York Times in London, Saigon and Rome.  </P></p>

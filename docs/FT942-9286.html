			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Assets of Church return to growth Assets of the Church Commissioners, which declined by Pounds 800m between 1989 and 1992 after over-exposure in property markets, grew by 14 per cent last year. Summary accounts published yesterday showed that net assets rose from Pounds 2.1bn in 1992 to Pounds 2.4bn last year. The assets were worth Pounds 2.9bn in 1989 and the commissioners say that last year's growth makes their value similar in real terms to the early 1980s. But although asset value improved, net income declined by 4 per cent last year to Pounds 154.9m. The Church of England has been forced to recognise that, even before the collapse in asset values, it was making excessive demands on the commissioners' income. As a result parishes are being told that they must make a greater contribution to the cost of maintaining their churches. The commissioners last year paid Pounds 58m to clergy stipends - 37 per cent of the total. Their contribution to stipends and housing support will be reduced by Pounds 5.5m this year and Pounds 12m next year. Parish support for stipends rose by 2 per cent to Pounds 67.8m last year.</p>

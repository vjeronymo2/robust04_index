			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Treasury on course for PSBR target The government's budget deficit fell to a lower than expected Pounds 2.86bn in June from Pounds 4.3bn in May. This indicates that the Treasury is well on course to achieve its recently set target of Pounds 36.1bn for the public sector borrowing requirement in the financial year to the end of March 1995. The Treasury and the Central Statistical Office reported yesterday that the PSBR fell to Pounds 11.4bn in the three months to the end of June from Pounds 13.4bn in the first three months of the 1993-94 financial year. Excluding last month's privatisation proceeds of Pounds 180m from the sale of Northern Ireland Electricity shares, the PSBR in June was Pounds 3.04bn. Without privatisation income the deficit shrank by Pounds 3bn to Pounds 11.9bn in the three months to the end of June from Pounds 14.9bn in the same period last year. The June deficit was markedly lower than the City's Pounds 3.7bn consensus forecast. The Treasury said early tax payments by the self-employed ahead of a July 1 deadline boosted government revenues. Income tax receipts jumped to Pounds 5.53bn in June from Pounds 4.18bn in May and Pounds 4.8bn in June last year. The overall improvement in the government's finances so far this year reflects relatively strong revenue growth and only a small rise in government outlays. Cash receipts were Pounds 17.1bn in June and Pounds 50.5bn in the first three months of 1994-95 to show a 4.3 per cent rise compared with Pounds 48.4bn in the same period last year. Cash outlays were Pounds 20.6bn in June and Pounds 62.4bn in the first three months of the financial year, up 1.6 per cent on spending of Pounds 61.4bn in the equivalent period of 1993-94. These were boosted, however, by higher interest payments and lower privatisation proceeds, which count as negative expenditure. Net departmental outlays in the three months fell 1.5 per cent compared with a year ago to Pounds 58.9bn. Yesterday's figures had no impact on financial markets but economists were impressed. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist for Salomon Brothers International, said that the scale of improvement in the fiscal deficit was likely to be sustained over the rest of 1994-1995. 'Assuming that the November Budget does not shift the fiscal stance, the PSBR could be down to Pounds 25bn or 3.5 per cent of GDP in 1995-96' compared with Pounds 45.9bn in 1993-94, he said. This would be 'among the smallest deficits in the European Union'.</p>

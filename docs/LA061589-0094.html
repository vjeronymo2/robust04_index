			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUPUS SUPPORT GROUPS ASK STATE PROBE OF BANE'S FOUNDATION, ALLOCATION OF FUNDS  </P> <P> A coalition of lupus support groups asked the state attorney general Wednesday  to investigate a nonprofit lupus foundation headed by Assemblyman Tom Bane  (D-Tarzana) and a series of allocations of public funds by a state lupus  research board headed by Bane's wife.  </P> <P> The groups questioned the state board's allocation of $800,000 to a physician  friend of the Banes and claimed, in a letter to Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp,  that the research "contracted for by the state was simply not done, unless it  was done so badly that it was not publishable."  </P> <P> The concern was contained in a letter from Dr. Daniel J. Wallace, a medical  adviser to the American Lupus Society's Southern California chapters and the  Lupus Foundation of America, the two largest lupus organizations in the nation.  Nancy G. Horn, president of the Greater Los Angeles Chapter of the Lupus  Foundation of America, also wrote a letter to Van de Kamp requesting an  inquiry.  </P> <P> Copies of both letters were provided to The Times but had not reached the  attorney general's office late Wednesday.  </P> <P> "Things don't add up," Horn said in an interview. "Funds were not where they  should be. I just want an accounting. And I think Tom Bane should be made  accountable."  </P> <P> Bane did not respond to an interview request Wednesday. In the past, he has  maintained that he and his wife have done nothing improper in the way they have  championed research on lupus, a debilitating and potentially fatal autoimmune  disease.  </P> <P> The lupus organizations' letters are the latest chapter in a controversy  involving Bane and the three-member state Lupus Appropriations Board headed by  Marlene Bane. The board has dispensed $6.2 million in state funds to scientists  since 1977 to do Lupus research.  </P> <P> Bane angered the lupus support groups when he agreed earlier this year to end  the board's funding, apparently because he was upset that the state Department  of Health Services had determined that some of the panel's decisions raised  questions of fairness and favoritism.  </P> <P> In his letter to Van de Kamp, Wallace questioned $801,473 in lupus board grants  for research by Dr. Raymond L. Teplitz, a longtime friend of the Banes and a  contributor to the assemblyman's campaign committee. Teplitz received most of  the money while he was at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte;  he transferred to UC Davis in mid-1985.  </P> <P> Wallace, a Los Angeles rheumatologist and co-author of a recent lupus text,  said an index of medical publications listed four articles by Teplitz on lupus  since 1980.  </P> <P> "Their contributions to lupus were marginal and they appeared in obscure  journals," Wallace said, citing findings by the Lupus Foundation of America's  Medical Advisory Board. Further, he said the board "estimates that at most,  about $20,000 could have been spent on the work that was published."  </P> <P> He asked Van de Kamp to audit Teplitz's files "to see if state monies were  properly used."  </P> <P> Teplitz, who previously declined to discuss his research with The Times, could  not be reached Wednesday. Bane has said Teplitz did "real good work on testing  whether people have lupus."  </P> <P> Bane is also the volunteer chairman of the National Lupus Erythematosus  Foundation, which was founded in 1957 to promote lupus research and fund lupus  clinics.  </P></p>

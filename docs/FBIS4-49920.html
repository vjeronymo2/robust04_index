			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (XINHUA) -- Chinese legislators said  the draft decision on punishing copyright violators is necessary  for the protection of the legal rights of authors and combating  the rampant piracy of intellectual property in the country these  years.    The decision will be an important part of China's legal  system to protect intellectual property, and be conducive to  promoting the country's public awareness of the legal control of  intellectual property.    The lawmakers were speaking at the eight-day seventh session  of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's  Congress (NPC) which will end Thursday [12 May], where they have  deliberated the draft decision on punishing criminals who  violate copyrights.    The NPC Standing Committee members have also aired their  opinions on the draft decision in view of passing it at the  earliest possible time.    Yang Jingheng, member of the NPC Standing Committee, said  today that the prevailing piracy of books and audio and video  tapes in the country has generated an adverse influence upon  China's cooperation with the outside world.    "Promulgation of such a decision will be good for China's  image in the international community," he said.    Yang said the protection of copyrights of computer software  has been more critical at a time when computers are widely used.  He said the relevant items should be specific and easy to  operate.    Vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peiyao said  production lines are purchased from abroad to duplicate compact  discs illegally. Many local governments even protect such  activities.    He proposed that the draft decision stipulate that local  protectionists involved in copyright violations be punished.    Member of the NPC Standing Committee Fu Tieshan, who is also  a bishop, said the draft decision so far lacks items to deal  with foreigners' infringement upon Chinese authors' rights and  should include such provisions.    Wang Liping, a noted music composer and member of the NPC  Standing Committee, said that copyright violators have been  seeking exorbitant profits and have destroyed the normal order  of the cultural market and economic activities.    The penalties for them in the decision should be harsh and  fines should be heavy to curb such crimes, he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Famous Work Demonstrating Invincibility of Korean-Style </F> Socialism"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  dedicates a signed article to the 3rd anniversary of the  publication of "Our Socialism Centred on the Masses Shall Not  Perish", a famous work of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il  (May 5, 1991).    Comrade Kim Chong-il in the work formulated the basic  characteristics of the Korean-style socialism centred on the  masses and its superiority, and the source of its durability and  invincibility with perfect logic and crystal propositions and  gave a comprehensive exposition of all the theoretical and  practical questions arising in building true socialism centred  on the masses.    The article headlined "Famous Work Demonstrating  Invincibility of Korean-Style Socialism" says that for their  richness, profundity, truth, originality, scientific and  revolutionary character the ideologies and theories expounded in  the work gave the faith in certain victory to the people in our  era who are struggling to achieve the victory of the cause of  socialism and are a precious textbook of struggle and life for  the revolutionary people.    The article says Korean-style socialism centred on the  masses  is invincible socialism because it applies the great chuche idea  and provides the masses with an independent and creative life.    It quotes the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as saying:    "Because it is the embodiment of the chuche idea, our  socialism is a man-centred socialism under which man is the  master of everything and everything serves him."    The article further says:    The basic characteristics and essential advantages of  our-style socialism lie in basing on the chuche idea calling for  thinking everything centering on the people and for making  everything serve them.    Today our socialism is victoriously advancing unshaken by  any  vicious manoeuvres of the imperialists and reactionaries because  it is based on and guided by the chuche idea.    Socialism is the life and soul of our people whereas the  chuche idea is the life and soul of our socialism. The might of  our socialism is that of the great chuche idea and as there is  the chuche idea, no force can break our socialism.    In our country the popular masses are taking part in the  political life as masters of the state and society and leading  an active and creative life as masters of economic life.    Our socialism is indestructible socialism next because the  singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses has  been successfully realized.    The work consummates the questions arising in strengthening  the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses  which is the eternal vitality of our socialism.    The party and the leader believe and boundlessly love the  people and the people absolutely trust and uphold the party and  the leader -- this is the true feature of our singlehearted  unity.    No force can break the might of our socialism in which the  leader, the party and the masses are united singleheartedly.  Our people will smash the anti-socialist moves of the  imperialists and reactionaries and certainly achieve the final  victory of the socialist cause in reliance on the might of the  singlehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses.</p>

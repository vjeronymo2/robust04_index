			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Letter: Pension law: America's is imperfect, but it strikes the right balance Sir, The late Robert Maxwell apparently did not siphon off assets of his companies' pension plans in the US. It is tempting to conclude that ERISA, America's comprehensive pension law, was the deterrent. My British counterparts should be aware that Maxwell's actions, if prudent, could have been permitted in the US. ERISA relies on the private sector for the delivery of pensions, and accommodates, at least in part, the role of pension assets in the corporate financial structure. Britain's debate questions who should own pension assets. Here the answer is clear: Maxwell could have terminated the plans and taken back any assets in excess of benefits earned to date. During the late 1980s, pension plan terminations became common here, despite arguments that excess funds belonged to the pensioners. Now terminations have slowed, due to poorer investment performance and curbs on plan funding. Reformers in the UK are considering removing plan assets from the employer's control and prohibiting self investment. Under ERISA, Maxwell could have appointed himself trustee, retained investment control and directed investment at plan assets in Maxwell companies. If those investments were prudent (perhaps a large 'if' in the case of Maxwell) no law would have been breached. (Although ERISA does not explicitly require it, our regulators insist that any self-investment be validated by an independent party.) Pension losses in the US are limited by an insurance system managed by a quasi federal agency, the PBGC. Without a federal guarantee of the programme, this should provide little comfort to pensioners. The system has been marked by deficits and by regular increases in fund premiums (paid by plans). Until recently, premiums were not based on plan financial health. Limited experience rated premiums are now imposed, but the relationship of premiums to risk remains imperfect. Enhanced reporting and disclosure is frequently advocated. I am sceptical. ERISA does require extensive reporting and disclosure. But under ERISA, no one would have learned of Maxwell's defalcations of pension money until it was too late. An investment may not be reported for as many as 19 1/2 months after it is made. The government only recently began enforcing penalties for failure to file (someone discovered revenue could be raised from it). ERISA will not prevent a determined person from raiding pension assets; no private system will. There is a danger of over-reacting to the Maxwell affair. ERISA is far from perfect but it has achieved a balance between protecting pensioners and preserving the private system.

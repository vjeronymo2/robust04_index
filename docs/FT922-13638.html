			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: Frontier spirit rebuilds a crippled economy / A look at how German banks have found a world of opportunity in their own back yard The days when would-be high-fliers in Germany's big banks felt obliged to spend a year or two in Tokyo, London or New York are over. The opportunities are now in the banks' back yard, in the eastern part of Germany. There, in the five new Bundeslander, a frontier spirit prevails as German executives try to build a modern market system on the ruins of a centrally planned economy. From the start the banks have been in the vanguard. They began setting up branches in the new territories in the weeks before monetary union on July 1 1990 and have built a modern banking system virtually from scratch. So far, and rather surprisingly, given the level of investment, many of the banks have made a profit in the east. Business there - though no more than about one-tenth of the the banks' total domestic lending - helped fuel the spectacular increases in 1991 profits announced in the past few days. However, the attractions of doing business there may wither away, as the government in Bonn reduces the financial favours it grants to eastern Germany. Before reunification, east Germany's banking system was under-developed and inefficient. The old Staatsbank, the former state sector bank, was responsible for printing money and was a tool for central planning. It distributed state handouts and facilitated payments from one Kombinat (state sector business) to another. The vast majority of private individuals were obliged to bank with a network of Sparkassen, savings and loans organisations which all paid interest of 3.5 per cent. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, Germany's two biggest banks, bought the Staatsbank from the Treuhand privatisation agency and parcelled out its branch network and staff between them. Other west German banks have had to build up their eastern operations from scratch and an estimated 2,500 west German bankers have moved to eastern Germany. The eastward march of German banks has required large logistical efforts and substantial investment. Billions of D-Marks have been spent on buying and refurbishing property, establishing computer links with the west, installing cash dispensers and other computer hardware. There have been substantial costs, above all in training the 12,500 east Germans who work in banking in the new Bundeslander. The banks are coy about the precise sums being poured into the east. But in the case of Deutsche Bank, the costs of its expansion were a significant factor in raising its staff and operating costs last year by DM1.5bn (Dollars 900m) to DM10bn, disappointing analysts when the figures were released last Thursday. The presence of the banks has enabled east Germans to borrow money or to finance a small business. For the first time, they have access to a plethora of savings products such as interest-bearing cheque accounts, unit trusts and share trading accounts. The banks have acted as a catalyst for the first stirrings of an economic upswing in the east, lending to start-up ventures, to the subsidiaries of west German companies, and to the thousands of companies owned by the Treuhand privatisation agency. Bankers see themselves less as businessmen than agents of reform, missionaries of capitalism. 'Our task is to optimise our corporate clients' understanding,' said Mr Rudiger Wrede of the Deutsche Bank in Leipzig. According to the Association of German Banks, private sector banks have advanced credits of some DM45bn in the east, of which the lion's share has gone to east Germany's fledgling corporate sector. In spite of the scale of investment, the eastwards expansion has so far been profitable for the banks. 'The only obstacle to growth is a lack of skilled personnel,' said Mr Klaus-Peter Muller, main board director at Commerzbank with responsibilities for the bank's activities in the east. This is partly because staff costs are still lower there than in the west. But there are two other important reasons. Although some east Germans have opened share accounts and experimented with more exotic forms of investment, such as options and warrants, the majority of private customers in the east have proved to be very conservative, preferring to leave their savings in accounts paying minimal rates of interest. Industry observers say this reflects east Germans' lack of financial sophistication. Ossies - east Germans - want their money to be safe and easily accessible, providing a cheap source of finance for the banks. The second reason is that bank lending has been insulated from the full problems of the east German economy. In June 1990, the Treuhand agency extended a so-called credit umbrella to the former state sector companies under its charge, guaranteeing loans taken out by German enterprises. Loans made under the terms of this guarantee are totally free from risk. The Association of German Banks estimates that DM15bn of credit is covered by the guarantees, a third of the total advanced by west German banks in the east. For some of the big banks, up to half the loan portfolio is protected in this way. The interest rate the banks received for these loans is lower than that charged to normal commercial clients, reflecting the lack of risks, but it is still a tidy two or three percentage points above the banks' cost of funds in the money markets - and as much as two or three times the interest rate paid out to retail depositors. Bankers maintain they deserve the margin paid by the Treuhand because of the amount of consultancy and administrative work associated with the loans. 'We have to deal with a fantastic amount of paperwork,' said Mr Kurt Kasch, head of corporate lending at Deutsche Bank in Berlin and Brandenburg in north-east Germany. 'The Treuhand expects us to give advice on all aspects of business.' The advantageous terms extracted from the Treuhand and hence the salad days for the banks in eastern Germany may be drawing to an end. The privatisation agency - under pressure from the government to cut its costs - has decided it is not going to continue subsidising the banks in this way. In December it announced that banks would have to take more of the lending risks on to their own books. The gradual elimination of guarantees will make it much more difficult for banks to lend money profitably in the east. As the Treuhand's credit umbrella is gradually removed in the coming months, the banks will have to start using normal commercial criteria when lending to businesses in the east. It is likely that the banks will continue to lend to the eastern subsidiaries of west German companies, and to dentists, plumbers and other small-scale entrepreneurs where the risks are limited. Otherwise they may be reluctant to lend at all - given the lack of credit history and management experience in the east. When they do lend, the prospects of bad debts and provisions against these debts will make business in the east far less profitable than it is now.</p>

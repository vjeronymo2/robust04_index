			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Sarajevo evacuations resume SERB forces yesterday released two Bosnian government bodyguards, who were abducted from a UN armoured car, prompting Sarajevo authorities to resume the evacuation of Serb civilians from the besieged capital. UN officials said the two guards from the Bosnian interior ministry, who had been escorting the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sarajevo but were seized by Serb gunmen and held for three days, were handed over to UN mediators at Lukavica, the Serbian garrison on the outskirts of Sarajevo. But while Serb commanders appeared to cave in to UN pressure to free the two men, UN officials yesterday said they continued to block the passage of humanitarian aid to Moslem enclaves designated as UN 'safe areas'. Belgrade economists say inflation is running at 0.5 per cent an hour, spurning claims by the government of brighter economic prospects.</p>

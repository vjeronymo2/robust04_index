The statement refers to those moves as an effort to aggravate  the political crisis with a coup d'etat as its final aim.    The opposition forces, says the statement, are fighting  under  the same formula as they did during the Communist regime, that  is, "the worse the better." However, if in the struggle against  the empire this formula contributed to achieving independence,  today, it threatens the existence of independence.    A process of destruction began in Georgia much earlier than  the present leadership came to power. An unfortunate heritage  was left to this leadership: War in the Tskhinvali region and in  Abkhazia, a provoked civil war, an integration of the interest  of enemies and traitors, a military defeat, a series of  subversions and sabotage.    Despite all the current difficulties, the government has  been  trying to bring the country out of the crisis. It has achieved  a breakthrough in the international isolation. As a result  Georgia has become an active member of the international  community and a part of various international political and  economic structures, established strategically significant  international relations, restored political and economic links  with Russia, and other countries. The above-mentioned is,  actually, only the beginning of bringing the country out of the  crisis. And the establishment of stability in the country is  the only condition for the revival of the country's economy.    Representatives of the parliamentary majority call against  the creation of the government crisis, prove their constructive  attitude toward the confirmation of the Cabinet of Ministers,  and regard as unacceptable the issue of cardinal changes in the  government due to the lack of an appropriate basis.    Members of the parliamentary majority appeal to the  opposition parties to reach a consensus, considering efforts to  discredit the head of state and the Cabinet of Ministers as  unacceptable in essence, for it could lead to chaos in the  country.</p>

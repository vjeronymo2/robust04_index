			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Brussels, May 16 (TANJUG) -- The European Union's  Ministerial Council on Monday endorsed in full the plan for  Bosnia put forth by Western and Russian foreign ministers at  Geneva last week. The foreign ministers of Russia, the United  States, Great Britain, France and the European Union's "troika"  (Belgium, Greece, Germany), meeting in Geneva on Friday, invited  Bosnia's warring Moslems, Serbs and Croats to agree to a  four-month ceasefire during which to negotiate a peace  settlement on the basis of an E.U. territory-sharing plan which  envisages for giving the Moslems and Croats 51 percent of the  territory in which to form their federation, and the Serbs the  remaining 49 percent.    The chairman of the Monday council session, Greek European  Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos, confirmed at a press  conference this evening that the E.U. foreign ministers had  endorsed the recommended division of Bosnian territory.    He said that inasmuch as the Geneva plan was implemented,  the  easing would begin of sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro  (Yugoslavia). His use of the term easing rather than the usual  suspension of the sanctions has not gone unnoticed. The  sanctions were voted in place by the U.N. Security Council in  May 1992 in retaliation for Yugoslavia's alleged involvement in  civil war in neighbouring Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Asked by TANJUG's correspondent what instruments were being  envisaged for endorcing the plan, more specifically if all the  Bosnian warring nations were expected to comply with the same  requirements, Pangalos said that no accord could be reached  without all the sides agreeing.    Asked further by the same correspondent if this meant that  the same side should again be permitted to back out of this  latest agreement at the last moment on a new pretext with  impunity, as every time before, Pangalos answered by shrugging  his shoulders. Bosnian Moslems have so far rejected several  peace plans, opting instead for war.    The Greek minister said that the contact group for Bosnia  had  already taken steps to draft maps and bring the belligerents to  the conference table.    British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, speaking at a  separate press conference, said that the twelve ministers had  clearly and unequivocally backed the Geneva plan. Asked by the  GUARDIAN's correspondent John Palmer, who poses in Brussels as a  lobbyist for the Moslem cause, if this meant rewarding the Serb  "ethnic cleansing" in the way in which Hitler had been rewarded  with Czechoslovakia, Douglas Hurd replied he could not  understand the idea behind the question, explaining that the  Geneva plan envisaged for Bosnia to remain within its existing  borders, and for the Serbs to make the biggest territorial  concessions.    Bosnian Serbs, who own 64 percent of the land in Bosnia  according to the land books and currently control about 70  percent of the territory, have indicated in talks to date their  willingness to make certain territorial concessions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a time of strictly dealing blows to various  criminal activities, the security organs across the region  dedicated two months to waging a special struggle against  abductors and traffickers of people. Twenty-eight criminal  gangs were smashed, 110 human traffickers were arrested, and 170  women who had been abducted and trafficked in were rescued.    Over the past years, some lawbreakers ganged up with one  another to wantonly engage in the criminal activities of  abducting and trafficking in women and children in order to reap  staggering profits. The women who had been abducted and  trafficked in suffered all kinds of humiliation. Some of them  were even killed or cruelly injured by their buyers when they  gave a strong resistance. Some of them could not withstand  humiliation and committed suicide. Xia Lingfeng, who was from  Yunnan, was sold to Wang Erliang, a villager of Dalumao township  of Jungar Banner, for 5,000 yuan. Xia managed to run away  several times. Wang Yingxiang, Wang Erliang's father, took her  back and broke her legs with a bat. After disclosing this case,  the Jungar Banner security bureau immediately rescued her and  duly punished the buyers.    Through this struggle, the broad masses of security cadres  and policemen spared no hardships to conduct investigations  among each village and each household, persisted in the  principle of being resolute and steady, rescued all the women  who asked to be rescued if discovered, and rapidly and sternly  punished all the abductors and traffickers. An extraordinarily  powerful criminal gang involving 69 persons with two brothers,  namely Li Daichun and Li Dailin, as chief culprits, was  destroyed at a time by the Togtoh County security bureau. The  Hohhot city security bureau arrested a four-member criminal gang  with Gan Ming as chief culprit.    On 14 January, 52 women, the third group of women saved  through the special struggle, got on a train back home.</p>

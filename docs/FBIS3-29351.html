U.S. officials briefed South Korean Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu on the meeting upon his arrival in Washington earlier  in the day after traveling to Canada and meeting with United  Nations Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York.    After coordination with South Korea, U.S. officials are to  meet again with North Korean negotiators as soon as Friday,  Seoul officials said.    In Thursday's meeting, the two sides reportedly discussed  the  schedule for an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  inspection team to enter North Korea, resumption of inter-Korean  contacts to discuss an exchange of envoys, announcement of the  suspension of the South Korea-U.S. "Team Spirit" military drill,  and the third round of high-level talks, while agreeing in  principle to exchange a memorandum of understanding on a "small  package deal" this week.    North Korean officials said an IAEA team may be able to  initiate inspections early next week, adding they will propose a  fourth round of working-level talks with South Korea to discuss  an exchange of envoys. The talks have been stalled since last  October. But the two differed somewhat on the timing of the  Team Spirit suspension announcement and on future bilateral  relations, Seoul officials said.    It is true there was some disagreement over setting exact  dates, but the two would have no trouble reaching agreement  within the week, a government official predicted.    Washington reported the results of the meeting to Foreign  Minister Han and asked for Seoul's opinions on the non-agreed  issues, he said.</p>

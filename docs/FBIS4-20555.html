			<p>CSO     [Text] A new secondary battery for electric vehicles has  been put on the market which can be recharged at 10 times the  speed of conventional nickel-cadmium batteries. It is a  thin-film battery that was jointly developed by Dr. Noboru  Koyama and associates at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. (president: Y.  Morishita), and what is interesting about the battery is the  fact that the composite electrodes are made with organic sulphur  compounds. It is much lighter than conventional batteries, and  would last 10 times longer if it were the same weight. When it  becomes commercially available, it will help further the use of  electric cars in which one of the major stumblingblocks has been  how far the car can travel on one recharge. A secondary battery  is charged and discharged based on combinations of chemical  reactions that take place between the positive and negative  electrode. Dr. Koyama and associates resolved the delayed  reaction problem that had been plaguing batteries by focusing on  an organic compound (dimercapto-thiazole) in which thiols were  linked in thiazole chains, and formed a composite material for  the electrode by mixing highly superconductive polyaniline with  fine carbon particles. He and his associates prototyped a 1-cm  thin-film lithium battery that consisted of the composite  electrode that they developed, a solid gel electrolyte, and a  negative electrode (lithium foil). They then investigated the  energy capacity of the battery that tells them how much work the  battery can perform per kilogram of mass on one recharge.  Results of tests confirmed that the battery had 10 times the  energy capacity of commercially available NiCad batteries, and  five times the capacity of batteries which use only polyaniline.  Moreover, the company found that by adding diethyl carbonate to  ethylene carbonate to form the solid electrolyte that they could  apply high voltages to the battery for 4.3V recharges, and speed  up the time it takes to recharge the battery. Furthermore, the  new battery demonstrated the ability to maintain 80 percent  capacity after 50 repeat charges/discharges, showing the kind of  durability required for use commercially.</p>

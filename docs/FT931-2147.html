			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Management: Tighter rein on the treasury - Even blue-chip companies have suffered A group of employees dabbles on the foreign exchange futures market, betting on a rise in the dollar. The dollar then falls and they cover their tracks. Four years later they are discovered sitting on an unrealised loss of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 700m). The story sounds improbable. Yet it can happen to the most blue-chip of companies, as Shell found out when its Japanese associate, Showa Shell, disclosed such a loss last month. It is not just unauthorised dealings that can land companies in trouble. George Wimpey, the housebuilder, last week announced a Pounds 25m provision against the cost of unwinding interest rate futures contracts. About five years ago, the builder had bet on interest rates remaining high; the subsequent fall in rates has made it cancel its bet  - at a heavy cost. The scale of potential damage a treasury department can inflict on the profit line has made top management take notice. Big shareholders are taking an increasing interest too. They are not just worried about the scope for losses when controls break down - as was the case at Showa Shell - but about losses when companies take a view and get it wrong. The Association of Corporate Treasurers has recently published a booklet of awkward questions that investors and analysts can put to companies to understand their exposure. Pressure from shareholders, coupled with the growing list of corporate horror stories, is encouraging companies to build a structure of controls around their treasury departments. 'In the past, boards used to let the treasurer get on with it. They used to look at the treasury as a black box, yet now more companies are introducing policies and procedures,' says Nick Ross, partner of accountant Touche Ross. The first step is for the board to come out with a clear set of rules. 'Companies must ask themselves what level of risk they are happy with,' says Gerald Leahy, head of the Association of Corporate Treasurers. They should then issue a policy statement approved by the main board, making it clear to what extent the company hedges against movements in interest and exchange rates. The statement should lay down the objectives of the treasury department and provide lists of dealing limits in each sort of instrument, saying who can deal and in what amount. This sort of exercise seems to have focused the minds of companies and made them increasingly wary of taking any unnecessary risks. 'We never expose ourselves to unlimited risks, we always know what the downside is. If I want to do anything fancy, I need to get approval for it. But usually, I just stick to plain vanilla,' says the treasurer of an FT-SE 100 company. Only about 7 per cent of big companies run their treasury as a profit centre, and some companies are abolishing their central treasuries, passing the duties down the line to the operational level, where all exposures are mechanically covered as they arise. The whizzy financial deals that companies happily engaged in during the 1980s are becoming less common. 'We are saying to directors: 'If you don't understand it, say no',' says Leahy. A policy statement alone is not going to ensure that things run smoothly in the treasury. It is almost impossible to prevent someone from doing an unauthorised deal, but companies can at least ensure that such trades are quickly spotted. To this end, the person who does the trade should not be the same as the one who confirms it, nor the one that settles it. However, this rudimentary control is not followed by a large number of companies: according to Touche Ross, many of the top 250 UK companies do not separate their activities in this way. Companies should then set up accounting systems to measure how well the treasury department is doing and keep senior management abreast of what is going on. They should also issue to someone outside the department a regular report of all transactions. Once again, companies do not seem to be following best practice. According to Touche Ross, almost half do not revalue their positions regularly, which means that they may be sitting on losses or profits without being aware of it. However, these sort of controls are not likely to work unless the culture of the company discourages taking unacceptable risks. Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar company, has gone to some lengths to ensure that it is not in the interests of its 14-person treasury team to do anything untoward. Its incentives are structured so that there are no individual bonuses; and although the department as a whole may get a bonus, this is only loosely tied to its trading performance. The company claims the virtue of intellectual honesty is drummed into its traders, all of whom are trained in-house. Furthermore, all employees are encouraged to confess immediately if they make a mistake. Technology is also helping companies introduce better controls. At Tate &amp; Lyle, all telephone calls to the banks are recorded - a system that a few years ago would have cost some Pounds 30,000, but now can be had for a sixth of the price. Similarly, advances in computer technology are making it possible to revalue trading positions more frequently, so that the management of big companies will constantly be able to know where they stand at the touch of a button. Naturally, the systems appropriate to a big trading company are not necessary in a little company with a treasury of one person, yet the principles are the same. Controls are all very well, but there is a danger that companies can get fixated on the controls, rather than watch the intrinsic risks of what they are doing. Says Leahy: 'Auditors are putting more and more controls in, so that companies can kid themselves that with so many controls all is OK. But management have to think what sort of business they are in, and stick to their last.'</p>

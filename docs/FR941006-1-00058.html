			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This standard has been applied absolutely in the sense that any individual who does not meet the standard is determined to be physically unqualified to drive a CMV in interstate commerce without further consideration of individual ability. Public policy enunciated in the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. 93&hyph;112, 87 Stat. 355, as amended) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1991 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;336, 104 Stat. 327, as amended) indicates that a preferable standard would allow drivers to demonstrate their individual ability to drive safely, in spite of their vision deficiency. However, because no practical means of testing the ability of an individual with various vision deficiencies to safely operate a CMV were known to exist, except actual driving experience, the agency could not grant waivers and be certain that such waivers were ``consistent with the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles'' as required by the MCSA. The FHWA determined that a group of drivers did exist who, although they did not meet the standard, had already demonstrated their ability to drive safely. These drivers were either operating in intrastate commerce and subject to a less stringent State vision standard, or were operating, unwittingly or otherwise, in contravention of the existing interstate standard. Adoption of the Federal standard by many States, along with stepped-up enforcement at both the State and Federal levels, exposed these drivers to disqualification determinations. This was not inadvertent, however. Laws enacted over the past ten years have effectively increased resources dedicated to the enforcement of the Federal safety regulations or compatible State regulations by a factor of ten. Congress has insisted on uniform standards consistent with Federal regulations issued pursuant to the MCSA of 1984, and has authorized programs to encourage states to adopt those standards. Moreover, Federal regulations implementing the Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986 and its commercial driver's license provisions, have further helped detect drivers operating in interstate commerce who did not meet the Federal physical qualification requirements. Because of these efforts, more than 5,000 unqualified drivers have been identified and removed from interstate driving positions. That is, in fact, the intent of establishing minimum Federal standards and insuring they are enforced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Vision Waiver Study <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At the same time that these enforcement efforts were increasing, heightened awareness of the rights of disabled individuals, and the fact that some of the physical qualification standards were absolute in that they permitted no demonstration of ability notwithstanding the physical deficit, caused the FHWA to reexamine its vision standard. Several research studies, although acknowledging that visual capacity was an essential element of safe commercial vehicle operation, had failed to fully resolve the issue of what level of visual capacity would be required to assure safety. The FHWA decided to conduct a further study in an attempt to gather essential information that would lead to an improved standard. The difficulties with some of the previous studies included insufficient subjects and the absence of exposure data. The FHWA believed these difficulties could be overcome, in part, by using as subjects drivers who, although they did not meet the Federal vision standards, had been safely operating CMVs for some time and were now, for the reasons mentioned above, becoming more readily identifiable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA announced its vision waiver study in a Notice of Intent to accept applications for waivers on March 25, 1992, (57 FR 10295). The intent of the proposed program was to obtain valuable information on the relationship between visual capacity and the ability to operate a CMV safely. This vision waiver study was initiated as part of an overall regulatory review of the medical qualification standards applicable to interstate CMV drivers. It was also responsive to several Congressional Committee reports accompanying the Americans With Disabilities Act directing the Secretary within two years to ``undertake a thorough review of (the driver qualification) regulations to ascertain whether the standards conform with current knowledge *&blank;*&blank;* and whether such regulations are valid under this Act.''

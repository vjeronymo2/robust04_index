			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] FINANCE Minister Tharin Nimmanhemin told US  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen yesterday that Thailand will  improve its financial market access, but this does not mean that  foreign brokers will have full freedom to enter the country.    Not, that is, unless the law is revised so that the 49  percent limit on foreign ownership of securities firms is lifted.    Some Thai brokers point out that even Thai companies face  restrictions in share trading because of limits on licences  issued for stock market members.    Sa-ngad Sataphattana, Baring Research's director, does not  see full broker status for foreign companies in the next couple  of years because, not only foreign firms, but also securities  companies in the country cannot easily get brokerage licences.    There are 40 full brokers in Thailand, while a bigger number  are subbrokers which have been coveted to gain broker status.  [as published]    The Stock Exchange of Thailand [SET] recently announced that  it would grant another four broker licences to sub-brokers. The  new brokers will be chosen from sub-brokers which have a good  track record.    "Whether or not the securities business will be opened to  foreign countries depends on the readiness of securities houses  in Thailand and the securities market size of the country," said  Mr Sa-ngad.    He added that few local brokers were in a position to  compete  with foreign firms. The development of the Thai capital market  is not sufficient to cope with the entry of foreign securities  firms.    "Thailand has only one secondary market for stock trading.  An over-the-counter market has not been established yet. Debt  instruments, which lack liquidity, are at the fledgling stage,"  said Mr Sa-ngad.    He said US securities firms did not have a commitment in  Thailand's market. The demand by the US Treasury Secretary for  the liberalisation of the securities business is only aimed at  paving the way for the entry of US firms in the future.    "The US securities business in Thailand is tiny when  compared  to that of European countries. Normally, US securities firms  will send a team to handle big underwriting deals in Thailand,  such as the recent underwriting of Bangkok Bank's debt  instruments by Morgan Stanley," said Mr Sa-ngad.    Seri Chintanaseri, the Stock Exchange of Thailand's  president, who met with Mr Bentsen yesterday morning, said the  US Treasury Secretary did not discuss anything about the  possibility of foreign firms operating securities businesses in  Thailand.    Mr Seri said Mr Bentsen just wanted information about the  SET  index, listed companies and member companies of the SET and its  computer trading system.    Whether or not local securities firms are ready to compete  with foreign companies, Mr Seri said, is a matter for the  Government to decide in consultation with the SET. He said the  liberalisation of the securities industry would have to be  harmonised with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Rapi Sucharitkun, the Securities and Exchange Commission's  spokesman, said Thailand had to revise regulations to liberalise  the securities industry.    "The maximum limit on foreign holdings in securities firm in  Thailand is 49 percent. The limit has to be boosted to enable  foreigners to be major shareholders before seeking broker  seats," noted Mr Rapi who added that this would take a long time.    A source at the Finance Ministry said the ministry was  studying ways to liberalise the country's financial industry,  including the securities business.    "The possibility of securities liberalisation is still far  away. But the US may apply pressure to liberalise financial  services at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation group, which  will have a (finance ministers') meeting in March," said the  source who added that most ASEAN countries did not want to open  their financial markets to the US.</p>

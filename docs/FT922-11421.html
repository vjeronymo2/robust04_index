			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Life offices prune bonus pay-outs - The reasons why policyholders are feeling the pinch on their endowments LOOK AT your bonus statements this year and you might not feel as well endowed as you were. Life offices have completed their bonus announcements for 1991 and two surveys - by Money Management magazine; and actuary Clay &amp; Partners, in association with Money Marketing - show a downward trend in returns. No life company likes cutting bonuses; ultimately, the worth of the entire product depends on the investment pay-out. But the actuaries who control the pay-outs from endowment and pension contracts were confronted with a dilemma. Bonuses were maintained at high levels in 1990 - even though the UK stock market fell that year - in hope of recovery. Shares did rise, but not nearly as much as expected. Meanwhile, the new economic discipline of the exchange rate mechanism has forced actuaries to downgrade their forecasts for future returns. That, for many, meant bonus cuts. This trend has been most marked on 10-year policies. These are not buoyed by the strong returns equities enjoyed in the late 1970s. Over 25 years - the term needed to back a mortgage  - the trend is more muted. Norwich Union was the first office to declare and shocked observers by slashing bonuses 9 per cent. But this proved to be out of line. While these cuts remain the steepest made by any office, they have been attributed by actuaries to the high share of property and general insurance in NU's funds. Some companies, such as Commercial Union, General Accident and Scottish Life, even managed significant increases. All have risen up the 25-year league table. Everyone agrees that the final payout is the most important factor, as it determines how well your endowment will perform as an investment. But, as ever with life assurance, other important indicators lurk within the mass of actuarial data. With-profits contracts use two forms of bonus: reversionary, which are paid annually and are irrevocable once announced; and terminal, which are paid only when the contract has been completed. The terminal bonus is vulnerable to a bad year on the markets so more-conservative companies, which pay out most of their funds through reversionary bonuses, have appeal for people averse to risks. But high reversionary bonuses are funded by putting money into low-risk deposits, so fund managers must sacrifice their investment freedom to pay them. This helps to explain why Standard Life, with a traditionally high terminal bonus rate, has done very well in recent years - it has topped Money Management's 25-year survey since 1986. This also makes Commercial Union's jump into second place, only marginally behind Standard Life, look particularly impressive. If a monthly premium of Pounds 50 had been assumed, CU would even have overtaken Standard, according to Money Management. Meanwhile, when terminal bonuses are excluded, CU comes first in all the four time spans surveyed by Money Marketing. Another actuarial calculation derives a surrender value - the life assurance term for the amount you will receive if you stop paying the premiums early and ask for a cash sum. The costs of running the policy - including intermediaries' commission and administration charges - are loaded at the beginning of the term, so the value you will receive in the first five years of a 25-year policy is awful. But what about surrender values after 24 years? Last year's Money Marketing survey showed that these returns barely deserved to be called 'with-profits' at all. Several companies offered only 40 per cent of what investors could get by hanging on for another year. This year, 19 of the 32 companies surveyed increased 24-year pay-outs. But the table, which shows 24-year values as a percentage of maturity values, still includes some figures that are hard to justify. CU's presence in the bottom five shows that conservative reversionary bonuses do not necessarily improve values if you surrender early. What of underlying investment performance? Past performance is never a guide to future prospects, as most readers will know, and the past year has seen a shake-up of the usual top payers. Last year, Money Management identified a 'Magnificent Seven' offices based on the consistency of their performances. Standard Life, Friends Provident, Scottish Amicable and Scottish Widows are still in the 25-year top 10 but Tunbridge Wells, Norwich Union and Clerical Medical are not. On Clay &amp; Partners' survey, four companies have been in the top 10 over all time periods this year and last. They are Friends Provident, Standard Life, Scottish Amicable and Royal London. Make of all these figures what you will. Some patterns are clearer. Guardian Royal Exchange's performance shows an alarming consistency over all periods - according to Money Marketing, GRE has the worst endowment pay-out over 10, 15 and 25 years. Over five years, it also has the worst pension performance, with an annualised yield of -1.8 per cent. In other words, after five years its fund is worth less than the total value of premiums paid in. Money Marketing also has valuable data on pension contracts and with-profits bonds, both of which have seen feverish marketing over the past few years. Reduced pay-outs have fed through to pensions, broadly in line with the trend for endowments. But the offices at the top of the tables tend to be pension specialists which do not figure in the endowment tables. Scottish Equitable heads the league for personal pensions since the start of July 1988, when they were introduced, with Equitable Life, Sun Life and Pearl all showing prominently. Over 10 years (using figures for the old 'Section 226' self-employed pension contracts), a Pounds 1,000 single premium would now have grown to Pounds 6,303 with Pearl, Pounds 6,191 with Scottish Life and Pounds 5,483 with Scottish Equitable. Assuming monthly premiums of Pounds 35 over the same period, Pearl would offer the best pay-out, of Pounds 15,131, followed by Scottish Amicable on Pounds 12,619 and Norwich Union on Pounds 12,451. Clay &amp; Partners sounds a note of caution on with-profits bonds. These take a single premium, and bonuses are added each year in the usual fashion. But offices reserve the right to make 'market value adjustments' if you surrender early at a time when the market is falling. As security is the big attraction of these bonds, compared with unit trusts these problems could be critical. Equitable Life and Legal &amp; General were the only offices surveyed which gave precise dates at which they guaranteed not to apply a MVA. At the fifth and each subsequent anniversary, the Equitable guarantees there will be no downward adjustment, while L&amp;G makes a similar guarantee for the 10th anniversary. The judgement of John Jenkins, insurance partner with Clay &amp; Partners, is unequivocal. 'I think there is an area here which independent advisers are overlooking in not attaching enough importance to the guarantee,' he says. 'I would regard these offices' products as fundamentally better than the others, for that reason.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       TOP TEN ENDOWMENTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             TEN YEARS Exc terminal bonus    pounds    Inc terminal bonus   pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Commercial Union    6,997     Equitable Life*      9,543 2 Tunbridge Wells     6,604     Tunbridge Wells      9,434 3 Eagle Star          6,501     Pearl*               9,283 4 Clerical medical    6,422     Friends Provident    9,176 5 London Life*        6,414     Standard Life        8,983 6 Legal &amp; General*    6,350     Scottish Amicable*   8,959 7 Scottish Mutual*    6,335     Royal London         8,923 8 Standard Life       6,282     Clerical Medical     8,862 9 Scottish Provident  6,278     Norwich Union        8,831 10 Norwich Union      6,248     Commercial Union     8,746  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     TWENTY-FIVE YEARS Exc terminal bonus    pounds    Inc terminal bonus   pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1 Commercial Union    30,768    Standard Life        44,004 2 Eagle Star          25,074    Commercial Union     43,844 3 Norwich Union       22,857    General Accident     43,535 4 Legal &amp; General*    21,782    Scottish Life        43,163 5 Royal London        21,167    Royal London         42,418 6 Royal Life          20,218    Friends Provident    42,311 7 General Accident    19,699    Scottish Amicable*   41,924 8 Scottish Widows     19,250    Equity &amp; Law         41,726 9 Scottish Provident  18,663    Eagle Star           41,433 10 Clerical Medical   18,589    Scottish Widows      41,004  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Policies started by 29-year-old male non-smoker.  pounds35 monthly premiums for ten-year term, pounds 20 monthly premiums for 25-year term.

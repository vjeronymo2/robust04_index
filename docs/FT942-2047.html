			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Daf's bank creditors likely to get full pay-out Bank creditors to Daf NV, the Dutch truckmaker which collapsed in 1993, have received nearly 90 per cent of what they were owed and are likely to be compensated in full. A report by the Dutch receivers said it was realistic to assume that Daf NV's 11 bank creditors would receive the full Fl 732.5m (Dollars 400m) claimed. On May 1, they had received Fl 645.7m, or 88 per cent of the total, after three payments. Daf sought protection from creditors in February 1993. It was later resurrected in slimmed-down form as Daf Trucks NV, that excluded Leyland Daf, the former Daf's UK business. Shareholders in the old Daf NV were left holding worthless shares. The money raised for bank creditors has been generated mainly by the sale of assets owned by three Daf NV subsidiaries. These assets, pledged as collateral to the banks during Daf's financial crisis, have been sold to Daf Trucks. The second main source of money is the transfer of funds from the UK receivers of Leyland Daf. Holders of a bond issued by Daf NV in 1988 have lodged claims of Fl 157m, and they have sought, unsuccessfully, to win a share of the assets belonging to these subsidiaries. Daf's largest bank creditor, ABN Amro of the Netherlands, had received Fl 294.6m of its claim of Fl 32.6m by May 1 1994, the receivers' report said. Among UK bank creditors, Lloyds Bank had received Fl 48.5m out of Fl 54.8m claimed, NatWest Fl 37.8m out of Fl 42.5m and Barclays Fl 25.5m out of Fl 28.8m. The receivers' figures, published in an interim report, are exclusive of interest and facility fees. The debts of the Daf Finance Group, the former Daf financing arm, have been reduced to Fl 1.06bn from Fl 1.86bn, reflecting the strategy of gradually selling the finance company's portfolio.</p>

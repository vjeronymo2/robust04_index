			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and Aleksandr </F> Kondrashov]    [Text] Belgrade, 17 Apr -- A comprehensive cessation of  hostilities on all Bosnian fronts should become a starting point  for ending the critical situation around Gorazde, today Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated following his meeting  with the Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.    It is necessary to ensure that the Serbian troops be  withdrawn from the town and that its shelling -- an excessive  response to the provocations of the Muslim side -- be ceased,  said the Russian minister. We also consider the NATO air  strikes to be an excessive reaction. However, at this point it  is important to stop this chain of developments, to define the  borders of the security zone in Gorazde, to bring there UN  observers and to observe the cease-fire not only in Gorazde, but  also on all Bosnian fronts, so as to avoid repeated duplications  of such crisis situations in different areas.    I am glad that our approach coincides in principle with the  position described by President Milosevic. The important point  is that these steps -- lifting the blockade of Gorazde, removing  all the problems which have emerged with the personnel of the UN  forces, the observance of the regime of the security zone and  the comprehensive cease-fire -- all these steps should be  implemented in practice.    Such implementation will create a solid foundation for  firmly  raising the issue of lifting the sanctions against the former  Yugoslavia, the Russian minister emphasized.    Asked what Russia would do should there be another breach of  the procedure of the use of force by NATO against Bosnian Serbs,  Andrey Kozyrev said: Within the last 24 hours, in spite of the  crisis in Gorazde, we applied serious efforts to prevent new air  strikes. I maintain that now all will depend on the  implementation of the complex of measures outlined at my meeting  with President Milosevic. At the forthcoming meeting in Pale  between the leaders of the Bosnian Serbs and the UN  representatives, with the participation of Russia, it is  necessary to have the borders of the security zone clearly  defined and the issues of bringing there UN observers discussed.  The adherence to these accords, the complete cessation of the  shelling of the town and the lifting of the blockade of the UN  personnel -- all these steps will make redundant the issue of  the air strikes.</p>

At least 15,000 public works employees  throughout the country participated in the stoppage to demand  payment of salaries and overtime, as well as a reclassification  of personnel based on an agreement reached last year.    Salvador Acuna, secretary general of the ATMOP [Public Works  Ministry Workers Association], said other public works  departments will join the stoppage if the demands are not met.    [Begin Acuna recording] For the time being we can count on  15,000 employees honoring the stoppage. We can add new workers  every day with the new departments that have joined us. The Air  Transportation Directorate could join us tomorrow, because we  have ATMOP directorate board members there. The same goes for  the National Land Transportation Directorate, which will join  the stoppage today, and the Maritime Transportation Directorate,  which could join on Friday. We do not want to inflict major  damage, but our demands must be met or we will continue the  stoppage indefinitely. [end recording]    We have reports from all over the country that employees of  public works' branches in all department capitals will implement  the measure to support the demands.</p>

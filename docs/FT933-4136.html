			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / China, UK end latest HK talks China and Britain closed their 11th round of talks on Hong Kong political reforms yesterday agreeing to meet again in two weeks as they strive to resolve a bitter dispute over democratic change, reports Reuter in Beijing. The official Xinhua news agency said the next round of talks would take place in Beijing from September 26-27, close to the time when the two countries' foreign ministers are expected to meet at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. The talks, which have dragged on since April, are aimed at working out differences over Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten's plans to implement limited democratic reforms in the British colony before handing it back to Beijing in 1997. The Patten proposal has enraged Beijing, and the talks have struggled along for months with no apparant sign of progress.</p>

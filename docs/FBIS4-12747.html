			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ahmad Quray,' head of the Palestinian </F> delegation to the economic talks with Israel, by radio  correspondent Salim Badawi in Paris on 11 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Quray'] During this round of talks, we reached an  agreement on three issues. The first issue is related to  agriculture. In addition to organizing the relationship between  the two parties, the agreement has opened, for the first time,  the Israeli market for Palestinian agricultural products, such  as vegetables and fruits. The Israeli market was completely  closed before to Palestinian products. This is one of the  papers that was accomplished.    The second paper deals with industry. This paper has defined  the requirements for developing Palestinian industry and the  relationship between the two parties. The paper even deals with  the issue of standards and our commitment to these standards.  Since Israel already has very rigid standards, we will not try  at first to follow their standards, but we hope that in the  future we will have our own firm industrial standards.    The third paper deals with energy. In this paper, we insist  on pricing all oil products in accordance with the income of our  Palestinian people. Although they insisted on one price for  gasoline, it was agreed to allow a difference of 15 percent  between the prices of fuel in the West Bank and Gaza and the  prices of fuel in Israel.    Therefore, I believe that all these papers are good because  -- although they did not meet all the demands -- they met some  of the most important Palestinian aspirations to lay down the  bases for an economic system that can survive and develop.    [Badawi] Brother Abu-al-'Ala' [Quray' nom de guerre]: The  self-rule agreement has not yet been implemented although 13  April is very close. What is the major obstacle in your view,  and what do you expect to happen in the future? Rabin said the  agreement on self-rule will not be reached before the first half  of next month.    [Quray'] I do not want to anticipate things or deal with the  causes. There is no doubt they shoulder the major  responsibility for not accomplishing the accord on the set date,  despite the great importance of respecting the dates stipulated  by the accord -- I am talking in particular about the date 13  April -- which means real implementation of the accord on the  ground in terms of withdrawal, the return of Palestinian  leaders, and the presence of Palestinian security and police on  the ground. This should have been respected by them as well as  by us. Regrettably, this date has not been met. However, I can  say that the current round of talks in Cairo and the economic  talks being held here will help expedite the implementation of  this accord. I am optimistic that the Gaza-Jericho accord will  be accomplished before the end of this month, within two weeks,  or even less than this.</p>

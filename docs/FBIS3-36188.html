			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TRUD military observer Viktor Badurkin commentary under the </F> "View on Situation" rubric: "Should We Have no Faith in Signed  Document?"]    [Text] The signatures of Presidents Boris Yeltsin, Leonid  Kravchuk, and Bill Clinton had hardly dried out on their joint  statement on the future fate of Ukrainian nuclear missiles when  it began to be "torpedoed" in Kiev in parliament and especially  at the Ministry of Defense. Whereas the parliamentarians  restricted themselves to verbal criticism of their president's  conciliatory behavior and their dissatisfaction with the amount  of compensation for nuclear disarmament, the generals  immediately embarked on decisive action.    At first the idea developed at the heart of the military  department of retaining on a temporary basis at "S" facilities  (special bases) the nuclear warheads which had been separated  from their delivery vehicles. And then a week ago an  unexpectedly but very insistent proposal was made at the  ministry collegium that the command of missile troops stationed  on Ukrainian territory should take an oath of allegiance to  Ukraine.    On the subject of the political "overtones" of the moves by  the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, it is hard to see them as  anything but a clear challenge to the line which Leonid Kravchuk  is pursuing with regard to the state's nuclear disarmament.  After all it is clearly written into the Moscow agreement that  all nuclear warheads should be withdrawn from Ukrainian  territory to Russia for the purpose of their subsequent  dismantling in the shortest possible time. You might ask, why  then compel the missile troops' officers to take an oath of  allegiance to Ukraine, why form their own missile troops, and  why create a command center for strategic nuclear forces?    You can only come to one conclusion: The Kiev generals are,  irrespective of the consequences, attempting to draw out the  process of handing over the nuclear weapons to Russia. What is  more, this is being done to the accompaniment of public  assurances from the minister Vitaliy Radetskyy about the  soundness of the three presidents' decision.    I think that the key to this paradox is fairly simple. In  order to command strategic forces you have at least to have  some, otherwise the number of posts is cut, which means a loss  of power, privileges, and everything else which guarantees the  rank of general. Therefore, the Ukrainian military's reaction  is completely understandable. It is more difficult to explain  the parliamentarians' behavior. Colonel General Yevgeniy  Maslin, chief specialist in nuclear missiles at the Russian  Ministry of Defense, told me about his recent appearance before  Kiev deputies. For about an hour he explained to them how  dangerous it is not only for Ukraine but for the whole Europe to  continue to store nuclear weapons without proper maintenance and  replacement of their components, after which questions were put  to him in rapid succession, including for example: But how much  will Russia be able to afford for the Ukrainian warheads? An  example of how politics and trade are interconnected....    Meanwhile, for some reason nobody is taking any interest in  how much it will cost Russia to dismantle the "independent"  [Ukrainian] munitions. Very likely much more than the $60  million the United States has appropriated for this purpose.  (Incidentally, even this money is not "compensation" from kindly  Uncle Sam for hazardous work undertaken, nor is it disinterested  aid, but merely an advance made against the Russian share in the  contract for highly enriched uranium.) At the same time Russia  has also agreed to provide Ukraine with fuel assemblies for  nuclear power stations containing 100 tonnes of low-enriched  uranium as the a first installment of the settlement for 200  missile warheads which in the next 10 months should be  transferred to our plants for dismantling.    If the Kiev politicians and generals do nevertheless manage  to draw out this process, we may all regret the consequences.  The price of procrastination is too high -- radiation respects  no borders. Three SS-24 missile warheads which were recently  urgently transported to Russia in a dangerous [predavariynyy]  condition proved this. Due to periodic technical maintenance  not being carried out at the proper time, hydrogen and other  constituents began to accumulate in them resulting in a buildup  of explosive gas. Apart from this, as time goes by nuclear  munitions are subject to corrosion, the products of which are  toxic and radioactive. There are after all 46 SS-24 missile  launchers, 130 SS-19 launchers, and about 40 TU-160 and TU-95  heavy bombers of the Navy, for which almost 670 long-range  cruise missiles with nuclear warheads are in storage.    Missile complexes began to be wound down in November and the  Ukrainian storage facilities are at this moment already  overflowing with nose sections and nuclear weapons taken off  alert status, which has significantly increased the background  radiation. This is no empty claim but a fact confirmed by the  chief designers from Arzamas-16 who have visited Pervomaysk. It  is at the very least shortsighted and foolhardy not to take what  they say into consideration.    There is one more side to the question. Next year the Treaty  on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons runs out. If Ukraine  does not become a party to it as a nonnuclear power, a dangerous  precedent will be set for the whole world. In such  circumstances the notorious "domino" effect cannot be ruled out  as there are more than enough people wishing to follow this bad  example, including those along Russia's southern borders.    We can only rely on the good sense of Kiev's politicians and  the Ukrainian president's ability to carry out the adopted  decisions and to keep to the obligations he signed with his own  hand.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Annie Thomas] </F>   [Text] Kigali, June 12 (AFP) -- Rebels from the Rwandan  Patriotic Front (RPF) heavily shelled the capital Kigali Sunday  [12 June] while maintaining their siege around Gitarama, the  strategic town where the interim government has set up its  headquarters.    Major Jean-Guy Plante, spokesman for the UN Assistance  Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR), said interim Prime Minister Jean  Kambanda was still in Gitarama although interim President  Theodore Sindikubwabo and several ministers had left the city  earlier in the week.    He said officially, Sindikubwabo and his entourage are to  spend about a week in northwestern Gisenyi before returning to  Gitarama, located 50 kiLometres (30 miles) south of the capital.    The mainly Hutu interim government established its  headquarters in Gitarama last month after the Tutsi-dominated  RPF began to close in on the capital.    The rebels since then have taken control of areas south of  Gitarama and on Saturday opened a new front to the northwest of  the town.    A well-informed military source meanwhile said that "tons  and  tons of munitions" have been reaching the rebel headquarters in  Milundi in the last three weeks, enough to allow the RPF to  continue fighting "for another year." The source, who spoke on  condition of anonymity, said government troops were also  probably receiving weapons and munitions, without which they  could not continue fighting back. He did not name the country  where the weapons originated.    UNAMIR officials would neither confirm nor deny the report,  which if proven true would constitute a violation of a UN  weapons embargo imposed on May 17.    "I have no information on this subject," Plante said.    Five rounds of UN-brokered peace talks aimed at ending the  interethnic conflict that has claimed hundreds of thousands of  lives since April 6 have so far proven fruitless. Another round  of talks is to begin Monday with leaders from both camps  expected to participate.    Military sources said it is unlikely the rebels would agree  to lay down their weapons before capturing Gitarama, which is  strategically located, and would mark a symbolic victory for  them. The RPF is also demanding a stop to ongoing massacres of  civilians in government-held territory.    Despite pressure by the international community, the carnage  has persisted unabated with the RPF also accused of executing  its opponents.    The rebels meanwhile have continued making gains on the  ground and on Sunday shelled Kigali, which is still held by  government troops. Four shells landed near the Red Cross  hospital in Kigali, where government troops have placed heavy  weapons. Previous shelling of the area killed two local Red  Cross employees.    Two districts where government troops massacred Tutsi  refugees in recent days were also being targeted by the rebels  over the weekend.    The UN has said it is powerless to try and evacuate other  refugees trapped in the region.    Rwanda plunged into an ethnic bloodbath on April 6, after a  plane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and neighboring Burundi  was apparently shot down, killing both leaders.</p>

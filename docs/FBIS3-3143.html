While examining and discussing  the government work report, Hu Jintao probed ways to promote  economic development in central and western China with the  deputies.    Deputy Zhang Wule, acting governor of Gansu, was the first  to  speak: Gansu's economic development was fairly healthy in  recent years and saw a growth rate of 8 to 10 percent every  year. Its total output value of goods and services reached 34.9  billion yuan last year. Hu Jintao was very pleased to hear this.    Speaking on some reform programs for this year, Zhang Wule  expressed his full support for the central authorities'  decisions and noted that these reforms were, in general,  favorable to Gansu's economic development and that temporary  difficulties could be overcome. Then, he spoke on problems in  helping Gansu's poor areas extricate themselves from poverty and  become prosperous; running large and medium-sized state  enterprises well; developing village and town enterprises; and  correctly handling relations among reform, development, and  stability.    Hu Jintao, who knows Gansu's conditions very well, asked  directors and managers from Lanzhou Petroleum Processing and  Chemical Complex, Lanzhou Chemical Industrial Corporation, and  the Jinchuan Nonferrous Metals Corporation about the operation  of their respective enterprises. Guo Xilian, Yang Jinyi, and  other deputies answered his questions. They reported:  Presently, large and medium-sized state enterprises are facing  the problems of antiquated equipment, heavy social burdens, and  poor internal management. The fundamental way out of such a  difficult position lies in deepening reform, changing operating  mechanisms, and accelerating the establishment of a modern  enterprise system compatible with a socialist market economy.    When Deputy Gu Jun, administrative commissioner of Dingxi  prefecture, touched on antipoverty work in the prefecture, Hu  Jintao asked with concern: "Have people there resolved the  problem of inadequate food and clothing?" Gu Jun replied: "An  overwhelming majority of them have basically resolved this  problem. Now the per capita apportionment of food in the  prefecture is nearly 300 kg and per capita income for peasants  is about 500 yuan. The major contradiction in antipoverty work  has shifted from the settlement of the food problem to ways to  increase peasants' income. To adjust ourselves to the new  situation, we will make corresponding changes in our ideology  and work methods." Hu Jintao nodded with satisfaction after  hearing this.    In his remarks Deputy Lu Kejian, chairman of the Gansu  Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, proposed that  it was necessary to gradually intensify the supervision over  governments, people's courts, and people's procuratorates by  people's congress and their standing committees at various  levels, and to gradually have this work done in accordance with  standards, procedures, and laws. Hu Jintao said: The system of  people's congress is China's basic political system and a good  form for inviting people to be their own masters. In the course  of establishing socialist democracy, we should further  strengthen this system and constantly improve it in practice.    Deputy Zheng Jinxia, a female health worker from Zhennan  village, Dongxian county -- the most remote, poor area of Gansu  -- reported that schools run by the people in the villages could  not pay teachers on time and they had difficult lives. She  hoped that the central authorities would attach importance to  and tackle this problem.    "You have put forward an excellent opinion!" said Hu Jintao  loudly, "authorities from central to local levels must resolve  to settle this problem. We would rather cut a project or cancel  a construction project than default teachers' wages. Wages for  teachers working in areas with hard conditions should, in  particular, be ensured by taking special measures."    Hu Jintao asked Gansu's party and government leading cadres  sitting amid the deputies: "Do you agree or not?" Gansu  Provincial Party Secretary Yan Haiwang said: "I absolutely  agree. We will resolve this problem appropriately."    After hearing deputies' remarks, Hu Jintao first expressed  his nostalgia and concern over the land of Gansu itself and  people of various nationalities there. He noted: Over the past  decade or so, Gansu, like other parts of the country, has  brought about a significant change in its appearance through  firm adherence to the party's basic line and unity and hard work  of people throughout the province. They have particularly  implemented the guidance in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important  talk during his south China tour and the guidelines of the 14th  CPC National Congress and have further emancipated their minds  to achieve new progress in various aspects of work. This has  further strengthened our confidence in taking the course of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by  Comrade Deng Xiaoping.    Hu Jintao said: There is one important reward from this  session -- deputies have generally reached a consensus in the  basic principles and overall interests for the work of the  entire party and the whole country, which has laid a good  ideological foundation for accomplishing all sorts of work for  this year more satisfactorily. Now that the tasks are set and  the general policies and principles are defined, as long as we  unswervingly adhere to the central authorities' arrangement;  keep the overall situation in mind; work in a down-to-earth  manner; and correctly and properly handle the relations among  reform, development, and stability, we are sure to complete all  sorts of work well this year.    Hu Jintao noted: To enliven Gansu's economy, we should,  first of all, further emancipate the minds, get a clear  understanding of the situation, seize the opportunity, and use  new ideas and new concepts suitable for the establishment of a  socialist market economic structure to guide our work. We  should proceed from specific conditions in Gansu, promote  development with opening up and reform, take the advantage of  local conditions, and make good use of our own superiority. It  is necessary to attach great importance to and strengthen  agriculture as the foundation of the national economy; improve  the basic conditions for agricultural production; gradually  readjust the economic structure in rural areas after ensuring  stable grain production; develop high-yield, fine-quality, and  high- efficiency agriculture; vigorously develop village and  town enterprises; and strive to increase peasants' income. We  should further invigorate large and medium-sized state  enterprises and continue to enable them to play the role as a  mainstay in the national economy. We should encourage the  social practice of respecting knowledge and professionals and  promote economic development by relying on scientific progress.  We should further enhance unity among various nationalities and  maintain social stability, so that Gansu will achieve better  results in various aspects of work.</p>

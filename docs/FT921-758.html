			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / International Company News: Ford's Australian losses deepen to ADollars 114m as sales fall FORD Australia, a subsidiary of the US motor group, yesterday announced a net loss of ADollars 114m (USDollars 87m) for the year to the end of December, compared with a net loss of ADollars 83m in the previous year. However, Ford said the net loss fell to ADollars 61m after deducting the cost of restructuring and charges relating to prior years' operations. On that basis, the loss was ADollars 22m smaller than in 1990. Ford said revenue was down 19 per cent to ADollars 2.3bn. The total Australian market for cars and trucks fell by 17 per cent to 514,566 vehicles, the lowest for 20 years with the exception of 1987. The group lost overall market leadership during the period to Toyota, the Australian subsidiary of the Japanese motor group, but claims to have recovered its lead in the last six months of the year. Mr Jac Nasser, president, said the group had improved product quality and productivity and was well prepared for a recovery in the vehicle market when confidence returned to the economy. But he said long-term recovery for the Australian vehicle industry would depend on government action to boost the economy, including lower interest rates, tax relief and increased export incentives. He said the urgency of the problem confronting the industry was highlighted by forecasts that imports would take 53 per cent of the market in the first quarter of this year, compared with about 45 per cent in the comparable period of last year. Mr Nasser said the industry's difficulties were likely to be worsened by recently-announced voluntary restrictions on Japanese car exports to the US, which would cause Japanese manufacturers to consider increasing exports to Australia. Statistics released by the federal government yesterday showed that new car registrations fell by 3.5 per cent in February, compared with the comparable month of last year. However, the trend figures, which smooth out fluctuations in monthly figures, showed an increase of 2.2 per cent, the strongest rise for more than two years. Mitsubishi Motors Australia plans to buy out minority shareholders and delist its shares from the Australian Stock Exchange, Reuter reports from Adelaide. Mr Mike Quinn, managing director, said the decision was taken because of exchange rules requiring an adequate spread of shareholders and because of illiquid trading in the shares. It would pay the shareholders, who own 2.9 per cent of the company, ADollars 7.75 a share, for a total of ADollars 1.86m. At the same time, MMAL reported a fall in net losses to ADollars 23.79m for 1991 from profits of ADollars 13.72m. Sales fell to ADollars 1.23bn from ADollars 1.29bn.</p>

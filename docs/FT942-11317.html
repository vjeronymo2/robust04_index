			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Discord in the shires hampers councils review Voters went to the polls in 114 shire districts in England and Wales yesterday not knowing whether the councillors they elected would ever be asked to face re-election for the same council. In four years, if government plans go according to timetable, most of the district councils will have been abolished - along with the county councils, which control education and social services - to be replaced by all-purpose unitary authorities. But developments in the last month have made it clear that this process will not be easy. Counties and districts disagree fundamentally over how the reorganisation should be carried out. Most districts want small unitary authorities, ideally based on old district boundaries. Meanwhile, counties tend to favour either large unitary authorities or a continuation of the present two-tier system, perhaps with some minor reforms to clarify responsibility in areas where local citizens are confused. However, the government denies that this option is allowed under the legislation. Disagreements could seriously delay the review. The process of reviewing counties has been slower than scheduled, and the government has announced firm proposals for only two - Cleveland and the Isle of Wight. Under the government's current guidance, the Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, the former CBI director-general, must give priority to reorganisation plans that have been agreed by all local politicians. The aim of this is to accelerate the review. During April, councils in 26 counties submitted proposals for restructuring to Sir John. He is due to announce a series of proposals - including a favoured option and at least one alternative - for 13 in the second week of June, and for a second 13 in July. But in none of the 26 did the county agree with all the districts, and in most counties the districts disagreed with each other. Under district plans, the 234 authorities involved, including counties and districts, would be replaced by 130 unitaries. Counties favour a variety of different plans. Ill-feeling between the local authority associations has intensified over the past 12 months, and boiled over in April when the Association of County Councils received a leaked copy of the Association of District Councils' lobbying strategy for the review and passed it to the press. The strategy suggested concentration on forming small unitaries to the exclusion of almost all else. The implications of such strong rivalry in a supposedly consensual process have not been lost on the government. One official for the commission said that both counties and districts had behaved 'increasingly childishly', and suggested they would need to show more realism if the review was to be a success.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       AUTHORITIES AT LOGGERHEADS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Proposals Sir John and the commission are studying with preliminary decisions due next month are:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Berkshire: county wants four unitaries, districts prefer five Bedfordshire: districts want three unitaries, county wants a unitary county Cambridgeshire: county wants two unitaries, districts four Cheshire; districts want six unitaries, county prefers existing two-tier system Cumbria: districts aim for five unitaries, county wants two-tier system (with some transfers of responsibilities) Devon: districts want six unitaries, county prefers unitary Plymouth and a two-tier system for the rest of county Hampshire: districts want five unitaries, county prefers 'improved' two-tier status quo Kent: districts want seven unitaries, county wants improved status quo Lancashire: districts want nine unitaries, county wants improved status quo Leicestershire: county wants improved status quo, districts disagree between unitary and two-tier Notts: county wants improved two-tier system, while all eight districts want unitary status Oxfordshire: county wants one unitary, districts want four Staffordshire: county prefers unitary Stoke-on-Trent with two tiers elsewhere, districts want six unitaries Suffolk: county wants improved status quo, districts want four unitaries  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- The commission's reaction to the remaining 13 councils is due in July:  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Buckinghamshire: county wants status quo, districts prefer four unitaries Dorset: county wants three unitaries, districts four Durham: districts want four unitaries, county prefers unitary Darlington and two-tier elsewhere East Sussex: districts want 3 to 5 unitaries, county suggests range of options including 3 unitaries Essex: districts want 8 to 9 unitaries, county prefers improved status quo Hereford &amp; Worcester: districts want 6 unitaries, county wants unitary Herefordshire, two-tier Worcestershire Norfolk: districts want 5 unitaries, county wants status quo Northants: county wants improved two-tiers, districts want four unitaries Northumberland: county and 5 of 6 districts want status quo Surrey: county wants improved status quo, districts want 5 to 6 unitaries Warwickshire: county wants improved two-tier, districts want 3 unitaries West Sussex: county wants improved two-tier, districts 3 to 4 unitaries Wiltshire: county wants unitary Thamesdown (which includes Swindon) and two-tier the rest, districts want 3 unitaries  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

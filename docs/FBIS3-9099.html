			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Fighters and citizens of Mostar put on a  magnificent, unprecedented welcome for members of the Army of  the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, who today, through the  mediation of the Red Cross and UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces],  were set free after having spent several months in prison.    The meetings with relatives and friends (?who waited for  them  anxiously) are difficult to describe. In the first group, this  afternoon, 178 former inmates arrived [in the Muslim-held part  of Mostar]. Twenty-two persons, in accordance with their own  wishes, were sent to the right bank [as heard] of the city,  which is under the control of the HVO [Croatian Defense  Council], while 12 of those freed went to Jablanica. At any  moment a second group of prisoners should arrive, so that the  agreement on their release can be fully implemented. [passage  omitted]</p>

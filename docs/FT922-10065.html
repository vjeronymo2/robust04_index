			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Unions' political links may take cover after race for top job THE Labour leadership election has accelerated the timetable for reform of the link between the unions and the party, with the argument increasingly between a complete break and a radical scaling down of the union role. Union leaders have privately been scathing about the way the Labour party has organised the election, and party leaders have been equally critical of the way some union leaders have been publicly toying with their electoral college votes and refusing to ballot their members. The strained personal relations between Labour leaders and union bosses bodes well for the radical reformers. But the largest group of union leaders  -currently embracing the GMB general union, the AEEU engineering and electricians' union and the Nupe public-service union - want to hang on to some institutional link. Even the most conservative voices in the party and the unions accept that the unions must be removed from the electoral college that will elect the new leader. Mr Bill Morris, leader of the leftwing TGWU general workers' union, does not want to go much further than that and he says that abolishing the block vote at the party conference could be 'disastrous'. But he, along with the left in the unions, is outnumbered by the more bold reformers. Mr Bill Jordan, president of the AEEU, said yesterday that the 'block vote has to go'. Like Mr John Edmonds at the GMB and Mr Tom Sawyer at Nupe, Mr Jordan wants to keep some formal link but he says it must be one that 'prevents the unions dictating policy to the Labour party and a possible Labour government'. The unions operate at several levels in the party - through the block vote at conference, through the electoral college, through seats on the National Executive Committee and reserved places on the policy review bodies, and through influence in local constituency parties. Quite what leaders such as Mr Jordan and Mr Edmonds do want to hold on to, beyond the excitement of wielding some power in an important political party, is not clear although Mr Edmonds stresses moving the unions' 'common-sense' influence on party policy to local level away from the glare of the party conference. The number of people supporting a complete divorce is quite small and largely restricted to those in the Labour camp, but the argument that union influence could remain strong but indirect - through shared values and through continued financial backing - could gain supporters over the coming months.</p>

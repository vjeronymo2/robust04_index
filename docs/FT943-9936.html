			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Equity Markets: Differing views emerge on base rates - London It looks as if the stock market, the Bank of England and the investment press are working on different time-scales where base rate prospects are concerned. The Bank's Quarterly Bulletin went down very well in a market still dismayed by the sudden, and still largely unexplained, rise in Treasury bill rates which preceded it. That same report, say the more unkind of the City analysts, was greeted by 'almost hysterical press commentary', suggesting the Bank was considering an immediate rate rise. It is, of course, all a question of timing. Any illusions that base rates can stay at present levels for long, let alone be trimmed just once more, had long since melted away from equity strategists' reports. National Westminster Bank says bluntly that base rates will be raised to 5.75 per cent 'within the next six to eight weeks and peak at 6.75 per cent in the middle of next year'. Strauss Turnbull also sees rates at 5.75 per cent very shortly. Having answered its first question - 'Where are base rates heading?' - the market is ready with answers for the second - 'What will higher rates do to equities?' The widely-held view is that the UK stock market has successfully moved from being interest-rate driven to becoming driven by the economic recovery, in the form of higher earnings and dividends, actual and prospective. Reported earnings for non-financial stocks are now running at 8 per cent above last year and analysts are becoming more lavish with upgraded earnings forecasts for UK companies. Real dividend growth of around 6.3 per cent next year is also widely anticipated. There is an even more optimistic view on base rate trends. Chartists claim, and can produce graphs to prove it, that rising base rates have not in the past spelt doom for share prices. The graphs indicate that equities have risen sharply over the 18 months which followed the last three troughs in interest rates - and an interest rate trough seems to be where we now are. This may mean there is nothing like higher profits and dividends for driving markets. Interest rates can rise quite a long way before shares react. If this is so, then the sudden rash of speculative fever, now spreading from food stocks to the drugs sector, indicates that a bullish mood is taking hold. After all, what is a half-point rise in base rates compared with a multinational takeover battle for a pharmaceutical giant? The contest for William Low, while disappointing in market terms - especially for the US house which bought Low shares in the hour between the announcements of Tesco's knock-out bid and Sainsbury's withdrawal - has whetted speculators' appetites.</p>

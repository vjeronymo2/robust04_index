			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRATS ELECT EX-JACKSON AIDE BY ACCLAMATION;  </P> <P> BROWN VOWS TO SEEK UNITY AS PARTY CHIEF  </P> <P> To the cheers of pennant-waving supporters, Ron Brown won the Democratic  national chairmanship Friday, becoming the first black to head a major  political party.  </P> <P> He promptly pledged to bring unity to Democrats and hard times to their  Republican opponents.  </P> <P> Elected by acclamation, Brown marched to the podium to the strains of "How High  the Moon" and vowed not to permit his racial identity to overshadow his  responsibilities as the party's leader.  </P> <P> "The story of my chairmanship won't be about race; it will be about the races  we win over the next four years," said Brown, 47, a Washington lawyer-lobbyist  and former campaign aide to Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and the Rev.  Jesse Jackson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cites Significance  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Brown made a point of acknowledging the broader significance of  his victory. "In choosing the first American of African descent to lead one of  America's major political parties you have made history," he told the 403  members of the Democratic National Committee here. "I know some people are  wondering just what kind of history we've made.  </P> <P> "I did not run for this position on the basis of race, but I will not run away  from it. I am proud of who I am and I am proud of this party. Diversity is our  strength, as it is America's strength."  </P> <P> Brown lost no time in attacking the Republicans, deriding President Bush's  proposals for carrying out his promise of a "kinder and gentler" nation and the  plans of the new Republican chairman, Lee Atwater, to win the votes of blacks  and other minorities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Education, Health Needs  </P> <P> Citing the efforts of various Democratic governors to meet education and health  needs, Brown said: "For these leaders, 'kinder and gentler' doesn't come from  some ghostwriter. it comes from the heart.  </P> <P> "Suddenly, after a year of questioning our party's patriotism, George Bush is  promoting all our policies and Lee Atwater is pandering to all our  constituencies."  </P> <P> Confidently predicting gains for Democrats from the state level up to the White  House, which they have not won since 1976, Brown urged party leaders to deal  with two of the party's perceived weak spots -- crime and national security.  </P> <P> "We need to say flat out: There is no one tougher than Democrats when it comes  to protecting our children from drugs, when it comes to protecting our cities  against crime and when it comes to protecting our nation against terrorism and  aggression," he said.  </P> <P> When Brown first announced his candidacy last December to succeed outgoing  Chairman Paul G. Kirk Jr., many in the party expressed consternation that his  selection would alienate white middle-class voters, whom the party needs to  recapture the presidency. Brown's foes said their major objection was not to  his race but to his liberal background and his ties to the controversial  Jackson, whom he served as convention manager in 1988.  </P> <P> But helped by an efficient campaign organization and the backing of the  AFL-CIO, a potent influence in the party, Brown overwhelmed his four opponents.  All of them withdrew before Friday's vote, allowing his supporters to turn the  election into a unity demonstration, complete with buttons, banners, placards  and enthusiastic oratory.  </P> <P> "The Democratic Party is blessed by virtue of his leadership," declared Willie  Brown, Speaker of the California Assembly, in seconding Brown's nomination.  Praise also came from Richard Wiener, head of the party state chairmen's  association, who had been regarded as Brown's most formidable rival for the  post. He called Brown "a leader, a unifier and a builder of our Democratic  Party."  </P> <P> Brown will serve a four-year term. His salary is a matter for negotiation with  the national committee, but Kirk, party officials said, was paid in the same  range as the $89,500 that goes to members of Congress.  </P> <P> The harmonious mood carried over into the election of other officers. A  potentially bitter fight between blacks and the forces of organized labor for  the new post of vice chairman for voter registration was averted when two black  candidates, Little Rock Mayor Lottie Shackelford and New Orleans Mayor Sidney  Barthelemy withdrew, allowing the election of Jack Otero, international vice  president of the Transportation-Communications Union.  </P> <P> In return, party sources said, labor gave its backing to Shackelford in a  contest for one of the three other vice chairmanships. She was elected along  with incumbent Lynn Cutler of Iowa and Carmen O. Perez, assistant chief deputy  to Los Angeles County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn.  </P> <P> Robert Farmer, who had been chief fund-raiser for the Michael S. Dukakis  presidential campaign, was elected treasurer, and Dorothy Bush, who is not  related to the President, was chosen as party secretary, a post she has held  since 1944.  </P></p>

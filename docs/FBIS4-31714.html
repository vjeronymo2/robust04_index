			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article signed by 40 Slovene politicians: "The May </F> Declaration--Five Years Later"]    [Text] The May Declaration as a political starting point  for social renewal contains four fundamental goals:    --state independence;    --democracy as a basis for social restructuring;    --a parliamentary multiparty system as a basis for the  political structure;    --an economic system based on the experiences of the modern  welfare society.    All those fundamental goals are mutually interdependent  conditions for each other, and are therefore only attainable as  a whole.    We have achieved:    --state independence and international recognition;    --a constitutionally sovereign state, which has created the  necessary normative starting point for Slovenia as a  law-governed and social-welfare state based on the protection of  human rights, private property, and free enterprise;    --a formal democracy as a basis for social renewal and  restructuring;    --a political structure with a parliamentary multiparty  system.    The following have not been achieved:    --the new state actually has not broken off continuity with  the previous totalitarian structure. It has not acknowledged and  has not condemned the worst actions of totalitarian violence and  the violation of human rights;    --the constitution has not been followed by legislation that  would take its general starting points to the level of  feasibility. The constitution has remained an unfinished work  that cannot survive without executive legislation and is  therefore threatened itself;    --democracy, as a basis for social restructuring, has  admittedly been achieved on the formal level, but the oligarchic  structure of society from the communist period has been  preserved, mostly with the same people in social roles and with  essentially unchanged relationships of social power. That allows  those who hold that power to have their present positions also  formally legitimized, and to use them to block further  democratic transformation.    An assessment of the present political and legal situation  leads to the conclusion that there is almost complete continuity  withthe structure and distribution of social power that  prevailed under the communist regime, and an actual  discontinuity with the political will and efforts that governed  the so-called Slovene Spring.  <H5>  What Next </H5>   We have to continue where we were stopped:    --to reunite and mobilize all those forces which carried out  the break with communism and began social renewal, and moreover  on the basis of modern political organization;    --to continue resolutely with the democratization of society  on the basis of a new redistribution of social power and social  roles. Above all, accelerated privatization and the  reorganization of the state administration and state services  should contribute to that goal. All illegally appropriated  social property should be returned;    --to accelerate legislation that will ensure actual  implementation of the constitution and not just the formal  coordination of the former legal order that was the basis for  the communist regime.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The new orientation of U.S. policies toward Latin  America will trigger a reaction from regional countries and  prompt them to search for imaginative, global, and definitive  solutions to border problems that have remained unsolved for too  long. This new trend will also create a real possibility for  Bolivia to obtain a sea outlet through dialogue.    This is the opinion of International Relations Secretary  General Jaime Aparicio, in referring to the proposal made by  Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary for inter-American  affairs, on the need to solve border problems in the region.  During a speech at the U.S. Congress on 5 May, Watson announced  that one of his goals will be "to seek opportunities for  dialogue to allow the United States to contribute to the  solution of border problems in Latin America."    According to Jorge Crespo, former ambassador to the United  States, the situation could be used by the Foreign Ministry to  draw up a new strategy, for presentation at the next OAS  meeting, for recovering Bolivia's sea outlet.</p>

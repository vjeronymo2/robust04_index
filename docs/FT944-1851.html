			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Travel: By bus in Guatemala - Mark Hodson has an eventful journey by public transport Jose sat beside me wearing red and white pin-striped trousers and black leather chaps. He had a long straight Mayan nose and dry black skin like crumpled linen. On his head, at a slight angle, sat a straw boater. He was taking the bus home from market, along with his wife and two young daughters and a chicken in a cardboard box. They lived in Todos Santos Cuchumatan, in the mountains of north-west Guatemala. Jose was a Nam Indian, a true descendant of the ancient Maya yet, like his village, his name was Spanish. The conquistadors had made the arduous trek to Todos Santos even before a road was built to connect it to the outside world. The Spaniards converted the inhabitants to Roman Catholicism, gave them new names and a distinctive local costume. Legend has it that the men of Todos Santos were so taken by the finery worn by one particularly flamboyant Spaniard that they all copied it. Today, the villagers still make the straw hats by hand and a boy does not properly become a man until he is allowed to wear the red shirt with its brightly patterned cuffs and upturned collars. The bus pulled out of Huehuetenango with a few nervous coughs and a loud roar. I shared a seat built for two with Jose and his family. One of the girls was allocated to me and she sat on my lap for the entire journey staring silently up at my alien face. As we approached a police checkpoint the conductor told everyone to crouch on the floor. There were 20 or 50 people standing in the aisle and they all obliged, the men gently laying down their machetes, the women heaving babies on to nearby laps. We made it through but at a second checkpoint we were stopped and a policeman noticed the bus was illegally overloaded. A small fine was negotiated and we were off again. For anyone over 5ft 6in tall, the seats were horribly cramped - the bus had been designed to carry American schoolchildren. Above the windscreen, between a blaring tape deck and a picture of the Virgin Mary, a faded sign warned: 'No Swearing, No Horseplay.' After 20 minutes we ran out of road and started to climb a lush mountain, rarely getting out of first gear and hardly topping walking pace. The driver, a man in his 40s with sunglasses, a greasy quiff and a row of silver teeth, handed over the wheel to his conductor so he could chat up a woman passenger. An hour later we reached the peak and pulled up at a lonely truck stop 10,000ft above sea level. The men filed off, loosened their chaps and relieved themselves against the side of the bus. They did not speak much. Spanish remains their second language and they would smile and exchange pleasantries but little more. After a light lunch of Coca-Cola and dried cakes we were back on the road crossing a stark barren plain. We dropped into a steep valley. We could see Todos Santos spread out below us when we heard another bus behind, hooting and snarling as it tried to pass on the narrow dirt road. Our driver refused to pull over even when he stopped to set down passengers. The other driver jumped out of his cab and ran up to our bus, swinging a machete, stamping his feet and howling obscenities. Our driver pulled away, stopping on the next bend to let the other bus pass. As it did so a young man stood in the doorway of the other vehicle, and waved the machete. With a flash of steel he slashed one of our tyres and we ground to another halt. Todos Santos was a picture of peace and tranquillity. Around the whitewashed colonial church half a dozen young men leant in doorways, talking in whispers and coyly posing in their brilliant costumes. Families sat outside their adobe huts weaving: women at the looms, children bundling up cotton and men sewing little bags. The villagers had set up a workers' co-operative and their tiny shop was packed with colourful weavings, each with a tag showing the name of the person who had made it. Next day, I saw a funeral. Half a dozen small children were walking down the main street in single file, each holding a peace lily and solemnly staring ahead. Behind them a boy of about 14 supported the rough-hewn coffin of a child across his shoulders as if he was carrying his own cross. He was followed by a dozen women in dazzling red blouses and skirts. None displayed any emotion. It was exquisite and heart-breaking. There was just one restaurant in town which served the same meal of scrambled eggs, black beans and tortillas for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and a hostel with horse-hair beds in draughty rooms that got hellishly cold at night. I lasted two days before I got back on that bus. This time we broke down after just 45 minutes. A second bus took us back to Huehuetenango where I found I had missed the connection east to Sacapulas and would have to wait until morning. Next day at 11am I was back on the road with another lunatic at the wheel who hurled us around the winding mountain roads until after two hours we shuddered to a halt when the transmission shaft snapped. I sat at the side of the road dreaming of cold beer, watching a herd of oxen overtake us and thinking that even by Guatemalan standards three breakdowns on the trot must be considered pretty bad luck. A United Nations truck pulled up but the driver refused to give us a ride so we had to wait two hours for the next bus. When it came it was already nearly full but the driver seemed so pleased to see a rival broken down that he made sure everyone squeezed on. By the time we reached the little crossroads town of Sacapulas at the foot of the Cuchumatan mountains it was almost dusk. I had missed the last connecting bus to the village of Nebaj and was looking for a cold drink when a lorry driver offered me a lift. He was leaving immediately so I clambered up the back of his open truck, clinging to the edge as we thundered high into the hills. I turned and through the swirling dust saw a warm golden sunset over the valley. I looked down to find myself standing on a mountain of wooden crates filled with beer.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Victory Day" interview with Supreme Council Chairman </F> Eduard Shevardnadze by Nato Oniani; place not given -- live]    [Excerpts] This interview will be shorter than usual  because today is 9 May, which is Victory Day, and I know that  you are busy. There are various opinions about this day. Some  regard it as the day of victory over fascism. But there is also  the opinion that it was not Georgia's war, the Georgians' war,  and that we should not have taken part in this war, and so on  and forth. What is your assessment of what happened 49 years  ago today?    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. First I would like to greet all  veterans and participants in the war. I know almost all of them  in person. [passage omitted]    Now to that equivocal attitude. I was upset to a certain  extent over parliament's failure to adopt a resolution  [reinstituting 9 May as a holiday]. Some deputies have a  different understanding of the importance of those years, and  the contribution of the fallen heroes and those who are still  with us today, toward the struggle for peace in the world. I  think that people who do not understand this and believe that  the veterans fought not for Georgia but for the interests of a  foreign country, and that they served the interests of a  different system, know little about the matter. [passage omitted]    Those who fail to understand that the 300,000 people [from  Georgia] who, while defending their own country, sacrificed  themselves for the freedom of other nations, have a very vague  understanding of the essence and purpose of national movement  and of the people who truly fought for the interests of this  movement.    Although many might not have realized it at the time, or  could have realized it subconsciously, the struggle against  fascism was a struggle for universal ideals. The same universal  ideals inspired the revolution of the eighties and the beginning  of the nineties. This revolution gave freedom to nations, to  Europe and to Georgia. Without victory over fascism, there  would not have been the revolution of the eighties, the  liberating revolution which brought about freedom and democracy  in former Soviet Union republics. This is a logical chain and  it cannot be denied. I think that people who do not understand  it have failed to keep abreast of the times.    Therefore, by marking 9 May, we are paying our respects to  the memory of people who sacrificed themselves for the freedom  of nations and for independence, to those who fought for these  ideals.    Today we talk about building a free and democratic Georgia.  Without the cornerstone that these people laid by fighting  against fascism, Georgia would not have gained its independence.  [passage omitted]    Finally, one of the major achievements of those great years  was the (?emergence) of the United Nations Organization and its  Security Council. We may not be impressed by the role this  organization is playing today [word indistinct], but without it  our planet would not have survived. [Words indistinct] people  who fought against fascism created a certain guarantee of a  peaceful life for future generations. [passage omitted]</p>

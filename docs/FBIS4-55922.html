			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 23 (CTK) -- Israeli arms manufacturers  are among serious candidates for cooperation with Czech  companies in the modernisation of the Czech military technology,  Defence Minister Antonin Baudys, who returned yesterday from a  five-day visit to Israel, told CTK today.    The Czech Army is facing a complex transformation process  which involves modernisation of the obsolete military equipment.  This should be performed by Czech companies cooperating with  foreign suppliers, Baudys said during a discussion-meeting with  CTK editors. For this, the Czech companies have sufficient  potential but they are lacking sophisticated know-how which is  being offered by Israel, he added.    The Israeli army has rich experience with modernising the  Soviet-made weapons and weapons systems of which it gained a  considerable amount after the Arab-Israeli 1967 Six-Day War,  Baudys said.    The Israeli companies are offering top-quality technology  for  modernising the Slovak-made T-72 tanks, MiG aircraft, missile  systems and sophisticated ammunition.    The individual companies will make the final decision after  the Defence Ministry presents concrete orders, said Baudys,  adding that the projects of modernisation of the Czech Army  would be completed by the end of June.    The visit of the Czech Defence Ministry delegation to Israel  during which the two countries signed an outline memorandum on  military cooperation paved the way for cooperation in the  military sphere, Baudys said. Israel considers the Czech  Republic a reliable and trustworthy partner which is evidenced  by the fact that cooperation in such a delicate sphere as  military technology usable for civilian purposes as well was  supported by the Israeli Defence Ministry and Yitzhak Rabin,  Israeli premier and defence minister, Baudys stated.</p>

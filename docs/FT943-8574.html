			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / London to list global depositary receipts The London Stock Exchange yesterday announced that it is establishing its first global depositary receipts programme enabling foreign companies to obtain a full London share listing. The move to allow global depositary receipts - sterling-denominated bundles of shares - is part of the exchange's effort to market itself to non-UK companies and strengthen its position in international share trading. Mr Michael Lawrence, exchange chief executive, has pointed to the success of US exchanges in attracting foreign companies, particularly those based in emerging markets. This has strengthened the international role of the US exchanges. Mr David Landman, executive director at Morgan Stanley, the US-based investment bank, said that London's pre-eminent position as a global financial centre would be strengthened as a result of the introduction of depository receipts. The exchange expects the strongest interest in obtaining a listing for depositary receipts to come from companies based in emerging markets. Yesterday the Inland Revenue said that unlike trading in the shares of UK listed companies, depositary receipts would not attract the standard 0.5 per cent stamp duty on each transaction. Issuers would, however, have to pay stamp duty of 1.5 per cent on all shares transferred into the depositary receipts programme. The rules are intended to make trading in depositary receipts competitive with trading costs in the home country. Listing requirements and fees for those seeking global depositary receipt status will be lower than for an outright London listing, although the requirements may be no weaker than the minimum set out in European Union legislation. The issuer must have a three-year trading record and although audited accounts for the previous three years must be presented, the accounts need not be prepared in accordance with international accounting standards, nor need they be consolidated. The depositary, typically a bank, must be one which is acceptable to the exchange and there must be at least one firm which agrees to act as market maker. Continuing obligations will include a requirement to notify the exchange in the event of a price-sensitive development. Annual and half-yearly reports must be released within six months of the period to which they relate. The initial listing fee will be Pounds 4,000 and the annual fee Pounds 2,000.</p>

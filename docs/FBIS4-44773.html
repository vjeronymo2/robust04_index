			<p>Turbine   Blades   <F P=102> 94WS0295B Stuttgart BILD DER WISSENSCHAFT in German Apr 94 p  111 </F>  <F P=103> 94WS0295B </F> <F P=104>  Stuttgart BILD DER WISSENSCHAFT </F> <F P=105>  German </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Socks for Hot Blades"] </F>   [Text] The Institute for Materials Research of the German  Aerospace Research Institute (DLR) in Cologne-Porz works with  the extremely high temperatures of the gas stream in aircraft  jet engines. When the turbine blades of modern jet engines are  surrounded by a not quite 0.3-millimeter thick thermal  insulation layer of zirconium oxide, the gas temperatures from  the combustion chambers can be further increased. This is almost  the melting temperatures of the turbine blades, which are firmly  attached to the turbine axis, however, and thus can also  transmit heat.    The goal is now 1,500 for the gas temperature; each  150 increase raises the efficiency of the turbine by about  six percent and correspondingly reduces the fuel consumption and  generation of pollutants. The DLR researchers do not take into  account the cooling of the blades, for example by circulating  cool air, since the power gain is then largely eliminated.    When you surround the blades which are under extreme thermal  stress with thermal insulation in order to prevent the flow of  heat to the metal, the difference between gas and metal  temperatures can be further increased. Then, however, the  adhesion of the protective layer determines the life of the  turbine; if the layer peels off, there is total damage. Using  so-called electron-spring jet-vaporization facilities the DLR is  trying to overcome the poor evaporation ability of certain  elements such as silicon and to enrich materials which increase  layer adhesion in the insulation layers.    The constant race between thermal material resistance and  higher gas temperature is not unique for jet engines. It began  with the first steam engines which drained the mines and in so  doing burned at low steam temperatures a large part of the coal  that was mined. It was evident even at that time that the  efficiency of a thermal power machine is greater the higher the  temperature difference between the working gas and the outside  temperature.</p>

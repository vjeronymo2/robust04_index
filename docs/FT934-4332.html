			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Former Sumitomo bank chief dies Mr Ichiro Isoda, former chairman of Sumitomo Bank who was forced to resign following an illegal loan scandal and his involvement with stock and property speculators, died yesterday. He was 80. Better known as the 'Emperor' of Sumitomo, he fell from grace in 1990 after six years as president and seven years as chairman. He was personally responsible for Sumitomo's emergence as Japan's top profit making bank in the late 1980s, aggressively expanding operations using cheap credit. However, Mr Isoda was also widely believed to be the force behind the bank's involvement with real estate and stock speculators. Sumitomo made large loans to Itoman, a trading company turned property developer and art collector, which was linked to underworld figures. Mr Isoda took Itoman under his wing after a financial rescue in the 1970s and sent in employees as presidents and board members. Itoman faced near bankruptcy due to mounting bad loans and was taken over by a Sumitomo group company earlier this year. An arrest of a former Sumitomo manager on alleged illegal loans to Mitsuhiro Kotani, a prominent stock speculator, was the trigger for his resignation, bringing a sad end to Mr Isoda's otherwise distinguished career. Mr Isoda first came to prominence in the 1970s by arranging the rescue of Ataka, a troubled trading house, and then persuading Ford Motor of the US to participate in the refinancing of Mazda Motor which faced financial difficulties. Mr Isoda later oversaw the rehabilitation of Daishowa Paper and Asahi Breweries, both heavily indebted groups. Under Mr Isoda, Sumitomo aggressively expanded overseas. The bank invested Dollars 500m in a non-voting stake in Goldman Sachs, the US securities company. The deal failed to bring in benefits the bank had originally hoped, as the US Federal Reserve banned the bank from building direct business links with Goldman.</p>

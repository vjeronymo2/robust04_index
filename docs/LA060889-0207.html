			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TV PROGRAM WITH ADS TO BE OFFERED TO SCHOOLS NATIONWIDE NEXT YEAR  </P> <P> Whittle Communications, already under fire from national education groups, said  today that it plans to offer its commercially sponsored Channel One news  program for teen-agers to schools nationwide starting next spring.  </P> <P> The media company based in Knoxville, Tenn., said it has modified its original  plans for the service and intends to make two additional channels of  educational programming available to the schools.  </P> <P> The Channel One project had come under fire from many national education groups  and other officials because it meant students would be compelled to view  advertising during the school day.  </P> <P> California School Supt. Bill Honig, saying "our students' minds aren't for  sale," warned that state public schools accepting the program would be docked  for time students spent watching it.  </P> <P> But Chairman Christopher Whittle, saying he had listened to the criticism, said  schools that sign up for Channel One will be able to have only some -- rather  than all -- of their classrooms wired to receive the program. And he said  students would not be required to watch.  </P> <P> The original plan, tested in six schools, was to show the program to the entire  student body every day.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Whittle said schools that participate still will be obliged to  show the daily 12-minute news program with the two minutes of ads in those  classrooms with the Channel One equipment every school day.  </P> <P> In addition to the Channel One service, Whittle said his company will donate  1,000 hours of satellite time every school year for non-commercial educational  programming to be carried on a new channel called the Classroom Channel.  </P> <P> The Classroom Channel would be run by a board independent of Whittle  Communications that would decide how it would be operated.  </P> <P> Whittle said it was likely the board would decide against allowing advertising  on that service. Schools could pick and choose what they want to use from that  channel, he said.  </P> <P> He said Whittle Communications would donate $500,000 a year for the board to  acquire rights to programming for the Classroom Channel.  </P> <P> Whittle said he was also developing a third network, the Educators Channel,  that would carry programming designed for educators.  </P></p>

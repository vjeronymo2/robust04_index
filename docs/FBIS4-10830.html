			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Walfredo Angulo] </F>   [Text] Havana, 15 Apr (PL) -- Cuba and Colombia have signed  a document specifying numerous areas for future economic  collaboration at the conclusion of a meeting of the Joint  Commission for Economic and Scientific-Technical Collaboration  [Comision Mixta de Colaboracion Economica y Cientifico-Tecnica].    This document opens paths for exchanges to ensure that  "relations between the two sister nations will be maintained  with patience but without interruptions" Colombian Deputy  Foreign Minister Andelfo Garcia said yesterday. It will produce  reciprocal benefits in the areas of education, sports, culture,  and science and technology, said Raul Taladrid, vice president  of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation.    The agreement also outlines investment possibilities in the  fields of tourism, mining, communications, aeronautics, and  energy, and it embraces the possibility of exploring other  fields such as fishing and textiles, among others.    It includes the marketing of Cuban medicines, particularly  the Colombian purchase of the hepatitis-B vaccine and future  negotiations for the purchase of the meningitis vaccine.    The document also confirms that an agreement will soon be  reached by Colombian and Cuban university rectors during a  meeting to be held in Havana in November.    The Colombian deputy foreign minister said he thinks that  meetings between the Colombian and Cuban presidents in  Cartagena, Colombia, and recent visits to his country by Carlos  Lage, vice president of the Council of State, and Foreign  Minister Roberto Robaina contributed to the current state of  their bilateral relations. The issues of petroleum sales to  Cuba and the debt that the island owes to this South American  nation were not negotiated within the joint commission, Garcia  reported.    The Colombian delegation also included the deputy ministers  of education, communications, and environment, Antonio Jose  Lizarazo, Jaime Uribe, and Eduardo Uribe, respectively, among  other important officials. A protocol for collaboration in the  field of education was signed yesterday and another one on  sports is scheduled to be signed tomorrow.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Arts: Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme - Theatre In 1670 Moliere wrote the ultimate situation comedy about a man who wants to change situation, Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme. Moliere was, as Voltaire said, holding up views in general for the reprobation of mankind. The original is rapier sharp, but the National Theatre Company's latest version could not cut through a warm flan. This is theatre moyen sensuel, proud to be vulgar and undemanding, the essence of bourgeois. Moliere strove to entertain and to instruct. Gentilhomme finds him castigating the arriviste, warning against the advancement of yearning and suggesting proper self-culture instead. One sympathises with a man who wishes to better himself but does not know how. This message arrives as a series of moral choices neatly balanced, so one is instructed and flattered into recognising the dangers of pretence. One learns nothing, however, from this production. It lacks basic intelligence. The director Richard Jones succeeds in making Moliere au courant (with plenty of swearing), but has failed to use the resources of 17th-century France. This play was written in the midst of two decades which yielded Pascal's Pensees, La Rochefoucauld's Maximes and La Fontaine's Fables. Nothing of its intellectual milieu survives. The Gentilhomme has been reduced to pantomime. The production's strengths lie in its boldness: it is neither flawed nor ill-executed, just disappointing. It starts happily, with Monsieur Jourdain (very well played by Timothy Spall) amidst the competing pleasures offered by his hireling masters of Music, Dance, Fencing and Philosophy. Jourdain is quickly established as a boorish patron: 'It's always bleedin' shepherds' he says to the Maestro presenting a pastoral. His Tailor arrives to clothe him, a levee ensues; then Jourdain's unimpressed Maid (Janine Duvitski) and unimpressable wife (Anita Dobson) laugh at his pretention. The production's only joke turns on Jourdain constantly slipping into his bourgeois origins with 'You silly cow' or 'I beg you, please accept my humble apologies for the bloody behaviour of my repellent wife.' The earnestness for etiquette pervades every scene. His anxiety dominates the action and marginalises the sub-plot, in which he is duped into funding a spongeing aristocrat's amours and conned into marrying his daughter to her lover disguised as Turkish royalty. Moliere knew that manners govern general politeness, and change slowly; etiquette polices the class boundaries, and changes quickly to keep out the arriviste. But this production never probes at why Jourdain should want to recreate himself. Only once does he cry poignantly, 'There's so much I don't know.' Taste has more to do with manners than appearances, and so the best scenes of pretension, including a hugely excessive banquet, are conjured by word and deed. The brash design, however, is inventive: value-added Louis Quatorze, in pop-up storybook style, adds legs to the harpsichord and makes puffy clouds float by outside. The costumes (Nicky Gillibrand), particularly the beautifully accoutred swarm of cooks, dancers and singers, make a plain delight in a world of excess. The fine music (Jonathan Dove), altered from Moliere's collaborator, Jean-Baptiste Lully, shows that subtlety can make an impact, for the same reason that Vaux le Vicomte is a finer Chateau than Versailles: it never tries too hard.

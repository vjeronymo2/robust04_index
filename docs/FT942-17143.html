			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Survey of Business in Dorset (6): County faces a dilemma - Transport and communications A news story in the Dorset Evening Echo, about plans to solve Weymouth's 'chronic traffic problem' with a Pounds 25m relief road, sums up the dilemma which faces the county in improving its transport links. The proposal, the Echo reports, 'is opposed by hundreds of residents and the environmental group Friends of the Earth, while supporters claim the route is a solution to congestion and a lifeline for the area's troubled economy.' Local feelings about road building are especially strong in a rural county - both for and against. Residents of villages battered by heavy traffic want bypasses; environmentalists and landowners want to protect the countryside. There is no doubt the local economy would benefit from an improved road network. The business community has highlighted this - and the development of scheduled services at Bournemouth airport - as prime concerns. The county council, in a report for its structure plan, describes the car as 'the almost universal mode of travel' in Dorset. But in rural areas, it says, the shortage of financial resources means few bypasses will have been provided, even by the year 2011. No motorway passes through the county and only the A31 and A35 are Department of Transport trunk roads. While the A31 provides a good connection between Southampton and the M27 to Bournemouth and Poole, the A35 road westwards from Poole is not adequate. A public inquiry into a village bypass between Bridport and Lyme Regis is scheduled to open on April 11, but one for Tolpuddle has just been put back on the Department of Transport's reserve list - a decision which Mr Peter Harvey, chief executive of the county council, describes as 'appalling.' The county council will complete improvements this summer to the A37 between Dorchester and Yeovil. But planned bypasses to improve the north-south A350 from Poole towards Bristol, a twisting road filled with slow-moving trucks, have yet to materialise. The port of Poole, despite the A350's inadequacy and the need for a replacement harbour bridge, has developed rapidly since roll on-roll off ferry freight services started to Cherbourg, 67 miles away, in 1973. A self-financing trust port run by harbour commissioners, it reclaimed an additional 35 acres in the early 1980s and now has three ro-ro berths, plus berths for conventional cargo and a rail link. Truckline - bought by Brittany Ferries in 1985 - runs its superferry Barfleur from Poole to Cherbourg with a capacity of 70 trucks, 270 cars and 1,200 passengers. The company is about to start a new service to St Malo, with four return sailings a week between mid-May and October. Brittany Ferries and Mr Hamish Green, chief executive of the commissioners, are confident in the port's ability to withstand the opening of the Channel tunnel. Although it is not a deepwater port, one expanding business is that of cruise ships and 20 are due to call this year. But in January the port lost the Jersey and Guernsey services run by British Channel Island Ferries, whose passenger operations were taken over by Condor, the Guernsey-based ferry company. Instead, Condor is running hydrofoil services and a traditional ferry to the Channel Islands from Weymouth. A mainline electrified rail service runs from London to Bournemouth and then to Weymouth, from where there is a slow service to Bristol. In the north, Sherborne and Gillingham are on the London to Exeter line. For business air travel, the choice has been either Southampton or Heathrow airports. But scheduled services are due to start from Bournemouth airport on April 11 which will be operated by a new regional airline, Euro Direct. Mr Neil Hansford, its chairman, intends to start with flights to Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels. He says: 'The only limitation to the number of services we are prepared to offer is the support we receive from the local community.' The airport is owned jointly by Bournemouth council and the county council, with Christchurch council as the planning authority, a combination which has not stimulated development. Mr Doug Wilson, who took over two years ago as director, acknowledges that the airport had become 'quiescent.' It has 80,000 movements a year but the vast majority are of light aircraft, although charter business has grown to about 200,000 passengers annually. Thomson will be using the airport for the first time this summer. Planning consent was recently granted to extend the run-off to its main runway, which will increase the range of aircraft and free up development land near the secondary runway. More than 100 companies, mostly aviation-related, are already based at the airport, employing 2,100 people, and Mr Wilson believes there is the potential to double that. He says: 'It is quite possible for a centre of aviation excellence to be built here.' The cost of the runway development will exceed Pounds 1m and, although part of that funding is in place, future expansion will require the injection of private capital.</p>

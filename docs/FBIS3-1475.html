The areas are Johannesburg, Alberton, Boksburg, Benoni,  Germiston, Kempton Park, Krugersdorp, Randburg, Roodepoort,  Springs and Westonaria.    Unrest regulations took effect at 10PM on Monday.    South African Police spokesman Maj Louis le Roux said the  unrest regulations granted additional powers to security forces  to contain violence. These included powers dealing with arrest  and detention, the prohibition of the carrying of certain  weapons and objects, the power of entry, search and seizure and  allowances for the police commissioner to promulgate further  orders.    Giving his reasons for the declaration of unrest areas at a  press conference earlier on Monday evening, Mr Kriel said in  Cape Town the carnage during the Zulu march in Johannesburg had  been "a terrible turn of events".    The declaration had been cleared with the sub-council for  law  and order of the Transitional Executive Council which, he said,  also realised the urgency of the situation. "This will give  more powers to the South African Police and other security  organs to handle the situation."    Mr Kriel said he would like to see mass action stopped as a  whole. "In a society as polarised as South Africa, mass action  leads to death. I blame political parties organising this for  political advantage and not taking the lives of people into  account."</p>

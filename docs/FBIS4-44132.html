			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Monika Naerr report: "Attitude Vis-a-Vis Macedonia </F> Appreciated"]    [Excerpt] Athens -- Immediately before the European Union  [EU] summit began in Corfu, President Thomas Klestil and Foreign  Minister Alois Mock met with Greek President Konstandinos  Karamanlis in Athens on Thursday [23 June]. Above all,  Karamanlis stressed that he appreciates Austria's position on  the Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] issue.    Karamanlis welcomed Austria as a new EU member and expressed  joy about the fact that the agreement came about under the Greek  EU presidency.    He underlined the intensified cooperation between Austria  and  Greece, mentioning Austria's commitment in Cyprus in particular.    After comprehensive talks on the situation in the Balkans,  Karamanlis explicitly pointed out that Austria's position on  Macedonia is being followed with great interest and appreciated  by Athens. This includes Austria's call for the  nonestablishment of diplomatic relations, the clear support for  consular relations, and Macedonia's recognition via joint UN  membership.    Moreover, Austria's traffic policy is in Greece's interest  over the long term. Greece also wants to shift traffic from the  "road to the railway."    Foreign Minister Alois Mock stressed that the clear outcome  of the referendum, in which 66 percent of the Austrians  supported the European Union, grants Austria a special position.    In the evening, President Thomas Klestil and Chancellor  Franz  Vranitzky participated in a dinner for Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, which was hosted by the EU heads of state and  government.

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / BA and Virgin likely to renew talks today BRITISH Airways and Virgin Atlantic are likely today to renew talks in London aimed at striking a peace deal in the wake of BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign against its rival. Virgin said yesterday that it wanted successful dis-cussions with BA but that it still intended to take action against BA if a deal was not agreed this week. Sir Colin Marshall, BA's executive chairman, said he wanted the talks to end amicably and 'the sooner the better'. Without a deal, Virgin threatens to begin anti-trust action in the US, as well as alleging to the European Commission that BA has abused its dominant market position. Virgin also might instigate court action under the Data Protection Act or pursue claims of breach of copyright. In three meetings held so far between the two sides, Virgin has claimed that BA's activities inflicted upon it serious commercial damage running into tens of millions of pounds. Virgin has not publicly specified its demands, although it is understood to have tabled a series of proposals. These range from cash compensation to the use of BA aircraft-servicing facilities. The allocation of take-off and landing 'slots' at London's Heathrow airport is also thought to be on the agenda. Although it is understood that some progress towards agreement has been made, there is some surprise in the Virgin camp at the time the talks are taking, and it appears determined not to see them drag on beyond this week. Virgin is being represented by Mr Sid Pennington, managing director of Virgin Atlantic, and Mr Trevor Abbott, financial adviser to Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman. Mr Robert Ayling, who on Friday was appointed BA's group managing director, is representing BA. If a deal is reached, it is likely that Mr Branson, will meet Sir Colin to complete an agreement. Meanwhile, fall-out from Lord King's announcement last friday that he would retire early from the post of BA chairman continued over the weekend. Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, the industrial conglomerate, and a friend of Lord King, criticised some of the airline's non-executive directors for failing to fully support the chairman during the aftermath of the 'dirty tricks' affair. The suggestion was refuted both by Sir Colin and by Lord King. Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, said he would have sacked the people involved in the 'dirty tricks' affair if he had been in the government and BA had been a state-owned company. 'I think it is quite deplorable and a disgrace,' he said. 'The BA board is a bit like the Tory cabinet - doesn't anyone resign any more when you get caught out?'</p>

			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Arts: Sleepers meet outsiders - Nigel Andrews reports from the bracing peaks and wacky foothills of Cannes '94 Bet-placing for the Palme d'Or has now reached fever pitch, but the 'Titre d'Or' award has been in no doubt. It goes to France's Grosse Fatigue. This title coaxes a sour chuckle from every festivalgoer who has spent the last week rising at seven, reeling from film to film through the day, winding up at midnight. And this in a quiet Cannes. With most Hollywood stars detained at Gatt-point back in America by studios still smouldering about Euro-protectionism, there is little otiose razzmatazz. And the 'no show' disease seems to have spread east with the suddenly-announced absence of the Palmists' current co-favourite, Zhang Yimou. His film To Live is a mordant, majestic fresco of life under Mao. It covers similar historical terrain to last year's Farewell My Concubine, but from a more intimist, venom-tipped viewpoint. We watch the trials and tragedies of a poor couple (Gong Li, Ge You), who lose their children, their livelihood (shadow puppetry) and most of their emotional bearings in the tidal wave of Great Leaps Forward and Cultural Revolutions. Zhang's style is less fierce, less 'Jacobean' here than in Ju Dou or Raise The Red Lantern. But he is a master at probing the psychology of 'ordinary' people and at juggling horror and hilarity in the same scene. Piece de resistance is the daughter's disastrous sojourn in a maternity hospital, where the doctors have all been dismissed or jailed - as 'too reactionary' - and the trainee nurses must cope with haemorrhaging and hysteria. You do not know whether to laugh or cry or hide under the seat. So where was Zhang himself? Not in jail, but detained in China where his film is failing to get a censor's visa. With the fifth anniversary of Tiananman Square only two weeks off, the stage now seems set for another East-West human rights row, with a powerful movie as rallying-point. The other Cannes favourite is more subtly political. Kieslowski's Three Colours Red is part three of his trilogy on tricoleur themes. A meditation on fraternity set in that capital of brokered harmony, Geneva, it stars Irene Jacob and Jean-Louis Trintignant. She is a goodhearted model, he is a retired judge with an odd hobby - electronically snooping on his neighbours. First question prompted by Red: Is 'brotherhood' a beneficiary or casualty of the age of communications? Kieslowski begins with a dazzling high-speed montage of multicoloured phone-lines and snaking undersea cables, as if to crystallise and satirise at once the iconography of the 'information highway'. Second question: is there a brotherhood (or sisterhood) that leaps across time and gadgetry? Trintignant's life and destiny seem to be being repeated, eerily, in the tale of a young lawyer who lives near Miss Jacob. Third question: is this is as good a movie as K's previous ones? I thought not. Though stylishly shot by cameraman Piotr Sobocinski, with the title colour heraldically picked out in every interior and street scene, the movie seems too composed, too attitudinising. It is like a mannequins' catwalk through previous Kieslowski obsessions and sign-landscapes. The mystical coincidences, so haunting in Blue or The Double Life Of Veronique, seem over-wrought. And the ending, a mid-channel ferry mishap of wild improbability, is a disaster-ex-machina designed purely to spotlight the trilogy's main characters. Kieslowski's film still seems like the complete works of Eisenstein compared with some competition entries. Apart from a neighbour licensed to wield a hatpin, how do you stay conscious through films like, say, Italy's Barnabo Of The Mountains, with its handsome border guard righting wrongs and dreaming dreams in a movie designed (on a bad day) by Caspar David Friedrich; or Russia's Riaba My Chicken, all about post-glasnost peasants still glazed with the collectivist ideal; or France's laborious spy epic Les Patriotes, 2 1/2 hours of cross and double-cross with existential pretensions. Once you descend from the bracing peaks you might as well head for the wacky foothills. Showing in a sidebar was Priscilla Queen Of The Desert, a title I casually mentioned in my last report, not having seen the movie. It has now become the sleeper of the entire festival. Terence Stamp and a pair of Aussies play the drag artistes who break down in their touring bus and bring culture-shock, or couture-shock, to the Outback. Writer-director Stephan Elliott, who has clearly not slept since last year's Cannes when his Frauds was in competition, makes free with the mascara, the lingerie, the song-and-dance numbers and the one-liners. It is very funny and endearing and it has turned Mr Stamp into the comeback kid of Cannes '94. Also out-of-competition were a fleet of bargain-budget American movies: the kind that slip quietly out of Port Hollywood while the big ships are tied up by cultural embargo. Best of them was Rory Kelly's Sleep With Me, a game of musical beds involving Eric Stoltz, Meg Tilly and Craig Sheffer. Three lovers revolve on the sharp points of an eternal triangle while four scriptwriters (no less) did relay work on the witty, fizzing dialogue. To call Cannes '94 a transitional festival may be understating it. The absence of large-scale US celluloid meant that flags were run up by nations virtually unheard-of before at this event. The flags merited respect, if not automatic saluting. Iran's gauche, meandering movie about movie-making, Across The Olive Trees, won applause for its 'charm': a word deadly with condescension at Cannes. And Mexico's Queen Of The Night was another chunk of magical realism from a part of the world already over-productive in that commodity. Cambodia, however, offered the genuinely powerful People Of The Rice Field. Though this looked at first like 'Cold Comfort Paddy', as the villagers waded through the rice-swamps cursing the weather and the snakes and flashbacking almost nostalgically to the days of the Khmer Rouge, the story gathers strength. Its Hardyesque architecture of fate rises to the challenge of a genuinely tragic climax. Rithy Panh's film is the only late-arriving outsider that might surprise us on prize night. No - there is one other: I have just seen it. Nanni Moretti's Dear Diary is a ramshackle autobiographical comedy from the bearded Roman comic who looks like Woody Allen re-designed by El Greco. It is no more than a 'musing on life' in three parts. First, he tootles around Rome on his moped, voice-overing thoughts about life, love and cinema. Then he island-hops with a writer friend. Then, suspecting cancer, he goes through a series of medical tests worthy of Allen in Hannah And Her Sisters. This is a film with true charm: not the brittle charisma of naivety, but the magic of a self-deprecating honesty served up with wit and a wayward, garrulous poetry.</p>

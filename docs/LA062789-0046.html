			<p><P> June 27, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> OWNERS OF JUDY'S CONSIDER SELLING CLOTHING CHAIN FOR $31 MILLION  </P> <P> Judy's, the Van Nuys-based clothing store chain, is holding discussions about  selling the company to an unidentified, out-of-state clothing concern in a  $31-million deal.  </P> <P> As part of the agreement announced Monday, the Israel family, which controls  78% of Judy's stock, will not sell its shares to another company for 110 days.  The unidentified party has tentatively agreed to pay at least $6.71 per share  of Judy's stock, according to Marcia Israel, Judy's founder and chief  executive.  </P> <P> Judy's stock closed Monday at $5 per share, which was down 25 cents.  </P> <P> According to the agreement, if the would-be buyer doesn't go ahead with the  deal or offers less than $6.71 a share, it will have to pay Judy's up to  $150,000. If the Israels refuse a bid of at least $6.71 per share, they would  have to pay the proposed buyer's transaction costs up to $600,000.  </P> <P> Israel said negotiations with the unidentified company began early in June.  Israel, 68, said she was willing to sell the company because she didn't believe  that she had sufficiently skilled managers in place who would be able to  succeed her. And having to groom new managers would take some time. "It would  be a long haul, and none of us is immortal," Israel said. Her husband, Lawrence  Israel, Judy's chairman of the board, is 72.  </P> <P> The Israels own their 78% of Judy's stock along with their two daughters. It  would be worth about $24 million at the $6.71 a share buyout price.  </P> <P> If the takeover goes through, Marcia Israel will step down as Judy's chief  executive officer and will be paid $1 million over five years as part of a  one-year consulting and non-compete agreement.  </P> <P> Terms of the tentative agreement call for the buyer to acquire all of Judy's  outstanding stock but to continue to operate the chain under its current name.  </P> <P> The timing of the possible takeover comes as Judy's has been struggling to  boost its profits after several poor years. Judy's was founded 40 years ago by  Israel, who at the time was a model. She said she was inspired to open her own  store because she couldn't find anything she liked to wear. For many years, she  seemed to have a gift for knowing what young women wanted to wear.  </P> <P> As recently as the fiscal year that ended in January, 1986, Judy's turned a  $1.2-million profit on sales of $56.7 million. But since then, Israel seems to  have lost her touch. Judy's profits slid to $426,000 in 1987 and to a mere  $7,000 in 1988. For its latest fiscal year, which ended in January, the company  would have lost $248,000 were it not for a tax adjustment. Meanwhile, sales  essentially have been flat for four years. In the quarter that ended in April,  Judy's lost $195,000.  </P> <P> "It was a terrible, terrible letdown to go 40 years with terrific profits and  then have these two years," Israel said.  </P> <P> For whoever winds up with control of Judy's, the major problem will be how to  cope with the company's chief market, a notoriously fickle group of consumers  called "juniors." Today, the Judy's chain consists of 70 women's clothing  stores and 34 men's clothing stores in five Western states, chiefly California.  Both the men's and women's stores sell sportswear and accessories.  </P> <P> Judy's is best known for selling moderately priced but trendy clothes that  attract not only teen-agers but women in their 30s and even 40s who can fit  into the slim-cut, stylish clothes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plenty of Competition  </P> <P> Joel Knapp, president of Judy Knapp, a Los Angeles clothing manufacturer, said  Judy's has plenty of competition, including other retailers such as Contempo,  Cherokee and the billion-dollar chain The Limited.  </P> <P> Another local fashion industry observer said: "Judy's is getting squeezed by  the titans who really have their act together. And they're getting squeezed by  the up-and-comers who are doing innovative marketing. A store like Judy's that  has been around awhile is going to lose some market."  </P> <P> Marcia Israel blames the company's recent slide on her decision to delegate  clothes-buying authority a few years ago. She said she took that step because  of repeated criticism of her management style. "The industry said it was a  one-man show," Israel said. "The retailers, manufacturers kept saying I didn't  know how to delegate.  </P> <P> "It turns out that I was right; they were wrong," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Buying Problems  </P> <P> Israel said delegating too much authority meant that Judy's suffered through  several years of chronic overbuying and underbuying, leading to markdowns and  low sales.  </P> <P> Israel also believes that her stores lost the sharp definition it takes to  appeal to her customers. "When the customer becomes confused about what she's  going to find at a particular store, you lose ground," she said. "The customer  walks away."  </P> <P> About six months ago, Israel looked at the company's dismal earnings and  decided that she'd had enough. Since then, she has been directing inventory and  merchandising and trying to forge an unambiguous fashion image for Judy's. She  has been trying to cut personnel costs, she said, reclassifying some employees  to lower-paying jobs and laying off 10 truck drivers.  </P> <P> But in many ways, Israel has continued to run the company like a private one.  In Judy's latest proxy statement, for instance, Israel said she planned to cut  her annual pay from $150,000 to $58,000. But she recently changed her mind,  saying there's no need to take a pay cut because she thinks that the company  has shown signs of coming back. She points to a 27% jump in same-store sales  from mid-May to mid-June compared to the same period a year ago.  </P> <P> Indeed, since she started the company, Judy's has been run the way Israel wants  to run it. The roots of Judy's reach to the years immediately after World War  II, when Los Angeles' defense-based economy, still gearing down from wartime  production demands, was doing a poor job of meeting the needs of fashionable  women, Israel said. In 1946, when she couldn't find any "young" clothing to  wear, she borrowed $1,000 from her mother and opened a 7-foot by 10-foot  hole-in-the-wall store on Whittier Boulevard in East Los Angeles. "It was the  first young boutique of our generation," Israel said.  </P> <P> She picked the name Judy's because it was short enough to fit on the skinny  storefront. She later named one of her daughters Judy.  </P> <P> By the 1960s, Judy's stores were seen as trend-setters. According to Knapp,  "They were unique. They were the first to capitalize on the emergence of the  junior customer." And some teen-agers were only too glad to take part in the  trend.  </P> <P> Connie DaVersa, an adult free-lance garment buyer in Los Angeles today but an  impulse-buying California teen-ager in the late 1960s, remembered her own  weakness for Judy's stores. "It was the place to shop. They had great displays  of what kind of things would go together to encourage you to buy a whole  outfit. They would put different colors together that you wouldn't have thought  about combining. If you saw it at Judy's, you figured, ooh, it must be cool."  </P> <P> In 1969, the Israels sold their 17-store chain to Beck Industries for about $8  million. Within two years, though, Beck had filed for bankruptcy protection,  and in 1971, the Israels bought the company back for what Marcia Israel has  said was significantly less than the selling price. A year later, the couple  took the company public.  </P> <P> The chain expanded rapidly during the 1970s, largely by plowing profits back  into growth. It reached its peak profits in 1984, when Judy's earned $1.5  million on sales of $46.7 million. Soon after, the slide began.  </P> <P> Despite the company's recent problems, the Israels have continued to do well.  Besides their combined $300,000 salaries, the Israels took home about $182,000  last year in dividends. Moreover, they own a separate company that Judy's paid  $288,000 last year to provide security systems at the clothing stores.  </P> <P> JUDY'S INC. AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Judy's operates a chain of 70 women's and 34 men's apparel stores for teenagers  and young adults in California and four other western states. The Van  Nuys-based company, founded with one store in 1946, has about 1,000 employees.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH UPBEAT, WARY ON SOVIET ECONOMIC BID  </P> <P> President Bush offered an upbeat response Sunday to what he called Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's "fascinating" appeal for Western help for his  effort to overhaul his Communist economy.  </P> <P> But in a note of caution, Bush said that the recent sharp improvements in  superpower relations do not mean that "everything is hunky-dory between the  East and West."  </P> <P> In a news conference at the end of the annual summit conference of seven  leading industrial democracies, the President also said he sees no immediate  prospect that the Soviet Union will join the economic summit meetings any time  soon.  </P> <P> The Soviets would first have to transform their economy to capitalism and their  political system to democracy, Bush told reporters who had assembled in the  leafy, sunny garden of the U.S. ambassador's residence here.  </P> <P> "There's an awful lot that has to transpire in the Soviet Union, it seems to  me, before anything of that nature would be considered," the President added.  "We're talking about free-market economies here. There was no . . . indication  that he will be attending the next summit."  </P> <P> He also said it would require "a little more time" before he would hold his own  summit with Gorbachev. White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu said earlier  on NBC's "Meet the Press" that such a summit would probably be held between the  end of this year and early next summer.  </P> <P> Gorbachev dominated the 15th annual economic summit merely by sending a letter  Saturday to French President Francois Mitterrand, the summit's host, in which  he promised to end the Soviet Union's historic isolation from the world economy  and asked for Western help for his effort.  </P> <P> Bush said the letter, which prompted "a great deal of discussion" at the  summit, will be given "a very courteous and very thoughtful reply" by  Mitterrand.  </P> <P> Asked whether anyone at the summit thought Gorbachev was attempting to make  "mischief" by upstaging the proceedings, Bush replied: "I can't say that that  (thought) never occurred." But he said no one was prepared to say that mischief  was indeed Gorbachev's goal.  </P> <P> The President said the summit leaders concluded that the letter "was just one  more manifestation of the changing world we're living it -- that I think was  the main message."  </P> <P> "They're moving toward our open system, our free system, our system of free  elections," the President said. "And that's the way I would look at the letter.  . . . It was saying, let's do something in a common way about solving problems  around the world."  </P> <P> The President also reacted warmly to Gorbachev's expressed goal of a "common  home" for all Europeans, although he said that achieving the goal is a long way  off. U.S. officials have previously responded more cautiously, out of concern  that Gorbachev's proposal left no room for the United States and the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization.  </P> <P> Bush said the seven summit nations, which agreed Saturday to take concerted  action to assist Poland, Hungary and other East European nations that take  steps toward capitalism and democracy, should encourage similar changes in the  Soviet Union, "to the degree the Soviets would not consider that an  intervention into their internal affairs."  </P> <P> "The Soviet economy needs a lot of work," the President declared. "And I say  that not to be critical, but certainly that's an objective judgment. The  economy is in bad, bad shape -- far worse shape than the Western economies."  </P> <P> The President sidestepped a question on whether the Cold War had ended, saying:  "I don't like to use 'Cold War.' That has a connotation of worse days in terms  of (the) East-West relationship.  </P> <P> "Yet I don't want to stand here and seem euphoric that everything is hunky-dory  between the East and West, on arms or on differences in the economy or on how  we look at regional problems. We have some big differences still."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a Popularity Contest  </P> <P> Similarly, he avoided declaring a winner at this year's summit, his first. He  said such questions sound like "who's more popular, who's ahead in the poll --  Bush or Gorbachev -- in Eastern Europe or Connecticut. And it doesn't really  have much to do with that."  </P> <P> Later, escorting reporters on a tour of the ambassadorial residence, his  quarters in Paris, Bush cracked playfully that as for a popularity contest with  the Soviet leader in Connecticut, the state where he was raised, "I'd hate to  put it to the test."  </P> <P> Bush said at the news conference that he was "kind of running out of gas" after  a week in which he also visited Poland and Hungary. He is scheduled to stop in  the Netherlands today before returning to Washington on Tuesday, and he  expressed no regret that the summit ended at midday Sunday, half a day earlier  than scheduled, because all of the agenda items had been discussed.  </P> <P> Asked whether the leaders couldn't have found anything else to consider, the  65-year-old Bush cited his fatigue and said:  </P> <P> "It's been a vigorous experience in physical fitness for me, and I try to stay  in pretty good shape. But when you couple the summit with the (French)  bicentennial and then tack on Poland and Hungary, I wasn't about to argue we  needed more time, nor was anyone else."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] New Delhi today categorically told Pakistan that it  will not spare any effort to oppose moves against India's unity  and territorial integrity. Rejecting the two nonpapers given by  the Pakistan Foreign Office to the Indian high commissioner in  Islamabad yesterday, New Delhi said the question of plebiscite  in any part of India, including Jammu and Kashmir, simply does  not arise. Terming the non-papers as Pakistan's propaganda, a  spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said in New Delhi  today that the exercise is an attempt to obscure the realities  of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir. He said that violence in  the state is being created by militants and foreign mercenaries  trained and equipped by Pakistan to erode the territorial  integrity and political stability of India. Recalling New  Delhi's repeated call upon Pakistan to desist from sponsoring  trans-border terrorism, he said India has the will and the  commitment of the people of Jammu and Kashmir to counter the  violence generated by militants with external support.</p>

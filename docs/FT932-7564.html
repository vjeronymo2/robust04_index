			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Markets: Marks sparks retail revival - The Bottom Line SIR Richard Greenbury, Marks and Spencer's chairman, could scarcely hide his irritation this week at suggestions that the City of London thought M and S shares were a good recession stock, but 'boring' once the recovery began. 'On any track record evaluation that's a lot of old rubbish,' was his immediate reaction. 'We will do as well next year, and the year after that . . . as the goods we buy, the price we charge for them and the service we give. If we get it right we will do well and if we make a mess we will do badly,' was his more considered follow-up. It is difficult to quarrel with either statement. This week's results from Marks and Spencer were impressive by any standards. Pre-tax profits increased 25 per cent to Pounds 737m, making M and S once again the UK's most profitable retailer, although turnover increased only 3 per cent. The profit increase was flattered by the fact that last year's figure was reduced by exceptional costs of more than Pounds 80m, according to the new FRS3 accounting standard. But even stripping out those costs, profits were up 10 per cent. Profits and margins rose in the UK even after the company froze prices for three-quarters of its clothing range and reduced them for the rest, and its overseas businesses all enjoyed sales and profits increases. Sir Richard's point is that a company that can do this well in a recession, provided it continues to get the formula right - a safe bet  - can hardly fail to benefit from an upturn in consumer spending. Quite right, say the analysts. But other retailers starting from a lower base and only just recovering from over-expansion and mismanagement in the late 1980s may grow at an even faster rate. One of them is Storehouse, which reported on Thursday. The improvement in its fortunes was obscured by exceptional charges of Pounds 34.1m relating to losses on last year's sale of the Richards and Habitat chains. Without those, pre-tax profits would have tripled to Pounds 46.6m, while operating profits for its remaining BhS and Mothercare chains quadrupled. There is still room for improvement. Ann Iverson, Mothercare chief executive, is looking for increases in market share and margins and her past record suggests she can deliver. Reforms continue at BhS and refurbishment of some stores this year may help lift sales. A more risky bet, but still a recovery story, is Burton, which 10 days ago announced a 13.3 per cent improvement in interim profits to Pounds 24.7m, and sales up 14.3 per cent to Pounds 1.07bn. John Hoerner, chief executive, has attacked the cost base through wide-ranging rationalisation and increased part-time working. If he can continue to improve efficiency, he may start to unlock the potential of a company which has annual sales of Pounds 2bn but achieves net margins of only 3 per cent - compared with M and S's 12.5 per cent. The problem is that recent sales increases have been stimulated largely through lowering prices, resulting in a 2.3 point drop in gross margins  - a vicious circle it may be difficult to break out of. Other clothing retailers are pulling through after life-saving surgery. Next, which helped transform the face of the high street in the 1980s before running into problems as it over-expanded, more than tripled pre-tax profits last month with retail sales up 18 per cent. It believes it can increase sales per square foot in its stores by another third. In addition to the clothing retailers, some say stores such as Argos, MFI and Dixons are set to benefit strongly from a consumer-led recovery, and especially a pick-up in the housing market. So where does that leave M and S? The growth prospects may not match that of some other stores, if their own and the general economic recovery continues. But few companies can offer such safe, steady growth. M and S is run superbly, and in the past five years turnover has risen 30 per cent, pre-tax profits 47 per cent and dividends 59 per cent. As one stores analyst put it: 'If I was allowed to, I'd be buying the pants off this one.'</p>

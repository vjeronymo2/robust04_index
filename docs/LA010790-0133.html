			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCHANAN ON MONROE DOCTRINE  </P> <P> Buchanan's article ended the year on a shrill note, if not a high one.  </P> <P> He states that the diplomats in the Organization of American States and those  in the United Nations condemn our invasion of Panama, but privately agree with  our actions. If this is true (an unprovable allegation), why? Could they fear  the reaction of their citizens? That is sometimes known as democracy, a system  I thought we espoused.  </P> <P> Leave the OAS, advises Buchanan, and reassert the Monroe Doctrine. That oughta  do it! We could call it a Martial Plan for Latin America!  </P> <P> WILFRED COUZIN  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

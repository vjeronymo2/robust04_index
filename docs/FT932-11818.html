			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (3): Extensive realignment of product policy - The Germans / Mercedes-Benz In a surprising departure from corporate tradition, Mercedes-Benz has decided to re-think the whole way it does business. Under the radical leadership of Mr Helmut Werner, who takes over as chief executive in May, it is embarking on what he describes as 'a very extensive realignment of its strategic product policy'. In practice, Mercedes-Benz has decided to transform itself from 'a car manufacturer with a long tradition in the luxury class' into 'an exclusive full-line manufacturer offering high-quality vehicles in all segments of the market,' says Mr Werner. Before the end of the decade the company is planning to launch a Mercedes-Benz people carrier or multi-purpose vehicle similar to the Renault Espace or the Toyota Previa; a four-wheel-drive leisure utility vehicle for off-roading or, more probably, for cruising the more elegant suburbs of the world's cities; and a small Mercedes-Benz city car for urban commuting. These will be produced in addition to the present three ranges of luxury and executive cars. Mr Werner, in an important policy speech outlining the change of direction, admitted with surprising frankness earlier this year that Mercedes-Benz's present luxury cars were 'over-engineered'. He said that if the company persisted with such a policy for developing new models it would end up being 'priced out' of world markets. The break with tradition and the new awareness of pricing is to be marked already this summer with the launch of the new Mercedes-Benz C-class car range which will replace the 190 series. The company has accepted that radical changes in the world vehicle market mean that Mercedes-Benz will no longer be able to demand premium prices for its products based alone on an attractive image. In order to avoid the 'trap' of being priced out of markets, Mercedes-Benz has decided to turn on its head its whole product development strategy. Instead of developing the ultimate car and then charging a correspondingly sky-high price as in the past, Mercedes-Benz is taking the dramatic and radical step of moving to 'target pricing'. It will decide what the customer is willing to pay in a particular product category - priced against its competitors - then add its profit margin. It will then cost every part and component to bring in the vehicle at the target price. Such an approach is not entirely new. Chrysler has begun to use it to great effect to fuel its renaissance in the US, but in Stuttgart this is the stuff of revolution. Mercedes-Benz's brave new world is not going to be won without pain and dislocation, however. Mr Werner accepts that the company still lags way behind its rivals in costs and productivity. Fixed costs are 'still appreciably too high', layers of management are to be removed, there will be a 'rigorous pruning' of the white collar central staffs. The life-cycles of Mercedes products have to be reduced to about eight years from 11 years, while the development time for new products has to be cut from up to 57 months to less than 44. The break-even volume for a vehicle line must be cut to 60,000 a year, he says. About 13,000 jobs were eliminated last year in Germany, reducing the workforce from 225,000 to 212,000 by the end of 1992. Another 14,500 jobs are scheduled to be cut in the coming two years. There is to be a new decentralised organisational structure, with so-called 'performance centres' aimed at achieving cost savings of up to 30 per cent. And more vehicle assembly will be moved outside Germany to locations such as Mexico, South Korea, Spain and probably the US. Mercedes-Benz is to invest DM800m to build a new technical centre in Germany for the development of future car models. The new research and development centre will play a crucial role in the company's controversial reform plans. According to Mr Dieter Zetsche, Mercedes-Benz director for car development, the company plans to concentrate all its new vehicle design, development and engineering operations at only two locations instead of the present 18 sites in south-west Germany. The new technical centre will be built at Sindelfingen in south-west Germany near Mercedes-Benz's main domestic car assembly plant. It is planned to begin operations in 1996 and will have a workforce of about 4,500. The design and development of engines and transmissions will be concentrated at the group's Unterturkheim plant in Stuttgart. Mr Zetsche says that the company is also seeking to increase its use of outside components suppliers to develop and produce parts and systems for future vehicles. It is aiming to reduce the amount of so-called 'vertical integration' - the share of a vehicle made in-house rather than purchased from outside suppliers - from the present high level of 45-50 per cent. Among Mercedes-Benz's new product plans, the people carrier or multi-purpose vehicle is closest to the market and should be launched by late 1994 or early 1995, says Mr Werner. The vehicle, code-named T0, will be built outside Germany at Mercedes-Benz's plant at Vitoria in Spain. The company is planning to invest DM356m in Spain, and the capacity of the plant will be expanded from 28,000 vehicles a year to about 60,000 a year. The new vehicle will be produced in two variants, as a passenger-carrying MPV and as a light commercial vehicle to replace the present MB-100 van. According to Mr Werner, Mercedes-Benz's new direction is being forced by 'radical changes in the structure of the car market.' He maintains, that 'the traditional vertical market structure defined by engine size is increasingly giving way to a horizontal market structure. With a proliferation of niche vehicles such as MPVs, off-road vehicles and roadsters, it is body shapes and forms of propulsion (petrol/diesel/hybrid, electric) that are becoming the more important distinguishing features, rather than engine size and performance. 'Mercedes-Benz has to gear itself to a future market structured primarily around a diversity in vehicle concepts rather than around engine prestige value,' he said. As car buyers forsake the conspicuous consumption of the 1980s and place more stress on a vehicle's functional use than on its role as a status symbol, Mercedes is also beginning to investigate radical new ideas of car ownership and of selling cars. By the late 1990s, Mr Werner suggests that personal car leasing programmes could be available, where the customer might have access to several different vehicles during the year, for winter and summer use, for holidays or for commuting. In terms of production sites outside Germany, Mercedes-Benz has been developing plans for passenger vehicle production in the US and is assembling cars in small volumes in Mexico. In South Korea, it has recently entered a far-reaching co-operation deal with Ssangyong Motor to enable the South Korean vehicle maker to begin car production in Korea based on Mercedes-Benz technology. Ssangyong, the fifth-largest Korean vehicle maker, is planning to produce up to 50,000 cars a year from 1996 for sale both in the domestic and export markets. The Ssangyong car will be based on components and systems from the existing mid-range Mercedes-Benz 200/300 series. According to Mr Werner Niefer, who retires as Mercedes-Benz chief executive next month to be replaced by Mr Werner, the deal with Ssangyong gives the German carmaker 'the key to one of the biggest growth markets of the future.'</p>

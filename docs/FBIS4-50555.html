			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 18 (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of  the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC), today held extensive talks with  leaders of the Belgian Parliament.    Li met with Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb, president of the  Belgian Chamber of Representatives, and Frank Swaelen, president  of the Belgian Senate, over bilateral relations and  international issues of common concern.    The Chinese official arrived in the Belgian capital on  Tuesday [17 May] for a five-day visit.    During the meeting, Li said that since the establishment of  diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1971,  bilateral cooperation has developed considerably in political,  economic and trade fields.    The Chinese leader pointed out that there have been more  exchanges of high-level visits between the two sides while  bilateral economic and trade relations have been increasing.    Since there is great potential and prospects for  Sino-Belgian  cooperation, said Li, China hopes both sides will make joint  efforts for more cooperation.    At the request of the hosts, Li gave an outline of China's  political system reform, its socialist democratic politics and  the People's Political Consultative Conference.    Swaelen said that Belgium is opening up to Asia since the  center of the world's economy is moving towards the region.    He noted that China has an important role in Asia and will  be  more and more influential in the world economy and international  affairs.    Li's visit to Belgium shows that China attaches great  importance in developing relations with Belgium, he added.    Belgium is the last leg of Li's five-nation European tour,  which has already taken him to Finland, Sweden, Norway and  Denmark.</p>

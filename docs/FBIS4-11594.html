			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz, 28 Apr (AFP) -- The authorities have  reported that Armed Forces troops moved on Thursday to prevent  striking peasants and teachers from establishing roadblocks on  highways and railroads across Bolivia. The strikers are  demanding salary increases.    Some observers say the tense situation has submerged the  nation in a kind of semi state of siege. This forced President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's government to deploy some 30,000  troops, who were ordered to act decisively to maintain peace.    First official reports indicate that the worst conflicts  occurred in Santa Cruz Department, in the east. Peasant union  demonstrators tried to block the railroads leading to Argentina  and Brazil, and the highways that join that tropical city with  Angostura and Chapare.    A police source said there is still no official word on  arrests or other incidents. The source said security forces  cleared the expressways of rocks and logs the strikers placed  across them to pressure the government into accepting their  demands. Another roadblock was removed from the highway that  connects La Paz with the mountain regions of Oruro.    The authorities reported that the flow of traffic in and out  of La Paz and the rest of the country is normal, according to a  responsible source, who said the troops maintain control at  points where strikers were trying to erect roadblocks.    In La Paz, police patrolling was doubled in view of the  threat by 10,000 peasants to stage a march on the city to  protest the government's refusal to grant their wage demands,  which have been capitalized on by the Bolivian Labor Federation  with a 24-day strike.    The conflict worsened last Friday after one of the street  protests degenerated into disturbances with rock throwing and  looting of businesses and vehicles, resulting in tens of persons  injured and 27 arrested. Also, on Sunday and Monday the police  forced a dozen hunger strikers to suspend their 20-day strike  and admitted them to clinics for medical attention.    Although the chief of state had warned a few days ago that  if  the situation worsened the government might be forced to impose  a state of siege, some analysts believe that the labor and  opposition pressure appears to want to force Sanchez de Lozada  into adopting that extreme measure.    The Catholic Church, whose mediation was requested by COB  leaders, voiced "its exasperation" in view of the "deafness" of  the labor leaders and government to find a solution to the  conflict. "If there are two deaf people, who want to speak, the  church cannot be in the middle screaming," Apostolic Nuncio  Giovanni Tonucci remarked, saying that there was no room for  dialogue. "If there is deafness on both sides, it seems to be  that it is futile and ridiculous to ask the church to mediate,"  he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Esat Kiratlioglu, deputy leader of the True Path  Party [TPP], remarked that there is a search for a civilian  revolution and a transition regime in Turkey, adding that his  party will never allow this.    In a news conference in Ankara today, Kiratlioglu charged  that Motherland Party leader Mesut Yilmaz launched efforts to  create a transition regime in order to resolve the difficulties  within his party arising from the fact that the party was  defeated in the local elections. Noting that Yilmaz is  suggesting new government models within parliament, Kiratlioglu  said that these proposals are reminiscent of antidemocratic  governments established in the wake of 12 March [1971]. These  proposals are being raised for the so-called reason that the  parliament should do something before solutions are imposed on  it by others, Kiratlioglu explained, adding: Mr. Yilmaz is now  a civilian revolutionary and is leading a civilian revolution.    Claiming that Yilmaz wants to remain as his party's leader  by  creating a political crisis in the country, Kiratlioglu said  that earlier Yilmaz also prepared the grounds for the current  banking crisis by announcing that dollar accounts will be  confiscated. Kiratlioglu declared that the plans to weaken the  TPP will not succeed, the coalition government is standing  upright, and democracy will certainly be victorious.</p>

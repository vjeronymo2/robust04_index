			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2ND AIRLINE TO BEGIN SERVICE TO PALMDALE  </P> <P> Skywest Airlines will become the second carrier to serve Palmdale Regional  Airport, flying five round trips a day to Los Angeles International Airport  starting June 1, the airline announced Monday.  </P> <P> The announcement by Skywest -- a feeder service for Delta Airlines -- follows  the start Jan. 2 of service by America West Airlines. America West's four daily  round trips between Palmdale and Las Vegas ended a five-year absence of air  service from the Palmdale airport, which is operated by the city of Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Skywest plans to use 19-passenger Fairchild Metro III turboprop planes for the  30-minute flights to LAX.  </P> <P> "We just thought the time was right to establish a link between Palmdale and  Los Angeles," said Steve Hart, Skywest's director of market planning.  "Obviously having America West reestablish service there will help us. We sort  of hope to run on their coattails," he said.  </P> <P> Skywest officials said they saw a market in the Antelope Valley, with its  fast-growing population of about 200,000 and concentration of military and  aerospace businesses. Airport officials, however, said both carriers' services  mainly strive to capture passengers for their connecting flights.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Board of Airport Commissioners is scheduled to meet in  Palmdale on Wednesday to approve a five-year lease for Skywest.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Department of Airports officials applauded Skywest's decision as a  step toward development of Palmdale's airport. But they also said they had  hoped the next carrier at Palmdale would have avoided feeding already-crowded  LAX.  </P> <P> Skywest, which carried about 1 million passengers last year, serves 43 cities  in eight Western states. The introductory Palmdale-LAX round trip fare will be  $98. But airline officials said they expect most of their passengers to catch  Delta flights at LAX, entitling them to pay little or nothing for the  connecting flight beyond the price of the Delta ticket.  </P></p>

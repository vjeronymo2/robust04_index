			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 12 INDICTED IN COCAINE SHIPPING SCHEME  </P> <P> Twelve suspected drug runners, including two from Orange County, have been  indicted on charges alleging that they tried to ship more than 1 1/2 tons of  cocaine across the country in tractor-trailers.  </P> <P> The federal indictment returned Friday culminates almost a year of  investigation by Anaheim police, which has broken up several cocaine smuggling  rings.  </P> <P> Charged with conspiracy to distribute cocaine were Alejandro Sanchez, 41, of  Yorba Linda and Paul Velez-Torres, 28, of Huntington Beach. The others indicted  were Cubans and Colombians from Florida, New York, New Jersey, Rialto,  Temecula, and Covina.  </P> <P> All are scheduled to be arraigned in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Aug.  27. The defendants, who were arrested last week, face penalties of 10 years to  life in prison if convicted.  </P> <P> The indictment alleges that the operation used trucks and trailers with secret  compartments to ship thousands of kilograms of cocaine from a central warehouse  in Rancho Cucamonga, which was the hub of a network of smaller storage areas.  </P> <P> According to the U.S. attorney's office, narcotics agents intercepted five  shipments of cocaine -- 1,527 kilograms, worth an estimated $25 million -- from  the alleged operation from September to November, 1989.  </P> <P> The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Customs Service, the state  Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement, Fullerton and Brea police and the San  Bernardino County Sheriff's Department participated in the investigation.  </P> <P> Anaheim police, in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, have been  investigating suspicious trucking operations for almost a year that involve  Cubans and Colombians from New Jersey, New York and Florida.  </P> <P> Last December, officers arrested seven people and confiscated 5,000 pounds of  cocaine bound for the East Coast from a trucking operation with storage sites  in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. Law enforcement authorities  described it as the second largest seizure of the drug in the state.  </P></p>

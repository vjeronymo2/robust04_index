			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Albania makes hard work of investment: Kerin Hope reports on the risks and frustrations of setting up in Europe's most backward country FILTERED through wheezing loudspeakers at the Shkodra Chamber of Commerce, Mr Ahmet Musavi's invitation to invest in Albania could almost be mistaken for an obituary of the country's manufacturing industry. With unworldly truthfulness, Mr Musavi, chairman of the city council, explained why all but three of the 15 state-owned factories on offer stopped work over a year ago. The reasons he cited were similar: shortages of raw materials and spare parts, outdated technology and mass departures of skilled workers. 'We are ready to welcome foreign investors, whether in joint ventures or on their own. We want to modernise, but we don't have any money,' he said. The factories in question, among them plants that used to produce textiles, shoes, soap and canned vegetables, could serve as a museum of industry. It is hard to imagine that anyone could get the pre-second world war machinery from Italy - along with Chinese and Hungarian imports from the 1960s - working again. Albania's emergence from autarchy is going to be painfully slow, despite the government's avowed enthusiasm for establishing a market economy. While strikes and massive emigration to Italy and Greece succeeded in hastening the collapse of the Stalinist system, the economy was reduced to ruins. When the Democratic party came to power in March, almost two-thirds of the country's factories had shut and most farm co-operatives had been divided up, sometimes by force, into peasant smallholdings. Albania's foreign debt has swelled from Dollars 200m to Dollars 600m in two years, while exports almost ground to a halt. The Albanians' dream was that as soon as communism was defeated, luxury tourist resorts would start springing up along their unspoiled coastline. In fact, initial interest shown by Italian hoteliers and Greek contractors has faded because the government insists that foreigners cannot buy land, but must settle for a 49-year lease. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is trying to find international companies willing to modernise Albania's mining industry, dependent until recently on the unpaid labour of political prisoners. But a slump in prices for copper and chrome could discourage potential investors, who would have to spend heavily on improving processing and productivity. Prospects look somewhat brighter for the oil industry. Preliminary offshore surveys by US, Italian, and German oil companies granted concessions last year reportedly produced encouraging results, with test drilling due to start early in 1993. Yet no foreign company has been signed up to modernise the onshore fields in southern Albania, where output has dropped by more than 40 per cent in the past decade. For all the apparent willingness to embrace change, Albanian officials clearly find it hard to throw off their traditional suspicion of outsiders, which did much to sustain Enver Hoxha's policy of isolation in the communist period. Efforts to set a legislative framework for investment are also hampered by the past: Albania lacked a justice ministry for over 20 years before it was re-established in 1990. Importing legal expertise has become a priority in order to introduce basic tax, commercial and company law. 'Confusion over the legal position, combined with the long-drawn out process of decision-making makes it very frustrating trying to do business here,' says Mr Alex Standish, a British consultant. Over 50 joint ventures have been set up, mostly by Italian and Greek companies in partnership with state companies or individual Albanians, according to the Ministry of Trade. But only a modest amount is being invested: the total capital invested this year is Dollars 38m, of which Dollars 21m was provided by foreigners. Greece is keen to help develop the Albanian economy, partly as a way of stemming the flow of illegal Albanian immigrants across the border. Its investment incentives law was extended this year to include southern Albania. The state-controlled Hellenic Industrial Development Bank includes Albania in an EC-financed programme it runs for developing small business in eastern Europe. But the practical problems of working in a country with only a few thousand kilometres of surfaced roads, where bank transfers take weeks to arrange and where ports are almost permanently occupied unloading EC and US aid, mean that fewer than half the joint ventures are in regular operation. It will be some time before Albania starts getting international funds for making infrastructure improvements. Much will depend on how firmly the government sticks to the conditions of a Dollars 25m IMF stand-by loan granted this year. There are already problems over its readiness to delay unpopular measures, such as reducing unemployment benefits or launching privatisation. Mr Vassilis Anastasiades has spent almost two years negotiating a joint venture to make sports clothes in southern Albania. 'The risks in Albania are huge and it's impossible to predict when the investment climate will stabilise. But if you're in a business where labour costs matter, it's worth persisting,' he says.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Warburg opens its book The truth can sometimes disappoint as SG Warburg found to its cost yesterday. Its decision to break down its source of profits was laudable but the revelation that over half the Pounds 197m increase in first-half group operating income came from trading prompted a 2 per cent fall in its shares. The argument is that earnings from trading are by nature unreliable. The more Warburg becomes dependent on them, the lower the quality of its earnings stream. Fear of a similar bad reaction should not deter others who disclose even less. For example, outside investors cannot know for sure what truth underlies Schroders' astonishing share price performance. Living under illusion may be comfortable: it is also dangerous. Those who wish to carp can find other faults with Warburg. It is reticent about the extent to which the contribution from Japan has improved and about the degree to which the Pounds 91m increase in fee income reflected one-off contributions from Zeneca and BT3. Its cost base has risen sharply - investors must have faith that spending can be pruned easily if revenue turns down again. Mercury Asset Management appears closer to saturation of the UK institutional market, though it is moving forward apace in private client business. Group net return on capital is still only 20 per cent. Such a low return is hardly satisfactory if this is indeed an earnings peak. Yet to quibble on that score too may be to miss the point. US investment banks boast higher returns but they are also more highly geared. Warburg has surplus capital and could afford to gear up too. But if that produced a still higher return based on increased proprietary trading, the market could scarcely complain about the quality of earnings. Higher return and higher risk go hand in hand. The task for Warburg is to convince it has got the equation right.</p>

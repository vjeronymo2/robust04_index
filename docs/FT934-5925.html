			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Management rescues Daf parts offshoots The UK components operations of Daf, the failed Dutch commercial vehicle maker, have been rescued from receivership by a management buy-in team, which has made secure 510 jobs in Glasgow and Leyland, Lancashire. A new company, Albion Automotive, has been formed to take over the former Albion axle plant in Scotstoun, Glasgow which employs 330 people, as well as the Leyland components plant which employs 180. The company will be led by Mr Dan Wright, formerly managing director of Fleming Thermodynamics, an engineering consultancy based in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire, and now a subsidiary of Motherwell Bridge, the engineering group. The management team has secured backing of about Pounds 12m. Bank of Scotland is providing long-term finance and overdraft facilities of about Pounds 5m, while selective regional assistance from the Scottish Office will add up to about Pounds 1.5m. Additional funding is being provided by the Glasgow Development Agency and Strathclyde Regional council. Equity backing of close to Pounds 4m is being provided by the syndicate of former Daf creditor banks led by ABN-AMRO of the Netherlands. The bank syndicate is providing venture capital finance through the Leyland Daf receivership, led by the joint administrative receivers, Mr Murdoch McKillop and Mr John Talbot of accountants Arthur Andersen. The rescue of the two operations almost completes the restructuring of the former Leyland Daf truck and van operations in the UK after the financial collapse of Daf in February. About 2,700 of an original 5,500 UK jobs at Leyland Daf have survived. The Birmingham van plant and the Leyland truck plant have been rescued by management buy-outs. The parts operation in Chorley was bought by a management buy-in team and the sales and marketing activity in Thame, Oxfordshire was taken over by Daf Trucks in the Netherlands. Mr Wright said Albion Automotive would have an initial turnover of about Pounds 30m. The workforce has supported the rescue by agreeing to a 5 per cent pay cut and a far-reaching package of new work practices. The company has secured contracts of up to six years to supply truck and van axles to Leyland Trucks and Leyland Daf Vans, as well as truck and bus chassis components and piping to Leyland Trucks and Daf Trucks. The company plans to develop in the fields of vehicle chassis and driveline components through joint ventures and acquisitions.</p>

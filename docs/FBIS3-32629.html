A U.S. State Department spokesperson, who spoke with EFE on  the condition that he remain anonymous, said that between 50 and  75 Cubans tried to reach the U.S. Interests Section, but were  turned back by Cuban policemen who cordoned off the area. "In  the past few days a false rumor has been spread in Havana. The  people have been told that the United States will issue visas to  anyone who requests it without checking on the person's  qualifications," the spokesperson said to explain the sudden  rush.    The spokesperson did not wish to comment on the way the  Cuban  security forces kept back the group that wanted to reach the  U.S. Interests Section. "The office will resume its normal  operations on Monday, but the United States wishes to make it  clear that it has not changed its policy regarding the issuance  of visas to Cubans who wish to leave the island," the  spokesperson stressed.    The Cuban-U.S. National Foundation, the largest organization  of Cuban exiles in the United States, has told EFE that the  security forces "immediately" detained the Cubans who went to  the U.S. Interests Section. The organization added that  according to reports received from Havana, following the  incident, as well as throughout the night, several shots were  heard in the Vedado neighborhood and that the Cuban police have  been arresting people throughout the city.    The organization added that "people in Miami who are  listening to the radio confirm that Cuban State Security has  been placed on alert while confrontations are being reported in  at least three areas of the city." The areas where  confrontations are being reported are: seashore drive [Malecon]  and L Street, between 17 and L Streets, and between El Cerro  Road and Primelles. "Likewise, our sources have confirmed that  the special forces have been ordered to stop and check all  vehicles in the city in search of weapons and explosives, as  well as to protect tourists."    The foundation condemned "the brutal acts of violence and  arbitrary arrests by Castro's security forces against the Cuban  people. [passage omitted]</p>

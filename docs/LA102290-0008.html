			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> A GRAND OLD PARTY, IN TWO PARTS;  </P> <P> ONE SIDE STANDS FOR REFORM, THE OTHER FOR REELECTION. THE SPLIT MAY BECOME  PERMANENT.  </P> <P> The ongoing fracas over the budget and tax policy has revealed to the public  what insiders have long known: there are two different Republican parties.  Until now, they have managed to get along, at least in public. But the tax  question has sent them after each other's throats, creating an open split that  may become permanent.  </P> <P> The two groups are the Reform Republicans and the Party Republicans. The Reform  Republicans put their agenda above loyalty to the party institution. That  agenda has two parts. In policy, it visualizes an America made prosperous  through a revitalized free market, which requires big cuts in taxes and reduced  government spending and absorption of capital through borrowing.  </P> <P> Reform Republicans see the deficit and Gramm-Rudman as opportunities, not  dangers. They would use them as leverage to reduce federal spending and  borrowing through a total freeze on spending (including entitlements) or by  letting the Gramm-Rudman ceilings take effect. Reform Republicans see the  rising tide of anger at Washington now manifesting itself across the country,  and want to run as critics of the Establishment, not members of it.  </P> <P> Party Republicans have fundamentally different perceptions. They have no real  policy agenda; their focus instead is on "making deals." They are process men,  concerned much more with keeping things on an even keel than with pushing any  particular set of policies. They seek harmony between the Congress and the  President, looking to the White House for leadership and guidance; they are  uncomfortable with partisanship, and they find any public bloodletting  distasteful. "No new taxes" has little policy or political importance in the  their eyes, especially when compared with the need to make a deal, and they  view Gramm-Rudman as a grave danger, not an opportunity to reduce the size of  government dramatically.  </P> <P> Politically, the Party Republicans are establishmentarians. Their "real world"  lies inside the beltway, and their political barometers are the White House,  Wall Street and one another. They have little feel for what is happening back  in Kansas, and not much interest in it either. They have no ambition to become  a majority party in the House; reelection of incumbents (themselves), not party  growth, is their goal.  </P> <P> When House Republican whip Newt Gingrich announced his opposition to the budget  deal, the Reform Republicans crossed their Rubicon. Now, if they go back to the  sort of "deal for a deal's sake" the Party Republicans want, they will find  they have alienated their own base. Having put their agenda above their party  loyalty once, they will find they must consistently do so or shatter and turn  upon themselves.  </P> <P> Where does this leave the Republican Party? The Reform Republicans are right in  sensing a growing wave of popular indignation against politicians. Their  populist, "outsider" message could enable the party to ride this wave to power.  Politicians who in effect come out against themselves with support for measures  like term limitation can still be credible with the public.  </P> <P> But the Republicans most visible to the public through the budget fiasco have  been the Party Republicans. They come across like what they are, professional  politicians without an agenda beyond staying in office, and the public reaction  has been strongly negative. They represent the Establishment of wealth and  privilege that average Americans have come to resent deeply. Not only are they  out of touch with their constituents, the constituents know they are out of  touch with them.  </P> <P> Their image shaped by the Party Republicans, Republican incumbents may take a  severe drubbing in November. In the long run, that could be good for the party,  because it could open the door to ascendancy of the Reform Republicans, who  have far greater potential public appeal. But there is also a danger that the  public will not be able to distinguish clearly between Reform and Party  Republicans, and will slaughter both indiscriminately.  </P> <P> The challenge facing Reform Republicans at this point is getting their  difference from Party Republicans across to their constituents. The next  proposed "deal" on the budget should give them another opportunity to do so.  But the hour is late, and courage may be waning. Will the Reformers see that  their only hope lies in separation? We will soon find out.  </P></p>

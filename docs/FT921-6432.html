			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Lonrho Lonrho's report and accounts will have done little to reassure investors alarmed by the dismal profits fall announced last month. Hence the further 7 per cent slide in the shares yesterday. The extra detail strengthens the impression of a group failing to hold its far-flung empire together. Even the declared Pounds 207m of pre-tax profit was flattered to the tune of Pounds 43m by property disposals and capitalised interest, so the underlying fall was significantly worse than previously disclosed. Lonrho's bankers, who have advanced the group more than Pounds 800m of unsecured loans, might be regretting their generosity. The main explanation for the poor trading performance appears to lie in the UK, where profits collapsed from Pounds 55m to Pounds 19m before tax. Given that the VAG motor distribution business made Pounds 20m pre-tax in 1990, the performance of Lonrho's other UK operations must have been dire indeed. If that continues, Lonrho will certainly face an Advance Corporation Tax problem. Nor is there much hope to be gleaned from the fact that the group's losses from foreign exchange adjustments last year fell by three-quarters to Pounds 40m. It will be asking a lot for exchange rates to be so favourable this time round. In structural terms, the group's main problem was its inadequate cash generation. A generous reading suggests a cash inflow of a mere Pounds 35m before tax and dividends, though it remains tantalisingly obscure over how this came about. Granted, capital expenditure should fall sharply this year and there might be a boost from asset disposals. But given the poor quality of its earnings, Lonrho must be wondering whether it can keep up even its reduced 13p dividend. The yield case for buying the shares looks ever more suspect.</p>

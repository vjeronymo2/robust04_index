			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Airbus to market new twin-engine airliner AIRBUS Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, has been given the go-ahead by its supervisory board to start marketing a new 124-seater airliner, the first step towards its new airliner programme. The consortium hopes to secure enough orders for the new twin-engine jet, the A319, the smallest in the Airbus aircraft family, to launch the Dollars 275m (Pounds 155m) programme to develop it later this year. The new aircraft would be a shorter derivative of the 150-seater A320 twin-engine aircraft. The consortium is already manufacturing a stretched 180-seater version of this aircraft, the A321. It is expected to be assembled at Hamburg together with the A321, although France has expressed concern over its share of the work on the A319 if the airliner was assembled and completed in Germany. Although the A319 is likely to compete against some of the separate regional jet programmes of the Airbus partners, Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus managing director, argued that the new aircraft would enhance the competitive position of Airbus against its two main rivals, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas of the US. The A319 is expected to enter service in late 1995.</p>

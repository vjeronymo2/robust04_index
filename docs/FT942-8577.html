			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Head of Dollars 80bn US pension fund to step down Mr Dale Hanson is to step down as head of the California Public Employees Retirement System (Calpers), the biggest US public pension plan with around Dollars 80bn under management, it emerged yesterday. Mr Hanson, 51, announced his intention to resign at a board meeting in Annaheim, California yesterday. While Calpers declined to give further reasons for Mr Hanson's departure, it said: 'It is of his own choice. The resignation was not forced or asked for by the board.' Mr Hanson will explain his reasons publicly today, Calpers added. His departure signals an upheaval in the senior management at one of the world's biggest investment institutions. It comes just six weeks after the retirement of Mr DeWitt Bowman, Calpers' long-standing chief investment officer, who had built a reputation as the US's most activist shareholder. Mr Bowman's job has in effect been left unfilled. His successor, Ms Sheryl Pressler, a former fund manager at the McDonnell Douglas pension fund, is not due to start work full-time at Calpers until July. Mr Hanson is expected to announce that he will continue as chief executive until a replacement has been found.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY BARS ISRAEL PEACE ACTIVISTS' WEST BANK CONVOY  </P> <P> The army set up a road block of jeeps and barbed wire Saturday to prevent a  "peace convoy" of more than 1,000 Israelis from entering the West Bank town of  Tulkarm to hold talks with Palestinians.  </P> <P> "This obstacle, this roadblock, it is symbolic, and there are many obstacles  that the Israeli government tries to put up between the Israelis and the  Palestinians," said Faisal Husseini, a prominent East Jerusalem Palestinian who  was part of the convoy.  </P> <P> The military had declared Tulkarm a closed military area and erected the  roadblocks after Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin ordered the "Peace Day" visit  to the West Bank town canceled. Peace activists said the military had no  authority to stop the event because it was not planned as a demonstration but  as a series of visits to Palestinian homes.  </P> <P> Blocked from entering Tulkarm, the protesters filled the road at the western  entrance to the town and unfurled banners reading "Peace Now."  </P> <P> Left-wing Knesset members Haim Oron and Dedi Zucker criticized Israel's "Inner  Cabinet" for rejecting Friday an Egyptian invitation to begin  Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo.  </P></p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Asuncion NOTICIAS in Spanish on 12 March  publishes on pages 2 and 3 three articles on peasant leaders'  reactions to comments made by Paraguayan President Juan Carlos  Wasmosy in Santiago, Chile, about problems causing social unrest  among peasants in Paraguay.    On page 2, a 200-word article by reporter Robert Figueredo  from Coronel Oviedo notes that local peasant leaders consider  the comments by Wasmosy "inappropriate." The leaders  furthermore believe, according to the article, that "Wasmosy's  intention is to divert international attention from the real  problems affecting the majority of peasants." Leader Rafael  Ruiz Diaz, who is coordinating the mobilization of peasants for  a demonstration in front of Congress in Asuncion on 15 March, is  quoted as saying: "This is the type of comment that shows the  government's negative attitude toward listening to our demands,  but it gives us greater unity, more enthusiasm, for the large  demonstration to be held in front of Congress on 15 March."    On page 3 a 300-word article by reporter Adolfo Traverssi  from Villarrica notes that the main peasant leader in Caazapa, a  Mr. De los Santos Vazquez, said that Wasmosy's comments are "not  true." He added: "If the president said that the peasant  leaders have not planted a single square meter of cotton, I will  say of him that he is a tourist president. Thanks to peasant  leaders like us, he is always travelling." Santos said he was  astonished that while Wasmosy was abroad he had discredited the  peasants who are doing miraculous things to produce more for the  benefit of the country. He added: "Instead of discrediting us,  our president should seriously think of changing his government  policy and aiming his cooperation toward the rural areas, where  the Paraguayan economic potential is located."    Also on page 3, an unattributed 300-word article notes the  comments made by Tomas Zayas of the Alto Parana Agricultural  Association. Zayas said that Wasmosy's comments are "shameful,  as he is unaware of the real situation of his own people."  Zayas added that anyone could see just by looking that there  has been a 50 percent reduction in cotton production, and not 5  percent, as indicated by Wasmosy. Zayas said: "The president  and those responsible for the country's agricultural policy are  irresponsible, because that figure was disclosed by officials of  the Agriculture and Livestock Ministry." Zayas also rejected  Wasmosy's comments that the peasant leaders are agitators. He  said they are peasants living in a land that had been  expropriated by Congress and vetoed by Wasmosy. Zayas concluded  by saying: "The president has shown once more his  irresponsibility in looking for agitators, subversives,  guerrillas, communists, and atheists among the peasants."</p>

In his recent report the special envoy of the U.N. Human  Rights Commission, Reynaldo Galindo Pohl, with the intent to  damage Iran's image in the world public opinion , has charged  Iran with cases including violation of political and social  freedoms and terrorism.    This is while Iranian officials, incuding the Head of the  Judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, have termed the allegations  biased and a political ploy to pressure Iran.    The pressure is of course by the Western powers that do not  favor Iran's active role in the region and its independent  stance with regard to such important regional development as  Gaza-Jericho compromise deal.    Stressing the existence of political and social freedom in  the country, Iranian officials state that all the points  mentioned in the constitutional law on the precise observation  of individual rights and the preservation of the rights of the  religious minorities are respected and practiced in Iran.    The existence of freedom of activity for political groups,  the progressive nature of laws and judicial system of the  country and freedom enjoyed by the religious minorities prove  this fact. This has been confirmed by leaders of religious  minorities and independent observers who have visited Iran.    The restatement of these allegations and unfounded matters  about human rights violation in Iran at Western circles and mass  media has created numerous questions.    Galindo Pohl's report which is a repetition of previous  claims was published following the massive Feb. 11 rallies  (marking the anniversary of the victory of the Islamic  revolution in 1979).    To any impartial observer, the rally was full of meanings  and  implications and removed numerous doubts instilled in the world  public opinion about the popularity of the Islamic government in  Iran.    On the other hand, the report should be considered connected  with the firm stances recently taken by the Iranian official in  condemning the genocide of Bosnian Muslims by the Serbs and the  compromise accord in the Middle East.    The fact that five years have passed since the issuance of  the verdict on the apostate Salman Rushdie, the author of the  Satanic Verses, and the futile political and economic pressures  by the West on the Islamic Republic of Iran to revoke the  verdict can be mentioned as other reasons behind presentation of  this report.    Exertion of pressure to make Iran compromise and move along  with the policies of the West is the main goal that the United  States and its allies constantly are pursuing by publicizing  such false claims. This is while Galindo Pohl's colleagues have  overlooked human rights violations in the countries allied with  the United States.    Another important point in this report and similar claims is  that Iran is accused of state terrorism when it is a major  victim of terrorism itself and this is something that those  claiming to support human rights have always ignored.    The recent assassination attempt on the life of the Iranian  president Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani on Feb. 1 during the Ten-Day  Dawn inauguration ceremonies (marking the anniversary of the  victory of the Islamic revolution in 1979) and the November 29  hijacking of a Fokker friendship passenger plane belonging to  the Oil Ministry to Iraq are among more recent cases, not to  mention over a decade of post-revolution victimization of the  Iranian nation at the hands of Western-supported terrorist  outfits.    The allegations on human rights are brought forth at a time  when tens of thousands of innocent Muslim Bosnian children and  women are being martyred in the heart of Europe and hundreds of  thousands are facing the prospect of being massacred or raped.    The outrageous violations of the rights of the Muslim  Palestinian nation by the Zionists are among other issues which  have been neglected in the files of the so-called human rights  organizations.    The double standard in dealing with the world events by  international organizations is not something that Muslim nations  can overlook.</p>

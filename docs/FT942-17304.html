			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Israel seeks to sell state shipyard Israel yesterday put state-owned Israel Shipyards up for sale by tender, writes Julian Ozanne in Jerusalem. The company, which had annual sales of Dollars 37m (Pounds 25m) in 1992, builds and repairs ships for civilian and military uses and does repair works for the US Sixth Fleet. The sale is part of the Israeli government's privatisation programme for 1994 which aims to raise Dollars 1.5bn and includes selling companies such as Bank Hapoalim, Bank Leumi, Israel Chemicals and the state airline El Al. The Finance Ministry said investors interested in Israel Shipyards must submit bids by May 5 and that the sale would be completed within six months. According to the tender documents, the buyers are obliged to keep the concern as a shipping company and maintain existing labour agreements. To privatise Israel Shipyards, in receivership since 1986, the government had to forgive Dollars 140m of debt under an arrangement with the company's creditors.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Records: Long live the blues THE BLUES Is Alright sang Little Milton a little less than a a decade ago. The faithful cheered, but in truth, the Blues seemed like a dying genre: young blacks had turned to funk and even the crowd of white worshippers at the holy grail thinned out as the likes of George Michael turned to the softer sounds of 1970's soul which they refashioned as the basis of emotive balladeering and dance music. At the tiny Malaco label, Little Milton and fellow elderly blues survivors (among them the marvellous Bobby Bland, ZZ Hill and Johnnie Taylor) went through their traditional paces. The Blues Is Alright (MCD 7449), a greatest hits of the label, confirms they were still legendary, but also that had lost their ability to inspire younger listeners. The blues it seemed was truly dead. Then, seemingly from nowhere, came Robert Cray to refashion the blues and achieve significant mainstream commercial success along the way. 1988's Who's Been Talkin' (Charly CDCLM 101) captures him at his bluesiest and most confident, a strident sinner confessing his sins and glorying in temptation, knowing it will all end in pain. Then the trickle became a flood as lo and behold legendary blues man John Lee Hooker, who made his first recordings in 1948, entered the 1990s with a series of hit albums. In his wake Buddy Guy rekindled the flames of a dying career and also stormed the charts. The blues, it suddenly seemed was very much alive. And so the re-issues (and advertisements featuring blues men) gushed forth. A good starting place for beginners is the budget offering 60 Great Blues Recordings (Cascade CBOXCD 3) which spans recordings from the Flair and Modern labels mostly from the 1950s. Apart from a few tracks by Hooker and BB King it includes mostly little known performers. As a result, it is a good working introduction to the blues as a genre. For more of the hits try Sequel's The Blues Guitar Box 2 (NXTCD 185). Another triple CD package, it touches more bases, including a fair number of white blues men, but, possibly because its scope is larger, its impact is lesser. All Night Long They Played The Blues (Ace CDCHD440) is another irresistitible compilation of lesser lights, including Little Johnny Taylor, Saunders King, and the wonderful Charles Brown, that works as a whole simply because the songs and emotions tumble into each other seamlessly. As the most successful blues man of the moment, naturally Hooker is the most re-issued. Hence the six-CD set The Vee-Jay Years, 1955-1964 (Charly CDRED Box 6) which includes virtually everything Hooker recorded during his ten years with Vee Jay. Undoubtedly, a work of scholarship, it fails to capture Hooker. Instead it merely suggests the variety of work he was capable of without celebrating his laconic passion. For that you need Graveyard Blues (Ace CDCHD421) a collection of early recording made for Specialty. Hooker's chanted lyrics and repetitive guitar work may seem simple at first listening, but their power remains undiminished after numerous plays, the mark of someone who has teased an unconsidered passion from his music. Memory, Pain (CDCHD438) is the title of Ace's second collection of Percy Mayfield's recordings, and appropriately bleak they are. His biggest hit was Please Send Me Someone To Love in 1950, but clearly he went unrequited. Heard through a throng, Mayfield sounds like a a piano bar blues man, all tinkle and sad saxes waiting for Bogart to make an appearance. Banish the throng and you find one of the great poets of popular culture of the 1950s. Like James Dean or Jean Paul Belmondo in a Bout De Souffle, characters who strive for dignity and style but know they are not enough, Percy Mayfield knows that the dawn brings forth no new hope. In his world, lost love is the norm and suicide the major temptation, all held barely at an arm's distance by the caressing sound of the coolest blues style ever. Or as he puts it: It serves me right to suffer, it serves me right to be alone.</p>

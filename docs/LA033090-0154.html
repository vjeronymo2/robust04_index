			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1990 BOYS' TRACK AND FIELD PREVIEW  </P> <P> Top teams: Esperanza, San Clemente, Saddleback.  </P> <P> Top sprinters: Erik Mitchell (Los Alamitos), Roshawn Sims (Esperanza), Tim  Martin (San Clemente).  </P> <P> Top hurdlers: Adrian Brown (Huntington Beach), David Fair (El Toro), Damon  Richardson (Esperanza).  </P> <P> Top distance runners: Mark Gonzales, Tim Mahon (La Habra); Daniel Niednagel  (Dana Hills); Mike Farrell (San Clemente); Robby Price, Eddie Salinas  (Saddleback); Alan Grant, Brian McCaffery (Marina); Mike Terry (El Modena);  Linh Le (Los Amigos).  </P> <P> Top field event athletes: Phouphet Singbandith (Magnolia); Mark Parlin, Clayton  Tharrington, Trevor Lycett (Esperanza); Andy Marrone, Matt Jordan (Dana Hills);  Hartwell Brown (Los Alamitos); Brad Sherman, Lawson Mollica (Edison); Al Avila  (Loara); Tyson Jacobson (Capistrano Valley); Scott Wigglesworth (San Clemente);  Keith Miller (Corona del Mar); Tony Robinson (San Clemente); Darriel Whipple  (Valencia).  </P> <P> Important dates: April 7, Arcadia Invitational; April 21, Mt. SAC Relays; May  18, Southern Section finals; May 25, Masters meet; June 1-2, State meet.  </P> <P> Notes: Esperanza, the defending 3-A champion, breezed through the Orange County  Championships to win with 90 points. The Aztecs are led by all-around sprinter  Roshawn Sims, who already has won two athlete of the meet honors (Irvine  Invitational and OC Championships). One of the more interesting showdowns this  year should be between Los Alamitos' Mitchell and San Clemente's Martin --  Martin beat Mitchell in an indoor 50-yard race in January, but Mitchell beat  Martin last week in the 100 meters at the Orange County Championships.  Huntington Beach sophomore Brown has proved to be in a class by himself in the  110-meter hurdles, and watch for Magnolia's Singbandith to close in on the  county triple jumping record of 50 feet 3 1/2 inches set in 1982 by Troy's Ken  Williams.  </P></p>

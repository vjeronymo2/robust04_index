			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Procter takes a gamble with nappy changes - The group hopes to regain market share with its latest price cuts Here is a puzzle. Pulp prices are rocketing worldwide, so companies making paper-based products are under pressure to raise their prices too. Yet Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, announced earlier this week that it was cutting the US price of its Luvs disposable nappies (diapers in the US) by 11 per cent. What is Procter &amp; Gamble's game? At first glance, the announcement sounded ominously like a repeat of Marlboro Friday. Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes 15 per cent of its global revenues from disposable nappies, said it was cutting the price of Luvs to claw back market share from cheaper, store-branded and private label nappies. Last year Philip Morris, another big US packaged goods maker, employed much the same logic when it cut the price of Marlboro, its top-selling cigarette brand, to reverse its loss of market share to cheaper, generic brands. So was this Diaper Tuesday? The comparison falters because Luvs, unlike Marlboro, is not a premium product. Procter &amp; Gamble's top disposable nappy brand in the US is Pampers, while Luvs is a value-for-money brand. Procter &amp; Gamble says the Luvs price cut is intended merely to restore the product's competitiveness with private label brands, which have recently become cheaper. Even so, the cut will hurt. US nappy prices have already fallen by about 20 per cent over the past two years because of tough competition between Procter &amp; Gamble, the private label suppliers, and Kimberly-Clark, the US paper products company that leads the US nappy market with its Huggies brand. Furthermore, Procter &amp; Gamble is having to accompany the Luvs price cut with a 2 per cent reduction in the US price of Pampers because Pampers might otherwise start to look too expensive. The puzzle is how Procter &amp; Gamble can afford it. Pulp prices, driven by surging worldwide demand, have shot up by 80 per cent from their November 1993 low of Dollars 390 a tonne, and are rising fast. According to Mr Chip Dillon, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, Procter &amp; Gamble gets through 700,000-800,000 tonnes of pulp a year in the US alone. So even by the most conservative estimate, the company is facing an increase in pulp costs of Dollars 200m a year in the US - equivalent to about 25 cents a share after tax. One way Procter &amp; Gamble plans to defray the cost is by increasing the price of its other paper-based products. It said this week that it was raising the US prices of its Charmin toilet tissue by 5 per cent, its Bounty paper towels by 6 per cent and its Puffs facial tissues by 8 per cent. Meanwhile, the Luvs price cut should be partially offset by increased sales. The company is also cutting manufacturing costs. In July last year it set in train a plan to close 30 plants and shed 13,000 jobs - about 12 per cent of its global workforce - in response to competition from lower-priced products. 'The efficiencies gained from those actions pay out at a time like this,' the company says. Procter &amp; Gamble insists that it expects to continue 'solid' sales and earnings progress in spite of the nappy price cuts. Ms Lynne Hyman, an analyst at CS First Boston, is less sure: she thinks the price increases on tissue and towel products should cancel out the increased cost of pulp, while lower production costs should balance out the price cuts for Luvs. 'I would say it's fairly neutral, but a little bit of it is dependent on getting some higher volumes, so there's a chance it could be slightly negative,' she says. If things do go wrong, one possible gainer should be Procter &amp; Gamble's biggest US rival in paper products, Kimberly-Clark. Unlike Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly-Clark is a pulp producer. Therefore if product prices rise, Procter &amp; Gamble will be simply defraying higher raw material costs, while Kimberly-Clark should see the full benefit at its bottom line. Unfortunately, however, Kimberly-Clark has troubles of its own. The company has been trying to break into the European market for disposable nappies with its Huggies brand, but the cost of doing so has proved much higher than expected - not least because of aggressive retaliatory action by Procter &amp; Gamble. So the last thing Kimberly-Clark needs just now is a round of price cuts in the US nappy market. Mr Sherman Chao, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, remarks that all this is a far cry from the early 1990s, when consumer product companies were enjoying a fall in raw material costs and yet were still able to push up prices. 'Now everything is converging against them - an inability to raise prices in general and raw material prices moving up.' Seen in that light, it is remarkable that Procter &amp; Gamble is doing as well as it is. But with the nappy war moving to Europe, and the increase in pulp prices showing no signs of slowing, no one is pretending that the diaper business is going to get any easier.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Poltava-Cherkassy, [no date as received] -- On 25  June President Leonid Kravchuk visited Poltava and Cherkassy  Oblasts, where he met local residents.    Replying to a UNIAN correspondent's question on where the  danger was in the Ukrainian Supreme Council's draft law "on  introducing amendments and additions to the Ukrainian law `on  the formation of the bodies of local power and  self-government,'" which he recently vetoed, and whether he  assessed this draft law as a deliberate move by the left-wing  majority in parliament, Leonid Kravchuk pointed out: "This  draft law was adopted in violation of three articles of  Ukraine's Constitution, and it does not matter to me who  violates it, either the left-wingers or the right-wingers,  because everyone must respect the Constitution, while the  Supreme Council and the president should provide an example of  respect. If this kind of attitude toward the Constitution is  displayed at this level, then it is necessary to announce that  we have no Constitution and that we live in compliance with  current laws which are adopted either by the left-wing or the  right-wing majority."    As far as private ownership of land is concerned, which  Supreme Council Chairman Oleksandr Moroz recently spoke out  against, Leonid Kravchuk replied that neither the president nor  the chairman of the Ukrainian Supreme Council solves this issue,  but the Supreme Council of Ukraine does, as a legislative body,  proceeding from the proposals to be put forward by the regions,  as well as the decisions by the oblast councils and also  people's will. "I have already said that all the talk about  democracy, citizens' rights, and freedoms should be discontinued  if a citizen of Ukraine, who wants and who can buy a plot of  land is banned from doing this," said Leonid Kravchuk.</p>

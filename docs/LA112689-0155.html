			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WESTCHESTER HIGH APPEALS PROPOSAL TO SWITCH LEAGUES;  </P> <P> COMPETITION: SHOULD WESTCHESTER MOVE TO THE SOUTHERN-PACIFIC CONFERENCE IN  PLACE OF PERENNIAL DOORMAT NARBONNE, WHICH WANTS OUT? L.A. CITY SECTION  OFFICIALS LIKE THE IDEA, BUT WESTCHESTER PARENTS AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS SAY  NO.  </P> <P> The stage is set Monday for perhaps the fiercest high school releaguing battle  of the year.  </P> <P> Backed by concerned parents, Westchester High will appeal an L.A. City Section  proposal to move the school to the Southern-Pacific Conference in place of  Narbonne, which requested a change because of its continued failure to compete  on that level.  </P> <P> Narbonne has a two-year conference football record of 0-14, playing a demanding  schedule that includes Carson, Banning, Dorsey and Crenshaw. In basketball, the  Gauchos were 1-9 in the conference last season.  </P> <P> "We don't think Narbonne should stay there," Westchester football Coach Larry  Wein said, "but we don't think they should put another school in there to  suffer."  </P> <P> Will Westchester suffer? Several South Bay coaches believe the Comets are  capable of being competitive in the Southern-Pacific Conference.  </P> <P> Westchester's football team has reached the L.A. City 2-A and 3-A Division  finals each of the last two years and will play a second-round 3-A playoff game  Friday against South Gate. The basketball team regularly qualifies for the 4-A  playoffs.  </P> <P> "I don't see anything wrong with it," Carson football Coach Gene Vollnogle said  of the proposal. "I have no respect for coaches who don't want to move up."  </P> <P> Wein, though, said Westchester's reluctance to move from the Coastal Conference  to the Southern-Pacific Conference involves more than potential wins and  losses.  </P> <P> He outlined three reasons:  </P> <P> * The community is concerned about the prospect of gang activity after two  football games this season at Southern-Pacific Conference schools (Washington  and Dorsey) were suspended in the fourth quarter because of gunfire outside the  stadiums.  </P> <P> * By placing Westchester in the Southern-Pacific Conference, four of the City  section's five high schools with black enrollments of at least 60% (Crenshaw,  Dorsey, Washington and Westchester) will compete in the same conference, thus  creating a segregated conference.  </P> <P> * With an enrollment of 1,600 students in grades nine through 12, Westchester  is the second-smallest high school in the City section and will have trouble  competing in football with larger schools such as Banning, Carson and Dorsey.  </P> <P> Wein also argued that moving Westchester from the Coastal Conference will  terminate longtime rivalries with Venice, Palisades and University.  </P> <P> "When I came here eight years ago, the football team had won two games in five  years," said Wein, whose team is 19-5 over the last two seasons. "We've come a  long way. To see the program destroyed in a year or two, along with the  school's spirit, would be a shame.  </P> <P> "We're just looking for an equal situation. None of the Westside schools have  large student pools. Give us 3,000 students, and we'll go anywhere you want us  to go."  </P> <P> The proposed switch with Narbonne involves moving Westchester to the 3-A  Division Southern League with Gardena, San Pedro and Washington, and in the  conference with 4-A Pacific League members Banning, Carson, Dorsey and  Crenshaw. Narbonne would be grouped in the Coastal Conference with 3-A Metro  League members University, Venice and Los Angeles, and 4-A Western League  schools Manual Arts, Hamilton, Fairfax and Palisades.  </P> <P> The changes would affect all sports for the 1990-92 cycle beginning next fall.  </P> <P> If Westchester loses its appeal Monday before the releaguing subcommittee, Wein  said the school will appeal the matter to the Interscholastic Athletics  Committee, the governing body of L.A. City athletics.  </P></p>

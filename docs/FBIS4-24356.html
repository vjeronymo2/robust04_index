			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Colette Braeckman: "Rwanda: Paul Barril's Theory </F> Shaky"]    [Text] Captain Barril is making too much of the matter and  his verbosity risks harming the credibility of what he says and  the credibility of those sponsoring him. Initially, the former  "super gendarme" from the GIGN [National Gendarmerie  Intervention Group] had assured the daily LE MONDE that he had  the black box of the Falcon 50 in which the Rwandan and  Burundian presidents were killed, and that he had gone to Kigali  to look for it on behalf of [deceased] Rwandan President  Habyarimana family.    Next, talking live on France 2 [television network]  yesterday  [28 June] at noon, the former officer went much further: He  claimed that he had recordings of the conversations with the  control tower, in which, he says, he recognized "Belgian"  accents. These recordings were made by the Rwandan Armed  Forces. He also confirmed that he had satellite photos  indicating an offensive on the Ugandan border begun on 6 April.    Someone who tries too hard to show something ends up not  convincing anyone, or even raising questions about the exact  nature of his mission. In this connection, LE CANARD ENCHAINE  wrote that the former member of the presidential palace's  gendarme "cell," who has not totally broken with his former  employers, actually went to Kigali to recover President  Habyarimana's files. It was therefore dangerous, to say the  least, to hurriedly send someone as controversial as him to  center stage.    Indeed, Barril's statements are peppered with contradictions  and inaccuracies. First of all, it is amazing that a private  individual should still have access to satellite photos, the use  of which is supposed to be reserved for military personnel. As  for the place from where the missiles were fired on 6 April,  that was an area controlled by the Presidential Guard. The RPF  [Rwandan Patriotic Front] did not arrive until May. As for the  black box itself, the mystery has not been cleared up at all:  Dassault maintenance personnel say that this type of airplane  did not have a black box and a pilot thinks that the object  submitted by Barril was just a radio-compass box. The fact  remains, however, that shortly after the crash, an object  resembling the black box was picked up in the wreckage of the  airplane by a French military volunteer. Who handed it over to  Paul Barril? The Rwandan Government, to whom the object was  supposedly given afterward? One might also wonder whether the  remains of the black box shown on French television were not  something put together to make people forget the existence of a  compromising "original."    In addition, Barril supposedly discovered parts of the SAM-7  missile launchers in Massaka. So the elite shooters,  undoubtedly professionals, were absentminded, were they? In any  case, in May, when the RPF held the area, the land had clearly  been gone over with a fine-tooth comb, so it would have been  with the help of the previous occupants, the Presidential Guard,  that Barril made his discoveries.    There is another inaccuracy in Barril's statements: He  maintains that no international inquiry has been requested. In  actual fact, in the first few hours after the attack, and once  again when the Belgian Blue Helmets were accused of having  assassinated the president, something which led to the death of  10 of them, the Belgian Government asked the International Civil  Aviation Organization to open an inquiry. This request is  regularly called up by Brussels.    Nevertheless, it remains to be seen whether the Mystere  Falcon, piloted by a crew comprising former military personnel,  should be considered a civilian aircraft.    Apart from the contradictions in the testimony, it is now  important to wonder why the family of the dead president, and  other sponsors, asked Barril to put his talents as a storyteller  and editor at the service of a version which is slowly losing  its plausibility, namely a version which claims that there was  Belgian involvement, in collaboration with the RPF.  Increasingly, a theory is gaining ground which says that the  "tough guys" of the regime, members of president's wife's  family, instigated the attack and provided the inspiration for  the massacres.    Even the fact that Elie Sagatwa, considered the leader of  the  regime's "hawks," was also in the airplane along with the chief  of staff, does not prove anything: President Habyarimana knew  he was under threat, a coup had already been prepared for 23  March and a number of high-ranking officers had already let it  be known that important events were being prepared. President  Habyarimana could have been trying to protect himself by  surrounding himself with heavyweight personalities and having  himself accompanied by the Burundian president.    It is also impossible not to notice that Captain Barril's  explosion onto the media scene followed the publication in LE  SOIR of a theory which is still being looked into by the Belgian  military prosecutor's office and which involves two French  nationals.  <H5>  Screens </H5>   In reality, Paul Barril's intervention could have something  in common with "Operation Turquoise," namely that both are  "screen" operations with hidden motives. "Operation Turquoise"  despite preventing further massacres, could be considered as a  humanitarian enterprise concealing other objectives. Among  other things, it would be a matter of bringing out people who  have stuck with the government or pulling local collaborators  out of the Rwandan hell. These people do not face the greatest  danger but they know a great deal. Radio messages have been  broadcast, calling on those who can to reach Kibuye. The  members of the Mille Collines Radio are also said to be  preparing to be evacuated by the French.    In the Zairian city of Goma, observers have noted the  presence of soldiers who do not belong to any officially engaged  unit. And the push of the French Army to Gikongoro, a few km  from the front line, worries those who fear a clash between the  RPF and "Operation Turquoise."    This clash could easily take place elsewhere: A witness at  Bangui airport in the Central African Republic saw French  soldiers equipped with parachutes. They seemed convinced that  they would be required to jump on Kigali in the coming hours and  therefore directly face the RPF.    Moreover "Operation Turquoise," which is clearly being  required to act circumspectly by the Balladur government, is  producing secondary effects: The media deployment it has caused  is revealing the extent of the genocide and inevitably leading  to questions about everyone's responsibilities. The "screen"  operations are also seeking to turn these questions toward other  targets.    Now that at last, and too late, all the attention is going  to  Rwanda, its neighbor Burundi is living through very critical  times. Provisional President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya said that  his country was on the brink and that distrust between citizens  had reached new heights.    It appears that large Israeli arms deliveries are at present  reaching Burundi via Goma. They are probably intended for the  extremist Palipehutu movement and the Burundi Democratic Front  hard-liners. At this moment on the hills of Burundi, people are  being taught how to use M-16's and Uzi machine guns.</p>

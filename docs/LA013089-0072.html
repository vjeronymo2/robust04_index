			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> EGG MAY HATCH GENETIC DRUGS  </P> <P> Researchers at Amgen Inc. of Thousand Oaks have developed an effective new  method of inserting new genetic information into chicken eggs so that it will  be passed on to succeeding generations. One benefit of the development may be a  new path to production of genetically engineered drugs.  </P> <P> Using techniques that have been refined in other animals, the Amgen researchers  open the egg at a very early stage of development, insert genetic material into  the nucleus through a very fine glass tube, then reseal the egg and allow it to  hatch. Future experiments will attempt to introduce new genetic material  controlling such traits as growth characteristics and disease resistance, the  company said.  </P> <P> Amgen officials said the technique may one day have applications in the  pharmaceutical industry because of the chicken's proven ability to efficiently  produce albumen -- the protein that makes up the white portion of chicken eggs.  Foreign proteins, such as drugs, could be manufactured along with the albumen,  then readily isolated.  </P></p>

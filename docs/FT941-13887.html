			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Books: Lost in the moral maze A HISTORY OF SIN by Oliver Thomson Canongate Press Pounds 17.99, 278 pages Years ago John Sparrow, then Warden of All Souls and not noted for his Christian piety, was seen to take the chaplain of Winchester College by the elbow after attending Morning Chapel. 'That was a most interesting hymn we sang just now. 'New sins forgiven'. Do drop me a card with the latest list.' Social rules are as old as human culture and the breaking of them just as old. They are constantly evolving and diverging, even to the point that different cultures or successive generations may hold rules which are contradictory. Oliver Thomson has attempted to map the vast range and variety of these social norms, especially the nasty ones. History of Sin falls into two main sections with a brief epilogue, in which he tries to peer in to the future. The first section is designated 'The Nature of Moralities'; the second is an extended canter through human civilisation from 1,500,000 years BC to 1992 AD. In the process Mr Thomson demonstrates a breadth of reading which is mind-boggling. There are over 400 books listed in the Bibliography, and a note that the list does not include the Holy Books of the great religions. The author's canvas is global, would-be cosmic. One has a feeling that he would love to be able to list some strange barbaric customs culled from the Third Planet of Alpha Centauri. A hitchhiker's guide to the ethical systems of the Galaxy must surely be his next endeavour. The enterprise is of course potentially fascinating; a comparative anthropology of the development of morals pursued with intellectual rigour and with a sustained thesis is likely to be enlightening. But the sheer mass of material and the multitude of generalisations drawn from the exhaustive collage of instances he has collected make it difficult to find here any coherent analysis. Mr Thomson is more concerned about public policy than with personal morality. Reading between the lines one may sense a deeply compassionate man struggling with the perennial beastliness of human beings who have so persistently quenched the small flames of compassion, cooperation and altruism under a tide of cruelty and institutional violence and then compounded the felony by commending barbaric customs as virtues. Accumulating multitudes of instances does add colour; the virtues, but more the vices, of other peoples and ages have undoubted fascination. Open the book on any page and the eye will be caught by an intriguing instance or illustration. (Nothing prurient.) Did you know that Timur the Lame built a tower of 70,000 skulls? That in Bombay it was at one time a capital offence to paint a moustache on a sleeping woman? That the Amish people forbade buttons? Do you know about cannibalism, pederasty, human sacrifice or ritual prostitution from the Andes to Tibet? About anitsemitism, racism, the Inquisition? About flagellation or fanatical puritanism? Here it is docketed and dated. But the endless listing and enumerating of instances eventually reduces history to natural history - row after row of butterflies pinned on a board. Too much detail is not the only problem. There are significant but undefined distinctions between ethics, morals, cultural norms and social taboos. Fashions in shoes are different from issues of justice and mercy. The language context of sin is normally religious; it is an offence against the Divine. 'Immorality' has a different language context, so does 'ethical'. There is not enough account of the progress of moral philosophy without which ethical analysis is impossible. The result is the relativisation of all moral judgment which leads in turn to the inevitable frustration of any attempt to write a history of sin except as an immense collection of learned vignettes with commentary.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola] leader Jonas Savimbi has written to UN envoy Alioune  Beye to say that sanctions against UNITA will not mean the end  of the world. Jonas Savimbi warned the Angolan peace talks  mediator about the possibility of the United Nations imposing  sanctions against UNITA.    According to the letter delivered to Alioune Beye today,  dated yesterday [28 June] from Huambo, Savimbi said that UNITA  would no longer live with the fear of sanctions. UNITA  spokesman Jorge Valentim refused to go into detail, but did not  repudiate the possible interpretation that his letter implied  that the UNITA leadership admitted that the talks might break  down if renewed sanctions were imposed against the movement.    The letter comes at the same time as an impasse at the  Lusaka  talks.</p>

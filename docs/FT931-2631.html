			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Kwik-Fit blames trading down for decline to Pounds 17m KWIK-FIT Holdings, the tyre and exhaust fitter, yesterday blamed motorists who have reduced and deferred expenditure on car maintenance for a 47 per cent decline in full year profits. Pre-tax profits in the year to February 28 fell from Pounds 32.1m to Pounds 17.1m on turnover down 8 per cent to Pounds 233.6m (Pounds 253.8m). Commenting on the latest results Mr Tom Farmer, chairman and chief executive, said the year had seen 'the toughest conditions in the automotive industry Kwik-Fit has experienced in 22 years of trading.' The reduction in consumer spending on car maintenance had coincided with aggressive competition as companies fought for market share. 'We operate in a business that has a high fixed cost base and the decline in sales has had a disproportionate negative effect on profitability,' he said. Following record results in 1991 Mr Farmer said the group had been expecting a slow start to the year, but believed that expenditure on car maintenance and essential automotive products could not be deferred'. However, not only was overall tyre demand down, but the sales mix changed from premium brand products to economy brands and remoulds as motorists and companies reduced their costs and expenditure. In contrast, exhaust sales, which could not be deferred were maintained at the previous year's level. Despite the rising cost of utilities, rents, rates and insurance, and the associated cost of opening 19 new centres, together with the refurbishment of 30 existing centres, Kwik Fit's overall costs increased by less than 5 per cent. The group remained the market leader with 610 centres and more than 4m customers last year. Earnings per share showed a decline from 13.27p to 7.06p. However, the recommended final distribution is maintained at 2p making an unchanged total for the year of 3.35p. COMMENT Tough new tyre legislation last year should have given the Kwik-Fit business a boost in the usually stronger second half. But no-one, least of all volume sensitive Kwik-Fit, reckoned on the risks motorists were prepared to take. Police surveys show that one-in-four cars on the road is illegal. Those motorists who are changing tyres are buying lower priced brands, hitting both turnover and margins while overheads stay fixed. And there are more competitors. Yesterdays results were slightly better than some analysts had feared and as a result the shares gained 1p to close at 107p. This recently volatile stock has taken investors on a rollercoaster ride over the past year, touching a high of 223p and a low of 71p. Pre-tax profits forecasts range from about Pounds 16.5m to Pounds 19m producing earnings of between 6.5p and 7.5p per share. But without a pronounced and early recovery the stock still looks fully valued.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Frank Gonzalez: "Fourth </F> Ibero-American Summit: Consultation Mechanism Will Have To Prove  Its Strength"]    [Text] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia [no date as received]  -- While looking toward integration and remaining committed to  making concerted efforts to survive in the new international  scene, the Ibero-American presidents are scheduled to hold their  fourth summit this month in this Colombian Caribbean city.    The meeting, scheduled to be held on 14 and 15 June, will be  attended by 23 heads of state or government in Latin America,  Spain, and Portugal. This time, the summit was called to study  an agenda that primarily focuses on commerce and integration as  ways to further development.    To advance these goals, and as proposed by the host nation  of  Colombia, all participating governments have had access to the  draft of the conference's final declaration, which has undergone  ad hoc modifications based on suggestions, proposals, and points  of view not included in the original draft.    This is the process being used to prepare the document, and  it is to continue until the final version is drawn up the  evening before the summit. The foreign ministers will then  review the document before sending it to the presidents for  consideration. The latter will be given seven minutes each to  give a speech before they hold their first two plenary sessions  on the opening day of the summit.    The statesmen also will be able to express their views on  proposals presented by their colleagues during the closed-door  debates that will follow.    According to reports, issues scheduled to be discussed  include prospects for an international trade system, convergence  of integration processes, competitiveness, and social  development.    The host nation believes this exchange of opinion will prove  to be the most important time for the dignitaries to freely  discuss their positions. For this reason, measures have been  taken to ensure absolute secrecy; what is said at this meeting  will not be recorded in any document.    Analysts and diplomats linked to the summit predict it will  be an interesting event, especially its debates on the  relationship between economic growth and social development, as  well as those on problems suffered in recent years by most Latin  American countries because of severe adjustment programs that  have had serious negative impacts on low-income sectors.    In advance of Cuba's participation in the summit, Deputy  Foreign Relations Minister Jorge Bolanos mentioned the need for  the final declaration to adequately reflect Latin American  reality.    Bolanos noted that one cannot forget the situation of  210-220  million of the region's inhabitants for whom it is impossible to  speak of development without social justice because they live  below the poverty level.    Another highlight of the debate could be the prospects for  the new internatioanl trade regime approved in April in the  Moroccan city of Marrakech following the conclusion of the GATT  talks.    When evaluating this topic, the Ibero-American leaders will  have to take into account other nations' policies and positions  which hinder trade liberalization, such as the U.S. blockade  against Cuba.    Just as at the third summit, which took place a year ago in  the Brazilian city of Salvador, it is hoped that the fourth  summit will issue a statement rejecting the U.S.  Administration's coercive measures against Cuba.  <H5>  Agreement Mechanism Becomes Consolidated </H5>   In its fourth year of existence, the Ibero-American Summit  mechanism seems headed to consolidating itself as a means of  agreement and consensus of wills, with integration as a  still-distant but feasible goal.    Starting with the first summit in Guadalajara in 1991,  followed by the meetings in Madrid in 1992 and in Salvador in  1993, we can see an increasing consolidation of goals and  potential of this group of nations, all of which are  interconnected through their languages, culture, and history.    Along with this impressive natural base for cooperation,  common interests have been added as a result of the evolution of  international relations, including the trend toward  globalization of the world economy and the consolidation of  blocs and partnerships.    The founding conference in Guadalajara decided to turn a  host of historic and cultural affinities into an instrument of  unity and development.    The second summit in Madrid coincided with the spectacular  festivities with which the Spanish Government and crown  celebrated the fifth centennial of Christopher Columbus' arrival  in America.    Brazil hosted the third summit and gave it a new and  superior  character by dedicating it to sustained development with a  social emphasis.    One of the peculiarities of the Ibero-American meetings is  that, from the beginning, they have worked with a temporary  secretariat held by the country where the next meeting is  scheduled. Those who favor this system argue that it prevents  the creation of a permanent administrative apparatus with  additional expenses and bureaucratic red tape.    Others, however, believe it is time for the conference to  set  up a permanent secretariat to serve as liaison to supervise  compliance with the agreements reached at each summit.    In just three years, the Ibero-American leaders have  ratified  72 agreements covering 31 different topics that include  agriculture, trade, cooperation, terrorism, sovereignty,  culture, and health.    The dispute that arose in Salvador on whether the summits  should be held annually or biannually seems to have been  resolved in practice following the announcement of venues for  upcoming summits until the year 2000.    Argentina will host the 1995 summit, Chile in 1996, El  Salvador 1997, Portugal 1998, and Panama in the year 2000. The  1999 summit remains vacant and, in the opinion of the Colombian  Government, should be assigned to Cuba.    Anyway, everything seems to indicate that the Ibero-American  mechanism has become a superior starting point on the path  toward agreement. In terms of this mechanism, Latin America  benefits greatly from the regional unity these summits  encourage, while it also benefits because of the mutually  advantageous relationships established among different  industrialized areas and with members of the European Union --  relationships that are maintained on a level of equality, not  submission.</p>

			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: MAN boosts truck output MAN Nutzfahrzeuge, the commercial vehicle subsidiary of Germany's MAN engineering group, expects to produce a record number of trucks for the second year running. The rise in output, from 36,000 in 1990 to an expected 43,000 this year, will help the truck maker increase turnover by DM800m to DM8bn (Dollars 4.8bn) for its fiscal year ending June 1992, according to executive board chairman, Mr Wilfried Lochte. The turnover increase for the trucks subsidiary - still benefiting from the surging demand for trucks following German unification - underpins earlier group forecasts that turnover and profits for the group will be maintained this year. This is despite lower orders in other group operating sectors such as printing and industrial equipment. The truck subsidiary itself earned DM159m net of tax last year, up from DM147m. The company's sharpest growth in percentage terms is coming from buses rather than trucks. Bus output has more than doubled over the past two fiscal years, to 1,325 units, and demand from the east German states - where MAN already claims 40 per cent of the bus market - is expected to help sustain the momentum. Mr Lochte said he expected bus turnover to increase by a further 35 per cent in the current fiscal year. MAN has recently completed the Pounds 20m (Dollars 35.4m) purchase of MAN Truck &amp; Bus UK - the UK importer and distributor of MAN trucks - from the Lonrho group. The group plans to invest 'some tens of millions of Deutschemarks' in its own dealerships in the UK in the hope of doubling UK market share, to between 8 and 9 per cent, within the next five years.</p>

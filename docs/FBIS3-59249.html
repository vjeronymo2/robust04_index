These will take place on  21-22 February and from 25 to 28 February (thus including  Saturday and Sunday), with the possibility of a prolongation to  beginning-March "by stopping the clock." Each session will  comprise separate meetings with each of the four candidate  countries: Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. In principle,  negotiations should end with the four candidates at the same  time.    For its part, the European Commission said that it proposed  completing drawing up the draft "joint positions" under its  competency this week (including the supplements relating to  agriculture), so that the Council is in possession of all the  texts. The budgetary aspects (participation by the candidate  countries in common expenses) will, however, not be included in  this package. It is, moreover, worth mentioning that:     -  Greek  Secretary General for European Affairs Yannos Kranidiotis  confirmed that Greece had asked that the future financing of the  Arctic regions under regional policy be the subject of an ad hoc  fund. This request is said to be supported by the so-called  cohesion countries (Spain, Portugal, Ireland). According to the  current rules, only those regions where per capita income is  less than 75 percent of the Community average can benefit from  funding under objective n.1 of regional policy; however, this is  not the case for the Arctic regions in the candidate countries,  whence the need for an ad hoc fund;    -  Finnish Prime Minister Esko  Aho, having met European Commissioner Hans van den Broek,  reaffirmed that his country regarded as essential keeping  subsidies for its farmers throughout the territory. Regarding  this, Finland rejects the Commission's proposal (which is not  yet a "joint position" by the Twelve): According to Mr. Aho (who  then went on to France and Spain) his position is finding  increasing understanding among member states and he had "reason  to believe" that the Commission itself would revise its  position;    -  Mr. Kranidiotis and Mr. Van den Broek confirmed that  the state of negotiations was not uniform: Norway in particular  is behind. Whatever, Mr. Van den Broek told MEPs [members of  European Parliament], it is up to the candidate countries  themselves to decide on breaking the parallelism for closing  negotiations.    The text of the agreements will not be available in March,  and Van den Broek urges MEPs to consider the possibility of  beginning the examination procedures on the basis of a  comprehensive report.    Speaking to the European Parliament's Committee on External  Economic Relations, Commissioner Van den Broek declared that,  whatever happened, the texts of the agreements would not be  available at the beginning of March. It involves around 10,000  pages to be drawn up in 9 languages; even if negotiations end on  28 February, we shall need to wait for early May before having  all the texts at our disposal. He then urged the MEPs to  consider the possibility of starting the procedures (with a view  to an "assent" in the EP) as soon as negotiations ended, on the  basis of a comprehensive report from the Commission and Council,  it being understood that the assent would only come in May, when  all the texts were available. There is therefore no question of  asking Parliament to decide on the principle of accession as  suggested by some jurists; whatever the interpretation of  Article O of the Maastricht Treaty, it would be politically  unthinkable that the compulsory assent should not be based on  the complete and definitive results of negotiations.</p>

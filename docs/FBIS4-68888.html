			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Burkov, chairman of the Duma </F> Committee on Property, Privatization, and Economic Activity, by  Vladimir Chernyshev; place and date not given: "Parliamentary  Hearings. An Intelligent Law Is Not Born in a Hurry"]    [Text] The parliamentary hearings on the course of  privatization conducted recently in the state Duma confirmed:  The State Committee on the Administration of State Property of  the Russian Federation will continue its work "outside laws."  And the esteemed department does not wish to burden itself with  developing drafts of them. The victorious reports about  privatization encompassing all of Russia, the triumphant news  conferences and the corresponding publications are intended to  give the appearance of well-being. And this is against a  background of an almost total lack of the legislative base  necessary for destatization.    But when will there be viable Russian laws protecting  property owners from the omnipotence and arbitrariness of the  bureaucracy. And finally, how did the hearings that were  conducted go? With these questions I "attacked" the chairman of  the Duma Committee on Property, Privatization, and Economic  Activity, Sergey Burkov. And here is the answer I heard:    [Burkov] There were extremely stormy and lengthy debates.  For  two days they discussed the results of the first stage of  privatization, the concept of the state program for  privatization of state and municipal enterprises, and also  problems of administration of state property. Today the process  is regulated basically by presidential edicts, decrees of the  Government of the Russian Federation, and directives from the  State Committee on the Administration of State Property.  Frequently they contradict one another, which is taken advantage  of by people who want to get rich quick. The process of  privatization must be placed on a stable legislative-legal  foundation.    [Chernyshev] If I have understood you correctly, it will be  necessary to place the appropriate legal base under the  practical actions of the executive organs of power.    [Burkov] Action without laws or outside of laws is  arbitrariness. It is typical of totalitarian, antidemocratic  regimes. In Russia it is time to create a rule-of-law state. The  preconditions for this are established in the constitution of  the Russian Federation. The deputies are trying to determine  clear-cut and distinct contours of the revival of the Russian  economy and imbue it with a dynamic, highly effective nature.  Every Russian citizen must stand firmly on his two feet. But now  they do not feel that there is solid ground underneath their  feet.    [Chernyshev] How did participants in the hearings evaluate  the report from the chairman of the State Committee on the  Administration of State Property, Anatoliy Chubays?    [Burkov] The report of the State Committee on the  Administration of State Property mentioned quantitative  successes above all. As of the present day up to 70 percent of  the objects of small-scale privatization have been placed in the  hands of private owners. On the basis of medium-sized and large  enterprises about 12,000 joint-stock companies have been  created. The voucher stage is being completed. The main thing  now is the qualitative content of the process, its coordination  with Russia's long-term interests, its revival, and the raising  of the level of well-being of Russian citizens. But the deputies  still have not received a clear picture.    As we know, in spite of the fact that even profitable  enterprises are being privatized, the budgets at all levels are  failing to receive a considerable share of their revenues. The  standard of living of the population is declining and the  economy is faltering. Much of the confusion and many complaints  have been caused by the existing and clearly too low assessment  of the value of the privatized property. This allows all kinds  of "nearly privatized" fly-by-night firms to buy up considerable  amounts of national wealth for token sums.    Tendencies toward artificial separation of large  technological conglomerates into autonomous units have been  discovered. For example, pressure on the collectives "from  above" has evoked a sharply negative reaction at the Nizhniy  Novgorod automotive plant, the Chebarkul metallurgical plant,  and in the collectives of many other complexes that have been  created and are functioning successfully as a unified whole.    The Duma quite pointedly raises questions of developing  mechanisms on the administration of state property, restriction  of the authority of the owner among organs of state power, and  effective administration of state shares.    The first stage of privatization has taken place. What next?  Unfortunately, the Government of the Russian Federation has not  yet submitted the corresponding draft laws.    [Chernyshev] Do you have any kind of information about their  content?    [Burkov] I cannot answer that until the draft laws have been  submitted. But any civilized state must protect the rights of  its citizens. It is extremely necessary, for example, to have  strict state control over the activity particularly of check  investment funds, and they must be audited continuously.    The activity of "Technical Progress," "Oil-Diamonds-Invest,"  and certain other structures, which evoked a storm of  indignation, could disrupt the process from within. Whom are  firms like these "investing in"--the domestic economy, the West,  or their own pocketbooks? Unfortunately, privatization has  brought about cases of abuse from the organs and workers of the  State Committee on the Administration of State Property  themselves, especially in the localities. The deputies are  afraid that this mass of lawlessness could become critical. It  is even being said openly that because of the corruption,  impoverishment of the people, and unemployment there could be a  social explosion. The legislators intend to clear the way for  creative movement.    [Chernyshev] And how do you envision this path?    [Burkov] Dialogue, interaction, accord. Like the majority of  deputies, I am convinced that the reforms that are being  conducted must be coordinated with the entire order of public  life and the Russian national character. This is the path of  relying on our own forces, open and equal cooperation,  harmonization of public life, and gradual formation of a market  mentality. A certain "grab it" ideology has taken over now. We  need new concepts, a new economic philosophy, the center of  which is the working man.    Our committee recommended that the Government of the Russian  Federation develop and submit to the Duma in the form of draft  laws an integrated concept of privatization, the development of  diverse forms of ownership, and a program for the corresponding  actions. All segments of the population and not just individual  parts or groups of it must be drawn into the movement toward a  civilized market.    Alas, the executive power is still not letting go of the  worst traditions of the command-administrative bureaucracy.  Thus, for example, according to a schedule coordinated with the  Government of the Russian Federation our committee was to have  received a number of draft laws as early as March, but they are  still not ready. As we know, the procedures for the work of the  state Duma on draft laws take no less than two months. If the  documents are submitted "for a vote" the deputies will be unable  not only to study the documents but even to read them. Are some  people really still living in those good old days when the  entire hall "unanimously" raised their hands? What kind of  democracy or profound and well-considered discussion can there  be then? Such relations not only do not correspond to the  constitution of the Russian Federation but also lead to conflict  among the branches of power and a continuation of the situation  of lawlessness.    [Chernyshev] And what laws do the real proprietors need?    [Burkov] They need laws that reinforce their creative energy  and develop the market and democratic process. I am speaking  about drafts of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, the  package of laws "On Joint-Stock Companies," "On the State  Enterprise," "On the Mortgage," "On Changes and Additions to the  Law `On Insolvency (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises,'" "On  Administration of State Property," "On Securities and Stock  Exchanges," "On Trustee Property (Trust)," "On  Financial-Industrial Groups and Holding Companies," and possibly  certain others. As one can easily understand, the laws must be  adopted in packages, that is, one law cannot exist without  another. Moreover, the package of laws must be formed for a  specific state privatization program. And this is what we do not  have.    [Chernyshev] Obviously it would be more reasonable to think  about the path we have travelled and not rush forward recklessly.    [Burkov] Naturally. After all, even the deputies are asking  the question--to what extent is privatization economically  expedient? But we do not have a complete picture of where  Russia's economy has arrived as a result of privatization. There  is no register of state property. What proprietor can allow  himself that? We do not even have an integrated set of  statistics rather than individual ones on the financial  condition of state and privatized enterprises. It is impossible  to make any calculations.    I emphasize that the directives of the State Committee on  Administration of State Property and other such acts are not the  law. Therefore we need laws that protect the rights of the owner  and regulate the privatization process. Nothing else is allowed  in civilized rule-of-law states.    [Chernyshev] It seems to me that such laws should have  already existed.    [Burkov] I hope that the arrears in legislative work caused  by certain factors will still recede into the past. In any case  our committee is aiming toward profound  prognosticatory-analytical and at the same time operational work.    The only reliable compass in this is high quality of  domestic  legislation in the name of the revival of Russia and respect for  the dignity and individuality of each Russian.    [Chernyshev] So our editorial office can get on the "hot  line" where the readers can not only share what is bothering  them but also make constructive proposals?    [Burkov] In any case, when developing decisions we will rely  on the most diverse opinions of ordinary people, experts, and  specialists. The extensive reader mail, the results of public  opinion polls, expert assessments, and other channels of  feedback can increase the "reserve of durability" of future laws.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   For those wishing to share their thoughts, observations, and  proposals we give the "hot line" number of the editorial office:  8 (095) 257-29-17.</p>

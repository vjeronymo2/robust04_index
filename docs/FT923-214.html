			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / North campaigns to keep aid status ALL OF the 82 greenfield inward investment projects won by businesses in north-east England and Cumbria since 1987 have settled in 'assisted areas', a delegation from the regional regeneration body told Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, yesterday. The body, the Northern Development Company, supports the case for the region's 11 assisted areas to retain their status. It said the government's regional industrial incentives were vital for the continuation of economic regeneration in the north. The development company said that the regional policy map, at present under review by the government, should be extended to include parts of the north-east coal areas that are facing more pit closures. It also said the Copeland and Barrow districts of Cumbria should be included, having borne the brunt of heavy job losses at the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing site and VSEL, the builder of Trident submarines. Expected job losses in the offshore industry, which employs 20,000 people regionally, should also be considered, the company argued. Today is the closing date for submissions to the government on its review, which it has indicated is more likely to shrink than to expand the assisted-areas map. The new map should be published early next year after consultation with the European Commission. The company's 15-page lobbying document presented to Mr Sainsbury says assisted-area designation should respond to long-term structural unemployment, not short-term trade cycle fluctuations - an allusion to areas of southern England recently suffering from rising joblessness and now competing for assisted-area status. The NDC said the north region, covering north-east England and Cumbria, has suffered from structural unemployment for 60 years. Since 1973 it has had the highest regional unemployment rate in Britain, even though since early 1985 it has won Pounds 2.8bn of inward investment, creating or safeguarding about 34,650 jobs. Of the 82 new investments from overseas into the region between 1987 and 1991, 69 went to 'development areas' and 13 to the 'intermediate areas', which receive less aid. Of all 202 projects in the region by overseas companies in that period, including joint ventures, acquisitions and expansions, all but nine were in assisted areas.</p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Deadlocked OECD names stand-in chief The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has papered over an increasingly serious rift between its European and non-European members by naming the ambassador of Sweden as its acting head for the next two months. After spending most of the past three days vainly trying to resolve the deadlock between rival French and Canadian candidates, the envoys of the 25-nation organisation yesterday called on the services of one of their number, Mr Staffan Sohlman of Sweden. He will act as secretary general until November 30, if before then they remain unable to agree a successor to Mr Jean-Claude Paye, whose term ended at midnight on Thursday. The sucession crisis therefore continues in this staid governmental think-tank, whose solid economic output generates interest but never drama and which takes decisions by consensus. The two main candidates - Mr Paye, the Frenchman who has served as secretary general for the past 10 years, and Mr Donald Johnston, a former Canadian minister - would appear to have virtually knocked each other out. Equally, however, it might prove hard for either to leave the field, given the strength of governmental feeling now ranged behind them. The French foreign ministry indicated last night that Mr Paye was still a candidate, drawing hope from what it called 'an indicative vote' in the OECD council that was said to have given the Frenchman twice as many votes as the Canadian. The split was along geographical lines, with most European envoys speaking up for Mr Paye and non-Europeans for Mr Johnston. But the US, which effectively leads the Johnston camp, said last night it stuck to its position that 10 years was enough for Mr Paye, and that the time had come for a non-European to lead the organisation. An ambassador representing a government in the Johnston camp admitted last night that 'the French have pulled out all the stops' for Mr Paye, but said it was nonsense for the French to characterise soundings in the Council as anything resembling a vote which was impossible under OECD rules. The prospect of contined deadlock marginally increases the chances of the third declared candidate, Lord Lawson, the former UK chancellor of the exchequer, who has offered himself as a compromise candidate.</p>

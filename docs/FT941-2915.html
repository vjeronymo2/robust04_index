			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / A mirage on the left The fact has to be faced: Mr John Smith may be our next prime minister. He could step into No 10 Downing Street in, say, April 1996. That is just two tax increases away. Peer into the crystal. The Scottish ascendancy triumphs, give or take an English name or two. Chancellor - Gordon Brown. Home secretary - Tony Blair. Foreign secretary - Jack Cunningham. Jack who? Never mind, it could be someone else. This startling vision, this electrifying anticipation, is in the political air. It could be a mirage. Yet no matter how much you shake your head, the notion that the Conservatives are approaching the end of their run will not be dispelled. The opinion polls, which so misled us in April 1992, have put Labour at 20 to 25 points ahead and kept it there. Their failure two years ago may not wholly invalidate their methods. Mr Smith's party is scoring well in traditional areas of Tory strength, such as management of the economy, taxation, and law and order. More to the point, we know without benefit of poll results that the Conservatives are no longer trusted. 'Nobody believes a word we say,' one of their senior advisers complained the other day. We do have a lamentable lack of faith, we who have been gulled, gulled and gulled again. Most voters now appear to believe that Mr John Major's government will be thrown out next time. Yet where they place their crosses is more telling than what they tell interviewers. It is a fair assumption that the Conservatives will lose ground in the forthcoming by-elections, not to mention the local elections in May and the European elections in June. If they do it will be difficult to resist the conclusion that Mr Major is unlikely to remain in office until the end of the century, as I once imagined he might. The possibility that Labour will come back has been noted in Washington. When he visited the American capital last week Mr Brown and entourage were received by luminaries of the administration's economic team. A Labour party adviser was welcomed into the White House and shown around by the young heroes of Little Rock. It may be too much to suggest the president's political strategists will collude with Mr Smith's associates, in retaliation for the support given by the Conservatives to President Bush. Yet there is a political rapport be-tween important individuals in the two parties that may pay divi-dends - unless President Bill Clinton is brought into irretrievable disrepute by the Whitewater affair. The US Democrats are looking with interest at Mr Smith and, perhaps more particularly, at Mr Rudolf Scharping, the German Social Democratic party leader. If Mr Scharping joins, or heads, the German government after the election in October, Mr Smith should gain from the ensuing sense of momentum, the feeling that the reformed left in northern Europe is on its way. It would be imprudent to allow this increasingly common fancy to determine Labour's political strategy. The bubble could so easily burst. There is no law that requires an election before April 1997. Opinion poll leads can melt away in an afternoon. Anything can happen in a period as long as 37 months. Mr Smith's slow-motion repositioning of his party is the most dangerous strategy he could have chosen. It leaves him vulnerable to a long, shallow, recovery of Conservative fortunes, capped by a surprise cut in taxation, a snap election during a period of optimism about the economy, and a campaign during which Labour's package of proposals, presented very late in the day, is easily dismissed. The Labour leader clearly sees matters differently. Solid repositioning work is being done. Mr Tony Blair would make an excellent Conservative home secretary. His law and order speeches are more convincing than those of Mr Michael Howard, the present incumbent. They include an appeal to both reason and emotion. Mr John Prescott has been allowed to persuade the party that private investors should be persuaded to enter joint agreements with public authorities to finance specified projects. Mr Donald Dewar has distanced Labour from its previous, impossibly costly, pledges to increase state pensions in line with prices. His recent speech on this subject was thoughtful and pragmatic. He even managed to propose a way of introducing targeted benefits while affecting that there would be no means test involved. The trick is to top up pensions from three sources - state, private and occupational - to create a minimum retirement income at minimum cost. Each of these is an instance of the steady build-up of reassurance that Labour needs. The proposition that the people's party may not be so bad after all has to be sold to a large number of separate constituencies, one by one. Mr Smith has put some markers down indicating what Labour would actually do, most notably in the field of constitutional reform. He would contemplate proportional representation only if Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats held a pistol to his head, but he is committed to a Scottish assembly. A bill of rights and a freedom of information bill could be introduced quickly and at no financial cost. A first step might be taken towards reform of the House of Lords, probably by excluding hereditary peers from the vote. A surprising number of appointed Tory lordships would support such a move today if Mr Major had the wit to propose it. Mr Smith's supporters argue that, apart from maintaining the attack on the government, little more need be done than carry on with incremental changes in stance like those listed above. From Labour's point of view, they say, there is no alternative to lying low while the Tories continue to destroy themselves. Any other strategy comes up against questions that are impossible to answer - when will the election come? who will be prime minister at the time? will the Conservatives be united? what will they have on offer? It is not good enough. The imperfections of the government combined with the uninspiring nature of the principal opposition party have contributed to a national mood of political despondency. All politicians seem equally reprehensible. Nothing on offer makes the heart beat faster. A new Labour paper promising to control public spending is entitled 'trust and hope'. British voters have lost trust. They seek in vain for a source of hope.</p>

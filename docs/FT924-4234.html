			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Letter: Reform of EC farm subsidy system would lift economies Sir, The best way to revive the European economy, reduce inflation and help the poor would be to change the Common Agricultural Policy from a price support system to one based upon deficiency payments related to the difference between world market prices and intervention prices. This was the British system of agricultural subsidy before joining the Common Market. The present CAP costs the average family Pounds 12 a week in artificial prices plus taxes to subsidise exports of surpluses. Abolishing the CAP, so reducing food prices, would be equivalent to a benefit of Pounds 12 a week helping the poor and families most because they spend a greater proportion of their income on food. Farm support would be paid directly to farmers but limited to the level of deliveries made by each farmer in previous years under the CAP so that any extra production could only be sold at world price. Thus, farm outputs would be related to the market price not the intervention price. There would be savings in the cost of bureaucracy besides eliminating the storage and sale of surpluses. The objections of other agricultural countries to European farm subsidies would be removed because export subsidies would be ended. Some might think it not unreasonable that each country should pay the subsidy claimed by its farmers instead of Britain subsidising foreign farmers as at present. Are our politicians capable of seizing this chance which has only occurred because of the recession and disarray of the CAP? Patrick O'Brien, 2 Evening Glade, Ferndown, Dorset BH22 8DB</p>

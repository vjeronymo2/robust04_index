			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Survey of West Bengal (6): City of night, city of joy - Calcutta hopes to regain its lost grandeur Rudyard Kipling termed it the necropolis of 'dreadful night'. VS Naipaul, the author and Rajiv Gandhi, the former Indian prime minister, declared the city was dead or dying. Back in the 1950s, Time, the US magazine, dubbed it the City of Pestilence. Calcutta-bashing has been an international free-for-all for decades now, but the city has had its defenders as well. Satyajit Ray, the renowned film-maker, was a proud son of Calcutta, and Dominique Lapierre called it 'The City of Joy,' recognising the soul beneath its deprivation and decay. And Calcutta is the home of Mother Teresa, who has shone like a beacon of hope for the desperate. 'Calcutta is much-maligned, but it is also deeply loved,' says Mrinal Sen, a noted film-maker. For the first-time visitor, it is difficult to ignore the dirt, decay and abject poverty. Once the gateway to the east and the proud capital of British India, Calcutta is today a byword for pollution and overcrowding. The flight of industry in the mid-1960s after the militant Naxalite movement reared its head, and the waves of refugees from bordering countries and states have compounded the city's problems. For most of the past 16 years, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) government has concentrated on the betterment of rural West Bengal, while neglecting Calcutta. Power cuts have been incessant, telephones never worked, and traversing Calcutta's overcrowded potholed roads could be a nightmare. But the last two years have seen the end of the power shortage, and the telephone service has improved. The city boasts a second bridge - the ultra-modern Vidyasagar Setu - over the River Hooghly, and a new metro that has some claim to be among the best-maintained in the world. Calcutta, which celebrated its tercentenary in 1989, epitomised the best and the worst of British rule, and the colonial legacy is still plain to see. Recently, Calcuttans protested loudly when their rusty, creaking tramcars were to be phased out. The city's residents are justifiably proud of their metro, but do not want to lose the archaic tramway. Stubbornly, they believe that Calcutta will some day regain its lost grandeur and dignity. This is a city of contradictions and paradox, and the roots of its split personality are to be found in history. In the mid-18th century, Robert Clive, the most celebrated of British viceroys to India, described Calcutta as a 'city of palaces' but also talked of the squalor of the surrounding 'native towns'. Two hundred years later, the city has been unable to throw off the vestiges of the Raj - its beautiful colonial buildings are grimy and crumbling, but they lend the city their unmistakable grandeur, a grim reminder of better days. Even after Delhi became the capital of the British Empire in India, Calcutta, with its hinterland rich in tea, jute and coal, and over 80 per cent of the country's industry, retained a pre-eminent position. The British sahibs, executives in the big companies that survived partition, replaced the bureaucrats - even today, the club culture is more evident here than in any other Indian city. Calcutta bore the brunt of the trauma of partition, with thousands of Hindu refugees flooding in from east Pakistan. The influx recurred in the early 1970s with the formation of Bangladesh. Migrant labour poured in from Bihar and other neighbouring states to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by industry. Though migration from neighbouring states continues to be high, the Left Front government's poverty alleviation programmes and rural employment generation schemes have largely stemmed the influx from within West Bengal. With the downslide of industry, the flight of Calcutta's British entrepreneurial base, and the lack of new investment, the city no longer seemed able to contain poverty to its slums - it spilled onto the congested thoroughfares, and make-shift dwellings sprang up on pavements and even encroached onto the roads. Over 20 per cent of the city's 12m people, it is estimated, now live in wretched and inhuman conditions, devoid of basic civic amenities. For its 300th birthday, the government promised a 'facelift' for the city, but it amounted to no more than administering a 'Band-Aid for a terminal illness,' as one critic has put it. A new auditorium, archives and a library were built, and some 19 parks were cleaned up. Executives say that colleagues from overseas still prefer to meet them in Bombay or Delhi rather than risk a trip to Calcutta. Until a month ago, there were no regular international flights, but British Airways and KLM have just relaunched links to Calcutta, after a gap of several years. Mr Jyoti Basu, the West Bengal chief minister, admitted to businessmen in August last year that roads in Calcutta and the rest of West Bengal needed urgent attention. The urban development department, he said, had initiated several projects to solve these problems, but lack of funds continued to be a problem. In its memorandum to the Finance Commission, a central body which allocates funds to the states, West Bengal's government urged it to grant extra funds. 'The Calcutta-Howrah metropolitan area should not be viewed only in terms of West Bengal,' it said. 'Its eminence as one of the most important industrial, commercial and exporting centres of the country transcends the limits of the state and its contribution to the national economy should be assessed on the basis of these considerations.' The state government plans to ask large industrial houses to help rebuild and maintain sections of Calcutta's roadways, which are in a dreadful condition. Yet at the same time, it hopes to promote tourism, offering financial incentives to those who invest in hotels, motels, luxury transport and water sports facilities. Under one scheme, the government will lease out nine British-style tourist lodges to the private sector for management, and develop a new beach resort at Sankarpur, 180 kilometres from Calcutta. Other schemes include the development of river sport resorts and a luxury liner on the River Ganga, and a series of highway motels and roadside facilities. The business houses realise they will have to pitch in if the city of Calcutta is to be rejuvenated. In 1991, the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, representing a cross-section of multinational and Indian business houses, banks and trade, launched 'Pride and Glory', a son-et-lumiere show of Calcutta's history. Within the sprawling white marble Victoria Memorial at the city's heart, the show augments the Chamber's 'Calcutta I Care' campaign. Nevertheless, Calcutta is perhaps one of the world's most uninviting cities for the foreign investor, and the state government is acutely conscious of this as it strives to attract foreign investment. A publication of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce admits that the ordeal may begin at Calcutta airport, where the visitor is likely to 'get a shock  .. to be lost in chaotic road and traffic conditions  .. he would be psychologically put off immediately and decide to leave the city as quickly as possible.'</p>

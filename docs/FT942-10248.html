			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: Jungheinrich's profits fall Jungheinrich, the Hamburg- based lift truck producer, yesterday announced a sharp fall in group net profits to DM8.1m (Dollars 5.06m) last year from DM54.3m in 1992, writes Andrew Baxter. The group which also has property interests, said it is cutting its 1993 dividend per ordinary share from DM7 to DM3, while the payout on preference shares was cut from DM8 to DM4. The group said the 'toughest ever post-war year for west European lift-truck producers' had left its mark, but the company had retained its strong poition worldwide. Group sales fell from DM1.6bn to DM1.4bn, and group income from ordinary activities fell from DM90m to DM34.5m. The company said 1993 distributable profit was DM10.2m. The 1992 figure was not available. Jungheinrich, which produces mainly at its large Hamburg plant and also buys in lift trucks, said it expected a slight improvement in earnings this year, with group sales recovering to about DM1.6bn.</p>

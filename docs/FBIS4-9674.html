			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 29 Mar (NOTIMEX) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto  Duran-Ballen denied today that the United States had pressured  Ecuador to give its support -- at the last minute -- to Colombia  to gain the OAS secretary general post. Duran-Ballen said at a  news conference at Mariscal Sucre Air Base in Quito that it was  decided at the last minute to support President Cesar Gaviria,  given the Ecuadoran people's clamor.    The president arrived last night in Guayaquil, Ecuador, from  Washington, concluding a 16-day tour during which he also  visited Tokyo and Beijing. It was not until today that he flew  to Quito.    He discussed the issue broadly in an attempt to convince the  public of the reasons that motivated his sudden change of mind  to vote for Colombia -- despite the previous commitment made to  support Costa Rica. Duran-Ballen stressed -- visibly annoyed --  that he had not been pressured by the United States to "change"  the vote committed to Bernd Niehaus, the Costa Rican foreign  minister. He denied local media reports that he had changed his  vote after meeting, during his stay in Washington, with  Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant secretary of state for  inter-American affairs.    The president defended the decision as serious Ecuadoran  foreign policy and assured that in the OAS elections he made a  decision based on "his own criteria and without any external  influence." He explained that Foreign Minister Diego Paredes,  who according to the opposition should resign for being  incompetent, has his trust and will remain in his post, as he is  doing a "magnificent job." Duran-Ballen added that in light of  Cesar Gaviria's candidacy and the prestige he had gained leading  his government "we ended up changing Ecuador's position."    The local media and the opposition censured the president  and  Foreign Minister Diego Paredes for annulling four times its  support to Costa Rica before deciding to vote for Colombia, due  to alleged U.S. pressure.    Duran-Ballen, 72, arrived last night in Ecuador ending a  16-day absence. He was on a working tour to Japan, China, and  on a private visit to the United States where he underwent a  routine medical checkup.    The plane that transported Duran-Ballen and his delegation  from the United States was not able to land last night in Quito  due to bad weather and was forced to divert to Guayaquil. The  president spent the night in Guayaquil and this morning returned  to the Ecuadoran capital.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Markets Report: France trims rates The Bank of France yesterday trimmed its intervention rate by 10 basis points to 6.10 per cent, confirming the likely downward trend of official European interest rates, writes Philip Gawith. The rate-cut, which surprised observers, was in stark contrast to the interest rate pessimism in European bond and futures markets. By late afternoon the December short sterling and D-Mark interest rate futures on LIFFE had fallen by 20 and 22 points respectively, indicating the market view that interest rates are likely to rise over the remainder of the year. Currency markets initially remained immune from this volatility, but the dollar weakened sharply in the afternoon on speculation of heavy hedge fund selling. The French franc remained firm after yesterday's cut in rates. It closed in London at FFr3.397 to the D-Mark from FFr3.398 on Wednesday. The cut in the intervention rate - the key instrument used by the BOF to influence monetary policy - was the first move in monetary policy by the BOF's monetary council since its formation last month. The timing surprised most observers who had expected the BOF to wait for the Bundesbank to cut its repo rate before acting. As with last week's cut in the German discount rate, the BOF appeared more concerned to send a signal to the market about the future direction of rates, than to effect any significant easing in policy. Ms Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW, commented: 'The BOF was probably quite market sensitive. It wanted to reassure the market that its lack of action after last week's Bundesbank easing did not mean they wouldn't move at all.' The BOF also appears to have struck a balance between the conflicting imperatives of wanting to show its independence and tracking the D-Mark - a key component of its monetary policy. The French intervention rate remains 10 basis points above the German repo rate of 6 per cent and some commentators stressed that this shows the BOF's intention not to put pressure on the franc by pushing French rates below German rates. The dollar finished slightly stronger against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM1.7306 from DM1.7279 on Wednesday. It later fell sharply in New York against both the yen and the dollar and was trading yesterday evening at Y105 and DM1.7150. It closed a third of a cent weaker at Dollars 1.4796 against sterling and was slightly down compared to the yen, finishing at Y105.350 from Y105.525 on Wednesday. Earlier in the day there had been a flurry of activity after the release of US durable goods orders. The headline figure of a 3.7 per cent increase in January durable goods orders, compared to a market forecast of 0.8 per cent, initially fuelled talk of another possible US monetary tightening. Later, however, this figure was largely discounted when it was discovered that the figures were heavily influenced by airline orders. Stripped of the transport factor, the rise was only 0.3 per cent. Mr Chris Turner, currency strategist at BZW, noted that it was the sixth consecutive rise in a volatile series and hence could be considered a 'fairly strong number'. The fact that unfilled orders had also risen was another bullish piece of data. Mr Brian Martin, senior economist at Citibank, said he didn't believe the figures gave any cause for concern about the strength of the US recovery and he forecast 2.5-3 per cent growth for the US economy this year. Traders said the weaker dollar was apparently the product of heavy dollar sales by the hedge funds which took the opportunity to sell heavily into dollar strength when the US currency rose initially after the release of the durable goods figures. With hedge funds apparently having suffered heavy losses recently on the yen and in bond markets, analysts speculated that they were taking profits wherever they could be found. Others said weakness in the US stock and bond markets had fuelled sale of dollars. In theory the fears of higher US interest rates, which have unnerved leading equity and bond markets, should be dollar positive. The D-Mark finished weaker in Europe yesterday on fears of industrial unrest in the engineering sector, concerns about another possible easing of policy and worries about political instability in Russia. Sentiment was initially undermined by reports that the Russian parliament had voted to offer amnesty to some of President Yeltsin's opponents. Rumours about a possible coup in Russia also hit the D-Mark. The Bank of England provided Pounds 330m of late assistance to UK money markets bringing total help for day to Pounds 2.345bn, compared to a revised liquidity shortage of Pounds 2.4bn. The large shortage is evidence that the Bank of England's recently introduced twice-monthly repo facility - introduced to supplement its daily money market operations - has yet to bed down properly. The aim of the new facility is to reduce the daily shortage so that the Bank can more easily influence money market rates.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the initial and still incomplete  results of the self-government elections held yesterday, the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has won in Bedzin, Bydgoszcz,  Czestochowa, Kielce, Konin, Koszalin, Legnica, Lodz, Olsztyn,  Plock, Suwalki, Walbrzych, and Wloclawek.    In Lublin, almost the same number of votes was received by  candidates of the SLD, the center-right, and the Freedom Union  [UW].    In Warsaw, victory went to a coalition of Freedom Union, the  Conservative Party, and the Peasant-Christian Party; in Gdansk,  Gdynia, Krakow, and Wroclaw to the Freedom Union. The  center-right received the greatest number of votes in Bialystok,  Chorzow, Lomza, Przemysl, Rzeszow, and Torun.    The turnout was low--between 25 and 40 percent. The official  results of the self-government elections should be known on  Friday, State Electoral Commission Secretary Kazimierz Czaplicki  told this station today.</p>

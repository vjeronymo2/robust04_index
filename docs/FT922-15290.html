			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television When the state executes people for murder ('Pre-meditated killing is wrong and so, after much deliberation, we are going to kill you'), mistakes will be made and innocent people put to death. That alone is reason to abjure capital punishment, as the notorious A6 murder case demonstrates. True Stories begins a new series (10.00 C4) by reconsidering the execution of James Hanratty for the murder of Michael Gregsten in 1962. Nobody who has read Paul Foot's excellent book 'Who Killed Hanratty?' will need convincing, but it is as well to keep reminding ourselves that we, society, hanged the wrong man. Another series which has done outstanding work in revealing miscarriages of justice, and not only in the courts, is Taking Liberties, which returns to BBC2 (8.00). Today David Jessel reports on the dangers of general anaesthetics at the dentist's. There have been warnings, it seems, for 25 years, yet people, mostly young, go on dying. Also back with a fresh batch is Harry Enfield's Television Programme (9.00 BBC2), the series in which the 'Loadsamoney' comedian has established a whole raft of new comedy characters.</p>

He was reacting to speculation that a group of  Boereparliament members who supported AVF Gen Constand Viljoen's  registration of the Freedom Front party would indeed submit a  candidates list, contrary to an AVF transitional representative  assembly decision last Saturday.    Speaking on Radio 702 on Tuesday, Prof Boshoff said the  group  was still considering whether to submit such a list, and the  issue was still being negotiated. "I am convinced an effort  should be made to resolve the deadlock," Prof Boshoff said. "We  therefore think we should continue with negotiations in own  ranks to establish whether we should not participate in the  election. At this moment no final decision has been made and  the matter is still being discussed."    Every effort should be made to prevent another split in  Afrikaner ranks, but Prof Boshoff thought the main issue was  whether it was possible to break the deadlock.    Last Saturday the AVF's transitional representative assembly  voted by 73 votes to 20 to boycott the election unless it was  granted a volkstaat [homeland].</p>

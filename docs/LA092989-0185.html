			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> $60,000 IN NEW GRAND PRIX FINES ISSUED;  </P> <P> WEEK'S TOTAL HITS $130,000 AS CONTROVERSY ACCELERATES IN SPAIN  </P> <P> Auto racing's international governing body fined world champion driver Ayrton  Senna $20,000 and officials of the Spanish Grand Prix $40,000 today for a total  of $130,000 in fines in the last week.  </P> <P> Senna, from Brazil, was fined for ignoring signals to stop practice, and race  organizers were fined for starting today's prequalifying session 30 minutes  late.  </P> <P> Announcement was made as a bitter dispute between Ferrari and McLaren still  raged over $50,000 in fines and a suspension from Sunday's race against Ferrari  driver Nigel Mansell of Britain. Two other drivers, Alain Prost of France and  Martin Brundle of Britain, were fined $10,000 each.  </P> <P> After last week's Portuguese Grand Prix, the International Federation of  Automobile Sports fined Mansell for ignoring black disqualification flags.  Mansell was disqualified for driving in reverse in the pits.  </P> <P> Brundle was penalized for driving too fast in the Estoril pit lane last  weekend, and Prost failed to attend a news conference.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Post Position  </P> <P> Despite the fine, Senna was back in business later today, clocking the fastest  time in preliminary practice for provisional pole position for Sunday's race.  </P> <P> Senna's hopes of recapturing the world championship dimmed after his  McLaren-Honda collided with Mansell's Ferrari in last week's race. In  qualifying for this race, he turned a 2.62-mile lap over the Jerez circuit in 1  minute, 21.855 seconds, or 115.27 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Second-fastest today was the Minardi-Ford of Italy's Pierluigi Martini in  1:22.243. Austria's Gerhard Berger had his scarlet Ferrari third fastest in  1:22.276.  </P> <P> Prost was fourth, Nelson Piquet of Brazil was fifth and Ivan Capelli was sixth.  </P> <P> Still, practice was overshadowed by the verbal battle between McLaren-Honda and  Ferrari.  </P> <P> McLaren team manager Ron Dennis brusquely denied Mansell's claims that McLaren  mechanics were partly responsible for his disqualification from the Portuguese  Grand Prix.  </P> <P> "I just don't buy this whole thing," Dennis said.  </P> <P> Mansell said he did not see the black flag and claimed that his view in the  lane was blocked by McLaren tires and other equipment.  </P></p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / UK Company News: A changing landscape in the race for space  -Tesco takes to the Metro line with its programme of 'compact' expansion It was Mr Archie Norman, Asda's chief executive, who first broke ranks with the UK's leading grocers to warn of leaner times ahead, but it took Tesco's chairman, Sir Ian MacLaurin, to change the food retailing landscape. His announcement yesterday spelt the end of the era of unbridled superstore expansion which he helped to usher in. The Tesco of the next few years will be a different animal from three years ago, when it launched a Pounds 585m rights issue to fund its aggressive opening programme. Then it regarded the ideal store size as 35,000 sq ft to 65,000 sq ft, and was celebrating the opening of its biggest-ever store, at 72,000 sq ft. Capital expenditure for the year to February 1991 was Pounds 925m, and Tesco said 'we continue to find a large number of opportunities to develop . . . stores on quality sites.' Contrast that with yesterday's assertion that 'it is widely understood that currently there is a diminishing number of profitable prime superstore sites available.' Tesco added that it had to safeguard its returns on investment in the light of growing pressure on margins. The admissions are significant. Some analysts speculated when market leader Sainsbury's launched its price-cutting programme in November that it might have a 'hidden agenda'. Having recognised the over-capacity in the industry, was it trying to force one or both of its main competitors to cut back their expansion programmes, by putting pressure on margins? Argyll and Tesco have indeed both responded. Argyll said last month it was cutting capital spending this year from Pounds 650m to Pounds 550m, and bowed to pressure to depreciate buildings over 40 years. However, as one analyst put it yesterday: 'Argyll opened the door, and Tesco charged through it.' On depreciation, Tesco is following Argyll's lead and depreciating buildings over 40 years. But it has also recognised that it paid 'premiums' for much of its land above its alternative use value, and decided to amortise those premiums over 25 years, leading to a total charge of Pounds 153m against profits this year. More significantly, it is cutting spending from Pounds 750m this year to a projected Pounds 450m to Pounds 500m in the year to February 1997. Floor space expansion will be cut back from 1.2m sq ft in 1991-92 to about 450,000 sq ft in 1996-97. Tesco also expects the average new store costs to shrink from Pounds 22m to Pounds 16m over three years. That reflects a shift away from out-of-town superstores towards the Metro city centre format, and the 'compact' superstore format of about 20,000 sq ft, aimed at market towns and city suburbs. Mr David Reid, finance director, said he expected of 20 projected openings in 1996-97, three or four would be Metros, seven or eight compact stores, and the balance - less than half - larger superstores. Tesco thinks there is scope for about 50 Metros - with nine planned by September. It admitted yesterday that it was looking at new trading formats, building on Tesco's existing strengths in selling 'grocery and grocery-related products'. It will also be expanding the Catteau chain in France by up to six stores a year, generally through organic growth. It claims not to have plans for further large acquisitions overseas at present. As UK expansion slows, more effort will go into maximising returns from existing space. Tesco insists there is scope for 'significant savings' in operating costs, which will then be reinvested in improving service to try to enhance customers' loyalty and persuade them to spend more. It claims some success in doing this already, through a combination of introducing new services such as pharmacies, photo-processing, dry cleaning and counter service for meat, trimming its prices, and introducing the Tesco Value line, which offers basic goods at prices which rival the discounters. Like-for-like sales for the first 20 weeks of the second half were up 4.5 per cent, which represented a 2.5 per cent gain in volume, after taking out inflation of 2 per cent - better than it has achieved for some years. The spotlight now shifts back to Sainsbury. It has been saying privately that it saw no need to depreciate, but analysts believe it now has little choice but to follow its rivals not only on that issue, but in calling a halt - or at least a slowdown - in the race for space.</p>

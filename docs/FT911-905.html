			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Webster to quit top CIA post MR WILLIAM Webster, director of the Central Intelligence Agency, announced his retirement yesterday, leaving President George Bush with a tricky decision on a successor. Mr Robert Gates, deputy national security adviser and a CIA veteran, is viewed as a front-runner. But a Gates nomination would be a gamble; he has already tried and failed to win the top job. In 1987 President Ronald Reagan nominated Mr Gates as CIA director to replace Mr William Casey, who many believe masterminded the Iran-Contra arms-for-hostages affair. Mr Gates, whose role in the affair remains murky, was forced to withdraw in the face of Senate opposition. Mr Webster, 67, a former FBI director, took Mr Gates' place and set about repairing some of the damage caused by the scandal. The president said yesterday he had brought 'an integrity, an effectiveness and an insight' to the job. However, Mr Webster was never a member of Mr Bush's inner circle. Moreover, the CIA under him has faced criticism for poor work ahead of the 1989 Panama invasion and for indifferent assessments of Soviet economic strength. The selection of a successor faces renewed controversy, thanks to recent reports that the Reagan campaign, working with CIA renegades, struck a deal with Iran to delay the release of US hostages until after the 1980 presidential election. Reports have also suggested that Mr Bush, who was Mr Reagan's running-mate in 1980, took part in a meeting with Iranian representatives in Paris to conclude the deal. Mr Bush yesterday repeated last week's rejection that he was involved - without specifically denying that a deal may have been struck. 'I can only say categorically that the allegations about me are grossly untrue, factually incorrect, bald-faced lies,' he said.</p>

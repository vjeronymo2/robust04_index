			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Santa Fe, 9 Jun (NA) -- The national Constituent  Assembly has approved the general terms of the internal  regulations jointly proposed by the PJ [Justicialist Party] and  the UCR [Radical Civic Union] guaranteeing the approval of the  Nucleus of Basic Coincidences for reforming the Constitution  that will be voted on as a single package.    The first key vote of the Assembly took place last night.  Representatives of the blocs who signed the Olivos Pact obtained  an important victory -- by 182 votes for and 68 against -- with  the approval of the internal regulations. Article 129 of those  regulations establish the vote on the 13 points included in  Article 2 of Law 23409 declaring the necessity of and  opportunity for the reform.    The Assembly immediately afterwards started to vote on the  144 articles of the regulations one by one. The process will  continue during today's session.    On 7 June, the Grand Front bloc announced it will withdraw  temporarily from the premises during the voting on Article 129,  while Modin [Movement for Independence and Dignity] and  provincial blocs will stay to vote against the article, even  during the article by article voting process.    The regulations were approved following eight days of  extensive debates, during which nearly 100 convention delegates  from the 17 blocs, more than just debating juridical matters,  indulged in a marathon of speeches on the legitimacy of the  Olivos Pact. Next week the Assembly will begin discussing  specific items.    The political debate reached a climax yesterday with the  speeches of the main bloc leaders (Raul Alfonsin of the UCR,  Augusto Alasino of the PJ, Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez of the Grand  Front, and Assembly President Eduardo Menem).    Senator Menem gave a heated defense of the Olivos Pact,  which  he characterized as "innovative," and assured the delegates that  he feels "even prouder" of having been one of the sponsors of  the agreement "between the popular political forces" than to be  seated in the Assembly.    Former President Raul Alfonsin, using a tone clearly  different from the climate of controversy involving the  Assembly, preferred to dip into political philosophy to argue in  favor of his bloc's position and uphold "Chacho" Alvarez and the  Grand Front's "positive attitude," which "grants legitimacy" to  the constitutional reform.    "Chacho" Alvarez spoke just before Alfonsin. He appealed to  the majority of Justicialist and Radical delegates' "common  sense" "to open up the package" and thus permit their  participation in the process "without insulting our  consciences." [passage omitted]    The Constituent Assembly will install the 10 commissions  established in the set of regulations next week. Five of these  commissions will be headed by the PJ, three by the UCR, one by  the Grand Front, and one by Modin. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / The Race for Congress: Incumbents to feel wrath of the voters - Office-holders will not be helped by party links FOR a short time this summer it seemed to many congressmen that the worst might be over; that the wind of hostility to all incumbent office-holders, whatever their party or distinction, might have blown itself out. That hope has gone. The wind is now blowing as strongly as ever and threatens to sweep dozens of incumbents out of office in today's polls. Democrats, in particular, can no longer cling to the coat-tails of their presidential nominee, Governor Bill Clinton, who had appeared at one point to be cruising to a landslide victory. The anti-incumbent sentiment that has fuelled the presidential candidacy of Mr Ross Perot, the independent Texas billionaire, is sweeping all before it. Only in the 89 open House seats and eight open Senate seats, where there is no incumbent to feel the voters' wrath, are party links expected to make much difference. 'The truth is there are no coat-tails for incumbents of either party this year. And the evidence we've seen in recent polls tells us that Perot voters clearly can't be counted as incumbent supporters,' says Mr Vic Fazio, chairman of the Democratic congressional campaign committee, who is himself facing a surprisingly tough challenge in California's third district. Mr Guy Vander Jagt, his counterpart at the National Republican congressional committee, believes there is a 20 to 30 percentage point drag on every incumbent. Mr Vander Jagt is well placed to know for he, along with well-entrenched members of Congress like Senator Alan Dixon of Illinois and Congresswoman Beverly Byron of Maryland, was eliminated in a party primary earlier this year. Roll Call, Congress's parish newspaper, suggested last week that House Speaker Tom Foley of Washington state and Congressman Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, who holds the US government's purse strings through his chairmanship of the House ways and means committee, might be at risk. Even Mr Jamie Whitten of Mississippi, who if re-elected will start his 52nd year of House service on Wednesday, is having to campaign seriously for the first time in two decades. Although many incumbents may face the guillotine, the party composition of both chambers is unlikely to change dramatically. Democrats say they expect to lose between 20 and 25 seats in the House, not enough to dent their 101-seat majority. Republican party managers officially come up with the same figure: a net gain of 25 seats. But some Republicans, who once hoped for a net gain of 50 seats, now fear they could pick up as few as five seats. In the 100-member Senate, where Republicans once believed they had a realistic chance of winning a majority, the Democrats seem strongly positioned to maintain their 57 to 43 edge, and could even take seats away from the Republicans. Despite the recession, spending on congressional races has risen dramatically this year. The Federal Election Commission reports that congressional candidates had spent a total of Dollars 380m (Pounds 233.1m) by October 14, Dollars 75m more than in 1990 and Dollars 71m more than in 1988. Some of this increase is because of the unusual double Senate election in California  - the biggest state and hence the most expensive to campaign in. Senators are usually elected for six years, with a third of the Senate up for re-election every two years. A second election will decide who fills the seat vacated by Mr Pete Wilson when he became governor of the state. But spending on House elections, which take place every two years, is up by 38 per cent at Dollars 233m, led by Mr Michael Huffington, a Republican millionaire who has spent Dollars 4.4m of his own money, and by Mr Richard Gephardt, House Democratic leader, who has spent Dollars 2.7m on his Missouri race. The scandal over the House's private bank earlier this year has encapsulated voters' irritation with their members. The bank provided informal and unpaid overdraft facilities to members, and those who used the service are, in many districts, having to battle opponents' charges of 'kiting', or cheque bouncing. If Mrs Mary Rose Oakar, a Democrat, loses her Ohio seat it will be almost entirely due to her 213 overdrawn cheques; the same may be true for Republican Bill Goodling in Pennsylvania, who had 430 overdrafts on the House bank. Overdraft attacks have followed former House members like Ms Barbara Boxer and Mr Les Aucoin into their Senate campaigns. Some members have bigger problems than a few overdrafts. Congressman Nick Mavroules of Massachusetts overdrew his account just once, but he has been indicted on federal bribery charges, while Senator John Glenn of Ohio is still suffering from his entanglement with Mr Charles Keating, who ran the now-collapsed Lincoln Savings and Loan  - even though the Senate ethics committee concluded he was guilty of nothing more than poor judgment. To be pure, however, it is not enough to be a non-incumbent. Ms Carol Moseley Braun, the Democratic candidate for Illinois' Senate seat, has seen her lead eroded by charges over her financial manoeuvring to keep her elderly mother's eligibility for state Medicaid cover. Even without the collapse in public esteem for Congress, many sitting members faced hard re-election battles. US House districts are redrawn after the census every 10 years. With population still moving from the north and east towards the west and south, many sitting members have seen their districts dwindle or disappear. Montana used to have two congressional districts, one represented by Democrat Pat Williams and the other by Republican Ron Marlenee. Today the two men will face off in Montana's only congressional district. Even in states which gained seats from the reapportionment, such as California and Georgia, sitting members have often been squeezed into less favourable districts. The irrepressible Mr Newt Gingrich, the Republican whip in the House, lost so much of his district that he chose to move to a more Republican district, but is still struggling as he makes himself known to new constituents. Democratic members in several states have lost areas they used to depend on for support to create new districts with black or Latino majorities, in compliance with the Voting Rights Act. All told, Democratic campaign managers estimate that 34 of their party's incumbents were adversely affected by redistricting, and a dozen Republicans.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         KEY CONGRESSIONAL RACES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- House of Representatives (district number)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- State              Democrat                    Republican  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alaska             John Devens                 Don Young* California (3)     Vic Fazio* **               Bill Richardson California (42)    George Brown* Dollars       Dick Rutan Florida (10)       Karen Moffitt               Bill Young* Georgia (6)        Tony Center                 Newt Gingrich* Dollars ** Iowa (2)           Dave Nagle* **              Jim Nussle* ** Maine (2)          Patrick McGowan             Olympia Snowe* Maryland (1)       Tom McMillen* **            Wayne Gilchrest* Massachusetts (3)  Joseph Early* Dollars       Peter Blute Massachusetts (6)  Nicholas Mavroules* Dollars Peter Torkildsen Michigan (8)       Bob Carr* **                Dick Chrysler Missouri (6)       Patricia Danner             Tom Coleman* Montana            Pat Williams* **            Ron Marlenee* ** N Carolina (11)    Jack Stevens                Charlie Taylor* ** Ohio (6)           Ted Strickland              Bob McEwen* Dollars Ohio (10)          Mary Rose Oakar* Dollars    Martin Hoke Pennsylvania (19)  Paul Kilker                 Bill Goodling* Dollars Texas (2)          Charles Wilson* Dollars     Donna Peterson Texas (23)         Albert Bustamante**         Henry Bonilla Wisconsin (1)      Les Aspin*                  Mark Neumann  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Senate  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- State              Democrat                    Republican  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- California (A)     Barbara Boxer Dollars       Bruce Herschensohn Colorado           Ben Nighthorse Campbell     Terry Considine Illinois           Carol Moseley               Braun Rich Williamson New Hampshire      John Rauh                   Judd Gregg New York           Robert Abrams               Alfonse d'Amato* Dollars Ohio               John Glenn* Dollars         Mike DeWine Oregon             Bob Packwood*               Les AucoinDollars Pennsylvania       Arlen Specter*              Lynn Yeakel Washington         Patty Murray                Rod Chandler Wisconsin          Russell Feingold            Bob Kasten*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Incumbent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dollars Trouble with overdrawn cheques on House of Representatives bank, or alleged ethics violations  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Hurt by redistricting  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

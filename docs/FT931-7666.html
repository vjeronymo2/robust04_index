			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / International Company News: Wessanen and Bols post earnings gains WESSANEN, the Dutch foods company, and Bols, the liqueurs and beverages group, posted gains of more than 10 per cent in 1992 profits, in line with forecasts made in January just before they announced plans for a merger. Wessanen's net profit before extraordinary items rose by 12.7 per cent to Fl 123.9m (Dollars 67m). Turnover fell to Fl 3.7bn from Fl 3.9bn, reflecting the sale of the grain products division in mid-1992. Bols' net profit rose by 10.1 per cent to Fl 116m from Fl 105.4m on turnover of Fl 1.29bn against Fl 1.33bn. Improved cost controls helped lift operating profit by 3.9 per cent to Fl 149.9m. Both companies increased their dividends, Wessanen's pay-out rising by 5.9 per cent to Fl 2.84 a share and Bols' by 11.8 per cent to Fl 1.52.</p>

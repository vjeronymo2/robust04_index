Lots of peasants no longer consider "leaving their own  native place" to make a living as a big deal. They flock into  towns and cities to do business or work, picking up jobs no  matter whether they are full-time or not. They also go outside  their counties or provinces. Some even venture into the  international business or labor markets to make a living.    Since mainland China began its reform and opening to the  world, the bondage of registered permanent residence has been  loosened. Big, lateral economic asociations formed by various  provincial and regional enterprises have broken through regional  obstacles and separation. This change also provides objective  conditions for peasants to do business or engage in industry.  The contingent of "engaging in industry and doing business"  organized by peasants has set their footprints all over the  country. Some people go to Taiwan. Still more dare to leave  the country to travel far away across the sea to do business and  engage in industry, giving full play to their talents and  abilities in more than 20 countries and regions.    The transnational labor markets which mainland peasants  enter  are chiefly located in China's neighboring countries and areas.  According to statistics from the mainland department concerned,  in the China's coastal provinces alone tens of thousands of  peasants have been engaged in transnational businesses and  employment. Of these, the peasant supply and marketing teams  from Gutian, Fujian Province, have traveled north and south,  leaving their footprints in Sino-Vietnamese and Sino-Burmese  border areas in the south as well as the Sino-Russian and  Sino-North Korean border areas in the north. They have succeeded  in opening up foreign markets for Gutian's mushrooms. The  peasants from Jinjiang and Shishi sell Russia a large amount of  Western-style suits and jeans produced in their hometowns. The  polyester fiber goods made in Changle have entered the markets  of countries such as Laos, Vietnam, and Burma. The peasants  from Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, sell several hundred thousand  pieces of children's clothing and dresses to Russia annually and  a large amount of piece goods to Vietnam and Burma. Several  hundred peasants from Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province, have been  shuttling between trade fairs in Guangxi and Vietnam, in Yunnan  and Thailand, and between Yunnan and Burma purchasing the local  Chinese herbal medicines and selling them to Taiwan, Japan,  Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philipines after processing. A few  hundred peasants from the Daba Shan area in Sichuan Province  have set up several enterprises in Burma.    The official government planned labor exports in recent  years  have also changed the fate of millions of peasants in mainland  China. In Lu County, Sichuan Province, known as the "home of  builders," there is a peasant construction team composed of more  than 100 good technicians. This team has excelled itself by  undertaking nearly 1000 projects in the Middle East, Africa,  etc. After inspection, all the projects they undertook were up  to standard. In 1992 alone, the production value stood at  nearly 200 million yuan. In Sichuan Province alone, there are  already more than a dozen counties which have realized their  goal of earning over 100 million yuan through labor export.  Thousands of peasants from Qidong and Haian in Jiangsu Province  are now actively engaged in a dozen trades such as building  construction, cooking, nursing, textile garments, chemical  industry, decorating, machine repair, and ocean fishery. Of  these, the peasants in Qidong concluded labor export contracts  worth over $11 million last year. In Heilongjiang Province,  each year there are over 10,000 peasants who display their  skills to the full in agricultural planting and construction  work in the CIS.    The peasants in mainland China leave their small peasant  courtyards and play an active role in the domestic and  international markets. No matter whether they are engaged in  international trade or paid employment, all these engagements  enable them to increase their income and quicken their steps  toward the goal of becoming well-to-do. Labor export has become  an important economic development measure, especially for those  townships and towns which get involved in official government  labor exports because it needs less investment but can achieve  quick results. It can not only find placements for the local  surplus labor force but also bring back capital, techniques, and  information from outside to help develop the local economy and  promote the peasants' sense of commodities.</p>

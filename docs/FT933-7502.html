			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Turkey considers sale of bank holding THE Turkish government may sell its 40 per cent stake in Turkiye Isbankasi, Turkey's biggest commercial bank, in a deal worth around Dollars 400m at current stock market prices. The treasury is looking at a possible global offering, or placing the shares with foreign or domestic institutions. Bank officials say they expect the treasury to announce details in the next few days. Brokers expect big foreign interest, although the stake does not give control as the bank's own pension fund currently owns 41 per cent. Around 17 per cent of Isbankasi was floated on the Istanbul stock exchange last year. Shares have jumped 20 per cent in the past few days. The bank reported profits of TL 843bn (Dollars 729m) in 1992. The bank has 855 branches. It is divesting investments in an effort to bring capital adequacy ratios in line with international levels.</p>

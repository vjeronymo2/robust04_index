			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / MPs urge probe on bread prices An influential committee of MPs is putting pressure on the Office of Fair Trading to launch a formal investigation into the price of bread in Northern Ireland. The recently established cross-party committee on Northern Ireland yesterday wrote to the OFT to express its concern about the differential in bread prices between Ulster and the rest of the UK. The committee - chaired by Sir James Kilfedder, the Ulster Popular Unionist party MP for North Down - said it wanted to know 'as speedily as possible' whether the OFT thought there was a case for further investigation. The letter followed an appearance before the committee by the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland. According to the council, a large loaf costs on average up to 40 per cent more in Ulster than in mainland Britain. The council says the difference has increased since 1989. It asked the director-general of fair trading to investigate the matter last November. Lady McCollum, who chairs the council, said at the time that the body was 'not convinced' that the difference in price was fully justified, in spite of the information supplied by the industry. She added: 'What is even more worrying is the fact that the situation has actually got worse . . . than it was five years ago.' The council says the bread market in the province is dominated by three bakeries, two of which are subsidiaries of Associated British Foods and Ranks Hovis McDougall (which was taken over by Tomkins in 1992). It says ABF also owns two of the largest supermarkets in the province. The OFT said yesterday it was in the process of conducting an informal investigation into bread prices in the province. There were no plans to make an announcement on its findings in the immediate future.</p>

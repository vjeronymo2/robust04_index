			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Heron seeks rescheduling as asset values fall by Pounds 400m HERON International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group, will this morning tell a crisis meeting of its banks that the property market slump has wiped more than Pounds 400m off the value of its net assets. The gravity of the group's financial difficulties will be brought home to banks and holders of Heron's bonds when they are asked to defer principal repayments on debt until the late 1990s. Heron, which owes Pounds 450m on bonds and a further Pounds 850m in bank borrowings, will also ask for some interest to be deferred. The company will stress that it still has more than Pounds 100m of cash  - but the property market collapse has reduced its capacity to generate additional cash for repayments. It hopes to be able to repay everything in full, but not on the original schedule, which required substantial principal payments over the next few years. Heron will ask for these to be deferred to the late 1990s. More than 80 banks will attend today's meeting. They will be told that Heron's net assets at the end of March 1992 were worth an estimated Pounds 150m, compared with Pounds 585m a year earlier. The collapse in the net asset figure means Heron expects to be in breach of covenants on its bank loans. Since one of the covenants stipulates that Heron's assets should be worth more than Pounds 350m, the company is being forced to renegotiate the terms of its loans. Its principal banks, led by Barclays of the UK, have been told of its restructuring plans, though smaller bank lenders are likely to be shocked by the proposals. However, the company is most nervous about the reaction of bondholders. Heron has 11 bonds in issue. Companies in financial difficulties often have trouble persuading bondholders to support restructuring plans. Heron believes the new terms will ultimately give banks and bondholders returns equivalent to what they would have earned, but is not offering any incentives such as increased interest rates or promises of equity in the business to persuade them to back the plan.

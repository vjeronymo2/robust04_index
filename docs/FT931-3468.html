			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Letter: Only one justification for no tax increase Sir, I hesitate to question Mr Samuel Brittan's analysis, though my hesitation is not increased by the fact that he can pray in support six of the government's allegedly wise men. The quality of an economic judgment seems to be inversely proportional to the number of economists putting it forward simultaneously - witness the 364 co-signatories of the 1981 letter to the Times or 4,000 ex-employees of the East German ministry of economics. But Mr Brittan's argument that a tax increase should be delayed (Economic Viewpoint, February 25) appears to be based on an inconsistent theory of expectations formulation. If a tax increase is considered to be probable, in the real world most people will take this into account in their behaviour even before it is announced. So the case for delaying an inevitable tax increase is weak. The only justification for Mr Lamont avoiding a rise in taxes in his Budget is that he may feel that taxes will not need to be raised at all. If he feels confident that Mr Portillo's review will deliver sizeable cuts in public spending, this would justify a neutral Budget, leaving the revised levels of public spending to be announced in November. While the government continues to borrow Pounds 1bn a week, it remains subject to the moods of the financial markets. And these markets have tended not to give Mr Lamont the benefit of the doubt. Their confidence in UK economic prospects is only likely to revive when the chancellor puts forward a programme to eliminate public borrowing based on something more credible than Ms Rosy Scenario (who made an unwelcome reappearance in the Autumn Statement). Such a programme would improve the trade-off between interest rates and the exchange rate and create scope for further cuts in interest rates if the recovery fails to gain momentum.

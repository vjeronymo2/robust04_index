			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / France adjusts slowly to recovery: Green shoots are viewed with some caution The green shoots of France's economic recovery have been breaking through with increasing vigour. A series of statistics released over the past 10 days, from revised first quarter growth figures to first half employment trends, reveal a rise in momentum as the economy seeks to put behind it the sharp recession of 1993. Revised first quarter growth figures showed a rise of 0.7 per cent in gross domestic product, with most economists predicting a stronger performance in the second quarter. In June, unemployment fell for the first time in four years, while statistics released last week showed that 60,000 jobs were created in the April-June period. A string of company results, from Air Liquide, the industrial gases group, to the Peugeot-Citroen car company, have revealed healthy sales increases for the first half of the year. Inflation remains moribund at an annualised rate of 1.7 per cent. 'Some of the numbers have been impressive,' says Mr Paul O'Brien, European economist at JP Morgan. 'We are seeing a nice, healthy adjustment on the production and business side.' Like many other economists, he has revised up his forecasts for GDP growth this year to just under 2 per cent, compared with a 1 per cent contraction in 1993. The numbers add up to good news for Mr Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, as France heads for presidential elections next spring. But his reaction has been guarded rather than enthusiastic. 'I think that this is the beginning of a real recovery,' he says. 'But it may be that in the months ahead we have some disappointments. . . . whether it is production figures, export figures or employment figures.' Such a reaction reveals more than Mr Balladur's cautious nature. As he is aware, the pattern of recovery this year contains elements of weakness which may yet undermine its resilience and duration. So far this year, the economic revival has been based largely on a slowdown in company destocking and strong export demand from other reviving economies. According to Insee, the national statistics office, the rebuilding of inventories was the single biggest factor in economic growth in the first quarter and remained important in the second. Such a development, reflected in the strong sales performance of companies supplying intermediate and capital goods, is normal in the early stages of recovery. The concern arises over the prospects for other engines of growth, in particular, consumption and investment. France's consumers remain very wary of parting with their money. An estimated 1 per cent rise in consumer spending in the second quarter was largely the result of special government incentives in the motor sector, in particular a FFr5,000 (Pounds 605) payment to car-owners trading in old vehicles to buy new. Strip out that sector, argues Ms Esther Baroudy, senior economist at Credit Lyonnais, and one is left with an anaemic performance by the French shopper. The explanation for consumer caution lies partly with continued concerns about the level of unemployment and the reduced generosity of state benefits, for example pensions. Says the manager of one Paris bank: 'Many people have friends or relatives out of work. Most are aware that they state pension system is becoming less generous. So the response is to be more careful, spend less and save more.' Mr Balladur hopes this sentiment is beginning to change as the perception of recovery spreads. Economists disagree whether this hope will be realised. Ms Baroudy believes there is a danger the savings ratio will remain stuck where it is and that consumption will weaken sharply in the third quarter. Others argue that, with the employment situation stabilised and preparing to improve, the fear of unemployment will recede. 'The developments in the labour market will have a big positive impact,' says Mr Bernard Godement, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute in Paris. The government has taken several steps besides the car measures to help lift consumption. It is due to transfer FFr6bn to families to help pay for the expenses of the new school year. FFr15bn will also enter consumers' pockets through income tax cuts in the third quarter. However, another potential constraint on growth is out of the government's hands. Despite the lack of inflationary pressures, turmoil in international bond markets has prompted a rise in long term interest rates from about 5.6 per cent at the start of the year to more than 7 per cent. Economists play down the threat to industrial investment. 'If you look at most French companies they have a relatively strong financial position at the moment,' says one. 'On balance they are net cash holders.' He cites Saint Gobain, the glass and building materials group, as just one company with ambitious investment plans. The effect on the housing market may be more serious. New house purchases have slipped since the beginning of the year, partly because of the higher cost of long-term finance. Still more worrying is the impact on interest payments on the government's debt as it struggles to curb its budget deficit, targeted at FFr300bn this year. Economics ministry officials claim the target will be reached, pointing to the imposition of austere spending targets across the government ministries. A further rise in long term yields, however, would present the government with a difficult choice in the run-up to a presidential election: to rein in government spending still further or raise taxes. Neither is a palatable option, and both may damage the green shoots of recovery.</p>

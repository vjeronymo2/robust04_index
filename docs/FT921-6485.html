			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Brazil reaches debt deal with Paris Club BRAZIL has signed an agreement on rescheduling debt with the Paris Club of creditor nations, Brazilian economy minister Marcilio Marquez Moreira said last night, agencies report from Brasilia. The announcement came after some hard negotiating between Brazilian officials and creditor nation representatives in Paris. The Brazilian team had to work on new proposals after German and Japanese representatives apparently refused to accept the original Brazilian proposals. At a press briefing in Brasilia, the economy minister said that under an accord reached late last night Brazil would pay Dollars 4.1bn over 1992-93. This amount is a portion of a Dollars 13.5bn total that was due and that Brazil owed in arrears until 1993. Mr Moreira said the agreement included the rescheduling of another Dollars 11bn over a 14-year period and a three-year grace period. The minister put Brazil's total debt at Dollars 24bn, whereas ministry officials previously said Brazil's Paris Club debt was Dollars 21bn. The Brazilian announcement came just hours after the economy minister had told reporters that talks would be broken off for a week, contradicting earlier reports that negotiations were again going smoothly. The main sticking point in the Paris negotiations has been Brazil's insistence on including debt in the rescheduling that was rescheduled in the last accord in 1988. Mr Francisco Gros, Brazil's central bank governor, said last week that this accord had created an excessive concentration of repayments over the next two years. Only in exceptional circumstances does the Paris Club agree to reschedule already rescheduled debt and Brazil's non-payment of interest for the last three years has not endeared it to official creditors. They complain that they have been receiving worse treatment than the commercial banks to which Brazil started paying 30 per cent of due interest last year.</p>

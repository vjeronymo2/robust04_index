			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Ofgas sets Pounds 15 delivery charge A standing charge of Pounds 15 a year for mains gas delivery to domestic customers was set yesterday by Ofgas, the industry regulator. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, Ofgas director-general, said she had set the charge 'in anticipation that the gas market will move to full competition in the near future'. As a monopoly, British Gas has not been required to break down its Pounds 37-a-year domestic standing charge between the costs of transportation and of its trading division. But the planned liberalisation of the market beginning in 1996 will led to the separation of the two functions. Independent gas marketing companies welcomed the move, which they said should lead to the standing charge being lowered in the run-up to competition and after competition had been introduced. British Gas yesterday announced the closure by the end of next year of its research station at Killingworth, North Tyneside. Many of the 400 employees will be offered jobs at its new consolidated research centre at Loughborough, Leicestershire.</p>

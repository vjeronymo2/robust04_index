			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Guideline in Switching Cooperative Ownership Over To </F> All-people Ownership" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The concrete tasks and  ways of switching cooperative ownership over to all-people  ownership advanced by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song in  his famous work "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural Question  Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses" constitute a  militant banner for the ultimate solution of the rural question  and the complete victory of socialism in Korea.    This is stressed by Dr. Kim Chol in an article contributed  to  NODONG SINMUN today.    The article says the great leader in the work  comprehensively  expounded theoretical and practical questions in successfully  switching cooperative ownership over to all-people ownership.    The respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as  saying:    "Cooperative ownership should be switched over to all-people  ownership with success by consolidating and developing the  agricultural cooperative economy."    The great leader said the switchover must be carried out  gradually, depending on the maturity of all the conditions and  possibilities.    The fundamental prerequisite for the switchover is to raise  the level of ideological consciousness of the cooperative  farmers and consolidate the material and technical foundations  of the cooperative economy.    What is important here is to educate the cooperative farmers  ideologically and train them into revolutionaries and assimilate  them to the working class.    We can say the important conditions for the switchover are  matured only when the level of ideological consciousness of the  farmers is raised and they give full play to high patriotic  enthusiasm and devotion in socialist rural construction, deeply  conscious that the interests of society and collective include  their private interests and the prosperity and development of  the socialist motherland and the socialist countryside are  essential for their worthy life and happiness.    We can say the solid material and technical foundations for  the switchover are laid only when the distinctions between  industrial and agricultural labour are gradually eliminated and  the efficiency of agricultural labour is decisively enhanced  through the industrialisation and modernisation of agriculture  and the improvement of the farming methods and the cultivation  system.    By indicating in the work the fundamental prerequisite for  the switchover, the great leader provided a guideline for  successfully solving this matter without the slightest deviation  and turns and twists.    The work says the switchover of cooperative ownership to  all-people ownership must be done with the county as a unit.  The county is the base linking the towns with the countryside  in all spheres of politics, the economy and culture and serves  as the basic unit for the direct guidance and management of the  rural economy.    Since a well-organised agricultural guidance and management  system has been established with the county as a unit in our  country, the most reasonable form and method is to convert  cooperative farms in the county into state farms under  all-people ownership and let the county undertake their unified  guidance and management.</p>

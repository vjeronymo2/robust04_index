			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Jones &amp; Shipman considers cash call JONES &amp; SHIPMAN, the Leicester-based machine tool builder, said yesterday it was in discussions with a trade investor and other financial institutions on a possible issue of new equity for cash. Shares in J&amp;S, one of the UK's three publicly-quoted machine tool builders, rose 1p to 32p after the announcement, valuing the company at about Pounds 3.8m. Because of the discussions, publication of results for the year to March 31, due tomorrow is not expected until September. J&amp;S said the aim of the issue would be to finance completion of the previously announced rationalisation programme and to increase working capital. The programme, which involves halving the workforce to about 250 and outsourcing the machining of components, was announced last July. J&amp;S had originally hoped to finance the rationalisation out of existing resources, but said yesterday it had been impeded by market conditions and other factors, including its inability to sell property as advantageously as had been expected. The company said the precise amount of the issue had yet to be fixed, but was likely to be 'reasonably substantial'. The discussions include Close Brothers, the company's merchant banker, Albert E Sharp, its broker, and institutional shareholders. J&amp;S said trading conditions in the second half of last year remained difficult, albeit better than in the first half. In spite of these difficulties, the trading loss for 1992-93 was said to be 'much reduced' compared with the previous Pounds 3.04m deficit on turnover of Pounds 15.9m.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Profits plunge 60% at Fletcher Challenge A SHARP fall in first-half profits and hefty dividend cut are revealed by Fletcher Challenge, New Zealand's largest industrial company with forestry, energy and construction interests. Net profits for the six months to end-December plunged 60 per cent to NZDollars 151.6m (USDollars 82.4m), or 8.6 cents a share, from 1989's corresponding NZDollars 376.3m, or 27.9 cents. Sales declined by 7.4 per cent to NZDollars 6.28bn from NZDollars 6.78bn. As a result of the fall, the half-year dividend is being sliced from 11.5 cents a share to 7 cents. The latest figures are after extraordinary losses of NZDollars 32m, mainly from writedowns on the value of properties held by a construction unit. Results in the previous year included extraordinary gains of NZDollars 52m. Weak prices for pulp and newsprint caused Fletcher's core forestry division to record a loss of NZDollars 79m in the period, down from a profit of NZDollars 76m a year earlier. The 72 per cent-owned unit, Fletcher Challenge Canada, has been particularly hurt by an oversupply of newsprint on the North American market and weak demand. In contrast, earnings from the energy division rose 8 per cent to NZDollars 196m from NZDollars 181m, reflecting increased production from operations in New Zealand and in Canada. Profit from the farm-servicing division, which includes its Rural Bank unit, rose 42 per cent to NZDollars 51m from NZDollars 36m. But earnings of the construction division, affected by weak market conditions both in New Zealand and in North America, fell 73 per cent to NZDollars 17m from NZDollars 63m. Prospects for the year to end-June are clouded. Fletcher Challenge predicts earnings of about NZDollars 300m, down 46 per cent from 1990-91's NZDollars 555m, which in turn were 16 per cent below those of the previous year. The directors said weak markets in most of its products were likely through the second half but they expected a substantial cyclical recovery in earnings in the next few years. The company plans to sell assets worth NZDollars 750m in the current year. It has already raised NZDollars 500m of that target so far in the period. Assets sold include two sawmills in British Columbia, a 45 per cent stake in Quebec-based forest products company Donohue-St Fleicien, and several properties. Fletcher Challenge's total liabilities stood at NZ3.7bn at end-June last year.</p>

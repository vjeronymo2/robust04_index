			<p>SUMMARY                                   Continuing its strategy of minimal accommodation, Pyongyang has  invited the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to make  limited observations of the refueling of the 5-megawatt reactor  in Yongbyon.  At the same time, seeking to engage Washington in  direct negotiations while circumventing Seoul on issues involving  the security of the Korean peninsula, Pyongyang has proposed  DPRK-U.S. talks on replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace  accord.                              END SUMMARY      In the first public acknowledgment of its invitation to the IAEA-  - reported earlier in non-DPRK media (Yonhap, 21 April)--a  Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement on 27 April declared that  "technical requirements" are compelling Pyongyang to replace  nuclear fuel "soon" at the Yongbyon "experimental power station"  (Pyongyang radio, 27 April).  However, the spokesman made it  clear that IAEA inspectors will be allowed only to "observe" the  refueling process and to engage in related activities needed to  "verify" non-diversion of the spent fuel.  Specifically, the  spokesman said, the inspectors will not be allowed ''sampling and  other inspection activities" that have apparently been requested  by the agency.  He warned that if Washington and the IAEA  Secretariat--the two entities the spokesman again accused of  attempting to "crush" the DPRK--"rudely demand" such activities,  which fall outside the province of ensuring "continuity of  safeguards," it will lead to an unspecified "irrevocable complex  situation."  Pressing for bilateral nuclear talks with  Washington, the spokesman said that any additional activities  could be discussed at future DPRK-U.S. talks.     Apparently as a further incentive for Washington to hold  bilateral talks, the spokesman suggested that additional  inspections requested by the IAEA following what the agency  contended was an incomplete inspection of the reprocessing plant  in March could also be accommodated   The spokesman said that  Pyongyang is "studying" this question "in close relation to the  attitude of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat."     Peace Accord     The spokesman's pitch for bilateral talks with  Washington on the nuclear issue was followed by a North Korean  proposal for an apparently separate set of DPRK-U.S. talks on the  broad issue of security on the peninsula.  A 28 April Foreign  Ministry statement--a vehicle a notch above a spokesman's  statement in authority--formally proposed negotiations with  Washington to seek a peace accord to replace the Armistice  Agreement (Pyongyang radio, 28 April).  Clearly seeking to  distinguish the new initiative from old--and long discredited-  -proposals for a DPRK-U.S. peace treaty, the carefully worded  proposal called for "a new arrangement of peace."  Uncompromising  in tone, it went to great lengths to argue that the United States  has in fact "completely destroyed and abandoned" the Armistice  Agreement with a long history of violations, including  introduction of prohibited new weapons in the South that  culminated in the deployment of Patriot missiles.  The statement  reiterated Pyongyang's objection to the naming of a South Korean  general to head the UN side of the Military Armistice Commission  (MAC), an act that the statement claimed had rendered the  commission "a structure with no proprietor, a name with no  substance."      Background     The new proposal seems to be a step backward from  the North-South nonaggression pact of 1991.  In signing that  accord, Pyongyang had agreed to treat the question of the 1953  armistice accord as an inter-Korean issue, abandoning its long-  held position that the issue of replacing the armistice accord  with a peace treaty should be resolved between Pyongyang and  Washington, because the South was not a signatory to the accord.  As recently as 29 March, Pyongyang had repeated its claim of  recent weeks that the South, by virtue of a series of  "provocative" actions, including the deployment of Patriot  missiles, has "unilaterally nullified" the 1991 inter-Korean  agreement (KCNA).     Implications     The 27 April Foreign Ministry spokesman's  statement is consistent with Pyongyang's persistent attempt to  engage Washington in nuclear talks.  Pyongyang's transparent  attempt to undermine the authority of the ROK government on the  Armistice Agreement issue, as evident in the 28 Foreign Ministry  statement, seems aimed--at least in part--at displaying contempt  for the ROK government, which had recently yielded to the North  and decided not to press for the exchange of special envoys.  It  is not clear why Pyongyang chose to resuscitate a discredited  proposal at this time, thereby risking the possibility of  complicating nuclear negotiations.     (AUTHOR:  YIM.

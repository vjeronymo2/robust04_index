			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / When money grows on trees: The possible privatisation of British forests The prospect of Britain's forests being sold to the private sector has produced an unlikely alliance of environmentalists, ramblers, timber users and private landowners. They are fighting to preserve the independence of an old enemy, the Forestry Commission, which owns and runs the UK's state forests. The government, they argue, is about to undermine progress made by the commission, just when it has been getting it right, pursuing policies in the past few years that address both environmental and commercial interests. Their fears have been sparked off by a ministerial review committee, charged with examining Britain's tree-planting strategy and the future ownership of forests. Campaigners have until the end of next week to make their concerns known to the committee, which reports to ministers at the end of this year. While the government has not said publicly it wants to sell the state forests, it has made it clear that ownership is up for discussion. Campaigners fear that current budgetary pressures will tip the balance in favour of privatisation. The government reorganised the Forestry Commission last year, creating a more commercially orientated division, Forest Enterprise, to run and manage the 2m acres of state forests and woodlands that cover 5 per cent of Britain's land area. This left more general matters of regulation and policy with the commission. Environmentalists believe that Forest Enterprise is being groomed for sale. The sale of state forests has long been demanded by the Conservative right and by some private foresters, who argue that the forests in private hands would be more commercially dynamic. Conservationists say that private owners would adopt less environmentally sensitive planting policies, while ramblers fear the right of public access to Forestry Commission woods would disappear. The debate over possible privatisation, however, threatens to divert attention from the committee's main task of reviewing the system of incentives for tree planting put in place in 1988. But the two issues are intertwined. It was in his 1988 Budget that Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor of the exchequer, announced the replacement of tax incentives for planting trees with grants. At the same time, tree planting became more tightly controlled  -new conifer plantations now have to contain at least 5 per cent of broad-leaved, or deciduous, trees such as alder or oak. The measures were in response to the growing unpopularity of the conifer forests spreading across Britain's uplands. These were part of government policy dating back to 1919 to reafforest Britain after industrialisation and war. While conifers suit the timber industry because they are more commercially useful, there was a growing demand from conservationists and ramblers for more diverse and attractive woodlands, more suited to wildlife and recreational use. The tax concessions, whereby the cost of tree planting could be offset against income tax, had become discredited in the mid-1980s. Environmentalists discovered that trees were being planted on behalf of individuals, such as TV personalities, as a means of avoiding tax rather than being part of a national planting strategy. Tree-planting fell sharply when the tax concessions ended, dropping from a peak of 25,400 a hectare in the year to March 31 1989 to 15,000 a hectare in the last financial year. For the timber users, state ownership of the forests underpins steady supplies. Forest Enterprise provides saw mill companies with timber largely irrespective of timber prices, with any loss covered from its subsidy (about Pounds 45m this year). Timber users fear that private owners would sell wood only when timber prices were good. And big timber processors with long-term supply contracts with Forest Enterprise fear they would not survive privatisation. Some landowners, meanwhile, are worried that foreign companies would buy Britain's forests cheaply. On the other side of the argument, private foresters believe that the best way of ensuring a ready supply of the right sort of timber is to privatise. 'Privatisation would take the (Forestry) Commission's 40 per cent share of Britain's forestry out of the secretive, inefficient world of the civil service,' one private forester says. Mr Peter Johnson, chairman of Tilhill Economic Forestry, which plants and manages woodlands, says the current rate of planting is even worse than the official figures suggest, because less than one-third of current planting is 'commercially significant'. Mr Len Yull, Tilhill's marketing director, explains: 'The only trees that provide the timber which industry can use, in building homes or making furniture or making paper, are conifers. Yet we are being encouraged to plant broad-leaves which are often purely decorative, or if commercial will not mature for 80 years.' Conifers mature in 40 years. He adds: 'It's a tragedy because Britain is ideal for commercial forestry. Because of our climate, our trees grow up to twice as fast as in Russia and Scandinavia which we import from.' Britain meets only about 13 per cent of its timber needs from its own forests and it had a Pounds 4.5bn trade deficit in timber-based products in 1991. Supporters of private sector forestry are lobbying for two things. First, they say, the government should even out the subsidies for agriculture and those for forestry. 'There is too little tree planting because land that could be used for forestry is too expensive. It is too expensive because the subsidies available for farming it are much higher than those for planting trees on it,' says Mr Craig Campbell of the Scottish Council Development and Industry. Second, changes in the tax system are required to attract investment in forestry by individuals, now that the tax breaks have gone. It is suggested that the Treasury should change the tax rules to encourage companies and unit trusts to invest in forestry. Environmental and leisure interests could be met, says the pro-privatisation lobby, by splitting off woodland primarily of amenity value (for example, the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire) to be run by conservation groups or local authorities. Commercial forests would be sold separately. In the end, the voice of the Treasury could be decisive, although the state forests might raise only about Pounds 1bn, against a public sector borrowing requirement this year of Pounds 50bn. The government may conclude that it would be cheaper to ignore calls for more tree planting and leave things as they are. This would do nothing to improve Britain's timber trade - yet there is no guarantee that private operators would be any more successful than the Forestry Commission at balancing commercial needs with environmental and leisure interests.</p>

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Letter: Cargo law Sir, One point apparently not yet picked up in the many post-mortem reviews of the Braer tanker disaster is the following. Oil tankers should be handled as if 'dangerous cargo' (such as toxic waste), and therefore shipowners/charterers should be forced by EC law/UN resolution (a) to file details of the route of each voyage with a suitable supervisory agency that has powers to veto/adjust/delay, and (b) to accept 'pollution prevention pilots' on board for parts of the voyage where problems might be expected. I suggest that these simple measures would probably have prevented the recent tanker disasters in Spain and the Shetlands. James Munro, 49 Blandy Road, Henley, Oxon</p>

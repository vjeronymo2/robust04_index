			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acal seeks expansion funds and plans full listing Acal, the USM-traded electronics and industrial control manufacturer, yesterday announced plans for an acquisition, a rights issue and a move to the Official List. The company being acquired is Sartek Holding (EAF), which distributes, exchanges and repairs personal computer parts, mainly in the Netherlands and north-west Germany. Initial consideration for the proposed purchase will be Fl 18.9m (Pounds 6.6m), with further profits-related payments for the years up to December 1995 not exceeding Fl 23.5m. To pay for the acquisition, Acal is seeking to raise Pounds 10.1m net of expenses via a 1-for-3 rights issue at 225p per share. The balance of the proceeds - Pounds 3.5m - will be used to reduce borrowings. The rights issue is being underwritten by Schroders. Brokers are Albert E Sharp. In addition, the directors forecast that turnover and profits before tax for the year to end-March 1994 will be not less than Pounds 76m and Pounds 3.4m respectively, against Pounds 68.9m and Pounds 3.15m last time. A final dividend of 4.5p is forecast, raising the total from 6.3p to 6.75p. Acal has also applied to the Stock Exchange for its shares to be fully listed. They rose 15p to 281p yesterday.</p>

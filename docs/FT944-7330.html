			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Women's pay in London up 3% Gross weekly earnings for female full-time employees in Greater London rose 3 per cent this year, while weekly pay for men in the region only rose by 1.3 per cent, says data from the fifth instalment of the New Earnings Survey, published yesterday. Both male and female full-time workers in Greater London command the highest average gross weekly earnings in Britain, although women still earn 28 per cent less than men. The next highest earners, men in Berkshire and Surrey, received average pay rises of 3.8 per cent in the same period, although the pay of women in Surrey only rose by 1.9 per cent and that of women in Berkshire rose by 1.2 per cent. In the counties where employees received the lowest weekly pre-tax earnings, pay rose more than 4 per cent on average. For men, weekly pay in Cornwall rose 4.1 per cent, while in the Isle of Wight it rose 4.6 per cent and in Powys it rose 5.5 per cent. The rankings for the lowest weekly earnings for women have changed. Last year, Suffolk, Shropshire and Cornwall were at the bottom of the league for received earnings while this year it was Shropshire, Cornwall and the Highlands of Scotland.

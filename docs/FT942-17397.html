			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Observer: Landlord bitter A tired commercial traveller fed up with driving across the North Yorkshire moors spots a sign outside a lonely pub advertising 'a pie, a pint, and a friendly word for Pounds 1.80'. Not knowing when he is next going to get a meal, the traveller decides to rest a while and orders the special. The barman pulls a pint, hands over the pie and then goes straight back to doing his crossword. The traveller is a bit miffed at the lack of welcome and after several minutes' silence asks what happened to the promised friendly word. 'Don't eat the pie,' mutters the barman.</p>

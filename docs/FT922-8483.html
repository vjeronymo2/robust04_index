			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / International Company News: Bobst benefits from full order books BOBST, the Swiss paper and packaging machinery concern, posted an increase in consolidated net earnings of 17.9 per cent to SFr71.1m (Dollars 46.70m) in 1991, while turnover increased by 9.3 per cent to SFr1.13bn. Cash flow rose 22 per cent to SFr140.3m. Mr Bruno de Kalbermatten, company president, said Bobst had benefited last year from fat order books accumulated in 1990. He expected slower growth in 1992 but more positive developments in 1993. The Lausanne-based group, which employs 5,400 people worldwide, has adopted EC accounting standards for its 1991 consolidated accounts. Besides increasing transparency, the move has boosted the group's balance sheet largely by increasing asset values. However, the parent company, Bobst SA, continues to use traditional Swiss accounting methods. Bobst SA reported a 9.6 per cent increase in net earnings to SFr31.9m. The annual shareholders meeting on May 26 will be asked to approve an unchanged dividend of SFr34 per registered share and participation certificate and SFr68 per bearer share. The group boosted share capital by nearly 20 per cent last year to SFr755m. Mr Pierre-Andre Jolliet, finance director, said the company was considering a simplification of its share structure but had yet to make a decision. Increasing numbers of Swiss companies are moving to a single class of share, abolishing the distinction between registered (voting) shares available only to Swiss nationals and bearer shares which have no voting rights. The group would continue to strengthen its position in the mid-range of the market, as well as in high-quality products, a strategy that was paying off in developing country markets which account for a quarter of Bobst's sales, the company said.</p>

			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Aristide sets up transition team for Haiti Haiti's exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide appealed for calm in his country yesterday and announced the formation of a transition team to pave the way for his return before October 15. Mr Aristide urged the people of Haiti to 'be vigilant and guard against provocation', and called on Haitian elected officials to resume their offices in preparation for his return to power. 'In less than 24 days I will join you in Haiti. Then we will continue working as peacemakers, peacekeepers and peace lovers,' Mr Aristide told reporters on the steps of the Pentagon after being briefed by top US military officials on the progress of the US occupation of Haiti. In a striking reversal from the frosty tone of his statement on Tuesday, Mr Aristide also thanked the US for its actions. But Mr Aristide warned that the success of the US mission was 'directly tied to the process of disarmament' of the Haitian military and paramilitary forces. The US military command reaffirmed its commitment yesterday to co-operating with the Haitian military and leaving law enforcement to local police, in spite of incidents of political violence. As Washington insisted that US personnel should not intervene in domestic policing, the implication was that the US forces serving in Operation Restore Democracy could not guarantee Haitians free political expression. General Hugh Shelton, the US commander of the joint task force in Haiti, said the Haitian police intervention on Tuesday, which left one man dead and many injured, constituted a 'human rights issue'. However, he concluded that 'the co-operation, the teamwork (between US and Haitian soldiers) has just been splendid'. At a meeting yesterday morning between the US and Haiti's commanders, Gen Shelton promised to call on Gen Raoul Cedras, leader of the Haitian junta, to 'pull the chains back' on his militia. However, he went on to say that the police were made up of 'various factions . . . some of these General Cedras does not have control of'. Some members of the US 10th Mountain Division in Port-au-Prince confessed to feeling 'helpless' and 'frustrated' at not being allowed to intervene on behalf of innocent citizens. Some said their rules of engagement remained loosely defined, which allowed one group of servicemen to arrest three Haitian soldiers found near a small US ammunitions stockpile. There were reports of another scuffle near the airport yesterday morning. Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

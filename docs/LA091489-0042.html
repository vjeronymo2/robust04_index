			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENTER HELPS EASE ISOLATION OF ELDERLY;  </P> <P> FACILITY FOR ASIAN PATIENTS SUFFERS FROM FRAIL FINANCIAL HEALTH  </P> <P> When 74-year-old Lily Wong came to the Central Adult Day Health Care Center  near Echo Park Lake in November, she could barely walk.  </P> <P> Crippled by Parkinson's disease, she spent much of her time confined to her  bed.  </P> <P> The disease had atrophied her muscles, and her psychological health had  deteriorated as well.  </P> <P> "She literally dragged herself into our center," recalled nursing assistant  Grace Ho. Social worker Zvi Galibof, himself an emigrant from Israel, said:  "She said to me, 'What is the use of making efforts to walk when I will come  nowhere with it?' "  </P> <P> But since her first visit to the center nearly a year ago, Wong has learned to  cope with the degeneration that comes with Parkinson's.  </P> <P> She is now able to walk with assistance, and she has hope for the future.  </P> <P> "Before I came here, I ask God to take me away," she said, her voice barely  audible above the din of the lunchtime gathering at the center. "They're very  kind to me here."  </P> <P> Wong is one of about 30 seniors who regularly attend the center. The  state-licensed facility, which is in the recreation hall of St. Athanasius  Episcopal Church, provides bilingual nursing services, occupational and  physical therapy, exercise classes and nutrition counseling to its largely  Asian clientele.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Various Illnesses  </P> <P> Many of the center's patients suffer from various illnesses associated with  aging, such as Alzheimer's disease, hypertension, arthritis, diabetes,  post-stroke conditions and cardiac complications.  </P> <P> The center uses group activities to counter the sense of isolation felt by many  seniors. "The socialization process is one of the most beneficial," Ho said.  </P> <P> To illustrate this philosophy, a large sign across one wall reads: "Friends are  good medicine."  </P> <P> Alice Tsou, the center's founder and administrator, said she started the center  to help the many elderly, non-English-speaking people who came to Los Angeles  from Asia.  </P> <P> "They weren't getting appropriate treatment," Tsou said. "They couldn't  communicate with the nurses and doctors. Gestures don't interpret what you  really want or need."  </P> <P> But despite its success with patients, the center's financial health is as  frail as that of many of its patients.  </P> <P> The center was opened in August, 1987, with a $50,000 grant from the state  Department of Aging and funds from private foundations and individuals.  </P> <P> Since then, the center has struggled to survive on an annual budget of  $140,000.  </P> <P> Much of the funding comes from medical reimbursements, $45.85 per patient per  day, from the state Medi-Cal program.  </P> <P> Tsou said 30 people must attend the center every day, double the present  average daily attendance, to make it self-sustaining.  </P> <P> She estimated that the center receives $110,000 a year in services and supplies  donated by French Hospital, which is in Los Angeles' Chinatown; the Los Angeles  County Food Bank, which provides food for the daily lunches, and volunteers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Financial Ailments  </P> <P> To add to its financial ailments, the center may have to relocate.  </P> <P> The center's site is slated for demolition within the next two years when the  Los Angeles Episcopal Church begins work on its new diocesan center.  </P> <P> In preparation for the demolition, the church changed the center's year-to-year  lease to month-to-month in December.  </P> <P> Father John Bruno, rector of St. Athanasius, said he has reminded Tsou several  times about the new lease terms and the possibility that the building housing  the center could be demolished as early as next summer.  </P> <P> "I don't have time to look for another place," Tsou said. "I looked at 30  places before I found this one. It's hard for me to think of looking all over  again."  </P></p>

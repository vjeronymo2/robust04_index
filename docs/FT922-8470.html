			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / FT Conference: Bank head urges market evolution A SINGLE European stock market for wholesale investors should develop through competition between national markets, not be imposed from Brussels, Mr Pen Kent, an executive director of the Bank of England, said yesterday. In the first detailed comments by a Bank director on EC investment regulation, Mr Kent argued strongly that rules from Brussels should not be allowed to inhibit the development of London's international share market. 'Imposing a solution could mean losing the benefits of diversity and competition,' he said. His comments were made at a conference in London, organised by the Financial Times, on the international securities markets. Mr Kent said that the question of stock market transparency - the extent to which details of completed trades are published to the market  - was central to the debate. He defended the lack of transparency in London's share market, arguing that greater trade publication would discourage marketmakers from supporting the market. 'Revealing more information, through publication, will tend to help the less informed, but will also reduce the appeal of the market place to informed traders.' Also, marketmakers' quotes of the prices at which they were prepared to buy or sell shares constituted a form of 'pre-trade publication' which was in some ways preferable to publication of completed trades, he said. It was better to have different publication rules in different EC states, rather than to impose a single system. 'The conflict is between real efficiency and the appearance of fairness,' Mr Kent said. His comments had received support earlier from Mr Francois Bacot, director general of Bacot-Allain, the French arm of SG Warburg and author of a report last year on the development of wholesale share trading in Paris. 'The permanent quotation of bid-offer spreads and volumes provides all the necessary information' to keep investors informed, he said. Mr Bacot said that the debate over EC regulation, which had pitted the UK and French against each other in arguments over the ideal market system, failed to recognise that different systems suited different types of investor. 'Instead of asking us to choose one or the other, wouldn't it be better to try and make them work together, since it is certainly in the interest of the markets to offer their members a large variety of trading systems,' he said. Mr Brandon Becker, deputy director of the market regulation division of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, launched a strong defence of immediate trade publication. Transparency is essential for investor protection, encourages investors to participate in a market and promotes open competition, he said.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> JUDGE SAYS PROBLEMS IN COUNTY CLERK'S OFFICE LED TO ORDER TO HALT CIVIL TRIALS  </P> <P> A management breakdown in the San Diego County clerk's office is mostly to  blame for the postponement of all new civil trials in San Diego while a  critical backlog of criminal cases is resolved, Presiding Superior Court Judge  Michael I. Greer said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Everyone knows what the problem is," Greer told a group of reporters in his  chambers. And that problem, he said, lies in the county clerk's office.  "(There's a) morale problem over there (that's) next to horrible." He went on  to say that he has questions over the way personnel in the office are assigned.  </P> <P> The judge's statements brought a strong rebuttal from veteran County Clerk  Robert D. Zumwalt, who said that Greer "wasn't being candid with the  newspapers" and that it's the judges and their staffs who control the vital  factor of scheduling trials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Clerk's Office Defended  </P> <P> "I've worked here for 33 years and I know exactly what he's (implying),"  Zumwalt said. "I think he's just trying to throw up some type of smog or  something to shift the blame to the county clerk."  </P> <P> According to the judge, the courts rely on the clerk's office for critical  information about pending cases, yet the clerk's office is separate from the  judges, who have no management control over the office. A lawsuit over the  management issue is now pending before the California Supreme Court.  </P> <P> "(We) can't manage a system where we don't manage the people . . . (where)  someone else does," Greer said. "I'm not into complaining . . . (but) that's my  major problem."  </P> <P> While the judge explained that other important ingredients were also behind  last Friday's decision to delay new civil trials -- such as 18 vacant  judgeships that Gov. George Deukmejian has yet to fill -- he claimed it was the  lack of adequate information from the clerk's office that ultimately led to the  postponements.  </P> <P> When a new computer-based system to track criminal cases became operational  about two weeks ago -- a system Greer said relies on information provided by  the clerk's office -- the judge said it was the first time he had "some sort of  management device" over that aspect of the court system. To his chagrin, the  new system led him to "find snakes all over the place."  </P> <P> Even so, it wasn't until last Friday morning, he said, that he found out how  bad things really were. "I had no idea when I walked in Friday what was going  to happen," the judge said. He learned quickly, though, over breakfast with  Superior Court Judge Herbert J. Exarhos, who supervises the criminal courts.  </P> <P> There were several criminal cases facing certain dismissal that day unless  their trials started immediately, Greer was told. Under law, criminal cases  must be in court within 60 days, unless the defendant waives that right.  </P> <P> While an abundance of criminal cases has led to brief delays in San Diego civil  trials in the past, this situation was much more serious, causing Greer to  impose a courtwide halt on new civil trials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I'm Not Happy'  </P> <P> "I'm not happy about not having a warning," he said. "I just think we got  overwhelmed. . . . My concern is why wasn't I told I was going to be  overwhelmed."  </P> <P> But Zumwalt rebutted many of Greer's claims. He said the judges' staff handles  both the new computer system and the scheduling of criminal trials. "We have no  control over that," he said.  </P> <P> He said the county clerk's staff reports daily to Exarhos about the status of  criminal cases, informing him of how many days are left before a case must go  to trial or be dismissed. If Greer or other judges weren't aware of the  oncoming problem, then it's because of a communications breakdown between the  judges and their staffs, Zumwalt said.  </P> <P> The current crisis, Zumwalt said, can be attributed to the large number of  judicial vacancies and the increasing number of criminal cases, which are  taking longer to prosecute. "I don't think there's anyone to blame for what's  happening," Zumwalt said.  </P> <P> In addition, Greer said it isn't the first time the county has been faced with  having too many criminal cases and too few judges. In the past, he said, the  problem has lasted from a few days to two weeks, but, until now, has never been  widely known by the public.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tuesday's Proceedings  </P> <P> Tuesday was the first full day of the ban, and, according to Greer, most things  went smoothly, with about eight criminal cases set for trial, fewer than the 17  or more anticipated last Friday. The criminal trials -- ranging from armed  robbery and a felon in possession of a gun to manslaughter to murder -- were  sent to civil and family courts.  </P> <P> For example, Judge James R. Milliken, who was in the midst of a two-week civil  trial, was assigned a double armed robbery trial. Milliken will either have to  stop the civil trial for a few days or decide to split his day in half, setting  aside time for both the criminal and civil proceedings, Greer said.  </P> <P> Judge Donald L. Meloche, who usually hears civil cases, was assigned a murder  case that is estimated to last six weeks. Judge Vincent P. Di Figlia had just  empaneled a jury for what is expected to be a lengthy civil case, but he was  forced to send the jury home so that he could begin a criminal sanity hearing  instead. Family Court Judge William J. Howatt Jr. was forced to take over a  criminal case on Tuesday afternoon. Some criminal cases were continued.  </P> <P> Three of four judges who were scheduled to attend a conference in Monterey  canceled their trips to help with the criminal backlog. Greer said other judges  have offered to cancel their vacations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 18 Vacancies on Bench  </P> <P> The Superior Court currently has 53 judges. It is authorized to have 71. Greer  said that, if the court had its full complement of judges, "I'd be trying every  criminal case" and every civil case, as well.  </P> <P> The court was particularly hurt with the recent retirement of three judges and  the elevation to the appellate court of two others, Greer said. He said he  hopes to have replacements for those five in a month or so. He said his  optimism is based on discussions others have had with Deukmejian. Greer says he  doesn't want to complain about the San Diego County situation directly to the  governor's office, saying he doesn't think "complaining gets you anything"  considering other demands on Deukmejian.  </P> <P> It may take a month or 60 days before the courts return to normal, the judge  said.  </P> <P> Greer met with a large group of civil attorneys at noon to "discuss how Humpty  Dumpty is put together again." He and others are worried that the sudden  onslaught of criminal cases will, in turn, lead to a crippling backlog of civil  cases.  </P> <P> Under the 1986 Trial Court Delay Reduction Act, San Diego is one of nine  California counties selected for a "fast track" pilot program aimed at speeding  along civil cases. As a result, 98% of all civil cases have been settled within  a year of filing in the county, with the rest going to trial within 13 months.  It is the certainty of having an open court in which to hold a trial that has  led to the many settlements, Greer and other legal experts say.  </P> <P> But now there is no such certainty, and the judge is worried it could play  havoc with the pilot program if things aren't resolved soon. For example, four  civil trials were postponed Tuesday and one other, concerning the battle over  the takeover of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Corp. by SCEcorp., was referred to  a court referee, a retired judge hired by the two parties to hear the the  non-jury case.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Odessa 16 June TASS -- "Ukrainian Armed Forces are  able to defend their land, sovereignty and inviolability of  state borders. In spite of the financial and material  difficulties, Ukraine has a ready-for-combat army. It does not  threaten anyone, however," Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk  told servicemen of the First Ukrainian Aeromobile Division  stationed in the Bolgrad District.    Touching upon "Crimean issues," Kravchuk emphasized that  they  should be solved only within the framework of Ukraine's  Constitution. "Member states of the European Union and other  countries support this position. Russian officialdom, including  President Yeltsin, is of the same opinion. According to the  acting Ukrainian Constitution and the trilateral agreement,  Ukraine is a sovereign state and no one is entitled to break its  integrity," Kravchuk said.    "We will not hamper the autonomous republic's drive for more  independence. The official Kiev is ready to consider (Crimea's  proposals to this effect). However, it should not be a matter  of territory. The territory of our sovereign state is  untouchable and no one should surpass the red line. We shall  defend our integrity in accordance with the Constitution and  shall not permit anyone to neglect our laws," Kravchuk  emphasized.</p>

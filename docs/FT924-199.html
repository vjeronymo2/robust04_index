			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Arms accords offer Bush a dignified exit PRESIDENT George Bush can leave office next month with three important arms reduction treaties under his belt after tying up the loose ends of the Start 2 nuclear missile cuts he agreed with President Boris Yeltsin last June. The pact, coming on the heel's of last year's Start 1 and of the 1990 treaty reducing conventional forces in Europe, will certainly provide a more triumphant tone to the final days of the Bush presidency than seemed likely after Mr Bush's decision to pardon Mr Casper Weinberger, the former defence secretary, and others involved in the Iran-Contra scandal. 'I think it's about the best gift we could have during this Christmas season,' commented Congressman Lee Hamilton, who is about to take over as chairman of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee. 'It is good news that these two powers will be reducing sharply their warheads and it certainly gives a good send-off for President Bush as he leaves the presidency.' While the details of the Start 2 agreement remained to be settled, Mr Bush had come in for some criticism for failing to seize the chance to clinch deep cuts in the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union. Some have even criticised the Start 2 pact for offering too many opportunities for 'breakout', where one power starts a rapid rearmament programme with the aim of securing a nuclear advantage. This is because both Start treaties will allow some 'down-loading' to convert multiple warhead missiles into single warhead missiles, and so present the possibility of 'uploading' by putting extra warheads back on. Most arms control specialists, however, argue that the risk of break-out is exaggerated: it would take a considerable time, can be monitored and would have little effect against weapons that can survive an attack and threaten retaliation, such as submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). The agreement leaves open the question of where disarmament efforts should now be focused. A hypothetical Start 3 agreement could, according to Mr Ronald Lehman, director of the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, aim for the elimination of all intercontinental ballistic missiles, the 'Greenpeace option' of eliminating all SLBMs, or the 'Reykjavik option' of eliminating both categories of weapon. But participants in a recent conference at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy warned that if the US pursues disarmament through the Start framework, it could slow down the political changes it wants in Russia, by strengthening the hand of Russian hardliners. The conference urged a broader approach to curbing the threat of nuclear proliferation.</p>

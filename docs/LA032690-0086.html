			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : CUTTING A PATH BEYOND THE MINUTEMEN'S SPRAWL  </P> <P> The forced insularity of the Orange County rock scene has forged some bands  with distinctive visions. Case in point: Friday's show at Bogart's in Long  Beach with Don't Mean Maybe, Eggplant and Bazooka.  </P> <P> Although Don't Mean Maybe's debut "Live Sample" album has just been released,  the trio has already been dismissed by some as Minutemen second-hands. But  while the convoluted rhythms and fierce attack Friday did beg some comparison,  the trio cut its own sure path through and beyond the Minutemen's sprawling  influence. While still a bit unformed lyrically, the group pumped a rampaging  sense of life into the skitter-rhythmed "Live Sample," an exuberant celebration  of coffee ("Happy Beans"), and even a version of the Zep's "Houses of the Holy"  that sounded like a Captain Beefheart outtake.  </P> <P> Eggplant was only scarcely less engaging, with not so great an ensemble spark,  but some well-crafted, pleasingly quirky songwriting and cliche-free guitar  excursions.

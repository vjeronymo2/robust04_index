			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent A. Yaroshevskiy; from the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today the leaders of all groups in the lower chamber  of the Russian Parliament and its chairmen sent a letter to  Boris Yeltsin containing a warning, to the effect that the  Russo-Georgian friendship treaty may not be ratified by the  State Duma. The main reason for apprehension is a possible  destabilization of the situation in the Caucasus, associated  with signing the treaty.    [Yaroshevskiy] Konstantin Zatulin, chairman of the State  Duma's Committee for CIS Affairs and Links With Compatriots, has  just ended a news conference, at which he acquainted journalists  with the committee's statement on the Russo-Georgian treaty.  Essentially the first serious non-acceptance of a presidential  decision by Duma deputies was occasioned mainly by worries about  exacerbating the conflicts in the Caucasus and the siting of  Russian military bases in Georgia.    Incidentally, Zatulin acknowledged that some information on  the subject leaked from the mass media, specifically from  Russian TV's political observer Nikolay Svanidze, yesterday.  Evidently, in a week's time, on Thursday, the State Duma will  debate Russo-Georgian relations, whatever the outcome of the  talks between Yeltsin and Shevardnadze.    [Zatulin] The State Duma cannot, has no right, and I think  from a moral and ethical point of view, ought not to instruct  the president of the Russian Federation as to where he goes or  when.</p>

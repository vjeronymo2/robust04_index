Rule 2(e) Proceedings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also solicits comment as to whether filers should be required to disclose all administrative actions brought by the Commission against a designated person pursuant to Rule 2(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice. <FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>  Rule 2(e) provides for the suspension or disbarment of certain professionals, usually attorneys and accountants, from practicing before the Commission. <FOOTCITE>99</FOOTCITE>  Where Rule 2(e) orders relate to violations of the federal securities laws, <FOOTCITE>100</FOOTCITE>  disclosure would be required under both the current and proposed rules. Should the requirements be expanded to encompass Rule 2(e) orders based on lack of professional qualifications, <FOOTCITE>101</FOOTCITE>  lack of character or integrity, or unethical or improper professional misconduct, <FOOTCITE>102</FOOTCITE>  the conviction of a felony or of a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, or the disbarment or revocation of a license to practice as an attorney, accountant, engineer or other expert? <FOOTCITE>103</FOOTCITE>  If not, commenters should provide specific reasons for any recommended exclusions. If it is determined that all Rule 2(e) orders should be disclosed, should disclosure of disciplinary sanctions imposed by other federal and state authorities or non-government professional associations, such as bar associations, for violations of standards of professional conduct also be required?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 98 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 201.2(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 99 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Practicing before the Commission'' is defined in Rule 2(g) [17 CFR 201.2(g)] to include ``transacting any business with the Commission'' as well as ``the preparation of any statement, opinion or other paper by any attorney, accountant, engineer or other expert, filed with the Commission in any registration statement, notification, application, report or other document with the consent of such attorney, accountant, engineer or other expert.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 100 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Rule 2(e)(1)(iii) [17 CFR 201.2(e)(1)(iii)], allowing the Commission to suspend or disbar a professional that has been found by the Commission in a Rule 2(e) proceeding to have violated federal securities laws, and Rule 2(e)(3) [17 CFR 201.2(e)(3)], which provides for a summary disbarment or suspension by the Commission where a court has enjoined the professional from future violations of the federal securities laws, or where the person has been found by a court or by the Commission in a separate proceeding to have violated those laws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 101 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 2(e)(1)(i) [17 CFR 201.2(e)(1)(i)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 102 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 2(e)(1)(ii) [17 CFR 201.2(e)(1)(ii)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 103 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 2(e)(2) [17 CFR 201.2(e)(2)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E.

For examples of civil actions finding legal proceedings over five years old to be material,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> see SEC v.

For example, should misdemeanors be described for a lesser period than felony convictions? Commenters favoring that approach should specify the types of proceedings to which the current five-year provision should continue to apply. On the other hand, disclosure may be appropriate for periods longer than 10 years with respect to certain types of legal proceedings_for example: criminal fraud convictions; civil, administrative and SRO actions based on fraud involving securities, commodities, financial institutions, insurance companies or other businesses; actions involving mail and wire fraud; and, proceedings resulting in the removal or bar from acting in a decision-making capacity in connection with a financial institution or other business. Should these types of legal proceedings be disclosed for longer periods, such as 15 or 20 years, or indefinitely? Should disclosure be required so long as the designated person is subject to the order? Commenters should provide an analysis in support of any specific time period recommended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> BOARD VOTES TO EXPAND LIQUOR WARNING LAW  </P> <P> The Board of Supervisors adopted an ordinance Tuesday that expands statewide  rules requiring businesses selling or serving liquor to post health warnings.  </P> <P> The action means an additional 505 businesses will be required to post warnings  that consuming alcohol can be dangerous during pregnancy.  </P> <P> Several hundred Orange County businesses are already covered by a state law  adopted by voters in 1986. The state law affects businesses with more than 10  employees that serve or sell liquor.  </P> <P> The new county ordinance expands the requirement to any business dispensing  alcohol regardless of the number of employees. However, the board's action only  affects businesses in the county's unincorporated areas. About half-a-dozen  cities in Orange County require a similar warning.  </P> <P> County Public Health Director L. Rex Ehling requested the measure, which takes  effect next month.  </P> <P> As part of Tuesday's unanimous vote, the board approved spending up to $11,000  to print the signs and enforce the ordinance. The warnings read: "Warning.  Drinking distilled spirits, beer, coolers, wine and other alcoholic beverages  during pregnancy can cause birth defects."  </P> <P> Last year, Ehling said, about 400 babies were born in the county with  alcohol-related defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome, the leading cause of  mental retardation in the United States.  </P> <P> "We believe that it is vital we reach as many pregnant mothers as possible and  alert them to the dangers of drinking during pregnancy," Ehling said. "This is  an important step to meeting that goal."  </P></p>

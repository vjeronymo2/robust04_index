			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Half-open government YESTERDAY'S moves to expose some of the workings of government to public scrutiny are welcome if long overdue. The publication of the membership of Cabinet committees will not change the world. And the 130-paragraph Questions of Procedure for Ministers is unlikely to enter the best-seller lists. But the workings of government will become marginally more transparent, allowing voters greater insight into what goes on in their name. Defenders of the old order such as Lord Armstrong, the former Cabinet Secretary, have warned that the removal of such restrictions means the end of ministerial solidarity. If every backbencher knows that the Cabinet has overturned the recommendation of a committee, the committee members will be unable to maintain straight-faced the convention of collective responsibility. It will be impossible to challenge foreign dictators or vanquish insurgents at home, the doomsters say, if ministers cannot present a convincing picture of unity. Such scenarios are less than convincing. Ministers who fall out with colleagues are already adept at using the lobby system to advance their case. Cabinet splits emerged during the Falklands War and the miners' strike without seriously impairing the government's efforts. Good government can withstand public scrutiny - indeed is more likely to thrive under it. The government is promising more openness to follow. Mr William Waldegrave, the minister in charge of the reforms, has found more than 150 restrictions on the disclosure of information which he hopes to tear up. Mr Major wants to clear the attics of Whitehall of old documents withheld from the public long after 30 years has expired. Veil of secrecy All of this is commendable. Two world wars shrouded British public life in a veil of secrecy which is only now being gingerly cast off. It is often easier to research recent British history in the US with its freedom of information legislation or even in the voluminous records of the old Soviet intelligence services which are now fully open to public examination. The government rightly claims that it has done much to make more official information available. Computerised data are now largely open on demand. Patients can inspect their medical records. Much more information is published about the performance of the public services. But Britain remains a country of unnecessary secrecy. Much government information about safety, for example, is unavailable to the public which pays for its collection. If information about the safety of pesticides can be published without breaking commercial confidence, why does not the same apply to new medicines? Public domain Fire inspections carried out in London Underground stations are in the public domain; those on British Rail are not. The Transport Department tests new cars for pollution standards and safety - and refuses to make the results available to consumers. Coroners' courts withhold documents on fatal accidents from government-funded safety researchers. Equally, the unfortunate imbroglio over the deaths of nine British servicemen in the Gulf 'friendly fire' incident has been magnified by official secrecy. The desire to sweep the incident under the carpet has added to the burden of bereaved families, damaged the reputation of the UK government and almost certainly made transatlantic relations worse. The government claims that a Freedom of Information Act would not help because it would deluge the citizen with information, much of it useless. Far better, ministers say, to create a culture in which the government machine releases willingly the information which the citizen needs. Such paternalism is not good enough: it is for the citizen to make the decision about what he or she wants to know. If there are reasons for withholding it  -on national security, commercial confidentiality or other acceptable grounds - the government must justify it case by case, subject to independent appeal. If Mr Major wants to go down in history as the instigator of open government  -an honourable aim - he will in the end have to take on the vested interests which resist a Freedom of Information Act.</p>

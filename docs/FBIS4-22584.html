			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with State Duma Deputy Anatoliy Lukyanov, Russian </F> Road group, by Viktoria Rabotnova; place and date not given:  "Prepare for October in the Spring"]    [Text] [Lukyanov] Civil peace is not all-forgiveness or  universal fraternization. True patriots, our people, will never  agree to make peace with those who have shell-blasted the  parliament and the constitution. There will be no accord on this  count.    Overall, accord in a society that is splitting into the poor  and the rich is difficult. It is impossible to reconcile these  contradictions on the social plane, but it is possible and  necessary to attempt to resolve them without armed conflicts and  bloodshed. Most people, including the communists, support  precisely this. Such accord assumes a whole series of actions  aimed at resolving all issues by consensus.    [Rabotnova] In other words, for you accord does not mean  giving up the struggle?    [Lukyanov] One may wish for anything. But try to reconcile  the poor--and even according to government data 38 percent of  the Russian population live below the poverty level--with a  handful of new millionaires. But we have to act within the  bounds of the constitution.    [Rabotnova] Which constitution?    [Lukyanov] Even this one, essentially not adopted because  only one-third of the population voted for it in the referendum.  The struggle must be conducted by legal means. There are ways:  strikes; speaking up against the regime in the press.    [Rabotnova] Your forecast: How will events develop from here  on?    [Lukyanov] It all depends on the correlation of forces; on  how realistically the president and his entourage appraise the  current situation. Unless shock therapy is rejected; unless the  reforms become at least minimally socially oriented, October may  shift to other months...</p>

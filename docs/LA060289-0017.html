			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CITY SECTION BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> CIZEK STAUNCHES LATE PALISADES THREAT;  </P> <P> INJURED PITCHER LEADS KENNEDY TO 4-A TITLE  </P> <P> In light of the restructured City Section 4-A Division playoff structure,  whereby teams played three games in three days this week, it figured that  pitchers would be pushed to the limit.  </P> <P> And of all the guys with weary wings, Kennedy High right-hander Mitch Cizek had  to be the weariest heading into Thursday's championship game against Palisades  at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> Cizek had pitched the final 3 2/3 innings to earn the win in Kennedy's  come-from-behind semifinal victory over Sylmar on Wednesday -- only eight days  after he sliced an artery in his right forearm trying to open a balky window at  a friend's house.  </P> <P> After the Sylmar outing, in fact, Cizek's arm sprung a leak.  </P> <P> "It was bleeding big time," the 6-foot, 170-pound senior said. "I was gonna go  to the doctor, but I didn't want to hear any bad news, so I decided not to go."  </P> <P> Cizek, somehow, nursed his tired and wounded arm through seven innings of gutty  pitching as Kennedy defeated Palisades, 4-3, before 5,206.  </P> <P> Talk about your house calls.  </P> <P> Cizek (9-4) allowed two earned runs, struck out six and walked six. He worked  one perfect inning, the fifth, and dodged bullets the rest of the way.  </P> <P> With Kennedy leading by a run entering the bottom of the seventh, Cizek retired  the first two batters and worked Palisades cleanup hitter Larry Levine -- who  clubbed his eighth home run of the season and drove in the winning run in the  seventh against Chatsworth on Wednesday -- to an 0-and-2 count.  </P> <P> Levine, however, slammed a ground-rule double into the left-field seats. Cizek  appeared shaken as he paced behind the mound, but Coach Manny Alvarado left him  in.  </P> <P> "He deserved to finish it," said Alvarado, who led the Golden Cougars to their  third 4-A championship in the 1980s. "The only way he's coming out is if he  totally loses it, and that wasn't going to happen."  </P> <P> Alvarado's confidence was well-placed. Cizek, who was named the game's most  valuable player, retired Larry Israel on a fly ball to left on the first pitch.  </P> <P> Kennedy (22-7) continued a streak of Valley dominance. No non-Valley team has  won a 4-A title since Venice did so in 1972.  </P> <P> Yet against Palisades (25-5), which knocked off top-seeded Chatsworth in the  semifinals, it wasn't easy.  </P> <P> With Kennedy leading, 4-2, in the sixth, Palisades scored a run on Kevin  Fisher's single to left. Fisher's hit put runners at first and second with no  outs.  </P> <P> John Myrow moved the runners over with a sacrifice bunt. Cizek, however, struck  out pinch-hitter Brett Garcia on a 3-and-2 curve for the second out and retired  Mario Cobian on a hard grounder to third.  </P> <P> "He's got a good head on his shoulders," said Mike Codron, who was named the  tournament MVP. "He didn't have incredible stuff, but he's a really smart  pitcher."  </P> <P> Others had expected Cizek to crumble.  </P> <P> "I thought he would fall," Palisades Coach Russ Howard said. "He seemed like he  was teetering. I think that's what made him so good."  </P> <P> The Golden Cougars picked up where they left off against Sylmar in the  semifinal round when they scored seven runs in their final two at-bats. Kennedy  scored two runs in the first inning off Cobian (8-1), a senior right-hander.  </P> <P> Mike Murray led off with an infield single and moved to second on a walk to  Gino Tagliaferri. Cobian then walked Garret Anderson on four pitches to load  the bases.  </P> <P> Travis Bourne followed with a line drive off the glove of Palisades second  baseman Fisher. As the ball bounded into short right field -- it was scored an  error -- Murray and Tagliaferri scored to give Kennedy a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Kennedy scored again in the second to take a 3-0 lead. Danny Gugler drilled a  leadoff single to left and, one out later, was sacrificed to second base by  James Campbell. Murray followed with an RBI-single to center. Pat DeBoer  singled to short to put runners at first and second for Tagliaferri.  </P> <P> But after the runners moved up a base on a wild pitch, Tagliaferri, struck out  to end the inning.  </P> <P> Cizek was firmly in charge early, allowing only an unearned run in the second  when the Dolphins closed to within 3-1.  </P> <P> Israel singled to open the inning and moved to second on a walk to Kevin  Boasberg. Palisades loaded the bases when Kennedy first baseman Bourne threw  low to first on Fisher's sacrifice-bunt attempt.  </P> <P> Cizek, however, retired Myrow on a fly ball to center, Israel scoring on the  play. A sacrifice bunt by Gary Sandorf moved the runners into scoring position,  but Cizek struck out Cobian.  </P> <P> Kennedy received a big break in the fourth. Jeremy Haas, in the game as a  pinch-runner for Boasberg, who had walked to lead off the inning, was easily  doubled up when he bolted for second on Fisher's routine fly to right.  </P> <P> Myrow then lined a two-out single to center and moved to second when Bourne  missed a pickoff attempt at first. Sandorf, the Dolphins' No. 9 hitter, looped  a run-scoring single over Tagliaferri at short to make it 3-2.  </P> <P> Despite the hardships of the past two weeks, Cizek insisted that he was ready  for more.  </P> <P> "The cut was the best thing that ever happened to me," Cizek said. "My arm felt  refreshed and I was never tired tonight. Heck, let's play another one."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INNOVATION: ARTIFICIAL LIFE IN THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION  </P> <P> Whether your taste in Dr. Frankensteins runs to Mary Shelley or Mel Brooks,  this is where you'll find them -- breeding, replicating, mutating, evolving and  exchanging their recipes for "life."  </P> <P> The Artificial Life II Conference -- co-sponsored by the Santa Fe Institute and  the Los Alamos National Laboratory -- is a primordial soup of biologists,  physicists, computer scientists and anthropologists all struggling not only to  evolve new theories of life but to actually create new forms. In the same way  that the artificial intelligentsia use computers as their medium and metaphor  to model thought, "A Lifers" rely on software and silicon as their virtual DNA  to emulate life and evolution.  </P> <P> " 'A life' is an attempt to abstract the principles of life from its material  organization and re-create them in other materials," says Chris Langton, a  conference organizer and Los Alamos A Lifer.  </P> <P> A Lifers are less interested in biology than in bio-logic. Where biology is  analytical, artificial life is synthetic. The idea is to craft self-organizing  systems that explain what life is even as they evolve into new forms of "life."  </P> <P> As scientific subcultures go, the A Lifers are atypically smart, enthusiastic  and inordinately fond of Gary Larson "Far Side" cartoons. They are passionate  -- even zealous -- in their belief that we are destined to share the world with  a multitude of evolving artificial life species. No doubt, a synthetic Frank  Sinatra will one day be crooning:  </P> <P>  That's (artificial) life  </P> <P>  That's what people say  </P> <P>  Riding high in April  </P> <P>  Reprogrammed in May  </P> <P>  In fact, the artificial life movement already offers a set of powerful  insights into the way technology and innovation will evolve. The awesome  results of billions of years of biology makes a compelling case to consider  evolution as a design strategy for new technologies.  </P> <P> For example, as computers and their software grow ever more complex, our  traditional programming methods dissolve into inefficiency. "If you can't write  a program, maybe you can evolve it," says Danny Hillis, creator of the  Connection Machine, a supercomputer that links tens of thousands of  microprocessors into a super-sophisticated network. "The dream is to evolve  programs that do things we want. We're not there yet, but there's reason to  believe that we're just about to be."  </P> <P> The challenge thus shifts from treating a computer program as something to be  engineered to viewing it as something that can be grown. Hillis believes that,  increasingly, people will design computer environments that encourage software  to "grow" in desired ways. Successful software -- the fittest -- will be  harvested.  </P> <P> Similarly, it only makes sense that biotechnology innovation becomes harnessed  to evolutionary dynamics. "Applied molecular evolution is the next stage of  biotechnology," asserts University of Pennsylvania biologist and MacArthur  Foundation "Genius Grant" Fellow Stuart Kauffman, who consults to industry.  Kauffman sees new generations of pharmaceuticals that are evolved as much as  they are engineered. By designing and accelerating evolutionary forces,  industry will be able to more effectively discover the best of billions of  possible molecular combinations.  </P> <P> But the burning ambition of these A Lifers isn't commercial -- it's to spawn  new life, to build self-perpetuating, adaptable and intelligent creatures that  can survive and prosper in the harsh environs of the The Real World.  </P> <P> "We have to prepare for the inevitable," asserts UCLA biologist Charles Taylor.  "We are all going to be living in a world filled with artificial life forms  that we haven't yet imagined."  </P> <P> Taylor and most A Lifers point to computer worms and viruses as but the first  crude artificial life forms to be propagated in the real world. These little  chunks of software can demonstrably spread and replicate, parasitizing little  personal computers and giant mainframes. A Life true believers insist that,  just as biological life evolved into higher and more sophisticated beings,  artificial life will likewise evolve more complex and powerful creatures. The  next century, they say, will see a co-evolution of carbon-based life forms and  silicon-based artificial life.  </P> <P> Other A Lifers are even more extreme. They see us humans as a mere evolutionary  stepping stone on the path to a more highly evolved, highly intelligent  silicon-based species. Carnegie-Mellon's Hans Moravec actually argues that  "This is the end" and that a "genetic takeover is under way."  </P> <P> Conference organizer J. Doyne Farmer of the Complex Systems Group at Los Alamos  asserts that "With the advent of artificial life, we may be the first species  to create its own successors. What will these successors be like? If we fail in  our task as creators, they may indeed be cold and malevolent.  </P> <P> However, if we succeed, they may be glorious, enlightened creatures that far  surpass us in their intelligence and wisdom. It is quite possible that, when  the conscious beings of the future look back on this era, we will be most  noteworthy not in and of ourselves but for what we gave rise to. Artificial  life is potentially the most beautiful creation of humanity. To shun artificial  life without deeper consideration reflects a shallow anthropocentrism."  </P> <P> Just call me a shallow anthropocentrist. To explore artificial life as a medium  to gain a better understanding into life is as worthy an intellectual adventure  as can be found. Anything we do to enhance our appreciation of the underlying  beauty and patterns that animate matter -- that give us life -- is a good  thing. Life should inspire a healthy mix of curiosity, fascination and awe. If  artificial life techniques yield a new generation of technologies for us to  co-evolve with, then so be it.  </P> <P> But if this emerging generation of young Dr. Frankensteins genuinely believes  that our destiny is to be superseded by our own software, then what they are  playing with is strictly loony tunes. Because what they literally want to give  birth to would be as threatening to humanity as that other technology to come  from Los Alamos: The Bomb.  </P></p>

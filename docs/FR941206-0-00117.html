			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's rules provide that any revenues received from a programmer, or shared by a programmer and an operator, must be netted against costs for purposes of calculating whether there has been an increase or decrease in external costs. 47 CFR 76.922(d)(3)(x). We extend this requirement for offsetting revenues against costs to the per channel adjustment factor for channels added to CPSTs pursuant to our revised channel adjustment rules. The revenues must be deducted from programming costs and then, to the extent revenues are remaining, from the per channel adjustment. Offsetting will apply on a channel-by-channel basis. Commissions received by an operator from programmers will be treated as revenues received from programmers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The per channel adjustment factor permitted by this Report and Order will apply only to net increases in channels from the highest number of channels offered on all CPSTs (excluding NPTs) on May 15, 1994, or any date thereafter. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  If an operator substitutes a new channel for an existing channel, no per channel adjustment may be made under the revised channel adjustment rules. Rather, the operator should continue to charge the residual associated with the channel that was dropped. To permit an operator to receive a per channel adjustment in these situations would encourage operators to evade the purpose of the revised going forward incentives by substituting new for existing channels simply to get an additional per channel adjustment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An operator may receive a per channel adjustment for channel X if it substitutes channel Y for channel X and then adds channel X back to the system, so long as the addition of channel X represents the required net increase in the number of CPST channels. In contrast, an operator that had 20 channels on its CPSTs on May 15, 1994, 22 channels on its CPSTs on May 15, 1995, and 21 channels on its CPSTs on January 1, 1996, may not obtain a per channel adjustment for adding the 22nd channel back to its system on May 15, 1996. Rather, the 22nd channel is treated as a channel substitution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> c. Operator's cap.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the addition of new channels to CPSTs on or after May 15, 1994, the Commission establishes a per subscriber cap on the amount by which monthly cable rates may increase between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1997. Operators may not make rate adjustments to monthly rates totalling more than $1.20 per subscriber over the first two years of the three-year period or more than $1.40 over the full three-year period. Rate changes prior to January 1, 1997, resulting from programming costs of new channels must fall within the Operator's Cap unless they are covered by the License Fee Reserve. Price increases will be counted against the Operator's Cap when rates are increased as a result of channel additions, not when the addition occurs. Any rate increases pursuant to the revised rules shall be subject to the notice and prior approval requirements of the Commission's regulations. See 47 CFR 76.932, 76.933, 76.958, 76.964. In addition, operators will be required to send the Commission copies of the notices sent to subscribers. The Operator's Cap will apply only to operators using the 20 cent per channel adjustment in our new rules. It will not apply to operators that elect to use the existing rules to adjust rates for channel additions occurring on and after May 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Operator's Cap on the rate increase attributable to the addition of new channels to CPSTs is based on historical increases in numbers of channels offered. It is necessary because without such a cap, the per channel mark-up could create an incentive for operators to add large numbers of channels to CPSTs so as to increase the aggregate mark-up received. This result would undermine the 17% competitive rate reduction previously ordered by the Commission and could raise overall rates toward monopoly levels that would have occurred in the absence of the 1992 Cable Act. An unreasonable CPST rate also would cause the CPST to be an unattractive choice for subscribers, thereby removing it as a viable competitor to an NPT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Commission adopts the Operator's Cap because there is no evidence that consumers want to pay for an unlimited number of channels in CPSTs. The cap will also provide operators with incentives to choose which new services offered on CPSTs would be most demanded by subscribers. Finally, because the per channel adjustment of up to 20 cents reflects an average based on historical data, adjusted for the lack of effective competition, it may provide some operators with a greater incentive to add channels than would exist in a competitive market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> d. License fee reserve.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission also establishes a License Fee Reserve of 30 cents which operators may use, between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1996, to recover programming costs for new channels. The License Fee Reserve may be applied against the initial license fee or any increase in the license fee for channels added during the first two years that the Operator's Cap is in effect. During this period, operators also may use all or any portion of the amount permitted as a per channel adjustment under the Operator's Cap to pay for license fees in excess of the License Fee Reserve. License fees incurred in the third year the Operator's Cap is in effect may be passed through to subscribers as external costs without counting against either the License Fee Reserve or the Operator's Cap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 30 cents License Fee Reserve would allow 6 channels to be added at an average license fee of 5 cents per channel. The 5-cents average, per channel license fee falls within the range which the Commission observed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

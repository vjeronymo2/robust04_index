			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Wider tendering 'would cut costs' MUCH greater use of competitive tendering would reduce the cost and improve the quality of public services, the Institute of Economic Affairs says in a report published today. The free-market think tank says local and central government organisations continue to place obstacles before companies which might bid for contracts. It identifies scope to extend competitive tendering in local government, the health service, fire services and some police work. The institute calls for the Audit Commission, the local-authority watchdog, to investigate councils which have contracted out few or none of the services subject to compulsory competitive tendering. The report says the rule which excludes tendering of activities worth less than Pounds 100,000 a year should be examined to see if the limit could be lowered. The size of some contracts is an obstacle to bidders, the institute says. Many local authorities package work to be contracted out in ways which suit their in-house workforce. The institute says an upper limit should be set on the size of contracts, forcing the contracting-out organisation to offer separate contracts of more manageable size. While all the contracts might be won by a single contractor, 'economies or diseconomies of scale should be discovered rather than assumed', the report says. The report also recommends that experiments should be launched in contracting out the management of hospitals and schools. Testing the Market. IEA, 2 Lord North Street, London SW1P 3LB.

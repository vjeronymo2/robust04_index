			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Bonds: World Bank launches DM2bn five-year global The World Bank launched its long-awaited DM2bn global offering of five-year eurobonds yesterday. The issue, offered with a spread of 15 basis points over German government bonds, will be priced today, lead managers Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley said. The offering, the World Bank's second global D-Mark issue, was generally well received, syndicate managers said. The deal follows the bank's Dollars 1.5bn global issue last month. Its first D-Mark global offering, of 10-year bonds, was launched in October 1993. The joint lead managers reported particularly strong demand from the US. Demand from German investors was reasonably strong, given current volatile market conditions, they said. They estimate that the bonds will be sold mainly to institutional investors, with 60 per cent going into Europe, 20 per cent into North America, and 20 per cent into Asia. 'With the old 10-year global bond trading quite actively, the five-year maturity enables the World Bank to establish a new benchmark,' said a syndicate official at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. In the Australian dollar sector, Bank Austria braved the volatile 10-year maturity with an ADollars 100m offering, guaranteed by the City of Vienna and priced to yield 35 basis points over the benchmark bond in Australian dollars, the September 2004 Commonwealth bond. Lead manager BZW said the deal met very good demand from institutional investors in Europe and the Far East who were attracted by the high coupon. Two deals were brought in the French franc sector. Horus, a Cayman Islands special purpose vehicle which holds bonds issued by the OECD, launched a FFr1bn 10-year deal guaranteed by Ambac, the US insurance group. Lead manager Societe Generale said the deal had met strong demand from institutions in Europe, which were attracted by the guarantee and the spread of 28 basis points over comparable French treasury bonds. SocGen said the spread did not change after the bonds were freed to trade. Commerzbank Overseas France launched a FFr2bn five-year deal late in the day, which lead manager Credit Commercial de France said was aimed at the Swiss and Benelux retail market. The proceeds were swapped into floating-rate D-Marks. Banque Nationale de Paris, the privatised French bank, tapped the two-year sector for L150bn, offering a coupon of 11 1/8 per cent. Mr Niccolo Nuti, head of capital markets at Credito Italiano, the book-runner, said investors were attracted by the high-quality name and the coupon, which was higher than the L150bn Bayerische Hypobank deal brought last week. Municipal Finance Authority of British Columbia launched a 10-year, CDollars 46m deal with an 8 1/2 per cent coupon. Lead manager RBC Dominion Securities said CDollars 1.5bn of bonds are due to be redeemed this month in the Canadian market.</p>

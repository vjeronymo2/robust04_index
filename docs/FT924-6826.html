			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: Whitbread In dreadful trading conditions Whitbread did well to maintain pre-tax profits in the first half, and deserved to see its share price yesterday claw back part of the recent losses. Market share in beer showed an increase without any margin loss. Boddington looks to have been a big success, particularly in the fast-growing take home market where it has come from nowhere to become the leading brand. Perhaps the most impressive performance, though, was in food sales where Whitbread seems to be reaping some reward for its recent heavy capital investment. Success in striving with recession, though, cannot disguise the lack of market domination in any one region, or the continued dependence on the UK. The shares remain a geared play on recovery in the south-east in particular. The outlook is not good enough to justify an improvement in its below-average market rating.</p>

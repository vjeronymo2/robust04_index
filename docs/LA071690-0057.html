			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> RAILS: The rail transit system opening today between Long Beach and L.A. (A3,  E1) will someday have a line to Santa Ana, if planners have their way. . . .  They already have a route selected -- the same right-of-way used three  generations ago by the legendary Red Cars of the Pacific Electric. The 34-mile  route from L.A. to Santa Ana opened in 1905. Six years later, peak-hour trains  were making the 1-hour, 15-minute trip every half-hour. James S. Granelli and  Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Letter: No not a maybe to leaving ERM Sir, For the record, my answer to the question 'Would leaving the ERM help Britain?' is an emphatic no, not a maybe as you report (July 18). To leave would be to throw away the prize of inflation to be won from the pain of the last two years. Equally, a devaluation within the ERM would be a serious error, though there may be circumstances in the future (with inflation and government borrowing under control and an independent Bank of England) where a devaluation within the ERM would be less damaging. The government has no alternative but to stick to its current policies: these offer the prospect, for the first time for a generation, of low and stable inflation. The alternatives would throw away this prize. David Currie, Centre for Economic Forecasting, London Business School, Sussex Place, Regent's Park, London NW1 4SA</p>

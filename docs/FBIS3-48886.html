			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Policy Project Teams Reach Height of Activity    "Project teams" to "coordinate policies of the ruling  coalition" are being established one after the other. During  December, project teams began consultations on "Agriculture and  Agricultural Community Projects" to discuss measures to be taken  after the partial decontrol of rice markets, "Decentralization  of Central Government Authority" and "Access to Information."  Early next year, project teams will be initiated on a total of  13 projects, to include "Residential and Land Issues" and  "Improvement of Bidding Procedures for Public Works Projects."  However, even though each project team arrives at a conclusion,  they often encounter a situation in which difficulties are faced  in reaching interparty agreements or an agreement cannot be  reached on how to proceed with the discussions.    Project teams of the ruling coalition have been initiated  and  are managed with the motto that "zoku Diet members" will not be  created.    The reason for this approach is the strong criticism  directed  at the adhesion between so-called "zoku Diet members"--wielding  a strong influence over policy decisions by the ruling party  during the Liberal Democratic Party days--and specific elements  of industry.    Projects are initiated when an issue arises by summarizing  the scope of the issue. In the past, project teams were  established on topics such as "Cold-Weather Countermeasures" and  "Relaxation of Crop Conversion Programs" to respond to poor rice  harvests as well as "New Trunk Rail Lines" and "Annuities." Team  positions are expressed in the form of "reports" which are  submitted to the policy executive committees of supervising  government agencies.    However, because the team in charge of the New Rail Trunk  Line issue specified the name of the new line proposed for  construction, the respective coalition parties were critical,  and the discussions were returned to their initial starting  point.    In the case of the team in charge of annuities, it was  unable  to engage in in-depth discussions because an interparty  agreement could not be reached on how to conduct discussions on  annuity reform, while treating central government treasury  obligations and tax issues as separate issues.    Mamoru Nakajima, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Policy  executive and chairman of the policy executive committee  responsible for coordinating efforts of the project teams has  said, "Although we are speaking of project teams that were  established under the concept of banishing zoku Diet members,  failure to brake the current trend will only result in the  establishment of an unlimited number of project teams. It would  be more efficient if the project teams were established on the  basis of broader topic areas." Already, the potential has arisen  for a return to "LDP-style" project teams.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |List of Ruling Coalition Project Teams                                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Team Title               |Chairperson              |Party                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cold-Weather Countermeas-|Takashi Tanimoto         |Social Democratic Party  |  |ures Team                |                         |of Japan [SDPJ]          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Relaxation of Crop Conve-|Kazuhiko Tsuji           |SDPJ                     |  |rsion Programs Team      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |New Trunk Rail Lines Team|Masao Sakon              |SDPJ                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Annuity Team             |Nobumichi Tsukada        |Democratic Socialist Par-|  |                         |                         |ty                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agenda 21 Team           |Tomiko Okazaki           |SDPJ                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Minamata Disease Team    |Asahiko Mihara           |Japan New Party, Sakigake|  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Atomic Bomb Victims' Aid |Tadayoshi Morii          |SDPJ                     |  |Law Team                 |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Product Liability Law Te-|Eiki Kurata              |Komeito                  |  |am                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Access to Information La-|Jiro Kainuma             |Komeito                  |  |w Team                   |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Basic Law for Promoting  |Tetsuo Yamaguchi         |SDPJ                     |  |the Decentralization of  |                         |                         |  |Central Government Autho-|                         |                         |  |rity Team                |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agriculture and Agricult-|Kazuhiko Tsuji           |SDPJ                     |  |ural Community Projects  |                         |                         |  |Team                     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

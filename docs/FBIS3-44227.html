			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Libreville, 26 Jan (AFP) -- The prices of essential  commodities have increased these past days in Malabo, the  capital of Equatorial Guinea, and Bata, the second largest city  of the country, despite the freeze placed on goods by the  government, Equatorial Guinean radio monitored in Libreville  said today.    Some traders even hoarded some goods such as soap, cooking  oil, rice, and milk in order to cause a shortage and to increase  prices on the markets, the radio said, but did not give figures  as examples of the price increase.    Equatorial Guinea, the last country to join the franc zone  in  1985, was until now free from all price increases brought about  in the zone by the announcement of the devaluation of the CFA  franc by 50 percent.    "The situation is unbearable in Malabo where traders have  increased the prices of all their goods. People are now waiting  in lines to buy a kilo of rice whose price has doubled," a  Malabo inhabitant commented over the phone from Libreville.    This situation "is all the more serious because the  devaluation occurs at a time when the purchasing power of the  Equatorial Guineans is very low and the government has not yet  even planned to increase salaries," he added.    The average salaries in Equatorial Guinea range from about  CFA 25,000 to CFA 30,000.</p>

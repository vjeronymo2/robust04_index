			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Hardanger shares suspended Correction (published 19th April 1991) appended to this article. SHARES IN Hardanger Property, the Kidderminster-based property company, were suspended at 65p while the company sought the support of its bankers. 'Following delays which have occurred in a number of property disposals, and in particular one relatively large project, the company's level of borrowings has remained uncomfortably high,' it said. At the September year-end it had borrowings of Pounds 72.1m, compared with assets of Pounds 19.8m. Interest costs in its last financial year were Pounds 8.1m, compared with rental income of Pounds 2.5m. Hardanger has been unable to make sufficient property sales to finance its income deficit because turnover in the property market has virtually ground to a halt in recent months. The company said that it was vigorously pursuing a programme of disposals and that a further announcement would be made, possibly this week. The large project alluded to in the announcement was a department store in Plymouth, which the company acquired in January in a property exchange with Legal &amp; General. The company's main bank is Barclays. Correction (published 19th April 1991). Borrowings of Hardanger Properties at the end of September totalled Pounds 72m, compared with the group's gross assets of Pounds 134m. The asset figure was incorrectly stated in Thursday's paper.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, February 25 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji today urged Japanese firms to increase their  technology transfer to China to help it modernize the country.    "My answer is very clear: I want Japan to give us more  technology," Zhu replied to a question during a press conference  at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo.    He said he was pleased that a rising number of Japanese  corporations had began to give know-how to their Chinese  partners while doing trade with them.    Japan ranked first in the transfer of foreign technology to  China last year, in which 28 percent of China's technology  imports came from Japan, he noted.    "It's great. It will eventually benefit Japan's economic  development," he added.    The advancement of Chinese technology will help upgrade the  competitiveness of Japanese products on the international market  since most of the transfer were done through Japan's joint  ventures with China there, the vice premier explained.    Zhu, who is in Tokyo on a nine-day visit, cited as a model  of  bilateral technology cooperation the start of videorecorder  production in Beijing last year with full technology given by  Matsushita, a Japanese electronics giant.    He hoped that more Japanese makers will follow Matsushita in  doing so.    Zhu underlined the importance of Japanese support for  China's  reform and economic development and vowed to work hard to boost  Beijing's ties with Tokyo.    He said he felt satisfied over recent years' "marked  progress" in bilateral trade, which totaled 39 billion U.S.  dollars in 1993, an increase of 54 percent over the previous  year.    But he said this is still short of its potential in view of  the present good relationship between the two countries.    Japan overtook Hong Kong as China's biggest trading partner  while China became Japan's second largest trading partner after  the United States in 1993.</p>

A  statement said he had been waiting for months for a Chinese  response to comprehensive proposals forwarded to Beijing.  London had also offered again without responses to send  Director of Immigration Laurence Leung Mingyin to Beijing for  talks.    Governor Chris Patten yesterday said: "In view of what's  being said about people going to Beijing, I'd just like to make  that absolutely clear and say that, alas, we haven't had a  positive response yet.    "But I very much hope that Director Lu Ping's remarks  yesterday, coming as they do after what we've been saying for  the last few months, represent a Chinese response which (we)  will be able to follow up, because it is the sort of area where  we should be able to co-operate in the interests of (the) people  of Hong Kong on an issue about which everybody feels very  strongly."    Mr. Lu said yesterday China wanted to issue SAR passports  before the 1997 change-over and appealed for Britain's  co-operation in supplying information. The British JLG  statement said Mr Lu's remarks were "noted with interest".    Following agreement on transitional arrangements for the  continued validity after July 1, 1997 of existing travel  documents issued by the Hong Kong Government, Britain had put  detailed and comprehensive proposals to China on July 15 last  year. "Our proposals dealt with such issues as eligibility  criteria, types of travel document and period of validity." The  statement said the British side had sought detailed expert  discussions on these matters as soon as possible so that the  documents could be issued immediately from July 1, 1997.</p>

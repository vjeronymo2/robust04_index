			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Observer: In absentia Stand down Concorde. The good news is that Lord White's court appointment in Colorado in just over a fortnight need not stop him from attending Hanson's annual general meeting the same day. The district attorney's office in Aspen says White's attorneys can re- present him first time out. The less good news for White is that Jim Wilson, Aspen's deputy DA, still hasn't made up his mind whether to push on with assault charges. Tom Dalessandri, number two in Aspen's police department, is continuing investigations. True, White's young girlfriend Victoria Tucker has retracted the allegations. But Colorado takes domestic violence issues seriously - which is why the DA's office, and not the victim, has responsibility for deciding whether or not to proceed with a case. Although the sporty lord is no stranger to the gossip columns, even he would not relish having to defend his private life in a US court. So he can hardly be sleeping easier for the thought that an ambitious DA might decide to proceed against him. What's more, a counter-suit against the Aspen police department would only prolong the embarrassment.</p>

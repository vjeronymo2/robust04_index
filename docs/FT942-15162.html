			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Markets Report: Sterling firm The release of a better than expected March UK retail inflation figure yesterday gave rise to renewed optimism about the prospect of lower interest rates, writes Philip Gawith. Few observers believe a cut is imminent, but the case for an easing of credit policy has been bolstered by underlying retail price inflation falling to 2.4 per cent in March - in the lower half of the government's target range. The improved outlook was reflected in short sterling futures, with the June contract closing nine basis points higher at 94.73. Sterling was fairly stable with the trade weighted index closing at 79.9 after opening at 79.8. It closed in London at DM2.5233 after finishing on Thursday at DM2.5239. Elsewhere, weaker than expected March industrial production and capacity utilisation figures in the US undermined the dollar. The US currency finished at DM1.7124 against the D-Mark from DM1.7088 on Thursday. Ireland joined the round of European rate cuts by lowering its short-term facility rate to 6.50 per cent from 6.75 per cent. Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, said the good RPI number provided confirmation that the underlying UK inflation trend was still favourable. He doubted, however, whether it had direct policy implications. The recently released minutes of monthly monetary policy meetings revealed that 'good inflation is a necessary, but not a sufficient, criterion for the Bank of England to cut again. It would need to see a slowdown in the economy because of higher taxes' said Mr Lyons. The Bank of England provided Pounds 170m of late assistance to the UK money markets. Earlier it had provided Pounds 73m assistance, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 350m. Taken together, the two US data released yesterday, were slightly weaker than the market anticipated. Industrial production rose 0.5 per cent in March, while capacity utilisation in mines, utilities and factories rose to 83.6 per cent from 83.4 per cent. Although slightly below expectations, the capacity figure was not far short of 85, historically seen as the level at which inflationary pressures are triggered. Analysts said the data was keeping the dollar well underpinned, but not providing fresh buying support. Placing downward pressure on the dollar is the resurgent yen. No fresh initiative to deal with the US/Japan trade dispute emerged from the meeting in Marrakesh between Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and Mr Tsutomu Hata, the Japanese foreign minister. Increasingly the market is tending towards the view that the dollar will weaken further, falling through Y100 to record lows. Elsewhere in Europe the D-Mark finished stronger against most European currencies. The Italian lira slipped further to L956 from L954.8 as a squabble about the election of a speaker in the Senate renewed fears about the prospects for a stable government following the recent elections. The Spanish peseta finished at Pta81.61 from Pta81.31, weakened apparently by rumours that the Economics minister would be resigning.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (28): When 13 is lucky - Profile, The Essar Group THE BROTHERS Shashikant and Ravikant Ruia are a superstitious pair. They assiduously avoid travelling on the same aircraft, and 13, they believe, is their lucky number. The corporate headquarters of their Essar Group - with annual sales of Rs10bn - are housed on the 13th floor of an office block at the Nariman Point, South Bombay's premium business district. The global ambitions of Essar (a name derived from the brothers' first initials) have borne fruit. With annual sales of Rs4.45bn, the group Essar Gujarat operates the world's largest gas-based, hot briquetted sponge iron plant (with an annual capacity of 1.76m tonnes), at Hazira, an industrial township on the western coast. In August this year the company made its debut in the international financial markets with a Dollars 75m Eurobond issue that was oversubscribed seven times. The next big venture is a Rs52,000m, 9m-tonne project in oil refining, an area recently thrown open to India's private sector. Additionally, Essar has put in bids for exploration of 13 oil blocks of which two are in partnership with Occidental Petroleum of the US. Essar has the experience. Two years ago it won onshore drilling contracts from Shell in Oman and Petromina in Indonesia. The Ruias belong to a breed of nimble-footed businessmen who over the past decade have risen from oblivion to the front ranks of Indian business, displaying more dynamism than old established groups such as Tata and Birla. Starting with a small inherited shipping agency exporting iron ore in the early 1970s from their base in Badras, the Ruias moved into marine construction and offshore support services and then further afield. Today, group gross fixed assets are Rs41.8bn, net profits collectively Rs2.3bn and market capitalisation Rs40bn. All this is generated from four core areas: steel, shipping, oil and services. These fit in nicely, they say, with the country's core sector, national priorities and their own competencies. In the past, critics have pointed to the Ruias' skill in winning friends in high places. The state Oil and Natural Gas commission has been a loyal customer for drilling rigs and offshore supply vessels, for example. Such assured custom cannot be expected in the more open markets of the 1990s. The Ruias say they are ready for competition since international market dynamics have always dictated their businesses. The aim, explains younger brother Ravi Ruia, has been 'to create worldscale capacities and absolutely ensure that we have a competitive edge on a global basis'. The Ruias display a keen entrepreneurial instinct for spotting a good business opportunity - even in fields that they are unfamiliar with. This brashness has been more than matched by their ability to learn fast. In marine construction, Essar started out as a contractor for Brown &amp; Root and ended up as an equal partner with the marine engineering company when they jointly undertook construction of an underwater pipeline from Bombay High oilfield to the coast of Gujarat. Much of their fleet of bulk carriers and offshore vessels were picked up when shipping was at an ebb and prices down and two years ago the Ruia bought into the profitable South India Shipping Company in which they now hold a 30 per cent stake. Their hunch that economic growth would fuel demand for steel prompted their decision to get into sponge iron, an alternative raw material to expensive, imported scrap. The plant was picked up from Emden of Germany at a bargain price of DM27m (Pounds 10.80m) and put up in a record 24 months. From this followed a downstream plunge into hot rolled coils, a form of semi-finished steel for export markets. The brothers are moving further downstream having set up Steelco, a joint venture with another private group for the manufacture of cold rolled coils. Similar joint projects are being planned in Indonesia, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia. This global focus has not made them lose sight of the domestic market. 'This is our base. India itself offers tremendous opportunities. And liberalisation has only opened up new areas for us,' says Ravi Ruia. Essar has entered the growing financial services industry with its company India Securities which offers lease financing and bill discounting among a range of activities. The group is also building a 350MW power project in Surat, in Gujarat, which will be for captive use for its steel plant. All these ambitions add up to a mammoth investment of Rs100,000m over the next five years. The group has relied on equity rather than expensive debt. Since 1985 the Essar group has mopped up Rs17,260m from half a dozen issues. The brothers have responded to criticism that the group is too centralised with a management restructuring last year. A profit centre system was put into place wherein authority was devolved to division heads. But Essar remains a family affair. Five years ago Shashi Ruia's son Prashant Ruia, a commerce graduate was drawn into the business and is now in charge of Essar Oil. The brothers say they have a perfect understanding in the workplace (Shashi is the operational man and Ravi assesses new projects) where they sit at opposite ends of the boardroom-sized corner office that they share. 'We can't think without each other,' says Ravi.</p>

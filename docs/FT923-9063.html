			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Government Bonds: Nordic markets jittery on Finnish rate decision THE Bank of Finland's decision to raise its key tender rate from Monday left Nordic government bond markets in a jittery state and pushed up bond yields. The Bank will raise the tender rate to 16.0 per cent from 14.62 per cent, in an effort to stem the outflow of capital from the country. The prime minister announced a package of economic measures yesterday evening aimed at restoring confidence in the Finnish financial markets. Yields on Finnish government bonds have risen recently, with the 11 per cent bond due 1999 now yielding 12.7 per cent, against 12.3 per cent last Friday. The Swedish government bond market responded to the sudden rise in Finnish short-term interest rates, with government bond yields increasing initially. However, yields later fell, and the bond due 2003 ended the day with an unchanged yield of 10.06 per cent. Dealers said the Swedish market had been helped by some positive news in the form of a well-received Treasury-bill auction. DESPITE a larger-than-expected rise in weekly jobless claims, US Treasury prices fell yesterday as dealers adjusted their positions ahead of today's July employment report. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/16 at 106 15/32 , to yield 7.447 per cent. The two-year note was also weaker, albeit only slightly, down  1/32 at 99 15/16 , yielding 4.266 per cent. Normally, Treasury prices would have responded favourably to the news from the Labor department that the number of people claiming state unemployment insurance rose 69,000 in the week ending July 25 - the largest rise in weekly claims since 1982. Analysts, however, pointed out that the big increase in claims was almost entirely the result of the company-wide shutdown of General Motors during the last two weeks of July and other layoffs in the car industry. FRENCH government bond prices closed higher across the yield curve helped by the combination of Wednesday's opinion poll in France on the Maastricht Treaty and a general sense of relief that the Bundesbank had decided to leave interest rates unchanged at yesterday's council meeting. The opinion poll - which indicated firm support among voters for European economic and monetary union ahead of the September 20 referendum on the ratification of the Treaty - helped spur buying by foreign investors, particularly at the longer end of the yield curve. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 fell from 9.07 per cent to 8.98 per cent. At its auction yesterday, the French Treasury sold FFr6.58bn of bonds due 2002 at an average yield of 9 per cent, and FFr4.18bn of bonds due 2023 at an average yield of 8.94 per cent. Dealers said that the French bond market was able to absorb the new supply without any problem. NEWS that the Bundesbank had decided to leave its key interest rates unchanged following the central bank's council meeting yesterday helped to nudge up German government bond prices. The bund market had been worried that the Bundesbank would raise the Lombard rate, following the rise in the discount rate from 8.0 per cent to 8.75 per cent on July 16. The Liffe bund futures contract moved up to 87.07 by late afternoon against the previous day's close of 86.95. STERLING weakness and funding concerns continue to hold the UK government bond market in check, and gilt prices ended the day either little changed or only slightly higher. The Liffe futures contract opened at 96.24 and traded up to 96.29 by late afternoon. Dealers said the gilt market was waiting for the Bank of England to make an announcement about its next auction - possibly as early as today. THE Japanese government bond market closed lower with the benchmark No 129 under-performing the rest of the market. The No 129 is due to relinquish its position as the benchmark bond issue soon, with the No 145 seen as the likely successor. The four tranches of the No 145 become fully fungible in September. The yield on the No 129 opened at 4.945 per cent, corresponding to the high price of the day, and closed at 5.03 per cent. In the futures market, the September contract opened at 104.95, reached a high of 104.97, and closed at 104.65.</p>

"But I was  pleased with our defensive pressure."  </P> <P> The team features several veteran players, including one who has played  professionally with the Harlem Globetrotters and in Europe -- 30-year-old  co-captain Lynette Woodard.  </P> <P> The United States won the bronze medal in baseball with a 10-4 victory over  Canada.  </P> <P> Jorge Fabregas had a single, double and triple, and Darren Bragg drove in three  runs.  </P> <P> Cuba defeated Japan, 6-1, for the gold medal as Jorge Valdes pitched a  four-hitter and Antonio Pacheco hit two home runs.  </P> <P> Cuba, winners of 19 of the last 22 world championships, hit four home runs,  including three in a row in the seventh inning.  </P> <P> The other American team to find success was the men's volleyball squad, which  beat the Soviet Union, 8-15, 15-13, 17-16, 9-15, 15-6.  </P> <P> Super-heavyweight Larry Donald of Cincinnati stopped Wolfgang Haas of West  Germany at 2:59 of the third round in boxing, while Edward Escobedo of  McKinney, Tex,, was beaten, 5-0, by Vasile Dumitroaie of Romania.  </P> <P> U.S. featherweight champion Oscar de la Hoya of Los Angeles, 17, the youngest  boxer in the tournament, stopped Lee Sang-Hun of South Korea at 2:55 of the  third round.  </P> <P> But Edward Escobedo, the U.S. champion at 201, lost a three-round decision to  Vasile Dumitroaie of Romania.  </P> <P> Ivan Robinson of Philadelphia, won a 4-1 decision over Kirkor Kirkorov of  Bulgaria at 125 pounds.  </P> <P> In the light-middleweights, Paul Vaden of Puyallup, Wash., beat Alexander  Kunzler of West Germany, 3-2. Chris Byrd of Flint, Mich., lost, 3-2, to Torsten  Schmitz of East Germany.  </P> <P> The United States has a 16-8 record in three days of competition.  </P> <P> Lori Norwood of Bryan, Tex., won the women's gold medal in the modern  pentathlon with 5,288 points after a day in which she placed first in the  two-kilometer run, second in equestrian and tied for ninth in the 200-meter  swimming.  </P> <P> Second was Tatiana Chernetskaya of the Soviet Union, with 5,179 points.  Kimberly Arata of Vandenberg, Calif., took the bronze with 5,130 points.  </P> <P> In men's competition, Anatoli Starostin of the Soviet Union won the gold medal  with 5,640.80 points.

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Work changes agreed at Lever Brothers WORKERS ATLever Brothers, the detergents subsidiary of Unilever, have agreed in principleto changes in working practices after being told that they would not receive anannual pay rise until they did. Shop stewards representing 1,750 workers at Lever Brothers' two plants at Port Sunlight, Merseyside, and Warrington, Cheshire, recommended broad acceptance of the changes in return for an immediate 8 per cent pay rise backdated to January. The broad-ranging changes, known as Horizon 2000, include new shift patterns, the calculation of working hours over a year, a single pay structure for blue and white-collar workers, and performance appraisal for manual workers. After delays in agreeing the package, the company told workers last month that they would not backdate any annual pay settlement if it was not approved by April. It also indicated that it would consider implementing the measures later than June. The company told workers that if there was industrial action it would withdraw guarantees of no compulsory redundancy and alter early-retirement policies. It said itneeded changes to combat a serious decline in sales during the recession. Mr Steve Thomas, chairman of shop stewards at Port Sunlight, said the stewards recommended acceptance of the offer as the only sensible option. The company has offered a 12 per cent rise once details are agreed. A further 8 per cent will be paid next January, and performance increments - which it estimates might add another 10 per cent to wages  - in January 1993. The changes in shift-working arrangements, with a move towards multi-skilling and more teamworking, are intended to make the measures self-financing. The company is also offering a new training scheme and harmonised pay and conditions. Mr Peter Wright, personnel manager for the plants, said he expected to be told today that the unions had accepted both the principle of joint negotiations covering the sites and the main principles of the working practices changes. Unions had originally been pressing for a one-year pay deal which would not be tied to acceptance of Horizon 2000. The company insisted that it would not pay any rise beforesuch an agreement and would not backdate it if there were delays.</p>

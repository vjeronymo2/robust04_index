The same  investigations led to the arrests of 66 persons linked with the  drug traffic, from whom the agents seized a total of 11  heavy-caliber firearms, over 1,000 cartridges, and 32 automotive  vehicles equipped for transporting drugs.    According to the briefing reports sent to the Federal  Judicial Police [PJF] General Directorate, headed by Commander  Adrian Carrera Fuentes, the most significant operation took  place in the warehouses of a transportation company on the  border in Tijuana, Baja California. There, the police found two  plastic drums holding 35 liters of hashish resin, a highly toxic  drug.    Upon his arrival to pick up the drug shipment, Agustin  Corrantes Sanchez, who was loading the drug containers onto his  pickup truck, was arrested by federal agents. With information  he provided, the federal prosecutor's office ordered the arrest  of his boss, who answers to the name of Jorge Abraham Zazueta  Felix. Both subjects claimed that it was only a shipment of  anti-oxidant used in the manufacture of lard. According to  experts on the subject, to obtain hashish a ton of marijuana is  required for each liter of the toxic substance. This means that  at least 35 tons of cannabis indica were used to produce the 35  liters confiscated.    Moreover, on the site known as "La Escondida," in Arramberi,  Nuevo Leon, the Federal Judicial Police and municipal police  seized two tons and 367 kg of dried and packed marijuana, bound  for the border at Reynosa, Tamaulipas. From there, it was  intended to be shipped to the United States. Arrested in the  operation were the presumed drug dealers, Silvano Aguilar Colin  and Filomeno Ruiz Martinez, who had concealed the drugs in the  false bottom of a truck body. [passage omitted]    The PGR agency in Nayarit, for its part, announced the  arrest  of Peregrin Villagomez Bazan and Luis Alberto Gamez Hernandez in  the vicinity of Ixtlan del Rio. They were carrying 182 kg of  very high quality cocaine in five suitcases stored in the trunk  of a sedan type vehicle.    In Quintana Roo, PJF personnel discovered 21 kg of the same  alkaloid scattered on the Cancun beaches at a site known as  Caleta de Manati. Presumably dropped by an airplane, the drugs  were intended to wait for pickup by the fliers' accomplices, who  would sell them.    The department's agency in Baja California, for its part,  reported the seizure of 234 kg of the chemical precursor known  as ephedrine. It was detected underneath the seats on a  passenger bus driven by Jose Manuel Moctezuma Torres, Ramon  Rosales Fernandez, and Gabriel Garcia Linares. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Jamaican purchase to boost stout sales GUINNESS is to acquire a majority stake in Desnoes &amp; Geddes, the Jamaican brewer of Red Stripe lager, in a move designed to expand sales of the UK group's stout throughout the Caribbean. The group is paying between Pounds 41m and Pounds 45m for a 51-55 per cent shareholding in the Jamaican brewer, which has brewed and distributed its stout since 1987. The Desnoes and Geddes families, and Heineken, the Dutch brewer, will retain holdings in the company. Guinness has been exported to the Caribbean since 1818 but sales in Jamaica  -which accounts for 35 per cent of the English-speaking Caribbean market - have more than doubled in volume since 1990 to 1.5m cases. The stout now has a 15 per cent share of total Jamaican beer sales. The UK group also has a wholly owned subsidiary in Trinidad and the stout is brewed by associate companies in St Vincent and Grenada. Mr Brenda O'Neill, managing director of Guinness Brewing Worldwide, said: 'Given D&amp;G's strategic significance in the Caribbean beer market and its leadership in Jamaica, the Guinness offer represents a logical step in the regional development of the brand.' In the year to September 1992, D&amp;G made pre-tax profits of JDollars 347m (Pounds 10.5m) on sales of JDollars 2.26bn. Its Red Stripe and Dragon beers, together with Guinness, Heineken lager and McEwan's ale, which it brews under licence, form a strong brands portfolio. The company also produces and markets a range of soft drinks and franchises Pepsi-Cola and Schweppes. The Guinness deal will not affect D&amp;G's contracts in the UK where Red Stripe lager is brewed under licence by Charles Wells and distributed by HP Bulmer.</p>

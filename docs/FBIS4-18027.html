			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Kolesnichenko] </F>   [Text] New York, 29 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- There is no danger  of a fresh coup attempt in Russia. Russian Federation President  Boris Yeltsin expressed confidence of this in an interview with  the American ABC television network. There is, of course,  opposition but it is weak, he said. It consists of nothing more  than small groups. All state and administrative structures --  the army, internal troops, the Ministry of Internal Affairs --  are on the president's side. People have now changed. B.  Yeltsin pointed out that he foresees no situation in which he,  as president, could not control the situation in the country.    Asked whether the idea of retiring has occurred to him, the  Russian leader said that he has thought of this, but "each time  I found myself remembering how much I still have to do before  June 1996." Asked about his long-term plans, B. Yeltsin merely  said that his aides advise him to stop saying that he will not  seek reelection.    During a discussion of international problems the Russian  president was asked: "Are you not shocked, as many others  throughout the world are, by the ethnic cleansing being carried  out by Serbs in Bosnia?" "Not only am I shocked," B. Yeltsin  replied, "I condemn the Serbs for not keeping their word." At  the same time he expressed hope that a situation in which Serb  positions would be subjected to fresh air strikes will not  arise. "We have a partnership with the United States. Even if  there are areas over which we disagree, we still must not react  brusquely to them or conduct a dialogue from a position of  strength," the Russian leader added.    In another part of the program he was asked about his  health.  "I am a healthy man," B. Yeltsin said. "This problem is being  brought up by the opposition, especially the communists. They  simply want to spoil my mood."</p>

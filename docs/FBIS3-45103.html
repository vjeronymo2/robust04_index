When meeting with visiting U.S. Senator John F. Kerry, who  is  also a member of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Rong  noted that China and the United States have no conflicts of  fundamental interests.    Instead, he added, the improvement of bilateral relations is  not only in the fundamental interests of the two peoples but is  beneficial to world peace and development.    More U.S. statesmen and entrepreneurs are welcome to visit  China and make joint efforts with their Chinese counterparts to  enhance mutual understanding and prompt exchanges and  cooperation in the fields of trade and economy, science and  technology, Rong told Kerry.    "Given the different cultural and historical backgrounds as  well as social traditions, it is normal that China and the  United States hold different views on some issues," Rong said.    "The differences should be resolved through equal  consultations in the spirit of mutual respect and seeking common  ground while preserving differences."    Kerry said that during his current visit, he has witnessed  the major progress China has made in many fields.    Rong and Kerry exchanged views frankly on the renewal of  China`s most-favoured-nation trading status.    Zhu Liang, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the  Chinese National People`s Congress, was among those who  participated in the meeting.</p>

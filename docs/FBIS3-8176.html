			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev by </F> Maria Graczyk in Krakow on 23 February: "Miracles of Diplomacy"]    [Text] [Graczyk] The declaration signed by the presidents  of Poland and Russia in Warsaw says that Poland's membership in  NATO is a question of a sovereign decision by Poland itself.  Yet a few weeks later, Boris Yeltsin sent a surprise letter to  Western leaders, calling on them not to expand NATO. Why was  the Russian president's behavior not consistent with the  declaration?    [Kozyrev] Maybe because he did not read the declaration very  carefully. We diplomats are accustomed to studying every single  document with painstaking care, but nondiplomats tend to skim  them. The things we are saying today are contained in the  Russo-Polish declaration. In conformity with the CSCE, we  believe that any decisions reached by Poland are an expression  of that country's freedom of choice. The Polish state defines  its own needs and expectations, and takes sovereign steps in  this or that sphere. It also decides whether to take part in  the work of various international organizations.    However, the declaration says nothing about Russia, an  independent state just like Poland, not having the right to  present its own ideas, especially on how fast the European  security system is to be established. Just as we believe Poland  may decide freely on whether to join NATO, we believe that there  is no point in hurrying to join NATO. There is nothing  inconsistent about that.    [Graczyk] In that case, what do you mean by the expression  "Russia's special interests in this part of Europe"?    [Kozyrev] The Russians and Poles have historical links. We  share a border in the Kaliningrad Oblast, and we both belong to  the Baltic Cooperation Council. The very creation of this  council is proof that both countries share common interests.  One reason for this, of course, is that both of our countries  border on the Baltic Sea, to say nothing of our cultures and  economic relations.    Minister Olechowski presented me with a Russo-Polish  economic  cooperation program. That is also evidence of special ties  between our countries, stemming from a desire to develop  cooperation in particular spheres. But that does not mean that  we have imperialist longings or a desire to dominate others or  indulge in diktat, and I am sure Poland does not want to dictate  an economic policy to us. It would not be fair to interpret  Minister Olechowski's speech in such a way, even though he did  mention a special interest in cooperating with Russia. By the  way, Russia's "special interests" do not apply only to Europe.  They also apply to other parts of the world--for example,  Mexico.    [Graczyk] Poland is also interested in other eastern  neighbors, including Ukraine and Belarus. How do you assess  Polish diplomatic moves in this region?    [Kozyrev] As a great power, we value ourselves too highly to  develop an inferiority complex. On the other hand, we respect  democratic Poland too much to detect any Polish neoimperialism  in such positive aims as economic development or political and  cultural cooperation with CIS countries. Although I myself am  sometimes accused of harboring neoimperial tendencies, I cannot  say the same about my Polish friend and colleague.    [Graczyk] Differences of opinion between Poland and Russia  on security in this part of Europe are well known. Both you and  Minister Olechowski have declared a rapprochement of views since  the Krakow meeting.    [Kozyrev] Our perspectives are undergoing constant  modification. It would be naive to think that, with the speed of  change today, the declarations of any one politician will  continue to be valid in 10 years' time. That would be a miracle  of diplomacy. Therefore, every hard-pressed diplomat reacts to  his surroundings, shifting the balance in his views and  adjusting his stance.    Minister Olechowski and I are keeping a close eye on what is  happening around us. We also listen to each other and take each  other's views into consideration--hence, certain nuances and  changes of opinion. But, basically, we agree that a common  Europe has to be built together by means of dialogue. But one  should not make hasty and unpremeditated decisions that could  turn out to be inconvenient for one side or the other. We must  all continue to work on this. One cannot expect miracles in  diplomacy.</p>

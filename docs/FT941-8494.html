			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Digital expands in Scotland Digital Equipment, the US computer manufacturer which is continuing to make heavy losses, is to invest Pounds 90m at its two plants in Scotland. The investment will increase capacity in semiconductor and computer manufacturing. The company will invest more than Pounds 65m in new equipment at its semiconductor plant at South Queensferry near Edinburgh and more than Pounds 20m on manufacturing capacity at its plant at Ayr, Strathclyde, to meet consumer demand. The South Queensferry plant, which Mr John Major, the prime minister, visited yesterday during a tour of Scotland, is Digital's only facility making its high-powered Alpha microprocessor. The new investment will enable the plant to produce the next generation of Alpha chips. Digital has agreed with Advanced Micro Devices, the US semiconductor maker which is a rival to Intel, to produce its microprocessors at South Queensferry. It expects output of the Am486 to reach a rate of 2m a year in the first half of next year. The Pounds 90m investment will bring to about Pounds 300m the total that Digital has invested in Scotland in the past 18 years.</p>

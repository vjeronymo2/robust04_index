Manuel  Camacho Solis, special commissioner for peace and reconciliation  in Chiapas, held a news conference this morning. He said peace  will not be achieved with sketchy information. Hence, peace  will be achieved with a dialogue and, above all, with  understanding, he said.    He admitted that yesterday and today he received some  messages concerning the possibility of holding a dialogue with  the members of the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN].  However, we have yet to confirm that these messages are from a  person who truly represents this armed group, he emphasized.    Manuel Camacho Solis also said the following:    [Begin Camacho Solis recording] Yesterday and this morning I  received one or two messages through certain persons in  different parts of the country. The first signs of the  possibility of a communication have appeared, but we have a big  responsibility. We must cooperate so the tranquillity generated  yesterday is used to take a new step toward the achievement of  peace.    We will not achieve this with poor communications, an error  in the dialogue, or without taking into consideration the  context of the region and the region's relationship with the  rest of Mexico. What do I mean by this? I mean there is an  organization, the EZLN -- a political, military, ideological,  and united organization. Any error in communication through a  false mediator, someone who does not truly represent the EZLN  positions could preclude the possibility of really establishing  a communication. [end recording]    Manuel Camacho Solis said various issues must be taken into  consideration in these negotiations, above all the culture and  customs of all these persons. In addition, Chiapas is a mosaic  of culture, he said; adding that, for example, the word  agreement and the word peace do not mean the same -- or do not  have the same significance -- for any of the Indian communities  in the region. Therefore, the goal must be mainly to achieve  harmony. He added that the doors are open for a dialogue but,  he emphasized, they are not open for opportunism.    The news conference was also attended by San Cristobal  Bishop  Samuel Ruiz. He said Mexico is currently afflicted by an  endemic disease and will not be cured by the first dose of  medicine. It requires an in-depth treatment which truly takes  into consideration what occurs in this universe, rather than  only in Chiapas, because Chiapas is not only part of the Mexican  territory, Chiapas is also an essential part of the country. He  said that backwardness and all the problems that have prevailed  must be analyzed point by point and part by part. [passage  omitted]    A march was scheduled for noon today, organized by various  communities in San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas. We saw many  children carrying signs that ask the EZLN to put down their  weapons and emphasizing the state wants peace and harmony.    Also, a news conference held by representatives of the  Mexican Bishops Conference ended a few minutes ago. It was,  obviously, attende? by Monsignor [Adolfo] Suarez Rivera,  president of the Mexican Bishops Conference, who issued an  appeal to the people urging them to open their eyes because  Mexico is now a different country. He said the armed conflict  in Chiapas has awakened a hidden Mexico. Suarez Rivera  emphasized that Mexico must undergo changes in its government  structures, its society, and its Catholic Church.</p>

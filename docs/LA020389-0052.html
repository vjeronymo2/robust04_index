			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TANK TRUCK SPILLS OIL ON I-805 AS RAIN BRINGS MISHAPS  </P> <P> Roads slick from intermittent showers, which are expected to last through  Sunday, contributed to several San Diego-area auto accidents Thursday morning,  the California Highway Patrol reported.  </P> <P> At 7:55 a.m., a tanker truck jackknifed on Interstate 805 southbound near Mira  Mesa Boulevard after a car entering the freeway struck the front axle of the  tanker.  </P> <P> The tanker trailer unhitched and ended nose down, spilling 700 gallons of  petroleum over the southbound lanes. Firefighters used sand barriers and  plastic wading pools to contain the spill.  </P> <P> Cynthia Mullen, 18, the driver of the car, was injured and was taken to Scripps  Memorial Hospital-La Jolla for observation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arrival of a Cold Front  </P> <P> Firefighters from San Diego, Del Mar and Solana Beach aided in cleaning up the  spill. There were no injuries to the truck driver.  </P> <P> About 14 vehicles were involved in four separate fender-benders on California  163 between 6 a.m. and 7:30 a.m. No serious injuries were reported, the CHP  said.  </P> <P> A collision of another sort seems to be the cause of the rains.  </P> <P> Chill air from an Alaskan cold wave traveling down California in a low-pressure  system has collided with warm air coming up from Mexico, causing periodic light  rains that are expected to last through Sunday, the National Weather Service  said.  </P> <P> Forecasters predict a 30% to 40% chance of showers this weekend. Otherwise, it  will be partly cloudy and breezy at times, with cool temperatures.  </P> <P> "I don't think it will be a bad weekend," forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said.  "But you can't rule out the showers. The rain we get should be small rains, so  it's not going to be too dismal."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stagnant Pattern  </P> <P> This stagnant pattern of light rains will not change much until early next  week, when a heavy storm headed this way from Hawaii is expected to hit,  Shigehara said.  </P> <P> Temperatures today through Sunday are expected to range from 55 to 60 degrees.  Nighttime lows for the coastal strip will be 47 to 50. Inland, nightly  temperatures will drop to 40 to 50 degrees.  </P> <P> The mountains will have highs of 35 to 40 degrees, with lows of 25 to 30. The  northern cold air has lowered the snow level to 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  </P> <P> Deserts are expecting highs in the 60s, with lows in the high 30s and low 40s.  </P> <P> The surf will be 2 to 4 feet, with water temperature at 54 degrees.  </P></p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / World Trade News: US threat to tear up UK air accord The US is threatening to tear up its bilateral aviation agreement with the UK in frustration at the lack of progress in negotiations between the two countries over a new agreement. 'The possibility of renunciation will be one of the tools that will be on the table,' Mr Federico Pena, the US transportation secretary, told a congressional committee yesterday. 'We see it as an option of last resort, but it is an option,' Mr Pena said. The US walked out of talks with the UK last year in protest at what it viewed as the inadequacy of British proposals to increase US airlines' access to coveted landing slots at London's Heathrow airport. The UK, in exchange, wants greater access to the US domestic market, and in particular an easing of restrictions on foreign ownership of US airlines. This is important to British Airways, the principal UK carrier, because of its large investment in USAir. A US transportation department official said yesterday no talks had been held since December, and none were scheduled. Renunciation of an aviation agreement is not unprecedented - France, for example, renounced its agreement with the US last year - and need not lead to any immediate disruption of air travel between the two countries. It would, however, raise the likelihood of a serious trade crisis between the two countries. Mr Daniel Kasper, an aviation expert said the US-UK row was dispiriting because both countries shared an interest in much broader liberalisation of air traffic worldwide. 'Instead of looking at the existing pie, the parties need to focus on the expanding pie that would be available to them,' he said.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Pakistan president ousts PM in power struggle PAKISTAN'S president last night dismissed the government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif and appointed an interim military-backed administration. The decision was the climax to a bitter power struggle between Mr Sharif and President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, who accused the government of corruption and terrorising its opponents. Mr Khan dissolved the national assembly and ordered fresh elections for July 4. Troops loyal to the president guarded state television and radio in Islamabad, but there was little sign of violence or unrest on the streets. The 78-year-old president acted just hours after meeting Ms Benazir Bhutto, the opposition leader, whose government was ousted in a similar move by him less than three years ago. The meeting was widely seen as a thaw in their relations. The president replaced Mr Sharif with Mr Balakh Sher Mazari, a little known feudal landlord from the province of Punjab. The interim government will also include members of Ms Bhutto's party. One of two ministers sworn in last night, Mr Farooq Leghari, is among Ms Bhutto's closest aides. Mr Sharif, who was at the time a protege of Mr Khan, won the general elections held after Ms Bhutto's government was sacked on charges of corruption in August 1990. Mr Sharif initiated wide-ranging reforms to unshackle the economy from bureaucratic constraints. He claimed last night that his ousting was intended to sabotage his economic policies and vowed to challenge it in court. But senior government officials said the new government would try to reassure the business community that its interests would be protected in the face of fears of a reversal of Mr Sharif's policies. On taking over his caretaker role, Mr Mazari described the business community as 'the backbone' of the country. Less than 24 hours before his dismissal, Mr Sharif indirectly accused the president of supporting the government's opponents and campaigning to oust it. The president said he was stepping in because of the recent resignations of members of the national assembly and of government ministers, which had worsened relations between the federal government and the four provinces. He accused the government of 'maladministration, corruption and nepotism'.</p>

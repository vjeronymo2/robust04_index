			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Revving up for the Pounds 20m Mansell show: John Griffiths visits Silverstone racetrack, where business is thriving for this weekend's British Grand Prix THIS WEEKEND, a 750-acre corner of Britain has found a temporary cure to the economic malaise sweeping the rest of the country: the racing driver Nigel Mansell. While the weather and economic clouds have cast gloom over this year's corporate hospitality scene from Wimbledon to Royal Ascot, the organisers of the British Grand Prix at Silverstone in Northamptonshire say they sold the last available hospitality space three weeks ago. Advance ticket sales have been 30 per cent higher than last year, when a total of 200,000 people attended over the three days of practice and racing  -making the grand prix the UK's single biggest paid spectator event. At Silverstone, it was being taken for granted that the circuit's attendance record would be broken this weekend as decisively as Mansell broke the lap record in practice yesterday. Pre-filed flight applications show that tomorrow Silverstone's grass strip will once again become the world's busiest airfield, with nearly 3,000 movements, mainly of helicopters. Ms Corinna Phillips, public-affairs manager for Silverstone Circuits, has no doubt that it is because of 'the Mansell factor' - the increasing prospect that this year Britain will have its first grand prix world champion since James Hunt in 1976. 'Like everyone else, we had a slow start this year,' said Ms Phillips. 'But when Mansell started winning, sales picked up enormously.' Supporting Mansell's progress in person requires a substantial commitment of the wallet for private and corporate punters alike. The basic admission price is Pounds 50 on race day; an additional Pounds 100 secures a seat in the grandstand. While most corporate hospitality is handled by agencies such as Keith Prowse, Silverstone Circuits offers its own direct hospitality package - at Pounds 250 a head. When ground rent payable by stallholders selling everything from T-shirts to tow ropes is taken into account, total receipts accruing to Silverstone Circuits are believed to approach Pounds 20m, although the figures are not released. The profits do not end up consolidated in the accounts of some large leisure group. Silverstone Circuits is owned by the British Racing Drivers Club and is charged with ploughing the proceeds into circuit facilities and subsidising the lower-profile club racing on which Mansell and all his grand prix colleagues cut their competitive teeth. Mansell himself loves Silverstone. He regards it as his spiritual home and it has been the scene of some of his greatest triumphs - not least a crushing victory there last year. With time running out at the age of 38, he now has his best chance yet of winning the world championship. He won the season's first five races in a row - unprecedented in grand prix racing - and then came second in Monaco to his arch-rival Ayrton Senna of Brazil, driving for McLaren-Honda. He failed to finish in the Canadian grand prix, but scored his sixth victory in France last weekend. That win brought his total tally of victories to 27 - equalling Jackie Stewart's 19-year-old record. Yesterday he was at Silverstone driving his 700-horsepower Canon-sponsored Williams-Renault FW14 B for the first practice. Typically, he is still trying hard to damp down what he says is an erroneous, if widely held, assumption that he has the championship in the bag. 'I've only won 66 points and there's another 90 points to win.' Realistically, he says, 'we know we'll get beaten sometimes in the next few races'. The lugubrious manner in which he doles out such sentiments, and his frequent comments on mechanical shortcomings, have contributed to a widespread media image of Mansell as a 'whinger' - an image hotly contested by his team. Sheridan Thynne, Williams's long-standing finance director, says: 'What the press interprets as whingeing is actually Nigel demanding the highest standards.' It is understandable that Williams and executives of Renault, the French state-owned company that supplies his engines, should be so supportive of Mansell. For Williams, this year's world championship would be its first since 1987 and would greatly facilitate Thynne's task of raising the more than Pounds 20m which, he says, Williams needs for each season's racing. About 90 per cent of that comes from sponsorship. With the possible forced retreat of the tobacco companies - because of threatened broadcasting restrictions - the hunt for more sponsorship may soon become anxious. They provided the lion's share of grand prix teams' funding. The French anti-smoking lobby came close to blacking out the French grand prix last weekend, winning a court ruling that for every tobacco name or image broadcast, TFI television would be fined Pounds 1,000. TFI broadcast anyway, and on the basis of the 1,250 such images shown on the preceding Canadian grand prix, stands to be fined more than Pounds 1m. It is away from the racetracks that a triumph by Mansell, Renault and Williams over Honda would be most deeply appreciated. In the boardrooms and research and development departments of Renault and other European car companies, victory would be seen as the best possible riposte by a European motor industry frequently depicted as withering under an unstoppable technological onslaught from Japan.</p>

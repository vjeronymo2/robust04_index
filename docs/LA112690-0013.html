			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Greek Film Flap: The Greek government vowed Friday to help the country's  leading film director fight an Orthodox bishop who has threatened to burn the  film set and excommunicate locals if they help on his latest film. Bishop  Augoustinos Kandiotis of Florina claims the film, directed by Theodore  Angelopoulos, is unpatriotic in calling for the abolition of national borders  and that the script for "The Suspended of the Stork" contains erotic scenes.  </P> <P> "The government unreservedly supports Theodore Angelopoulos and the shooting of  his film," Culture Minister Tzannis Tzannetakis said. Angelopoulos, the winner  of awards at the Cannes, Venice and Berlin film festivals, will start filming  in Athens on Dec. 3 and in Florina on Dec. 17. Marcello Mastroianni will star  in the $3.3-million production. Among Angelopoulos' prize-winning films are  "Landscapes in the Mist," which opened Oct. 31 in Los Angeles. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

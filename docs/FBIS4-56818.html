			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Extravision" newscast; passages within quotation </F> marks are recorded]    [Text] The Government Ministry will ask the National  Legislative Assembly to expedite approval of the draft narcotics  law. Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta today announced that  the U.S. Government will contribute $100,000 to the fight  against drug trafficking. He also announced that the Nicaraguan  Government will present a formal request to the United States to  open a DEA office in the country. [Sandinist] Deputy Doris  Tijerino, chairperson of the Legislative Assembly drug  committee, recently warned of the danger that such a move would  represent, saying that opening a DEA office in Nicaragua would  be an affront to national sovereignty.    Minister Alfredo Mendieta rejected drug trafficking charges  against members of the National Police [PN], calling the  incidents a campaign to discredit the institution. Today he  denied that any high-ranking PN officer was involved in drug  trafficking and affirmed that there are political motives behind  the accusations.    [Mendieta] "I strongly deny that the PN, as an institution,  could be involved in any way. I strongly reject any implication  of involvement by PN Brigade Commander Fernando Caldera. I  think it is all politically motivated. Although this may  surprise the media, I think there are some politicians behind  all this, as I have said from the beginning."    Commander Roger Ramirez said that he has done nothing  illegal, much less behind the backs of the PN commanders. He  was referring to his 25-percent partnership in a hotel on Corn  Island, which represents a $55,000 investment. He said he  received the money as compensation from the Government Ministry.  Mendieta confirmed Ramirez' statements.    [Mendieta] "We have no evidence indicating that Commander  Ramirez was ever involved in drug trafficking or any other  drug-related crime. We are aware of Mr. Ramirez' investments,  and he has told us that these funds came from payments made by  the Government Ministry during his transition and in  compensation for injuries sustained in the line of duty."    The government minister today strongly criticized those who  want to discredit the PN.    [Mendieta] "You cannot implicate an institution such as the  PN, which has demonstrated a high degree of efficiency in the  fight against drug trafficking. Furthermore, we believe it is  even more dangerous to implicate certain individuals who are in  fact involved in drug trafficking." [sentence as heard]    Commander Roger Ramirez stated that he has the full support  of Brigade Commander Augusto Fernando Caldera as well as of his  commanding officer, Lionel Espinosa, both of whom are well aware  of the fact that he requested his discharge for family and  health reasons. Ramirez said he has no enemies in the PN ranks.    [Ramirez] "If there is any kind of ill will over this whole  matter, as some newspaper reports indicate, I do not think it is  coming from the PN. Then again, I cannot say that for a fact,  because one minute you think you have friends, and the next they  stab you in the back."    Ramirez said his conscience is clean.    [Ramirez] "I think there are some people interested in  discrediting me simply because I tried to maintain a  professional image within the institution in accordance with the  ground rules the government set forth for the institutions that  make up the Armed Forces. In the end, I have a clean and  peaceful conscience."    Commander Roger Ramirez presented documentation for his  partnership in the Corn Island hotel and for his bank accounts  and bank deposits, which total less than $12,000.    [Managua EL NUEVO DIARIO in Spanish on 2 May publishes a  475-word report on pages 1 and 8 stating that "EL NUEVO DIARIO  has learned that PN Brigade Commander Caldera forced Commander  Roger Ramirez to resign." The report goes on to say that "our  sources assured us that Ramirez was found to have a checking  account with a $240,000 balance, which he could not explain,"  adding that the "DEA advised Caldera that the funds were from  drug trafficking activities." The report warns that "the  entangling nets of drug trafficking are gaining ground in  Nicaragua," pointing out that "one high-ranking officer has  become addicted to cocaine" and the identity of another, "known  as the `narco-policeman,' will soon be released."]</p>

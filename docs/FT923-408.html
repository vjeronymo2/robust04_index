			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Commission discretion over competition priorities The European Court of First Instance (CFI) has ruled that the European Commission has a discretion not to investigate complaints under the EC competition rules. In a judgment with implications for future competition law enforcement, the CFI said the Commission had the right to exercise such a discretion, particularly when it felt it was in the Community's best interests not to take any action. The decision arose out of a case brought by Automec, an Italian car dealer, which had complained to the Commission about its exclusion from the BMW dealership in Treviso. Automec had also taken action against BMW in the Italian courts, alleging infringement of EC competition rules when BMW terminated its distributorship after 24 years. The Commission rejected Automec's complaint on two main grounds. First, the Commission said it was powerless to order BMW to supply cars or to permit use of its trade mark, when the only allegation of infringements of the competition laws concerned restrictive agreements and not abuse of a dominant position. Second, the Commission claimed it was not obliged to issue a decision on alleged infringements of the EC competition rules. It said it was only required to decide whether to investigate or reject a complaint. If it considered a complaint did not itself contain sufficient matters of fact or law to indicate an infringement, which it was within the Commission's powers to terminate, the Commission had a discretion whether or not to investigate the complaint further. The Commission, as an administrative body, had to select priority areas for action in the interests of administrative economy, it said. The issues raised by Automec were already before the Italian courts which had concurrent jurisdiction to apply the relevant competition rules. No question arose of individual exemption, which was the only area of exclusive Commission competence. The CFI dismissed Automec's appeal. The court, drawing together aspects of previous caselaw, approved the Commission's position that it can decide not to investigate a complaint where it considers its resources better employed elsewhere in the Community interest. While the Commission is still obliged to examine every competition complaint, it now has the Court's authority to decline to investigate complaints which do not in themselves contain sufficient evidence of an infringement. Case T-24/90, Automec v Commission, CFI, FC, September 18 1992. Commission failure to act on competition complaint The CFI has condemned the European Commission for failing to take a position on a complaint under the EC competition rules within time limits set down by the Treaty of Rome. The complaint was brought by French car dealers against five Japanese car importers and the French government. The allegation was that their imports from other member countries were restricted by French government arrangements with the French Toyota, Mazda, Honda, Mitsubishi and Richard Nissan importers. The car dealers claimed the five Japanese importers undertook to limit French sales to 3 per cent of annual car registrations, excluding competing distributors of Japanese makes. In exchange, the French government imposed discriminatory restrictions on competing Japanese imports. The dealers called for action by the Commission under the Treaty of Rome's rules. But when the Commission failed to define its position within the two-month time limit, they brought an action against the Commission in the CFI. The Court rejected the Commission's claim that the action was inadmissible. However, it said that there was no need to rule on the substance of the application because the Commission had later defined its position and eventually issued a decision rejecting the complaint - a decision which is also under appeal (Case T-7/92). The Court rejected the complainants' other actions for annulment and damages. This case is important in confirming previous caselaw on actions for failure to act. It also makes it clear that subsequent definition of its position by the Commission outside Treaty of Rome time limits may not make a failure to act action before the Court inadmissible. Case T-28, Asian Motor France and others v Commission, CFI FC, September 18 1992. No review of favourable competition decision The Dutch banking industry has failed to overturn a favourable Commission decision declaring that certain transfer charge arrangements were permitted under EC competition rules. The banks, represented by the Dutch federation, challenged the reasoning of the Commission's decision in so far as it found their agreement restricted competition within the common market. The reason for the Commission's clearance of the agreement was that it found no significant effect on trade between EC member countries. The CFI ruled the judicial review action inadmissible because the operative part of the Commission's decision had not been challenged. Only acts capable of affecting defined legal positions are susceptible to review. It is only the operative part, not the reasoning, of a Commission decision that can produce such legal effects. Moreover, the Court may review only the legality of the Commission's reasons which support the operative part of the decision. In this case, the finding that the agreements restricted competition was manifestly not a reason relied on for the decision granting negative clearance. Case T-138/89, Nederlandse Bankiersvereniging v Commission, CFI 2CH, September 17 1992. Free movement rules not applicable in purely domestic context The European Court of Justice has confirmed that Treaty of Rome rules on free movement do not cover activities limited to the territory of a single member country. The Court said that was a matter for national courts. Case C-153/91, Camille Petit v Office National des Pensions, ECJ 5CH, September 22 1992.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: PLAYING IT STRAIGHT  </P> <P> Robert Downey is known for his movies' offbeat subject matter, but with his  latest dark comedy -- "Too Much Sun" -- he admits: "I've learned a lot from  this one."  </P> <P> Currently on the festival circuit, the CineTel Films production has the late  Howard Duff as a dying millionaire whose gay son (played by Eric Idle) and  lesbian daughter (Andrea Martin) will inherit a fortune only if they produce  heirs within a year of Dad's death.  </P> <P> It turns out that both have grown kids (Robert Downey Jr., Ralph Macchio) from  one-night stands during their heterosexual pasts, whom a less-than-saintly  priest hopes to keep under wraps so his church will inherit the money.  </P> <P> The writer-director feels it won't offend: "We played straight -- in a way."  </P> <P> Scenes involving Idle, Martin and their lovers (Leo Rossi, co-writer Laura  Ernst), Downey says, show "lots of tender stuff between them. We don't treat  them any differently than other couples, heterosexual or otherwise. We don't  put them down at all."  </P> <P> Some insensitive material was eliminated, he adds, and the AIDS issue is dealt  with directly. In one sexual situation, gay characters display medical cards  indicating their HIV-negative status.  </P> <P> "(The AIDS issue) was uncomfortable," Downey admits. "But you had to deal with  it, or the film wouldn't have worked." John M. Wilson  </P></p>

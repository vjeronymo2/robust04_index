			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / People: Looking for gold dust Steve Shirley, probably the computing services industry's best known female entrepreneur, has found a new diversion as she continues gently to disengage herself from FI Group, the privately-held software company she founded over 30 years ago. She has been appointed a part-time board member of AEA Technology, the services company which used to be the UK Atomic Energy Authority and which this year made a profit for the first time in five years. This marks Shirley's first directorship of a major company outside FI and her extensive international business experience is expected to accelerate the operation's transformation from government agency to commercial organisation. Yesterday she described the company as 'totally professional at every level, but it does not yet have enough of a service culture. In the past, the emphasis has been on cost containment; it has to be shifted to income generation'. She clearly relishes the challenge. 'There is gold dust in there' she enthuses. Her experience of FI Group is also expected to help AEA develop a more participative style of management. Shirley has been president of the British Computer Society and is, this year, Master of the Worshipful Company of Information Technologists, the 100th livery company to be formed in the City.</p>

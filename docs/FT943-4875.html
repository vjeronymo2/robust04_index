			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Walker denies signing documents Mr George Walker, former head of the Brent Walker property and leisure group, yesterday disputed prosecution claims he signed documents relating to an associated company involved in the alleged fraudulent inflating of Brent Walker profits. Mr Walker, in his second day in the witness box at the Old Bailey, denied that he had signed documents concerning Alberta, a joint venture involving Brent Walker. The prosecution alleges Alberta was used by Mr Walker to launder money to disguise bogus film rights transactions that increased the profits of the Brent Walker film division. Mr Walker and Mr Wilfred Aquilina, the former Brent Walker finance director, both deny charges of theft, fraudulent trading and conspiring to falsify the company's accounts. Questioned by his barrister, Mr Colin Nicholls QC, Mr Walker said he could not be sure that he had signed some of the documents. He was unsure the signatures looked like his, and one letter was on headed paper he would never have used. As chief executive of Brent Walker he signed so many documents he could not read them and had to trust the senior executives responsible, he told the court. 'Some weeks I got so tired my fingers could not hold the pen,' he said. Mr Walker also complained about the lack of support Brent Walker received from the banks throughout its history. He was often asked to provide security for loans from his personal assets. This, he said, was virtually unheard of for public companies. Mr Walker said flowcharts prepared by prosecutors from the Serious Fraud Office concerning the alleged profits boosting made no sense to him. 'This is an accountant's wonderland - an accountant's dreamland,' he said. According to the charts, the banks concerned had never imposed any charges for transferring large sums of money. This was never the case, said Mr Walker. The trial continues today.</p>

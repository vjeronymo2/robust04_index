			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> RULES FOR CITY RESTROOMS  </P> <P> Bathing, shaving or washing clothes in the city's public restrooms will no  longer be tolerated under an ordinance given preliminary approval last week by  the City Council.  </P> <P> Homeless people who have been "stripping down to their underwear and using  restrooms as bathing facilities" at the Monrovia Community Center prompted the  Community Services Commission to recommend the ban at its March 16 meeting.  </P> <P> The ordinance states that "no person shall disrobe, bathe or shave oneself or  launder clothing" in public restrooms.  </P> <P> "As public restrooms they are open to anyone, but not to unrestricted use,"  according to City Atty. Rick Morillo.  </P> <P> Patrons at the center have objected to the practice about twice a month,  Director of Community Services Eileen Brownell wrote in a May report. An  employee at the community center on West Palm Avenue said that the transients  have been coming onto the premises for eight years, but that the problem has  worsened in the last two.  </P> <P> The ban will go into effect 30 days after the council gives it a final approval  at its next meeting in two weeks.  </P></p>

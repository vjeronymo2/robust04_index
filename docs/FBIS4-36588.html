			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Taj-al-Din 'Abd-al-Haqq: "Al-Asnaj: Aden Battle </F> Will Not Be the Last"]    [Excerpt] Abu Dhabi -- 'Abdallah al-Asnaj, foreign  minister of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY], has said  that the Aden battle will not be the last battle between the  north and the south. And that the sons "of south Yemen, who  fought British imperialism for many years, will fight the new  imperialism wrapped in the cloak of unity."    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT prior to his departure  for Kuwait after a brief visit to the [United Arab] Emirates  accompanied by Engineer Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, prime  minister of the DRY, al-Asnaj said that the south is not just  Aden and the battlefield with the Sanaa forces extends to all  the territory of the DRY. Asked whether he expects open Gulf  recognition of the DRY, al-Asnaj said: "The issue at present is  the consolidation of the cease-fire, which Sanaa tries to get  around every time."    He said that what Sanaa says publicly conflicts with what it  is doing on the ground, as it is continuing the aggression,  hitting residential areas.    He added that the DRY has appealed to the UN secretary  general to compel the Sanaa rulers to respect Security Council  Resolution 924 and to observe the cease-fire by deed, not word.    He pointed out that DRY services have intercepted telephone  conversations in the voice of the Sanaa ruler, in which he urges  his forces to speed up their military operations and destroy  villages and residential areas.    Asked whether al-'Attas will request Gulf and Arab  recognition of the DRY during his current tour, al-Asnaj said:  "The recognition issue depends on our steadfastness on the  ground." He pointed out that fraternal and friendly states "are  awaiting [the outcome of] current developments in Yemen to  announce that."    He said that the international community sympathizes with  the  right to self-determination for south Yemen. It also condemns  the aggressive operations launched by the Sanaa government.    Al-Asnaj praised the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC]  resolution issued at the GCC foreign ministers meeting. He said  the resolution contains an open call for a cease-fire and for  renouncing the use of force, and is in line with Security  Council Resolution 924.    Asked whether southern forces have received military aid  from  Arab states, al-Asnaj said, "we are aware of regional conditions  and do appreciate them. We are asking for nothing at this stage  beyond condemnation and work to halt the continuing war launched  by the Sanaa rulers."    On his assessment of the U.S. role, al-Asnaj said: "We are  in touch with the United States and the permanent member states  of the Security Council." He also said: "We are satisfied with  the U.S. position, which is in line with the position declared  by the GCC states." [passage omitted]</p>

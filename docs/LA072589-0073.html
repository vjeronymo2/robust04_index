			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Unisys Corp.: The Blue Bell, Pa.-based computer and defense giant said  second-quarter earnings fell 67% to $53.6 million despite an 8% increase in  revenue to $2.57 billion. The firm attributed the sharp earnings drop to the  expense of cutting inventories, pricing pressures from competitors and the  temporary suspension of its defense business by the Pentagon. Also, the rise in  the dollar decreased the dollar value of sales made in foreign currencies.  </P></p>

			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: NatWest interest in TSB Bank purchase National Westminster Bank said yesterday that it had expressed interest in buying TSB Bank, the fifth biggest Irish bank. TSB trustees have discussed a merger with National Irish Bank, a subsidiary of National Australia Bank. NatWest is thought likely to have to bid more than Pounds 100m for TSB if an offer was allowed. Lord Alexander, NatWest's chairman, has personally told the Irish government that his bank would like to be allowed to bid for TSB Bank. NatWest said that it believed that it could reinforce its presence in Ireland by buying TSB. It already owns the third largest Irish bank in Ulster Bank, which is significantly smaller than Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland. National Australia Bank has said that it is in discussions with the TSB trustees and the Irish government over merging its subsidiary National Irish Bank with TSB.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Arts: Two Strauss sopranos Since the last round of musical chairs in conductors' appointments, Kurt Masur has come to look increasingly influential. From his triple power-base in Leipzig, New York and London, he presides over musical centres in both the old and new worlds, from which he can forge important partnerships in music-making. Over the past fortnight he has made two appearances in London. One was as a guest with his own Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, the other with the London Philharmonic, of which he is principal guest conductor. But on each occasion the spotlight fell on the soloist he brought with him, in each case a leading soprano. Both are comparatively rare visitors to this country, and both sang Masur's favoured composer, Richard Strauss. At the Royal Festival Hall with the London Philharmonic on Saturday, the singer was Kathleen Battle. A favourite in New York, her artistic home, Miss Battle entered looking like a fairy-tale princess and went on to play the starring role that was expected of her with consummate artistry. There is indeed a magic about her singing, though that is in part because the voice is so small that the audience has to sit in hushed attentiveness to hear her at all in a hall of this size. With that in mind, she had chosen her Strauss songs carefully. A pair of the Brentano Lieder, natural material for a Zerbinetta, were gossamer-light, spun with an exquisitely fine thread of sound. 'Waldseligkeit' floated effortlessly. Only 'Morgen' disappointed, too fast and insubstantial. It was with a group of Duparc songs that her limitations really became apparent. A brief thought back to Janet Baker in the opening lines of 'Phidyle' was enough to make Battle seem monochrome and inexpressive by comparison. The other songs, too, were rendered sweet nothings, charmingly sung, but saccharine and shallow. At least the singer was fortunate that Masur was such a considerate accompanist, allowing every wisp of sound to be heard. There could hardly have been a greater contrast with the other concert 10 days earlier. This was at the Barbican, in the Great Orchestras of the World series, when Masur brought the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra over for an all-Strauss programme. The singer on this occasion should not by rights have been the raison d'etre of the evening, but she was - firstly because the orchestral items were meagre, secondly because the singer was Julia Varady in the Four Last Songs. Next to Battle's flighty, girlish Strauss, this was adult singing and no mistake. Varady possesses one of the true Straussian voices of the day, the tone ample and unforced, even at the most taxing moments. She took her time with the music, breathing wherever necessary, and gave the songs a dignity and a generous soaring breadth that are all too rare. The Four Last Songs have never sounded greater.</p>

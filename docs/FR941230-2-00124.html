We are faced with a disturbing increase in violent crimes committed by juveniles and an alarming rise in abuse, neglect, and street violence perpetrated against American youth. In light of this emerging crisis, we can no longer afford a narrow focus by separate disciplines to attack this problem. To effectively address the rising levels of juvenile crime, participants from all community sectors, public and private, across specializations, must plan collaboratively and comprehensively if we are to reduce violence and build healthier and safer communities. Collectively, we must launch a two-pronged assault on juvenile delinquency and violence, and their causes. Both prevention and early intervention programs and a strong focus on law enforcement and a comprehensive system of graduated sanctions are crucial to this battle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public's fear of youth violence is well founded. The Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Report shows that the greatest increase in arrests of violent offenders involves children under the age of 15. This is also true of offenses involving the use of weapons. No place is a haven. Our neighborhoods, our schools and our homes are all places of violence. The increased use of weapons, particularly firearms, by our youth has created great fear for both and of our children. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An emphasis on increased law enforcement and corrections has been the most common reaction to the increase in juvenile violent crime. However, providing more detention beds and secure commitment facilities and increasing prosecution of juveniles as adults can only protect our communities in the short term. Even the strongest proponents of this approach acknowledge that such measures alone cannot put an end to youth violence. While we must take immediate steps to protect our communities today, programs to prevent delinquency and violence tomorrow are the greatest hope for the future. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The problem of crime and violence in our communities seems insurmountable. Many strands of our Nation's social fabric are unraveling. This is why we must intensify our efforts to prevent delinquency by seeking ways to effectively intervene with those at risk and rehabilitate juvenile offenders before they become adult criminals. Working with our communities we must integrate a system of support for our families and children that will help them live in a healthy and safe environment. America's children should awaken each morning in homes that are free of child abuse and neglect; they should attend schools that are free of drugs, gangs, and guns; and after school, they should be able to play in parks that are safe and return to homes that provide a nurturing, supportive, and loving atmosphere. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Much of the public debate about juvenile delinquency centers on at-risk youth. If we are to provide early and effective intervention to prevent delinquency, we must begin by more precisely targeting at-risk children and families, but we should not exclude any child who needs services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The road to adulthood has become increasingly hazardous in our society, and many families have broken apart. We must strengthen and preserve families. In particular, we must help families provide their children with the support that young people need for healthy growth and development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recent research sponsored by OJJDP and others confirms this approach. Studies indicate clear correlations between neglect and abuse and increased delinquency and violence. An ongoing OJJDP study on the causes and correlates of delinquency, notes that adolescents from families in which two or more forms of violence are present (e.g. child and spouse abuse) are almost twice as likely to report committing violent offenses as their peers from nonviolent families. A National Institute of Justice study on the cycle of violence reports that childhood abuse and neglect increase the likelihood of arrest as a juvenile and as an adult. The direct connection between violence and child neglect and abuse is striking: 12.5 percent of neglected children and 15.8 percent of physically abused children will be arrested for a violent offense by the time they reach age 25. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thousands of alleged incidents of child abuse and neglect are reported to authorities across America every day. These reports are often handled within systems that are ill-equipped to properly investigate cases, report adequately to the court, or provide effective protective supervision, appropriate foster care, or timely permanent placement. As a result, children may be harmed by the very system designed to protect them. Families may be devastated by the inappropriate handling of these cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Child protective service workers, investigators, police officers, and others responsible for protecting children need training in child development and investigative training, along with manageable caseloads. This will enable them to gather the information needed to make legal determinations while displaying sensitivity to the child and the family. Court counselors must be able to manage their cases and know the critical details needed to make an appropriate recommendation to the court regarding such matters as placement and future court action. Social workers must have adequate time to work with families, ensure compliance with court orders, and, above all, ensure the safety of children. They must be able to monitor a child's status in foster care and minimize the trauma that out-of-home placement may cause. Judges must have the opportunity to deliberate on each case in a thorough and thoughtful manner. They must be able to render informed, objective, and deliberate decisions that are in the best interests of the child and in full accord with justice. They must have the resources at their disposal to meet the treatment needs of the child and the family. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If we are serious about combating crime, we must intervene early and constructively in the lives of our children. We know that the early years of life are highly significant in a child's development. It is during that period that children learn empathy from caring adults with whom they have secure attachments and develop a sense of trust derived from parental responsiveness and loving attention. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

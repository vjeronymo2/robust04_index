One of the five candidates for the post of finance minister  is Mikulas Dzurinda, the main economic expert of the Christian  Democratic Movement (KDH), a source close to the Slovak Finance  Ministry has told CTK.    Dzurinda is an unambiguous supporter of the market economy,  and may meet with opposition from the left-wing parties. In  1991-1992 he was economic deputy to the Slovak Minister of  Transport and Communications.    Moravcik said on Monday that the post of foreign minister,  another hotly contested seat, should be filled by a non-party  "professional diplomat." CTK has learnt from a reliable source  at the Foreign Ministry that most suitable in terms of  experience and skills are the ambassadors Eduard Kukan (at the  UN), Frantisek Lipka (Paris) and Jan Kubis (Geneva). Also  "close to Moravcik," the source said, is director of the  Administrative and Information Department of the Foreign  Ministry Dusan Rozbora.    The parties negotiating the new cabinet agree Slovak foreign  policy should be coalition and not party-directed, as it has  been till now. Other possible contenders for the post are  director of the foreign committee of the presidential office  Pavel Demes, and former Czechoslovak ambassador to Vienna, Magda  Vasaryova, now head of the Slovak Society for Foreign Policy.</p>

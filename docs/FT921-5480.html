			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Letter: Paper and Brazil's rainforest Sir, Kathy Bradley of the Pulp and Paper Information Centre (Letters, February 29) rightly points out the misconception that paper is made from Brazilian hardwood. What she omits to mention, and this is a fact to which other voyagers to Brazil might attest, is the extent to which the rainforest has been subjugated by the implantation of eucalyptus, from which the paper pulp does come. Roderick Bromley, Coltishall House, Great Hautbois Road, Coltishall, Norfolk.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Bulis to be made more attractive by Bundesbank THE Bundesbank yesterday announced reforms to the bidding arrangements for Bulis - short-term money market instruments introduced earlier this year in an attempt to soak up excess liquidity created by the relaxation of minimum reserve requirements for bank lending. The reforms are designed to make the new instruments more effective in mopping up liquidity outside the banking sector. The German central bank, which yesterday launched a new DM8.5bn tranche of 'Bulis', said it was dissatisfied because the bulk of the DM24bn of Bulis issued so far had been taken up by banks and foreign institutions. Under the reforms, non-banks - a category which embraces industrial corporations as well as insurance companies - will be able to bid for the new securities direct through the Landeszentralbanken, the Bundesbank's regional branch network. They will no longer be obliged to buy the securities through banks. The minimum denomination is being raised from DM100,000 to DM500,000. Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a Bundesbank director, explained that this was designed to make the instruments more attractive to non-banks which had held back out of fear of competing with private investors. He said that only 10 per cent of the Bulis issued so far had ended up in the non-bank sector, while foreign investors - including central banks - held just over 50 per cent and the banking community the rest. This was disappointing because a central reason for introducing the Bulis was to give the Bundesbank a degree of direct control over liquidity outside the banking sector. 'The aim is to strengthen Bulis as an instrument of monetary policy,' Mr Gaddum said. This reflects the central bank's concerns about growth in money supply growth, regarded as a determinant of future inflation. Economists said the move could strengthen German money-markets, which are under-developed by the standards of other financial centres as the availability of short-term money-market instruments is limited. The new Bulis will be issued in two tranches with maturities of three and six months, replacing Bulis maturing on September 3. The terms will set by the tender. The Bundesbank said it intends to replace all Bulis maturing from December onwards with regular six-month maturities.</p>

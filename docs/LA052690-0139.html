			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADL, SOVIET COUNCIL TRACK RUMORS, FACTS OF ATTACKS ON JEWS;  </P> <P> ANTI-SEMITISM: THREATS HAVE INCREASED BUT NO VIOLENCE HAS BEEN REPORTED.  EMIGRATION IS ON THE RISE.  </P> <P> Jews in the Soviet Union have been fearful for months that anti-Semitic taunts  and threats may turn into violence against them, but a Jewish agency in Moscow  with connections to the Anti-Defamation League in this country is being careful  not to raise false alarms.  </P> <P> Early this month, the Vaad, an umbrella council for Jewish organizations in the  Soviet Union, investigated reports of violent acts against Jews and found in  each case that they were not motivated by anti-Jewish sentiment.  </P> <P> In turn, the ADL offices in New York passed along the information to other  agencies and to the public through news releases. That kind of caution has been  an ADL hallmark, according to National Director Abraham H. Foxman.  </P> <P> "It is important in fighting anti-Semitism in the United States or in the  Soviet Union to be accurate so that, God forbid, we won't find ourselves  yelling 'wolf' and the next time, when it really happens, there would be no  credibility," Foxman said.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, a widely circulated rumor said Soviet Jews would be attacked  in a pogrom on May 5, but the date passed without incident. Soviet government  officials had warned the citizenry that such violence would not be tolerated.  </P> <P> "The government didn't speak out with the crescendo that we would have hoped,"  said Foxman, "but it did speak out, and there was heightened security around  Jewish institutions. We are aware that the Soviet Union is taking (the threat  of a pogrom) more seriously today than it did six months ago."  </P> <P> At the same time, Foxman said while visiting ADL's new Los Angeles office near  Century City, Jews are faced with an uncomfortable irony in the changing Soviet  Union. Glasnost now allows Jewish groups to function openly, but perestroika,  the decentralizing reforms, has unleashed social turbulence, including  anti-Jewish feelings.  </P> <P> "In our country," Foxman said, "we have skinheads, nuts and hatemongers, but at  least the U.S. Jewish communities, while anxious, know that the law enforcement  agencies will be there, will protect, will defend. In the Soviet Union, that is  still an open question."  </P> <P> When Soviet Jews formed Vaad (Hebrew for "board") to give them a central voice,  the ADL signed a contract with the board to exchange information on reports of  anti-Semitism.  </P> <P> "If we read in the newspaper that such and such is happening, we check with  them: Is it true? What are the circumstances?" Foxman said.  </P> <P> According to Foxman, a Jerusalem newspaper reported this month the looting of  Jewish homes during a riot in Uzbekistan and the slaying of a Jewish man and  torture of his wife in another region of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> But Mikhail Chlenov, a Vaad co-president, told ADL officials that the rampage  by Uzbekis on May 2 followed the cancellation of a soccer match and "was not a  specific Jewish problem." Nor was the slaying related to anti-Semitism. The  Vaad said that Jews are victims along with many others during times of  increased criminal activity in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, nervousness about the possibility of anti-Semitic violence in the  Soviet Union is said to be feeding record rates of emigration to Israel. Soviet  Jews have been landing in Israel at the rate of nearly 3,000 a week, prompting  the worldwide Operation Exodus fund-raising campaign by Jewish communities to  help finance their settlement.  </P> <P> "In Jewish history, Jews usually run after bloodshed, after a pogrom has  occurred," said Foxman, who was born in Poland during the Nazi-era Holocaust  and says he owes his life a Catholic woman who hid him.  </P> <P> "I'm delighted that here is a situation (in the Soviet Union) where, thank God,  blood has not been spilled," he said.  </P> <P> Christians at times accuse Jewish leaders of overreacting to perceived threats,  he said. "We may be guilty of that," Foxman said. "But I say, 'I'm sorry if  we've upset you. I do not have the luxury to err on not speaking out.' "  </P></p>

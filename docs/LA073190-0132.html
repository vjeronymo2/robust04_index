			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DERWINSKI HAS UPBEAT MESSAGE ON VA BUDGET  </P> <P> Seeking to calm fears of massive funding cuts, the U.S. secretary of veterans  affairs assured several thousand disabled soldiers Monday that they can count  on more money this year for medical and other needs.  </P> <P> But some among the 5,000 delegates to the 69th national convention of the  Disabled American Veterans did not buy Secretary Edward J. Derwinski's upbeat  message.  </P> <P> "He's a politician," grumbled Tom Garrett of Las Vegas, 61, a Navy veteran who  now uses a wheelchair.  </P> <P> "He talks a lot and makes lot of promises but says nothing. What we want is a  firm commitment that the government is going to honor its commitment to us and  take care of our needs."  </P> <P> Likewise, the chief spokesman for Rep. G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery (D-Miss.),  chairman of the House Veteran Affairs committee, said the secretary's comments  may give an overly optimistic picture of the current budget talks between  congressional leaders and the Bush Administration, which has recommended a  $1-billion increase in funds for veterans.  </P> <P> "No one knows for certain what's going to happen," committee aide Jim Holley  said in an interview. "The holdup now is the budget summit, but we've already  been instructed (by congressional leaders) to get ready for a half-billion  dollars in veterans' cuts -- and that's a minimum figure."  </P> <P> Derwinski acknowledged in his talk that "I have not seen in my 32 years in  Washington a situation as complicated and as difficult as the budget problem  they're struggling with in Washington. Now we are the innocent victims -- we  the VA budget and, therefore, the veterans."  </P> <P> But he continued: "We were looking forward to a budget increase, we are going  to get one, we're going to have more money this year than we had last year. . .  . But the big problem is, do we get enough to cover the rising cost of  medicine? That's the $64 question for us."  </P> <P> Veterans' funding was foremost on the minds of many of those attending the  Anaheim convention. The VA's current $30-billion budget provides for medical  care, home loan guarantees, life insurance and pensions for veterans and their  51 million dependents and survivors.  </P> <P> Although funding for federal programs has become tighter in recent years, the  VA has managed to escape cuts and maintain its funding, officials said. The  agency is especially threatened this year, however, some veterans' leaders  said.  </P> <P> They cite a recent General Accounting Office report in which cuts were  recommended in money for military personnel who have sustained non-service  injuries, and the fact that a VA committee is considering, along with other  cost-cutting measures, trimming some marginally disabled veterans from the  federal rolls.  </P> <P> The rising cost of medical care and the graying of today's veterans -- those  over 75 are expected to number 2.6 million by 1996, nearly double the number  today -- have also caused some alarm about the security of veterans' programs.  </P></p>

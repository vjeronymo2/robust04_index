			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Help BT to compete abroad Sir, Like most other commentators, your editorial (Euro Telecom Alliances, December 8) on the Franco-German telecoms alliance, missed the key strategic point for Britain. This is whether a British company will be one of the big four or five operators in international telecommunications - effectively that means whether BT will, since it alone has the necessary critical mass. That objective should be the driving one for telecommunications policy. It would have enormous benefits for British industry at large, enabling a pace-setting role in the fast- growing area of information technology, which will be so vital to our future economic growth. The problem is that, as in so many areas of industry, this government does not have a telecommunications policy. Its stance is to leave it to the invisible hand of market forces. So much so, that competitors to BT are positively favoured (for example being allowed to carry the highly lucrative combination of telephony and entertainment which BT is not). As part of this, American carriers such as AT&amp;T, Sprint and the regional Bells are virtually being incited by the government to clean up the British market, while BT does not have reciprocal entry rights to the US market. Similarly, in Europe, the link between Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and possibly AT&amp;T is going ahead while BT has its hands tied behind its back, fighting off rigged competition in its backyard. Our concern should be to put Britain where it once was (as inventors of fibre optics for instance) in the leadership of international telecommunications. The government's position is typically short-sighted. If its current non-policy persists, British industry will once again lose out. Peter Hain, House of Commons, Westminster, London SW1A 0AA</p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: Stabilisation in new democracies Sir, Martin Wolf's article, 'Poland's struggle for stability', (May 9) raises many interesting issues for stabilisation policy. But his claim that the success of stabilisation and authoritarian regimes are causally linked is highly dubious. It runs counter not only to the views of the World Bank and the ESRD, but also to the results of academic social science. Haggard and Kauffman at Harvard found established democracies to be no less prudent in macro-management than authoritarian regimes. One of us has just participated in a nine-country study which rejected authoritarianism as a necessary condition for good structural adjustment (Aid and Power, Routledge, 1991). A good example of a new democracy managing stabilisation well is Chile. The Aylwin government's inflation forecast for 1991 of 15 per cent seems to us realistic - and it is well below the 25 per cent prevailing during the last years of the Pinochet government. Martin Wolf's economic analysis is good enough to need no support from half-baked political science.

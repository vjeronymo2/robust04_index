			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Auditors face radical shake-up of their role: Standard-setting body proposes enlarged report - Clear opinion on a company's chances of survival to be included AUDITORS will be required to comment on whether a company can survive for at least one year after its financial statements are approved, in a radical shake-up of their role proposed yesterday by the profession's new standard-setting body. The Auditing Practices Board is proposing that from early next year all annual company reports should contain a substantially enlarged audit report giving an unambiguous opinion on the financial statements provided by a company's directors. Details of the initiatives are in the first three draft documents produced by the board, which was created early last year. Mr Bill Morrison, board chairman, said: 'This is equivalent to trains moving from narrow gauge to wide gauge and coming out of a different station altogether.' Two of the new statements provide detailed standards for part of the statutory audit of all limited companies. They would fundamentally alter and lengthen the text of the report provided in accounts. The first addresses the issue of whether the company is a 'going concern' - to determine whether it is able to survive for a period of at least one year beyond the period to which the latest accounts refer. Auditors would be required to assess more actively the directors' view of their company as a going concern and use their judgment to identify 'material matters' such as inadequate borrowing facilities, litigation or significant debts falling due. They would also be required to look forward up to one year after the period to which statements refer, well beyond the timescale demanded under existing guidelines. The second statement deals more generally with the format of the audit report. It says the report should be addressed to the shareholders and state the date on which the opinion is expressed. It should describe and distinguish between the responsibilities of the directors for the preparation of the financial statements and the responsibilities of the auditors to express an opinion on these statements. It would have to contain a clear and unequivocal opinion on the financial statements. The third statement lays out the roles of the Auditing Practices Board. It has 18 voting members, including nine who are not practising accountants. The document says the board will issue two forms of document in the future: statements, which are mandatory, and practice notes, which represent best practice on emerging issues. The new standards establish six types of opinion with which the auditors' report can conclude: Unqualified opinion - no emphasis: the financial statements give a true and fair view. Unqualified opinion - with emphasis: the statements give a true and fair view but are affected by 'fundamental uncertainties'. Qualified opinion - partial disclaimer: all evidence reasonably expected to be available to the auditors has not been obtained and evaluated. Qualified opinion - disclaimer: the evidence has not been obtained and the effect is sufficiently material to make the statements as a whole misleading. Qualified opinion - disagreement: the statements are not prepared in accordance with accepted accounting principles or do not give a true and fair view, but the effect of the disagreement does not make the statements as a whole misleading. Qualified opinion - adverse opinion: the effect of the disagreement is so pervasive that the statements as a whole are misleading. The documents are open for comment until August 31, and the board aims to issue standards in the autumn applying to companies with year-ends after December 31 this year.

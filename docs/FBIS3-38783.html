			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Nonsense and Balderdash"] </F>   [Text] The miraculous substance is supposed to increase the  capacity of missiles, make projectiles invisible to any radar  equipment, and even be used in the construction of mininuclear  bombs.    Merchants Josef Rimmele and Klaus Eichler, who were probably  killed when a chartered Cessna plane mysteriously crashed into  Lake Constance the week before last, reportedly also dealt in  this substance. Dealers in radioactive material offer the  substance under many names: Red Mercury, Mercury P2-P5, Mercury  Rouge, Red Wine, Red Quicksilver, RM20/20, or Red Cherry.    According to findings by the Federal Intelligence Office  (BND) itinerant dealers have been offering the stuff since 1980.  One can "only speculate" about the origin of the Mercury  legend, a confidential report from January says. What is  certain are the prices demanded on the black market: "$200,000  to $400,000 per kilo," the BND in Pullach has found out.    Last year, the material was presented to an audience of  millions. The ARD [First German Television Channel]  "Tagesthemen" newscast reported that the dangerous substance is  produced in a research institute of the Russian military and  then offered all over the world for the construction of  detonators in nuclear warheads.    Experts laughed heartily. "Red Mercury is nonsense,  balderdash," Paul Wamers, vice president of the Cologne Customs  Office of Criminal Investigations, says, succinctly summarizing  the opinion of the experts.    The BND investigators in their expert report are also sure:  "A material with such qualities does not exist. The  mercury-antimony compound, which is again and again mentioned in  the media and is a brownish material, does not show any of the  spectacular qualities and would not justify the extremely high  price that is demanded. In the cases that were examined more  closely, the seized material was, for example, simple mercury or  mercury oxide. However, one case has become known in which  mercury was mixed with the dangerous radioactive material cobalt  60 -- probably to simulate the alleged radioactivity of Red  Mercury."    Theophil M. Lutz, scientist and owner of a company for  chemical analyses in Morges at the Lake of Geneva, sees  connections. He assumes that officers of the former Soviet  intelligence service KGB are behind the mercury boom. The  intelligence agents are operating with a fictitious material,  which is not rare in this scene.    Dutch merchant Adriana Gilhar, 42, has come to the same  conclusion. The born Romanian participated in the game, which  involved millions of dollars, for two years without ever being  able to conclude a real deal. She experienced "scenes as in a  movie": Somewhere in the heart of Russia "policemen, who were  armed to their teeth" guarded a box with 2 kg of "this damned  substance."    Adriana Gilhar calls this succinctly and vulgarly  "bullshit."  Obviously, the local governors of the former KGB had staged the  martial performance of the policemen in order to impress  supposedly rich buyers from the West. The experiences of the  Dutch woman coincide with findings by German authorities.    The BND has "intelligence service information" that Russian  politicians and high-ranking government officials might also be  involved in the black-market deals.    Thus, in 1992, Russian dealers presented their German  partners with a license that, according to the stamp and  signature, came from the office of the prime minister of the  Republic of Moldova: A domestic company was permitted to export  "1,000 kg" of the imaginary chemical Red Mercury.    Cornelius Vermulen, who for a long time was Adriana Gilhar's  Dutch business partner, also received this offer. Nervously, he  pushes two samples of Red Mercury across the table to show them  to his visitors: "Take a look, rubbish."    Such frankness is dangerous. A hotel owner from the Ruhr  area and his family had to flee abroad to escape the dealers'  revenge.    After months of negations, a deal involving 18 kg of Red  Mercury had not come about. Nevertheless, the Russian  negotiating partners demanded $300,000 for their efforts. When  the hotel owner refused, they called him on the phone and  threatened to set fire to his house and to kidnap his children.    Rimmele and Eichler also gained experience with the East  European Mafia. After failed negotiations on rare metals and  Red Mercury, they were kidnapped and brought to the Latvian  capital of Riga.    Eichler managed to free himself, he alerted the German  Embassy and the police. Later, Rimmele was also released.    The two dealers did not speak about the real background of  the kidnapping. But they had broken the law of silence, the  omerta, which is now also valid in East Europe. Rimmele and  Eichler betrayed the kidnappers to the Latvian police.    Since then they had lived in fear.</p>

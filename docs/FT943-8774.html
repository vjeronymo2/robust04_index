			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Ex-head of Reed Elsevier to receive Pounds 2.02m pay-off Mr Peter Davis, former co-chairman of Reed Elsevier, the Anglo-Dutch information and publishing group, is to receive one of the largest executive pay-offs in Britain in recent years - a compensation package worth Pounds 2.02m. Mr Davis, who resigned in June after a dispute over management responsibilities, is to receive Pounds 652,000 in cash, Pounds 1.3m of enhanced pension entitlements and up to Pounds 70,000 in fringe benefits, including temporary use of an office suite in London's West End. The deal, which was announced yesterday after protracted talks between Reed Elsevier's lawyers and actuaries, is the third-largest disclosed by an FT-SE 250 company since June last year. According to figures compiled by Pirc, the corporate governance consultancy, Mr Davis's pay-off was outstripped only by the Pounds 3.1m package awarded to Mr John Cahill, former chairman of British Aerospace, and a combined Pounds 2.9m payment to two directors of Lasmo, the oil exploration company. Reed Elsevier also disclosed that Mr Davis, who oversaw last year's merger of Reed International and Elsevier, could receive a further payout under an incentive scheme linked to growth in earnings per share. However, the company played down the size of the settlement. It pointed out that Mr Davis was receiving enhanced pension entitlements for only two years of his three-year rolling contract and that the cash pay-off was not much more than last year's salary and bonus payment of Pounds 636,592. 'Mr Davis forfeited the additional enhancement of his pension that would have occurred had he worked for the balance of his notice period,' Reed Elsevier added. Nevertheless, the pay-off has raised concerns among a number of Reed's institutional shareholders. Mr Michael Taylor, a fund manager at Royal Insurance, said the package was 'excessive', while another fund manager said he would be seeking clarification of the deal. The announcement follows criticism of executive compensation by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, at the weekend. 'I would personally like to see a much stronger role of share owners acting to ensure these sort of practices are constrained,' Mr Heseltine said. His concern was echoed by Ms Melanie Tether, employment partner at City solicitors Norton Rose. 'Shareholders may think about exercising their powers to ask companies to justify payments of this size,' she said yesterday. Reaction to package, Page 18</p>

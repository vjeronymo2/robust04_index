			<p><P> June 13, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MORGAN'S 3-GAME SUSPENSION UPHELD; GLOATED OVER BEAN BALL  </P> <P> American League President Bobby Brown today upheld his three-game suspension of  Boston Red Sox Manager Joe Morgan.  </P> <P> Morgan was suspended after gloating about Roger Clemens hitting Cleveland's  Stanley Jefferson with a pitch June 3.  </P> <P> Clemens opened the bottom of the first inning by drilling Jefferson with a  fastball, leading to a bench-clearing brawl.  </P> <P> The incident occurred the day after Indians reliever Doug Jones threw a pitch  near the head of Tony Pena.  </P> <P> "I loved it. We got even, didn't we?" Morgan said after the June 3 game. "We  voted as a team 34-0 that it would be such."  </P> <P> Brown suspended Morgan on June 5 for those remarks and "circumstances," but the  Boston manager appealed and had a hearing in New York on Tuesday.  </P> <P> The suspension takes effect beginning with tonight's Red Sox-Yankees game in  New York.  </P> <P> Third base Coach Rac Slider will manage the team in Morgan's absence.  </P></p>

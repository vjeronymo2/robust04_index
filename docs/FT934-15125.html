			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: Tax changes restrict PepsiCo PEPSICO, the US food and soft drinks group, reported a 9 per cent increase in third-quarter net income to Dollars 458m. Strong advances in most parts of the business outweighed a poor performance from the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants. The latest results would have shown a 17 per cent increase in net income to Dollars 495m, but the figure was affected by changes in the US tax regime. The effect was to reduce the latest earnings per share figure from 61 cents to 56 cents, a 6 per cent increase on last year. The impact of the tax changes on full-year earnings would be to reduce net income by an estimated Dollars 40m, equivalent to 5 cents a share. Operating profits rose by 20 per cent to Dollars 886m, with all three divisions growing by 17 per cent or more. Strongest performer was the beverages business, which increased operating profits by 22 per cent to Dollars 355m. In the US, new products such as Crystal Pepsi helped counter the effects of a product tampering incident in June, taking domestic beverage profits ahead by 21 per cent. International beverage profits rose by 28 per cent, helped by geographical expansion. Snack-food operating profits rose by 19 per cent to Dollars 309m with strong volume growth in the US and internationally. The restaurant division recorded a 17 per cent profits increase to Dollars 222m in spite of 15 per cent downturn in worldwide profits from Kentucky Fried Chicken, partly because of the successful launch of the large-size Bigfoot pizza in the US Pizza Hut chain.</p>

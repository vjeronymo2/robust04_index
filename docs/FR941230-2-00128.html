A grantee's eligibility for continued funding for an additional budget period within an existing project period depends on the grantee's compliance with funding eligibility requirements and achievement of the prior year's objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consideration for continuation funding for an additional project period for previously funded discretionary grant programs will be based upon several factors, including:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The extent to which the project responds to the applicable requirements of the JJDP Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Responsiveness to OJJDP and Department of Justice fiscal year 1995 program priorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Compliance with performance requirements of prior grant years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Compliance with fiscal and regulatory requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Compliance with any special conditions of the award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Availability of funds (based on program priority determinations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with 42 U.S.C. 5665a, Section 262(d)(1)(B), the competitive process for the award of Part C funds shall not be required if the Administrator makes a written determination waiving the competitive process:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. With respect to programs to be carried out in areas in which the President declares under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) that a major disaster or emergency exists, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. With respect to a particular program described in part C that is uniquely qualified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In implementing the fiscal year 1995 Program Plan, OJJDP will continue the process of developing, testing, and demonstrating the graduated sanctions concept throughout its programs, such as the Safe Futures. Partnerships to Reduce Youth Violence and Delinquency Program, while also supporting Weed and Seed sites and Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. This support will be provided through: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;New competitive programs to be funded at the State or local level and new programs that provide funds to national organizations to provide services at the State and local level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Continuation awards, under which OJJDP will negotiate with grantees and task contractors to identify and ensure the provision of appropriate technical assistance, training, information, and direct program services to Weed and Seed sites, Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities, other jurisdictions adopting a continuum of care program approach, and other eligible service recipients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> OJJDP Funding Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OJJDP seeks to focus its assistance on the development and implementation of programs with the greatest potential for reducing juvenile delinquency and to cultivate partnerships with State and local organizations. To that end, OJJDP has set three goals that constitute the major elements of a sound policy for juvenile justice and delinquency prevention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To promote delinquency prevention efforts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To foster the use of community-based alternatives to the traditional juvenile justice system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;To improve the juvenile justice system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Delinquency Prevention <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first goal of OJJDP is to identify and promote programs that prevent or reduce the occurrence of status or delinquent offenses. A sound policy for juvenile delinquency prevention strives to strengthen the most powerful contributing factor to good behavior: a productive place for young people in a law-abiding society. Preventive measures can operate on a large scale, providing gains in youth development while reducing youthful misbehavior. OJJDP programs encourage a risk-focused approach based on public health and social development models. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

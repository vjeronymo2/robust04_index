			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / International Company News: Skandia clear victor in bitter tussle - Christopher Brown-Humes and Karen Fossli on market implications Swedish insurer Skandia was being magnanimous in victory yesterday, but there was no disguising the feeling that it had emerged a clear winner from nearly three years of turmoil in the Scandinavian insurance sector. 'We don't want to rub salt into an open wound, but we believe we have come out top dog,' a Skandia official said. The deal, which places 40 per cent of Skandia shares in the hands of international institutional investors, leaves it with a stable ownership base, and without a single large unfriendly presence on its shareholder register for the first time since October 1990. It confirms a clear triumph over the predators which tried to take it over - first, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, which acquired a 28 per option in pursuit of a grand insurance/banking alliance, and then Uni Storebrand and Hafnia who bought 43 per cent in pursuit of pan-Nordic insurance co-operation - and ensures their place is not taken by some equally unwelcome grouping. It also means the group is free to pursue its strategic ambition of building up and integrating its insurance activities in what it describes as its 'Nordic home market'. 'We can now concentrate all our resources on the development of business activities in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, while implementing a restructuring of our international operations,' said Mr Bjorn Wolrath, Skandia chief executive. The group has already signalled a retreat from non-life reinsurance, and has a stated strategy of gaining between 20 and 25 per cent of the Scandinavian life and non-life insurance market, compared with a 13-14 per cent share today. Pursuing this will now be a lot easier, not least because the group's main rivals - including Uni Storebrand and Denmark's Baltica and Hafnia - have been badly weakened by the events of the last two years. This means Skandia should be able to pick up market share without reducing premiums, simply because very few companies in the region can afford to start a price war. Indeed, this weakness and the fact that no big foreign insurer has entered the picture, suggest premium rates can now move upwards. Skandia has shown interest in making an acquisition in Denmark in the past, as its market share there is only around 5 per cent. While this could trigger a bid for another group, it is far more likely that the growth will be organic. It has made it clear it hopes to pick up some business in Denmark following the March takeover of Hafnia's healthy insurance activities by fellow Danish insurer Codan. The placing of the Hafnia and Uni Storebrand shares was almost certainly helped by a feeling that the Scandinavian market is picking up. It would also have been assisted by firm evidence of financial recovery at Skandia, which recently reported a SKr700m (Dollars 96.5m) profit for the first quarter, a SKr1bn improvement on the same 1992 period. The group said its net asset value per share was also increasing because of rising share and bond prices and favourable exchange rate movements. Uni Storebrand is also back in profit, with a NKr150m (Dollars 21.9m) surplus, compared with a NKr151m loss in the same 1992 period. The disposal of a 25 per cent stake has given the Norwegian group a new lease of life following the chaos, uncertainty and debilitation which followed its abortive attempt to take over its Swedish rival. It can now look forward to a huge NKr4.3bn recapitalisation and to resuming a listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange. Mr Per Terje Vold, the group's chief executive, says the focus now will be on improving group profitability, increasing business volume and consolidating activities. Mr Vold says the company was considering selling some of its international activities as part of an increased focus on its core domestic life and non-life businesses. Uni has a 30 per cent share of the Norwegian life market and a 40 per cent non-life share. 'We also have a goal to return to the domestic market as a major institutional investor, which was one of the main reasons for the merger between Uni and Storebrand three years ago,' said Mr Vold. The affair has not left Uni unscathed. It sold its shares for SKr100 each, against an average purchase price of SKr220. It also had to submit to one last concession to facilitate the disposal: to bring Hafnia on board, the Norwegians agreed to sell their stake for SKr10 per share less than the price Hafnia fetched for its holding. 'Due to a previous agreement between Hafnia and Uni - which put some restrictions on Uni - Hafnia had to get more to be brought into the deal,' a source close to the three companies said. The wider implication of the placing is that Scandinavian insurance, having been shunned by international investors and analysts as a disaster area for the last 18 months, is back on the map.</p>

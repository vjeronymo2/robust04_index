			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report New York arabica COFFEE prices were near session highs at midday in a technical correction to last week's price plunge. London's robusta market continued to claw back some lost ground, closing with gains of up to Dollars 12. Dealers said they were looking for a close above 60 cents for the New York March contract to give the recovery added momentum, although conditions were nervous and a resumption of the downtrend could still not be ruled out. ICO talks about a new pact end on Friday. London COCOA futures closed with gains of around Pounds 21, boosted by the weakness of sterling against the dollar. Dealers said the market had convincingly breached resistance at Pounds 723 a tonne and should now move up to test the Pounds 742-Pounds 743 area on May. On the LME COPPER traders were awaiting developments from Chile's Ventanas smelter where workers are mulling an improved pay offer; reports of strike action at a Mexican copper refinery also made for some caution.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 1 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--An official  concerned of the China Press and Publications Administration  said that in 1993, the number of registered newspapers openly  published in China had reached 2,039. The total issues and  pages of newspapers printed in the first half of the year were  respectively five and 18 percent more than those of the same  period in the previous year, setting a record high.    At present, more than 700 newspapers have adopted laser  photo- composition technology. The advertisement business of  newspapers has also developed rapidly and income from  advertisements of more than 10 newspapers exceeded 100 million  yuan each in 1993.    This official pointed out that with the prosperity of  newspapers, some partial problems and symptoms of undesirable  tendencies have also emerged. Some newspapers have made false  reports, replaced news information with created or fabricated  stories, and cheated the readers by using "Mr. A and Mr. B" and  "City A and City B" to evade the tests of truth of the  information. Some are still using various ways to publish "paid  news reports." Others have made use of the "weekend editions"  or the "enlarged editions" in pursuit of "market effects,"  paying no attention to social benefits and doing harm to readers  with low-taste and bad-style reports, articles, and photos  written or prepared in a rough and slipshod way. Still others  have damaged publication order and the market of newspapers and  magazines, seriously violated state laws, decrees, regulations,  and rules, irresponsibly used false information of overseas  media, and even made mistakes in political issues and guidance  for public opinion. These problems should attract the attention  of all newspapers throughout the country and should be corrected.</p>

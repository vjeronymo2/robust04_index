			<p><P> July 8, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-TECH HOME: HARD-OF-HEARING TUNE IN WITH HEADSETS  </P> <P> The cancer hit in 1986, requiring massive doses of radiation and chemotherapy.  A year later, his hearing was all but gone, fallen victim to the drastic  treatments that saved his life. Hearing aids in each ear helped bring back some  semblance of a normal life for Marvin McConnell of Newport Beach, but  television was pretty much out of the question.  </P> <P> Until last year, when McConnell invested in a gadget called PrivatEar, an  "infrared assistive listening device" that brought Laker basketball back into  McConnell's home.  </P> <P> Hearing aids and television do not mix, because hearing aids increase the  volume of all sounds equally. So a device like the PrivatEar -- which brings  sound directly from a transmitter on the television set to a set of headphones  worn around the neck -- can be invaluable to Orange County's estimated 230,000  hard-of-hearing residents.  </P> <P> "If you just have your regular earphones (hearing aids) in, it's very difficult  to watch television," McConnell explains. "They pick up the regular TV sound  and the sound around you. They don't discriminate. So I could hear Chick Hearn,  but I had a difficult time differentiating between his sound and the sounds of  all the other activities around me."  </P> <P> But wearing his wireless headphones, McConnell can pick up Lakers announcer  Hearn without traffic and kitchen sounds from the house and neighborhood. The  result, McConnell says, is "magnificent."  </P> <P> The PrivatEar is one of a growing number of wireless headphone systems in use  throughout the country -- everywhere from churches, cinemas and theaters to  convention halls and private homes.  </P> <P> The technology of infrared sound transmission was developed in the mid-1970s,  originally for home, medical and educational uses; it was adapted for musical  and theatrical applications around 1980.  </P> <P> At the end of June, Mann Theatres opened eight screens in Laguna Niguel,  complete with a system called Audex, which is manufactured by Audiometrics Inc.  The Orange County Performing Arts Center employs a system manufactured by  Sennheiser Electronics Corp.  </P> <P> Here's how home infrared listening systems work: A transmitter, usually no  larger than a remote control device, is placed on top of the television set and  plugged into the audio-out jack or headphone jack. The transmitter is also  plugged into an electrical socket with an AC adapter. The hard-of-hearing  television viewer wears a headset or headphones, depending on the brand of  system.  </P> <P> The transmitter converts sound from the television into infrared light pulses  beamed across the room via light-emitting diodes. The headphones capture the  infrared light and change it back into sound. A volume control on the  headphones allows the hard-of-hearing viewer to make the sound as loud as  necessary.  </P> <P> Using an infrared system does not interfere with normal television viewing, so  friends and family members without difficulty hearing can enjoy programs along  with the hard-of-hearing.  </P> <P> The systems "work very nicely in a home environment," said O.T. Kenworthy,  director of audiology for the Providence Speech and Hearing Center, which is in  the city of Orange and affiliated with Childrens Hospital of Orange County.  "The infrared systems probably provide the best acoustic signal in a system  that doesn't involve hooking you up directly. They are wireless."  </P> <P> But they do have drawbacks, Kenworthy says. Price is one. Providence does not  sell such devices, but opens up its Hear Center to the public every Wednesday  to allow free trials of infrared systems and other gadgets that help the  hearing-impaired cope with life more easily.  </P> <P> McConnell bought his PrivatEar at the Hearing Enhancement Center in Costa Mesa.  At the Hearing Enhancement Center, the PrivatEar starts at around $85.  </P> <P> Another widely used system is made by Siemens Hearing Instruments Inc., a  subsidiary of Sennheiser, which provided the Performing Arts Center's infrared  theater system. The Siemens system runs about $325 at the Hearing Enhancement  Center, says audiologist Mark Dobkin.  </P> <P> "You're talking $325 to $400 by the time you buy accessories like the  rechargeable batteries and various microphone units," Kenworthy says. "In  addition, only people who are hard of hearing, with mild to severe hearing  losses, can benefit from such a system. Someone with a profound hearing loss, a  'deaf' person, would not be helped."  </P> <P> But for television viewers like McConnell, a PrivatEar or Siemens system can  bring entertainment back into the home via the television or videocassette  recorder. And for many, that kind of help is worth the money.  </P> <P> "Particularly for the elder folks, who are a little more TV-prone because of  their lack of full activity, it's just a magnificent thing," says McConnell,  68. "They can hear beautifully with it."  </P></p>

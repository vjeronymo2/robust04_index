			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / US drug tests raise hopes for anti-influenza cure Clinical trials in the US of an anti-influenza drug have raised hopes of a cure on the market within the next three years. Tests on 46 volunteers infected with the flu virus showed that the drug, developed by the UK company Glaxo, cut their infectiousness 100-fold. It also cut the period for which they were infectious by half to less than two days. Infectiousness, measured by the number of new viruses shed from the patient's nose, is a way researchers quantify effectiveness. Dr Frederick Hayden of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, who conducted the trials, said the volunteers also had fewer flu symptoms. Clinical trials involving another 600 people this winter should help set the dose for the drug and determine when is the best time to take it. If such trials are successful, Glaxo intends to submit the drug for regulatory approval in 1996. A product could reach the market later that year or, more likely, in 1997. No treatment today is very effective because the flu virus changes shape frequently. A flu vaccine immunises against three or four of these shapes, or strains, leaving people vulnerable to any others they may encounter. Such is the speed of mutation of the virus that new flu jabs are required each year. The new drug was developed by researchers at Monash University in Australia and is licenced by Glaxo from Australian biotechnology company Biota. It works by interfering with an enzyme the flu virus uses to break into healthy body cells.</p>

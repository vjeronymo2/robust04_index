			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 7 (XINHUA) -- China is embarking on  a trial reform of the wage system in 100 state-owned enterprises  this year which will enable them to decide on their own staff's  wages.    Meanwhile, in foreign-funded or privately-owned enterprises,  the state will advocate a system of setting wage levels through  collective negotiation or consultation.    In an interview with XINHUA, a high-ranking official with  the  state's Ministry of Labor said that the reform will focus on  readjusting staff income structures in large and medium-sized  enterprises with state ownership.    The reform will channel numerous employee subsidies and  allowances, including housing subsidies, into their salaries.  And the enterprises will be granted full decision-making powers  in setting or increasing wages for their employees on the  prerequisite that their wage increase rates do not exceed a rate  representing economic efficiency.    According to the official, the enterprises chosen for trial  wage reform will determine for themselves the number of  employees needed, and managerial personnel in the enterprises  will be salaried yearly under the system.    Along with the wage reform measures, the state will regulate  and guide social distribution by setting minimum wage levels or  issuing guidelines on wage increases.    The official noted that the present wage reform will also  take into consideration the wage readjustment being conducted in  government organizations or institutions. He said that wage  increases in the enterprises should be made in light of economic  efficiency and the cost of living index.    Meanwhile, the reform will also try to smooth out wage  relations between enterprises and government institutions and  between in- service staff and retired personnel.</p>

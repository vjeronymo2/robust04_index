			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The "old alliance" established 600 years  ago between Portugal and Great Britain was a  political-diplomatic agreement against the Spaniards, writes  Jose Vegar in the 5 March Lisbon weekly SEMANARIO. Noting that  "things are not much different today," it is still in Lisbon's  strategic interest to align itself with the United Kingdom in  the field of European construction, he contends. Vegar cites  Carlos Gaspar, adviser to President Mario Soares, as saying that  "it is necessary to choose the lesser of two evils, between  those who wish to preserve Portugal's transatlantic vocation and  the European Union (EU) and those who opt for subregional  integrations that obviate the existence of the Community." In  Gaspar's opinion, Portugal profits from aligning itself with  Great Britain within the framework of the EU, for this  "reinforces the tripartite center (France, Germany, United  Kingdom)...so enlargement will not negatively affect it." Vegar  cites Gaspar's concern about a possible fragmentation of the  Union through the formation of subregional Scandinavian,  Iberian, or German blocs.    On the other hand, Vegar also cites Andre Goncalves Pereira,  former minister of foreign affairs, as saying that "there is no  privileged relationship between Portugal and Great Britain." An  alliance made sense when Portugal first entered the EC, given  the somewhat parallel Portuguese and English positions on  federalism at that time. However, following EC assistance to  Portugal, Lisbon's present stance is much closer to the official  EU position, which collides with London's traditional  antifederalism, Goncalves Pereira is cited as saying. Vegar then  cites Socialist Party (PS) luminary and former Minister of  Foreign Affairs Jaime Gama, who notes that "it is to our  advantage to maintain an intense relationship with the United  Kingdom because we are partners in NATO and the EU."  Nevertheless, Gama continues, the object of this alliance "was  transferred from England to the United States, which  unfortunately never occupied this vacuum because it has a  different awareness of international issues." Finally, Gama is  cited as claiming that the "old theory of Atlantic versus  continental nations" cannot justify Portugal's interest in  favoring a close relationship with Great Britain, for "the world  is presently regulated by multipolarity, and a specific response  to each problem is needed."</p>

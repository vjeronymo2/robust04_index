			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN TO EXPLORE IMPACT OF NEW IDEAS  </P> <P> Innovations and the people who create them are interesting, but they become  compelling when they redefine what we take for granted. This is the first of a  weekly column that will explore the way new ideas, techniques and technologies  change both our expectations and our life styles.  </P> <P> Our new columnist, Michael Schrage, writes on topics in which innovation,  technology and popular culture merge. Previously the technology correspondent  for the Washington Post, Schrage recently was a visiting scholar at the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab.  </P> <P> He has been a contributor to the Wall Street Journal, Fortune magazine, Harvard  Business Review, the Asahi Journal and Rolling Stone.  </P></p>

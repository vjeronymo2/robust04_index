			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- Russia welcomes Cambodian King  Norodom Sihanouk's peace-making initiative on the holding of a  round-table with the participation of representatives of all  Cambodian political forces in Pyongyang at the end of May. The  round-table is aimed at reaching an arrangement on the  introduction of ceasefire throughout Cambodia since June 13,  Russian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Grigoriy Karasin told a  briefing on Thursday.    "We think that the realisation of this proposal would  facilitate to implement one of the main internal political goals  of Cambodia -- to complete the process of national  reconciliation in the country. We hope that the king's appeal  will be equally well heard in all corners of Cambodia," the  Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>

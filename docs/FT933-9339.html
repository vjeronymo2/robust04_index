			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Large trades boost Gas THE OIL and gas sector underperformed the wider market but provided the stock market's most active stock in British Gas where turnover reached 18m shares. Gas shares were sluggish for much of the session but picked up towards the close to end the day a net 1 1/2 higher at 309 1/2 p. Much of the action in the stock was concentrated in mid-session when a series of hefty individual trades, including a block of 4.8m shares, another of 4m and a number of 3m-plus trades moved through the Seaq dealing system. Some dealers attributed the large-scale trades to a number of institutions using Gas shares, always one of the market's heaviest trading issues, as a vehicle to invest big sums of cash in the market. 'If the market is rising and you want to shift cash into the market quickly, then Gas is one of the best stocks to use,' said one leading trader in Gas shares. It was also pointed out that the conclusions of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's year-long investigation into the the gas industry will be published next week. Publication of the full document is expected on September 6. There have been long-term worries in the market that British Gas will be dismantled as the regulatory authorities continue to seek increased competition in Gas's markets. But bulls of the stock push the view that the company offers well above average 'real' dividend growth.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / International Company News: Time Warner ahead at halfway Time Warner, the US entertainment group, has reported a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 23m, sharply reduced from the Dollars 83m loss a year ago due to record earnings at its publishing, music, films and cable TV programming businesses. During the quarter, combined earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) for the group and its Time Warner Entertainment subsidiary reached Dollars 748m on revenues of Dollars 3.7bn, compared with Ebitda of Dollars 711m on revenues of Dollars 3.4bn a year ago. Earnings in the first half were Dollars 1.38bn, up from Dollars 1.34bn in the first six months of 1993. The group, which was left with a heavy debt and depreciation burden following the 1989 merger between Time and Warner, tries to focus attention on Ebitda as a measure of its underlying perform-ance. Its Time Warner Entertainment unit (comprising the film, HBO cable channel and cable systems businesses) reports its operating results on a deconsolidated basis. Mr Gerald Levin, Time Warner's chairman, singled out the contribution of the group's publishing business, where Ebitda in the quarter jumped 19 per cent to a record Dollars 125m. Gains in advertising sales and circulation of its large stable of magazines were behind the improvement. Time Warner's music unit made second-quarter Ebitda of Dollars 150m, also a record, up 10 per cent from a year ago due primarily to improved operating results at Warner Music International. Record operating earnings were also posted by the group's filmed entertainment and HBO cable channel units, where Ebitda reached Dollars 267m and Dollars 67m, respectively. Cable operations, however, did not fare so well in the quarter, reporting Ebitda of Dollars 256m, down from Dollars 270m a year ago, as the impact of the reduction in rates imposed by Congress last September offset gains achieved from customer base growth.</p>

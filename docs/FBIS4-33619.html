			<p>BFN     [Text] Peru will continue to fight illegal drug trafficking  as originally planned, despite the virtual decision by the U.S.  Government to end the supply of information obtained by radar on  the alleged air transportation of drugs.    This comment was made yesterday by General Arnaldo Velarde  Ramirez, retired, the Peruvian representative before the  Inter-American Committee for the Control of Drugs and Drug Abuse  (CICAD) of the OAS, who said there is no official report from  the U.S. Government on this issue.    He added: "All we know is of a decision by the U.S. Defense  Department, which is not the official position of the U.S.  Government."    Velarde said the lack of information on narcoplanes over  Peruvian territory hurts drug enforcement considerably "but the  government's political will is very strong. Peru will continue  to fight trafficking with or without this information by using  its own capabilities."    Velarde labeled the U.S. decision as unilateral and  temporary, adding that it is "probably a decision made by the  U.S. Defense Department."</p>

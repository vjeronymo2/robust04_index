			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Rubbish Firms to Merge: GI Industries in Simi Valley, the major trash hauler in  eastern Ventura County with nearly 50,000 customers, agreed to be acquired by  Republic Waste Industries Inc. of Houston in a stock swap valued at about $15  million. The deal is subject to several conditions, including approval by both  companies' directors and GI's stockholders. GI, led by the Asadurian family,  which owns 44% of its stock, has suffered losses in recent years because of a  failed diversification effort.  </P></p>

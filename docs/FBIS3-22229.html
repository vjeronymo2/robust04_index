Who Is To Blame </F> This Time?'']    [Text] The Kiev Kharkivskyy Rayon People's Court has begun  to consider the case of violations of radiation safety rules and  norms during the reburial in 1988 of radioactive waste from the  territory of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences Nuclear Studies  Institute at a burial site that belonged to a special combine of  a specialized production association subordinated to the former  Ukrainian SSR Ministry of Communal Services (currently the  Ukrainian state association ``Radon''). The cooperative  ``Dozimetrist,'' which included scientists from the Nuclear  Studies Institute, Kiev State University, and the city  sanitary-epidemic station, acted as a mediator between the  Nuclear Studies Institute and the special combine.    As a result of the investigation, which lasted one year, it  is believed that violation of rules during the transportation  and burial of the waste created the threat of dangerous  irradiation for Kiev's population. The former deputy general  director of the specialized production association and the chief  of the radioactive waste burial site are accused of these  violations.</p>

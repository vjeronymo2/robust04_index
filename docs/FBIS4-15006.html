			<p>BFN     [Text] Boris Yeltsin said it was premature to raise the  question of whether he intends to be a candidate in the next  presidential elections. In an interview for an INTERFAX  correspondent, the president said that in the course of the two  remaining years before the elections, he saw his main task as  being the establishment of stable mutual relations between the  executive, legislative, and judicial authorities.    He said that new relations were already beginnig to take  shape with the Federation Council and the State Duma. The  president said the second task was to strengthen Russia's unity.  Acknowledging that the process of the establishment of federal  relations was at times painful and tense, Boris Yeltsin replied  that this process was, as a whole, under control.    The president regards the economy as the third priority  area.  He expressed the hope that in the coming two years, the  numerous ills of our economy would start to vanish and that we  would all feel better for that.</p>

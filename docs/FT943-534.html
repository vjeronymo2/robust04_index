			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Italian unions call for protests Italian trade union leaders yesterday called for countrywide protests in the run-up to a general strike on October 14 against proposals in the 1995 budget. The date for the four-hour stoppage was confirmed yesterday in the wake of Tuesday night's breakdown in talks between the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi and the unions over pension reform and spending cuts. Mr Berlusconi, presenting the 1995 budget at a press conference yesterday, described the general strike as 'an error' and insisted the budget had sought to spread the burden of sacrifices fairly. However, Mr Berlusconi's coalition partners, the populist Northern League, struck a discordant note on pensions. A League statement dissociated itself from one of the most controversial aspects of the government's pension reform - the reduction in benefits for those retiring before the normal pensionable age, even though they made the requisite contributions. Mr Berlusconi also announced a new privatisation timetable yesterday. He said Ilva, the state steel concern already partly privatised, and the remains of SME, the foodstuffs group, would be sold off this year. By the spring, the rest of INA, the insurance concern, would be sold. Stet, the telecoms group, and Enel, the electricity authority, would be sold soon after in the summer. Stet profits up as state sell-off set for summer, Page 28</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Amir al-Hulw: "The Usual Miserable Scenario"] </F>   [Text] From the time the evildoers issued their resolution  imposing economic sanctions on Iraq and set a bi-monthly  reevaluation to discuss the subject of continuing the sanctions  in the Security Council, they have been "eager" to concoct  events which they begin to broadcast "innocently" as regular  news through the "free" and liberal media publicly. Then they  "develop" the news into newspaper and television reports which  the Zionist lobby, present on the premises of the parliamentary  institutions of the US, Britain, and France, seizes, with  premeditated planning, to comment upon convulsively and  hatefully, as if the reports were true. They want "steps" to be  taken against Iraq for having committed these concocted events.  They allude to the "measures" they know, which we call "the  cowards' opportunity": the call to continue the economic  blockade of Iraq, ignoring the humanitarian effects on the proud  people of Iraq resulting from the oppressive sanctions.    The next phase comes, with is official character, as the  official spokesmen in the American White House, the Pentagon,  and the British Foreign Office hasten to voice their "disquiet"  that Iraq has not "complied" with the resolutions of the  international Security Council, then they begin to conspire in  the offices and corridors of the international Security Council  as the permanent delegates of those countries hold "intensive"  meetings with the other members of the Council to "formulate" a  new hostile stand against Iraq. There have been media  appearances and statements prior to the international Security  Council's next bimonthly meeting, indicating that they have  reached a draft resolution that they will present regularly and  speedily, once it is fully ready. So the Council recently  adopted its hostile resolution to continue the economic  sanctions against Iraq, without allowing any just voice to ask  about the extent of Iraq's implementation of the international  Security Council's resolutions, and what is actually required of  it to lift the sanctions, besides the publicly announced matters.</p>

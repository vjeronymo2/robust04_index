			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Henrik Qvortrup: "Progress Party Demands for a </F> Nonsocialist Government"]    [Text] The Progress Party has put up the price of its  support for a future Conservative People's Party-Liberal Party  government: A number of its flagship issues in the field of  domestic policy must be implemented. This comes after both the  Liberal Party and the Conservative People's Party have refused  to move on the demands they are making in the field of foreign  policy.    The Progress Party has produced tougher new demands which  are  to be met if there is to be future cooperation among the  Conservative People's Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progress  Party. They are to be the party's compensation, because even at  this present early stage Liberal Party chairman Uffe  Ellemann-Jensen is already rejecting any suggestion of moving  even an inch toward the Progress Party in the field of foreign  policy -- and this includes the sensitive question of the EU  [European Union].    In return for concessions on the EU question Progress Party  leader Pia Kjaersgaard wants more influence in the field of  domestic policy when the base for a nonsocialist government is  agreed.    "We are not simply the people who will go to the queen and  point to Ellemann-Jensen or Engell as the prime ministerial  candidate. We are setting a price," Pia Kjaersgaard stressed.    She and Kim Behnke, the party's finance policy spokesman,  have already planned in detail those areas in which the Progress  Party requires payment before it will supply the necessary seats  in support of a nonsocialist government:    -- The party wants the personal tax-free allowance increased  from 30,000 to 60,000 kroner.    -- Large-scale privatizations, of the Danish Statistical  Bureau and the State Vehicle Testing Service, for example.    -- Basic pensions must be increased.    -- And end to the right to family reunification and a  reduction in the annual refugee quota.    Both Pia Kjaersgaard and Kim Behnke stressed that the party  will consider itself to have a free hand if the Liberal Party  and the Conservaitve People's Party do not agree to its demands.    Liberal Party chairman Uffe Ellemann-Jensen commented that  it  is too early "to negotiate the details:" "But it is obvious  that they must have some influence."</p>

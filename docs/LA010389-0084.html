			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM TARGETS MINORITY ENTREPRENEURS  </P> <P> In the 12 years that Gregory B. Boyd spent working in corporate lending  departments at banks in California and Texas, his employers helped finance only  one minority business. Now, as a principal of a new Los Angeles venture capital  fund, Boyd hopes to improve the odds for cash-strapped minority entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> Backed with $500,000 in seed money from Lynwood-based Economic Resources Corp.,  a nonprofit economic development corporation that has been instrumental in  developing an industrial park near Watts, Boyd, 35, and his partners, Kenneth  T. Lombard and Lance Drummond, hope to raise $25 million from pension funds and  corporations to launch the ERC Capital Fund Ventures Partnership next month.  </P> <P> Theirs would be the first organized fund west of the Mississippi to raise  private money to buy a stake in minority businesses in hopes of turning a  profit. The three say they are particularly interested in financing  minority-run companies in manufacturing, telecommunications and real estate  development.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Formidable Odds  </P> <P> "Our job is to get minorities launched in significant businesses of significant  magnitude in a wide range of industries where we feel there is some upside,"  Boyd said. "The problem has been that capital has not been available. And we  say to our investors, 'Here's a way to satisfy social concerns and also make  money.' "  </P> <P> Historically, minority entrepreneurs have had to rely on banks or special  government programs, such as Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment  Corporations, or MESBICs, for financing. But with huge public pension funds  starting to earmark some of their assets for affirmative action and with  Southern California's reputation as a hotbed of entrepreneurship, Boyd said he  is convinced that ERC is perfectly positioned to be a force in the competitive  venture capital field.  </P> <P> But others say the three will face formidable odds in pursuing their agenda in  the venture capital business, a maturing industry that in its early years  helped launch such well-known companies as Federal Express and MCI  Communications Corp. Today, some 650 venture capital firms across the nation  manage about $30 billion, according to Venture Capital Journal, a trade  magazine. But as money has flooded in, returns have fallen. And lately big  investors have turned skittish.  </P> <P> "Venture capital financing has become much less popular in recent years and  downright unpopular in some circles," said Burton J. McMurtry, past chairman of  the National Venture Capital Assn. and a general partner of the venture capital  firm Technology Venture Investors in Menlo Park. "It's least popular among big  institutional investors who threw a lot of money at the venture capital  industry in the early 1980s, when it was at its peak. Now that returns are  down, they're pulling their money out."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, the industry's past largess did not greatly benefit minority  firms, said Gavin M. Chen, a senior economist with the Commerce Department's  Minority Business Development Agency. Chen said black, Latino and Asian-owned  firms received less than 5% of the equity financing provided by venture  capitalists in 1982, the latest year for which figures are available. And he  speculated that the percentages haven't changed significantly since then.  </P> <P> Two other privately managed minority venture capital funds founded several  years ago -- UNC Partners in Boston and Syndicated Communications in Washington  -- have made some inroads, financing dozens of minority businesses. But ERC's  venture fund could face significant resistance in raising money because it  hasn't built a track record.  </P> <P> "We would not hire (invest with) anybody without experience," said William O.  Bell, the chief investment official at Florida's state pension plan. Although  Bell said Florida is trying to seek more opportunities to place a portion of  its $15 billion in pension funds with minority money managers, he gives only to  those who have operated for at least three years. Other money managers require  at least 10 years of experience.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rules Limited Scope  </P> <P> With offices in a 52-acre industrial park near Watts, the ERC Venture Capital  Partnership seems an unlikely outpost for training venture capitalists. But  Drummond, the 60-year-old chairman of the nonprofit Economic Resources Corp.,  said he believes that ERC's previous experience in arranging corporate debt  financing as well as real estate development and leveraged buyouts will  persuade investors that ERC is up to the task of managing tens of millions of  dollars.  </P> <P> Drummond, Boyd and Lombard say their most important investment experience has  come from operating ERC's Capital Fund, which lends money to minority  businesses at fixed rates. Capitalized in 1984 at $1.7 million from federal  government sources and a Ford Foundation grant, the fund has lent nearly $2.4  million to 13 minority businesses. They include Royal Entertainment Inc., which  operates the Baldwin Theater, and Medialink VAR Corp., a black-owned  telecommunications firm.  </P> <P> The fund has also helped syndicate an additional $10.5 million in loans to  various minority businesses, including a $4.8-million loan package that enabled  black entrepreneur James W. Norton to engineer a leveraged buyout of Argon  Industries, a Los Angeles-based manufacturer of plastic products.  </P> <P> The Capital Fund, however, operates under government and Ford Foundation rules  that limit its scope and size, and therefore did not take equity positions in  companies it financed.  </P> <P> Yet ERC's banker, Barry W. Uzel, president of the National Bank of California  who has worked with Drummond and Boyd for years, contends that "the skills  learned (from debt financing) are more or less transferable to venture  capital." He said he endorses ERC's move into the venture capital field.  </P> <P> Drummond, a native of New York, developed his reputation as a successful  businessman in the 1970s, when he headed his own broadcast investment firm and  a liquor wholesale business which, at its peak in 1978, grossed $23 million and  ranked among the top 10 largest black businesses in the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Times Have Changed  </P> <P> Since joining ERC six years ago as a director, Drummond has guided ERC's real  estate division through its most active period of growth, including the  construction of the Martin Luther King Shopping Center in Watts and the Century  Terrace Condominiums.  </P> <P> He will be assisted in managing the fund by Lombard, a former regional director  of the Los Angeles brokerage firm Grubb &amp; Ellis, and by Boyd, who has held  assistant vice president posts in the corporate financing divisions of Lloyd's  Bank of California and First National Bank of Chicago's offices in Houston.  </P> <P> "This is not 1965 anymore," said Drummond. "The government is cutting back on  all different kinds of aid. If we want to play in the mainstream, we have to  play where the mainstream is being played, venture financing. Unfortunately the  MESBIC program has not been the great success that everybody wanted . . . .  It's young guys like these (Boyd and Lombard) that are the best hope for our  future."  </P></p>

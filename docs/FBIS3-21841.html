			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>   [Text] Deputy Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero has reported  that the Panamanian Government is cooperating with the DEA in  the investigation of crimes related to drug trafficking.    The DEA dismantled a drug trafficking ring that laundered  more than $10 million and was made up of Panamanian and  Colombian lawyers, accountants, and businessmen. Cordero said  that there is cooperation with DEA authorities to investigate  drug related crimes. The diplomat said that he agrees with  acting Attorney General Bolivar Davalos on the rules for this  cooperation and added that the Foreign Relations Ministry will  collaborate in this regard.    Cordero said that DEA participation in investigations  related  to drug trafficking do not violate the country's sovereignty as  long as Panama grants authorization as a sovereign country,  which it is.    The investigations indicate that distributors in this  network  introduced large amounts of cocaine into the United States from  Colombia and Panama. The deputy foreign minister pointed out  that DEA agents no longer participate in searches or arrests in  Panama, leaving these tasks to Panamanian authorities.</p>

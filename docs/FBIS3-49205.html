Minister Granic informed his guest about the process and  results of the talks he had yesterday with Bosnia-Herzegovina  Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic in Vienna. He laid particular  stress on the importance of an urgent cessation of hostilities  between the Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia, an issue on  which Presidents Franjo Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic will have  talks in Bonn on Saturday.    After informing his guest about the situation in the  occupied  areas of Croatia, Minister Granic said Croatia is resolved to  achieve a solution for these areas in a peaceful way through  negotiations in accordance with relevant UN Security Council  resolutions. But he also mentioned the decisive responsibility  borne by Serbia and Slobodan Milosevic for the present situation  in these areas, and stated the readiness of local power-holders  to negotiate and reach a peaceful solution to all problems.    Yasushi Akashi pointed out he will do everything possible to  implement all relevant UN Security Council resolutions and that  he expects close cooperation with and support from the Croatian  authorities in implementing the complex task of the United  Nations, and particularly the UN Protection Force, in restoring  peace and stability in this area.</p>

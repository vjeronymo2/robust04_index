			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Nuclear safety levels set SAFETY standards at future nuclear power stations should be set so that the risk to the public is 10 times smaller than the danger of a road accident, according to new guidelines published yesterday by the Health and Safety Executive, the industrial safety regulator. The HSE's report is a response to the 1986 public inquiry into the Sizewell B nuclear reactor, which called for standards on the tolerable level of risk to the public from nuclear power. The HSE concludes: 'We propose to adopt a risk (of death to a member of the public) of 1 in 100,000 a year as the benchmark for new nuclear power stations in the UK'. It compares that with the risk of 1 in 10,000 of dying in a traffic accident, 1 in 13,000 of a woman dying in childbirth, or 1 in 1,000,000 of dying in a fire or gas explosion at home. The report differs from the HSE's preliminary 1988 study in that human error is brought into the models, increasing some of the estimates of risk. The HSE's consultation document applies only to future nuclear power stations. Mr John Rimington, the HSE's director-general, said: 'We do not know how to quantify the risk from the Magnox stations' - the oldest of Britain's reactors. He added: 'What we do know is that they are enormously robust.' The HSE intends its recommendations to be part of the debate about the future of Britain's nuclear power industry. However, no new nuclear power stations are likely to be built until the completion of the government study into nuclear power's future, due in 1994.

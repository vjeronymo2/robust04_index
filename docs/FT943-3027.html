			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Kiev ministers poised to clinch deal with IMF Ukraine is on the verge of reaching its first agreement with the International Monetary Fund, a step which could unlock the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) in aid promised by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, senior Ukrainian and western officials said this week. Ukrainian cabinet ministers said they believed the country could reach a preliminary agreement with the IMF on an initial Dollars 700m loan to stabilise the economy by the end of the month. An agreement with the IMF would be the strongest signal so far that Ukraine, one of the weakest economies in the region, is about to attempt a radical economic transformation. 'We have a plan that will meet IMF conditions,' said Mr Roman Shpek, the reform-minded economy minister who is spearheading Kiev's negotiations with the Fund. 'There is now enough political will in Ukraine.' Western diplomats said Ukraine could reach the preliminary agreement with the Fund as soon as next Tuesday. Final approval would come at the IMF's summit in Madrid next month. To meet IMF conditions Ukraine, which has one of the least reformed economies in the region, must liberalise prices, reform the currency, overhaul its restrictive taxation and trade policies and slash its budget deficit from its current high of 20 per cent of GDP to 10-12 per cent. But if Kiev takes these difficult steps, the talks with the IMF and parallel negotiations with the World Bank to release a Dollars 400m rehabilitation loan could be the beginning of the first serious attempt to implement market reforms since Ukraine became independent nearly four years ago. Some western politicians and economists, many of whom had dismissed Ukraine as an economic basket case, have begun to argue that if Ukraine chooses to reform it should be supported with substantial western assistance. The Dollars 4bn, pledged at the G7 summit in Naples in July, was the first concrete move in this direction. 'I just can't believe that the west would miss this chance,' said Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist who advised Poland when it pioneered 'shock therapy' reforms nearly five years ago. 'You have a classic situation in Ukraine where you could have a very good programme or the opportunity could be lost. But they need a push from President Clinton and Chancellor Kohl.' However, if President Leonid Kuchma's administration chooses to push for radical economic reforms it could face tough opposition from Ukraine's communist-dominated parliament, where MPs from the rust-belt in the east of the country have a powerful voice. Although Mr Kuchma has already demonstrated a greater willingness to over-rule parliament by exercising the president's right to issue decrees, he is expected next Tuesday to ask the legislature to lift its moratorium on privatisation. Within the next few days his advisers say he will also present a comprehensive economic reform plan to the parliament. Moreover, Prime Minister Vitaly Masol, an appointee of the previous president, has openly opposed reforms. But some western observers believe that Mr Kuchma, who has been quietly moving his own, more reformist, allies into the cabinet, may be trying to isolate and eventually sack Mr Masol. These political uncertainties, and lingering doubts about Mr Kuchma's own commitment to reforms, have prompted some leading Ukrainian politicians to urge the west not to give aid to Ukraine until it acts on its reformist promises. 'Ukraine is like an alcoholic asking for a loan to buy more vodka,' Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, one of the leading advocates of radical reforms in the parliament, said. Before giving Ukraine financial assistance, he warned senior World Bank officials at a meeting last week, they must be confident that the government had 'kicked the state out of the economy'.</p>

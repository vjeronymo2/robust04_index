			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> CITY STAFF'S ACTIONS TO BE INVESTIGATED  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday ordered an investigation into city staff's behavior  in connection with the case of Henry 'n Harry's Goat Hill Tavern.  </P> <P> The council specifically wants to know whether a city employee tipped off bar  owner Robert R. Ziemer about a neighbor who has led the complaints against the  bar, which is struggling to keep a conditional use permit to operate.  </P> <P> Ziemer photographed Sheila Ward as she was being led by paramedics to a waiting  ambulance at her Magnolia Avenue home last December. Her second-story apartment  faces the back parking lot of several businesses on Newport Boulevard,  including the Goat Hill Tavern, 1830 Newport Blvd.  </P> <P> He submitted the photos of Ward to the City Council at its July 16 meeting, he  said, to disprove an entry in Ward's diary that noted disturbances at the bar.  Ziemer, in a note submitted to the council, said the pictures were taken Dec.  20, the same day Ward noted complaints about honking, yelling, screaming and  car alarms going off in the parking lot.  </P> <P> However, Ward admits she erred logging the the date of those complaints.  </P> <P> Mayor Peter F. Buffa, who called for the investigation, said he wants to find  out whether any city employee alerted Ziemer that an ambulance and paramedics  had been dispatched to Ward's apartment.  </P> <P> "I don't intend to investigate our employees but whether we can be assured of  the public's right to confidentiality when they call on the city's emergency  personnel," Buffa said.  </P> <P> Ziemer has said he always keeps a loaded camera at the bar to photograph  celebrities that drop by. The late Billy Martin and fighter Ken Norton have  been photographed at the bar.  </P> <P> The City Council has refused to renew Ziemer's conditional use permit to  operate the bar, a move which eventually could shut the tavern down. The  council has heard testimony from surrounding businesses and neighbors and  received police and fire department reports connecting the bar's patrons to  several complaints, including being drunk in public, drug possession and  disorderly conduct.  </P> <P> In all, 24 police reports were submitted to the council about complaints  stemming from the bar. However, Ziemer disputes most of the reports.  </P> <P> "My lawyer forced them to go back and look at how many were attributable to us  and they found there were nine in a period of four months," Ziemer said.  "That's unheard of."  </P> <P> Ziemer has appealed the council's decision and is awaiting an Oct. 3 hearing  scheduled in Orange County Superior Court.  </P> <P> "We want a hearing before the judge, and we're hoping that he's going to give  us a (fair) hearing," Ziemer said.  </P> <P> Ward says she is happy the city will look into the circumstances surrounding  the pictures. She refuses to say what she was being treated for when the  paramedics came.  </P> <P> "I feel like at this point I'm living in a fish bowl. If I go out of my  apartment, I'm called names. . . . I feel these are tactics of intimidation,"  Ward said.  </P> <P> "I'm just a private citizen voicing complaints that I have the right to  voice."MARY ANNE PEREZ  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Regarding the issue of dumping radioactive waste  into the sea by Russia, the Japanese Government agreed in  principle to provide the Russian Government with a 10,000-ton  class secondhand tanker to be used as an emergency waste  storage. Japan will spend 1 to 1.5 billion yen for this  purpose. At a specialists' meeting held in Moscow, Japan  presented the name of a tanker, which can be used as a storage  facility. It seems that a sales contract will be signed with  the owner of the ship as early as mid-January after Russia  completes its studies.    The ship in question is a chemical tanker of Panamanian  registry. Russian specialists will soon inspect the tanker which  is anchored at a harbor in Singapore prior to signing a contract.    Currently, there are storage facilities in the Russian Far  East and about 1,900 tons of liquid radioactive waste can be  stored there. However, they are almost full and very old.    Saying "the environment in the Far East region is in a  critical situation," Russia has asked Japan to provide it with a  secondhand tanker with 5,000 to 20,000 tons of storage capacity  by utilizing the $100 million support fund designed for the  former Soviet Union for dismantling nuclear weapons.</p>

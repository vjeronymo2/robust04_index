			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / International Company News: Anglovaal lifts dividend by 5% ANGLOVAAL, the South African mining and industrial group, reported improved profits for the year ended June, and is increasing its dividend to 105 cents a share from 100 cents. Net earnings rose by 6 per cent to R293.1m (Dollars 86.2m), due mostly to a strong performance from the industrial operations. The group forecast a further improvement in profits for this year. Anglovaal is one of South Africa's six big mining houses, but 69 per cent of earnings last year came from industrial operations - Anglovaal Industries - where the performance was boosted by lower tax and a full year's contribution from the Anglo-Alpha cement arm. Income from the group's main direct mining investments - gold, copper and manganese - fell by 20 per cent to R37.9m. Income from indirect mining investments rose marginally to R34.2m from R29.6m. Financial earnings were substantially lower - down to R17.9m from R29.6m - as a result of lower cash holdings and falling interest rates. Earnings were also affected by the troubles at the Crusader Life insurance company. Provisions have been made for potential losses in this area. Group turnover rose by 4 per cent to R8.5bn but pressure on margins saw operating profit fall by 4 per cent to R719.5m from R747.8m. The rise in attributable profit was the result of a lower tax bill and an increase in equity accounted earnings.</p>

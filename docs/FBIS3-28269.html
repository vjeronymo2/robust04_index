Mr. Kantor  failed to extract a "political decision" from Japanese leaders  on setting numerical targets and the 6 trillion yen in income  tax cuts, that the prime minister announced in the early dawn of  3 February, fell short of fulfilling U.S. expectations. Some  U.S. Government officials are hinting at the possibility of the  United States slapping sanctions against Japan, saying: "Now  that Mr. Kantor's Tokyo visit failed to move forward Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks, we have no choice but to take  hard-line measures." Hence, the Japan-U.S. summit slated for 11  February is highly likely to be held in an uncomfortable  atmosphere.    At meetings with Prime Minister Hosokawa and Finance  Minister  Fujii, Mr. Kantor highly spoke of the government's decision to  cut the income tax, but a U.S. Government source in Tokyo  complained about the size of the income tax cut, saying: "The  income tax reduction is short 1-2 trillion yen from what the  U.S. Government expected." The prevailing view is that Mr.  Kantor refrained from expressing his unhappiness with the size  of the income tax cut after concluding that any further U.S.  pressure on the Hosokawa government, beset with the issue of  securing financial resources to make up for a fiscal shortfall  incurring from the income tax reduction, will not serve the  interests of the United States. For the United States, Prime  Minister Hosokawa is the only Japanese leader who can decide on  Japan's concessions at the talks.    During his Japan stay, Mr. Kantor took a very tough attitude  at a series of meetings with the prime minister and cabinet  ministers. At a 2 February meeting with Tsutomu Hata, deputy  prime minister and foreign minister, the American official said:  "Japan and the United States are engaged in the three pillars  of economy, security, and international cooperation." His  statement meant not to stress the importance of bilateral  matters other than the bilateral economic issue, but to suggest  that if the bilateral economic issue is not resolved, it would  undermine the entire Japan-U.S. relationship, including  international cooperation and security. His statement can be  taken as a strong U.S. resolve that it will not hesitate to  review Japan-U.S. relations that [President Clinton once called]  the "most important bilateral relations in the world."</p>

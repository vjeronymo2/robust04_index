			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: SWOOPING IN AND OUT WITH TEXAS' D.O.C.;  </P> <P> THE D.O.C. "NOBODY DOES IT BETTER." RUTHLESS /ATLANTIC: *** 1/2: POP STARS:  ***** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE: ***** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S: *** GOOD VIBRATIONS: **  MAYBE BABY: * AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> Hip-hop, like disco, is essentially a producer's medium, and it's often more  accurate to rave about a Matt Dike sound or a Teddy Riley sound than about a  Tone Loc or a Kool Moe Dee. This year's hot hard-core hip-hop sound comes from  Dr. Dre, the Compton-bred deejay behind Ruthless Records, which in the last  several months has released million-selling rap LPs by J.J. Fad, Eazy-E and  N.W.A.  </P> <P> The D.O.C., a Texas rapper who led the undistinguished electro-hop posse Fila  Fresh Crew, is Ruthless' newest artist, and Dre has transformed him into  something of a Compton-style Big Daddy Kane, a guy who plays the English  language the way Itzhak Perlman plays a Strad. The D.O.C.'s lyrics cut and his  rhymes are fresh, while his mild voice functions almost as a rat-a-tat  obbligato that rhythmically supports the groove, swooping in and out of the  beat.  </P> <P> Though his subject matter tends toward loud boasting, his raps submit  absolutely to the tyranny of the beat box, which itself supports funky riffs  lifted from the likes of Parliament and the Sylvers. Label-owner Eazy-E and the  rest of N.W.A are generous with the cameo appearances we've grown to expect on  any Ruthless release. JONATHAN GOLD  </P></p>

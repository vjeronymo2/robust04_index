			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Statement by Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy on </F> the position adopted by the Group of 39, issued by the Press  Center of the Bulgarian Socialist Party"; date not given]    [Text] The Press Center of the Bulgarian Socialist Party  [BSP] and the Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy [PSSD] is  authorized to issue the following statement:    At present the Group of 39 [deputies of the former Grand  National Assembly who refused to sign the new Constitution in  1991] is attempting, through the agency of the chairman of the  National Assembly, to cast on the BSP the guilt for its own  grave crimes as regards the democratic changes in Bulgaria. It  was the extremist actions of the Union of Democratic Forces  (SDS) following the Varna meeting of the Group of 39 two years  ago that led to the blocking of the agrarian reform, the  repoliticization of the judiciary, the escalation of political  persecution, and the transformation of property restitution into  total restoration of the old state of affairs.    Then the SDS used slanders and insinuations against the BSP  as alibis in the eyes of Bulgaria and the world. Today,  however, nothing can conceal the brazen sabotage of the state's  power that is being carried out by the highly paid bureaucrats  foisted on the state by the SDS.    This latest hysterical propaganda campaign against the BSP  cannot distract attention from the grave situation within the  blue [SDS] coalition. The intrigues that each person in the SDS  is pursuing against all the rest, including through election  barriers, lists of deputies, and bargaining in the lobbies, are  today a public secret. They cannot be camouflaged by the  ostensible anticommunism displayed by guilty dabblers in  politics.    It is high time that the SDS stopped engrossing society in  its own political degradation, as it leaves the problems that it  has itself created for others to solve. The cheap demagogy of  the SDS deputies will not relieve them of their responsibility  for Bulgaria's collapse.</p>

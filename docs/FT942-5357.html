			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (13): High income may be an illusion - Robin Angus asks why anyone should prefer to pay tax at their top rate on low-quality income returns, rather than cash in high-quality capital returns and pay no tax on them at all I had a very upsetting experience a few months ago. At the annual general meeting of a blue-chip general investment trust, which had risen in price by well over 30 per cent during the previous year, I met an intelligent-looking private shareholder. 'You must be very happy with your portfolio,' I remarked. He made a woeful face and shook his head. 'I haven't worked out my total income for the year yet,' he said sadly. 'But I'm pretty sure it'll be down.' And he went on to suggest that he would shortly be switching out of his lower-yielding general trusts into high-yielding specialist trusts, or into the income shares of split-capital trusts. In my view, that man needed to consult not an independent financial adviser (IFA) but a psychiatrist. He was a prisoner of the absurd fixation that, however large and soundly-based his capital profits might be, the only thing he could possibly live off was his income. As a result, he probably sold a high-quality investment and bought one offering him a higher yield but a much lower total return. And that was what I found so upsetting. The quest for high income has dominated the retail investment world recently. Sometimes it has seemed that you could bundle up any old rubbish, stick a fancy yield on it and sell it in limitless quantities. And people have panicked into such investments, because they are no longer getting the 9 or 10 per cent interest rates they have become used to over the past 10 or 20 years. But where do they suppose these so-called 'high interest rates' actually came from? The charitable impulses of the banks and building societies? What a hope. Interest rates were high because inflation was high. So, unknown to themselves, people were living off their own capital, which was being handed back to them as 'interest'. And yet such people often tell you that to live off capital is the one thing you should never do. It baffles me that people apparently prefer paying tax at their top rate on low-quality income returns to cashing in high-quality capital returns and paying no tax on them at all. If I needed a high income from my savings, I wouldn't even look at a 'high yield' investment. I would either go to the monthly income plan offered by Ivory &amp; Sime ISIS (unique in the investment trust sector so far, although some unit trust groups have followed suit), or I would buy shares in good, sound diversified trusts which were likely to appreciate substantially in value over the years while still paying a reasonably dividend. Then I would sell a small percentage of my shares annually, in order to exploit the greatest tax-break of all - the fact that realised capital gains are tax-free to a level of Pounds 5,800 per annum to all taxpayers (Pounds 11,600 to a married couple). I also find it baffling that some people seem prepared to commit large chunks of their savings to highly specialised investment trusts. Emerging-markets trusts, for instance, are intended essentially for institutions that need to invest in these markets but lack the expertise to do it for themselves. Private investors can certainly join the party. But they should do so only with the 5 or 10 per cent of their total net worth they set aside for their 'fun' investments. And if I stagged new issues in the trust market, I would do so only with my 5 or 10 per cent of fun-money, too. I should hate my main portfolio to be treated as a sort of cut-and-come-again cake, off which stockbrokers or IFAs were constantly slicing commissions. Dreary though I may sound, I treat my main portfolio more like bread dough. I add the yeast, in the form of proven, dependable blue-chip trust shares, and then I leave it to rise peacefully by itself. But enough of all these 'don'ts'. I am excited and encouraged by much that is happening in the trust sector at the moment. In particular, since all my own investing is done through trust Peps and savings schemes, I am pleased to see increasing numbers of people recognising their merits. My biggest hope for the future, however, is the way in which the industry is starting to respond to what are called 'lifestyle needs'. Life is a series of liabilities. We have to buy houses, educate our children, provide for ill-health, plan for our old age, and provide also for our dependants when we die. And in all these areas, the state will tend to help us less and less. So in order to meet the liabilities in our personal balance sheet, we have to match them with assets accumulated for the purpose. And this is where trusts have a major opportunity. Lifestyle needs usually cannot be met by straightforward purchases of investment trust shares, whether as Peps or through savings schemes. A direct holding of Foreign &amp; Colonial shares, for instance, would not satisfy the Inland Revenue as a personal pension scheme. But the new Foreign &amp; Colonial Pension does. So I warmly welcome it as a way of enlarging the sector's customer base, along with similar planned initiatives from other investment trust management groups like Flemings, Kleinwort Benson and Ivory &amp; Sime. When investment trusts started life in the 1870s, people bought shares as their main form of provision for the future. Today, instead, they buy savings products designed to do specific things, like provide pensions or pay off mortgages. Investment trusts were slow to realise this, but are now making up for lost time. And it is through meeting these lifestyle needs that investment trusts will survive and grow into the next century. Robin Angus is director (equities) with NatWest Securities</p>

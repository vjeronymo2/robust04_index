			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Westlink buy-out Westlink, the first London Buses subsidiary to be privatised, has been sold to its management in a Pounds 2m deal, Charles Batchelor writes. Pictured are Clive Hodson, managing director of London Buses and London Transport bus privatisation director, and Jeff Chamberlain, Westlink managing director. Westlink is the trading name for Stanwell Buses, which operates 118 buses from depots in Hounslow and Kingston, west London. It made Pounds 220,000 after-tax profit on sales of Pounds 5.3m last year. The sale of the other 10 London Bus companies is expected to be completed by the end of this year. London Buses said Westlink had been sold first because it was the smallest.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE RETELLING OF FAIRY TALES TOO OFT TOLD  </P> <P> What's the big movie this summer? "Batman." What's the big musical? "The  Phantom of the Opera." What do they have in common?  </P> <P> We already know the story. Like the Greeks trooping into the amphitheater to  see the latest version of "Medea," we've got a general sense of who the  characters are and what sort of thing will happen to them. But we're eager to  see what this telling of the tale will produce. "Tell it again," we say. 'And,  pray, surprise us."  </P> <P> It's the same with "Cinderella" at Long Beach Civic Light Opera and "Peter Pan"  at Occidental College's splendid new Keck Theatre. In fact, these are stories  that we may know too well, those of us who aren't children. Is there anything  new to say about Cinderella?  </P> <P> Stephen Sondheim proved that there was in "Into the Woods." But the LBCLO  version is Rodgers and Hammerstein's 1957 TV musical adapted for the stage. It  is rather sweet and slightly funny. (Cinderella's sisters -- Pamela Myers and  Kathryn Skatula -- are stupes rather than meanies.)  </P> <P> Enchanting? No. Without camping the story, Hammerstein reduces it to his kind  of fairy tale, where an adorable young woman learns to follow her dream and  thereby catch the prize, i.e., the prince. It's to the credit of actress Juliet  Lambert that we like Cinderella as much as we do, for her lyrics are mush.  </P> <P> The prince is played by Greg Louganis, the Olympic diver. When he waltzes with  Cinderella, it's a neat but modest one-two-three. He has pitch problems in "Do  I Love You Because You're Beautiful, or Are You Beautiful Because I Love You?"  </P> <P> His line readings aren't bad, though. We can even say that he creates a  character: a likable young man who doesn't particularly want to be a prince,  but who is living up to what his parents (Alan Young, Marilyn Child) expect of  him. This probably comes closer to real life than the standard Prince Charming,  and is at least a point of interest in Fran Soeder's by-the-book staging.  </P> <P> The major technical interest is to see how the show adapts to the stage. Not  badly. Cinderella's friendly godmother, Pat Carroll, turns the pumpkin into the  coach practically before our very eyes (Adam Bezark is credited with the  special effects), and Cinderella throws her wedding bouquet to the audience,  proving that it's not TV.  </P> <P> Point of information: The King and Queen's duet, "Boys and Girls Like You and  Me," wasn't written for "Cinderella" but for "Oklahoma." It was dropped in  Boston and ought to be dropped here too -- it doesn't pertain.  </P> <P> If "Cinderella" offers no surprises, Occidental's "Peter Pan" offers several.  This is not the Disney version (back in the movie theaters this summer) and  it's not the Mary Martin musical version either. It is Sir James M. Barrie's  original 1903 play, expanded with sections from the novel.  </P> <P> Barrie was a mother-dominated Scots bachelor who really did believe in  ghoulies, beasties and things that go bump in the dark, and there's a lot more  death and sex in his story than are dreamed of in the usual presentation.  </P> <P> Rather than being a sparky little guy who always gets to go out to play, Peter  can almost be seen as a creature being punished for his hubris -- a "lost boy"  who will never make human contact, will never grow older and will never be  permitted to die.  </P> <P> The gloom is heavily observed in Alan Freeman's production, with its dark  atmospherics (Pamela Gross did the filmy setting, Howard Schmitt the costumes)  and its mournful piano music. And yet Freeman's cast tries to play the story  cheerfully, the way it is played in the musical.  </P> <P> The disparity created problems at the preview I saw, which also had some  technical problems. For example, John Clancy as Peter -- yes, a young man in  the role for once -- is as frank and open as Huck Finn. But with none of the  latent poignancy that comes across even in the musical. It's particularly  missed when the approach is so decidedly serious.  </P> <P> Nancy Walsh's Wendy did, however, evoke some of that character's very  complicated reactions when Peter insists on treating her as his mother. And the  flying sequences (as in all productions of "Peter Pan," they are managed by the  Foy Brothers) are magical.  </P> <P> The new Keck Hall is a beauty, by the way: a state-of-the-art version of a  European court theater, just large enough (400 seats) to make a young performer  extend himself, but not too large to daunt him.  </P> <P>  "Peter Pan" plays at 8 p.m. this Thursday and Saturday, and also on Aug. 18  and 20. Matinees are at 2 p.m. Aug. 20, 26, 27 and Sept. 2. Closes Sept. 2.  Tickets $6-$13. 1600 Campus Rd. (213) 259-2772.  </P> <P>  "Cinderella" plays at 8 p.m. Wednesdays-Saturdays, with matinees at 2 p.m.  Saturdays and Sundays. Closes Aug. 20. Tickets $7.50-$26. Terrace Theatre, Long  Beach Convention Center. (213) 432-7926 or (714) 826-9371.  </P> <P> </P></p>

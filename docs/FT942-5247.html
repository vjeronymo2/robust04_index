			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Survey of Canada (10): Johnson leads fight to stop breakaway  -Robert Gibbens looks ahead to an important provincial election in Quebec Quebec's coming election will bring Canada's only French-speaking province face-to-face with a choice between the mainstream and some form of breakaway from the rest of the country. Mr Daniel Johnson, the 49-year-old premier, who was acclaimed leader of the federalist Quebec Liberals last December after the ailing Mr Robert Bourassa resigned, is battling to persuade nervous voters that he can revive a sluggish economy with tighter management, co-operation with Ottawa and resurgent private sector investment. His Parti Quebecois opponent, Mr Jacques Parizeau, 63, the province's finance minister from 1976 to 1984 and a hardline nationalist, says political separation is the only way out of the confederation straitjacket. Were he to win the election, Mr Parizeau promises an independence referendum would follow within a year. He knows, however, that the Quebec electorate is older and more cautious than in the 1970s and 1980s, and that first-past-the-post in 1994 does not mean the subsequent referendum is won. Both sides have sought the blessing of international investors and politicians. Mr Johnson has won approval so long as he keeps a tight rein on budget spending. Mr Parizeau has met the same scepticism as in 1977, just after the PQ first took power: The typical US view is that Quebec can get what it wants from Canada and cannot afford to go it alone. Mr Jean Chretien, the federal prime minister, in the tradition of his mentor, Mr Pierre Trudeau, is implacably against separation or sovereignty. The election will probably come in September. Quebec, with 7m people, is Canada's second biggest province after Ontario and 99 per cent French-speaking outside Greater Montreal. Montreal's Francophone population is about 70 per cent of a total 3m; the balance is Anglophone and 'Allophone', in other words, those whose mother tongues are neither English nor French. Both Mr Johnson and Mr Parizeau lack seasoned supporting talent and inherit a heavy baggage of past mistakes. Voters remember the PQ government's disintegration after failing to carry the 1980 referendum on sovereignty. But they blame the Liberals for 12 per cent unemployment and the decline of Montreal - key to the province's economy. The PQ's 1979 legislation to protect French, make it the language of work and restrict immigrants' access to English schools, retains solid Francophone support. The Liberals can make only token concessions. Since 1990, the economy has been hit by the North American recession and depressed world commodity prices, accelerated Canada-US free trade, defence cuts and the soaring costs of health and other public services. Old industries have withered. A new economy, based heavily on research, aerospace, communications, software, electronics and pharmaceuticals, is taking shape slowly. A wave of investment in hydro power and primary aluminium plants has tapered off. Many new industrial projects are delayed by political uncertainty. The PQ won five by-elections in a row before the Liberals turned the tide in March. The polls have consistently shown the PQ ahead, though Mr Johnson leads Mr Parizeau in personal popularity. But Quebec's most popular politician is the charismatic Mr Lucien Bouchard, leader of the Bloc Quebecois, which promotes the separatist cause at the federal level. The BQ took 54 of Quebec's 75 seats in the October 1993 federal election and Mr Bouchard became Opposition leader in Ottawa. Many PQ supporters would prefer Mr Bouchard as their leader, saying he could best lead them to victory in the coming election. His 'sovereignty' and 'independence' options sound more palatable to anxious voters than Mr Parizeau's hardline 'separation' and his curt dismissal of Canada and all its sins. The Quebec Liberals have studied the 1993 rout of the federal Conservatives and a come-from-behind victory by Mr Ralph Klein's Conservatives in Alberta. They have consulted the Conservatives in Britain. But no Quebec party has won a third successive majority mandate since 1952. Another handicap is that 35 of the 92 Liberals elected to the national assembly in the last election in 1989 are not running again - including some big names. The Liberals at present hold 79 of the 125 seats in the national assembly, compared with the PQ's 33. The Liberals see the risks quite clearly. Though the economy is slowly turning, spurred by the US upsurge, real growth may not reach the predicted 3 per cent or enough to meet job-creation promises. Moreover, public sector cutbacks, overseen by Mr Johnson as Treasury Board head, are not yet complete. 'If we could translate Mr Johnson's personal popularity into voter intentions, we'd be talking about how many seats we're going to win,' says Mr John Parisella, Liberal campaign chairman. He claims the Liberals have some big names ready to run in several 'safe' Montreal ridings. Mr Parizeau's strategy is clear. If the PQ forms the next government, he says, the national assembly will pass a resolution starting the process of separation and the division of Canada's assets and liabilities. A referendum will follow. 'People who vote PQ will have thought it through and I want no ambiguity,' Mr Parizeau says. He promises the referendum question will be simple and clear this time. But the 'new' Quebec would aim to retain the Canadian dollar as its currency and accept Bank of Canada policies. The PQ remains the only alternative and attempts to set up a third party have failed miserably. Mr Johnson says Quebec must remain an important part of the federal system to prosper in the era of global trade. It must actively spur private sector investment and cultivate the new economy. 'We must remain outward-looking and benefit from world trade,' he says. About one-third of the electorate is undecided. It is still not clear whether Mr Johnson can overcome history and win the Liberals a third term.</p>

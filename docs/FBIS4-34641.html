			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 21 Jun (EFE) -- Ecuadoran President Sixto  Duran Ballen today decreed a national state of emergency after  the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie)  rejected a proposal to create a joint commission to draft a Land  Development Law reforms package. Just before the official  suspension of constitutional rights, the president had said "the  situation in several cities was no longer bearable."    Peasant and Indian demonstrations began on 13 June, right  after President Duran Ballen signed the new land law into  effect. The demonstrators erected roadblocks on many of the  countries roads and highways, looted businesses in several  cities, and clashed with authorities resulting in at least three  Indians dead and a dozen wounded.    During a meeting between Duran Ballen and Conaie leaders on  Monday, the president said he would not repeal the law. Instead  he proposed the formation of a joint commission to reform the  law and to draw up the regulations that will govern its  enforcement. The Indians, who make up about 30 to 50 percent of  the country's total population of 10 million, finally rejected  the proposals.</p>

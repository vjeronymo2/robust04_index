			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> RAIN BRINGS NO DROUGHT RELIEF  </P> <P> A vigorous upper-level storm hatched in the Gulf of Alaska dumped almost half  an inch of rain in some areas of Orange County this morning, but authorities  said the amount is not significant in easing the area's prolonged drought.  </P> <P> Joe Haug, a spokesman for the county Environmental Management Agency, said  about four-tenths of an inch was recorded in some central and southern parts of  the county this morning.  </P> <P> "This wouldn't do anything to the drought at all," Haug said. "We've given up  on hoping (heavy rainfall) will solve the drought. We are hoping that, next  winter, snow in the Sierras will replenish our water supply."  </P> <P> The early-morning showers were blamed for 24 minor traffic accidents reported  throughout the county before 10:30 a.m., California Highway Patrol Officer  Linda Burrus said.  </P> <P> Fire officials said the limited rainfall may complicate this year's "very  critical" fire season, which is to open within the next month.  </P> <P> "This little rainfall causes some growth, which then dries up very quickly and  adds more fuel to the already-dry countryside," said Kathleen Cha, a  spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire Department.  </P> <P> There is a slight chance later today of more showers in the mountain regions of  the county, according to WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The  Times.  </P> <P> Lows tonight will be in the mid-40s to mid-50s.  </P> <P> WeatherData meteorologist Rick Dittmann said clear skies and slightly warmer  temperatures are predicted for Tuesday.  </P></p>

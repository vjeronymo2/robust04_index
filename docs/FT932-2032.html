			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Letter: Ridiculous attack on EBRD Sir, Your coverage of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development seems to have been targeted mainly against its founder president, Mr Jacques Attali. At no time have you highlighted the constructive work he has done. You know very well that offices built just 10-15 years ago are out of date for modern purposes, so you cannot blame Mr Attali if his deputies took into consideration the needs of today and tomorrow. You attack his travelling expenses, but he has serious responsibilities, and time and other factors have to be considered. It is ridiculous that you should pick on an establishment with so much importance in the way you are doing. D Gokani, 88 High Street, Harrow-on-the-Hill, Middx HA2 0JF</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / High-risk strategy in global game: Talks on China's application to rejoin Gatt are nearing a climax One of the world's longest and tensest diplomatic poker games is nearing a climax. As negotiators on China's application to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade prepare to leave Geneva for the Christmas holidays at the end of this week, the time has come for bluffs to be called. How the game is played out in the next few days may determine whether a formula can be found for China's orderly integration into the multilateral trade system - or whether Beijing carries out its repeated threats to walk away from the bargaining table and pursue go-it-alone economic policies. Either way, the stakes are momentous. With a quarter of the world's population and one of its fastest growing economies, China is already a magnet to foreign exporters and investors. On recent trends, it may overtake the US to become the world's biggest economic powerhouse before the middle of the next century. China's erratic pace of reform, often chaotic business conditions and continued adherence to many of the practices of a command economy will not be easy to align with multilateral trade rules and disciplines. The task threatens to impose serious strains on the Gatt and its successor, the World Trade Organisation, which will be established at the start of next year. But it is widely accepted that keeping China out of the WTO would be even worse, and could turn the country into an international rogue elephant. Paraphrasing former US President Lyndon Johnson, one trade negotiator says: 'The choice is between having China inside the tent spitting out, or outside spitting in.' Talks on the resumption of China's Gatt membership, which it unilaterally suspended after the communist revolution in 1949, have been under way sporadically for almost eight years. But Beijing has recently raised the stakes to new levels by setting a deadline for their completion. Mr Long Yong-tu, China's chief negotiator, has told Gatt members that unless a 'substantive' agreement is reached by the end of the year, his government will offer no further concessions and will not seek to restart talks. Indeed, he is reported to have said that Beijing might even start closing its market to western exporters. The heightened sense of urgency has encouraged Mr Pierre-Louis Girard, chairman of the Gatt working party dealing with China's application, to order its members to pull out all the stops in an effort to have a formal accession protocol ready by the end of the year. However, by all accounts the talks are still proceeding at a snail's pace, and most negotiators see little chance of a last-minute breakthrough. 'I've seen miracles happen in Geneva before,' says one. 'But I don't expect one this time. There is just so much work left to do.' If that forecast proves correct, Beijing will confront a dilemma. Though it has not totally ruled out an extension of talks into next year, saying it would be ready to discuss 'technical' issues, it will be hard put to dress up results so far as the 'substantive' deal in which it has invested so much political prestige. What China would do then is anybody's guess. Some observers in Geneva fear it might succumb to pressure from hardliners to abandon the membership talks, on the grounds that foreign exporters and investors are so desperate to participate in the country's economy that it has nothing to lose. Mr Booth Gardner, the US ambassador to Gatt, is more sanguine. 'I don't think China's threat to pull out is a bluff,' he says. 'But as long as their negotiators can return to Beijing saying some progress is being made, they will stay in the game.' Mr Jeffrey Garten, US under-secretary of commerce for international trade, believes Beijing's economic self-interest will prevail over political pique. China's failure to enter the WTO, he argues, could damage international confidence in its economy and scare away much-needed foreign investment. 'I am optimistic that in the end our differences will be worked out,' he says. But even if breakdown is averted, stubborn obstacles remain. It is also not clear that the protagonists in the talks will enjoy any increased room for manoeuvre. China's negotiating position is widely thought to be constrained by a looming leadership struggle, which has caused even economic reformers to take a hard line. Some western observers say China's negotiators in Geneva recognise they must offer more concessions, but they have failed to win the authority to do so. Beijing, in turn, blames the slow progress on unreasonable demands by Washington. The US, which has taken the lead in the negotiations, has said it wants China to join the WTO, but has made clear its determination to strike a hard bargain. The Clinton administration is under strong domestic pressure to stick to its guns. After a humiliating retreat this year from its threat to deprive China's exports of Most Favoured Nation status over human rights, any further signs of weakness would provide powerful political ammunition to the new Republican-controlled Congress. US business leaders argue strongly that the WTO accession talks are the last chance to exact trade concessions from China, after the Chinese failure to fulfil promises made in a bilateral memorandum of understanding on trade agreed with the US more than two years ago. US resolve has been further strengthened by a 27 per cent rise in its trade deficit with China to Dollars 21bn in the year to November. Many other Gatt members - particularly developing countries - have in the past accused Washington of excessive obduracy. But recently, the tide of opinion has begun to turn, as a growing number of governments have started to find fault with Beijing. One reason is China's demand that it join the WTO on terms more generous than those enjoyed by developing countries in the Gatt. As well as angering many developing countries, there are fears that meeting this demand could set an undesirable precedent for the membership negotiations under way with Russia and other former communist states. Some industrialised countries would be ready to allow China to subscribe initially only to a set of core WTO obligations, and adopt the rest according to an agreed timetable, provided Beijing made reasonable bilateral offers on market access for their goods and services. However, western negotiators say Beijing's offers to date have been niggardly, lacking in clarity and hedged with restrictions. For instance, it is said still to be balking at basic commitments on regulations governing imports and foreign exchange, and wants to limit foreign banking rights to about 20 cities. So unyielding has Beijing's position been that some Gatt members are starting to wonder whether it really understands what is at stake in the negotiations. 'We are like ships that pass in the night,' says a western diplomat. A negotiator from a developing country puts the point more bluntly: 'China seems to think it is dealing with the United Nations, where everything consists of grand political posturing. It has yet to recognise that Gatt is all about negotiating on detailed, specific and concrete issues.' On this view, Beijing needs to undergo a fundamental change in psychology. But even if the talks continue beyond the end of this month, it has little time left to do so. Many Gatt members say that, in the absence of any breakthroughs, it would be impractical to drag them out beyond next summer. However, they also admit privately that whatever progress is achieved, the final decision on China's admission to the WTO will come down to a political judgment. It will turn on an assessment of whether Beijing will live up to its commitments - or whether it will wreak havoc by blithely disregarding the rules. That is a question to which nobody in Geneva pretends to know the answer. Even those who argue strongly that China's WTO admission is essential for global economic reasons admit that it is a high-risk strategy. 'The real nightmare,' says one, 'would be to have China inside the tent, spitting in.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Vyzhutovich: "President Has Left for </F> Sochi `To Think About the Reforms,' Whereas in Moscow They Have  Started Talking About Introducing a State of Economic Emergency"]    [Text] At Tuesday's session of the Federation Council,  Speaker Vladimir Shumeyko caused a sensation with the  announcement that the Russian parliament will shortly adopt a  law on a state of emergency in the economy. However, in a  "Vesti" television program interview the very same day the  Federation Council chairman stated that he was merely referring  to the need to take immediate and extremely prompt action within  the financial and economic spheres. This alone and nothing more.    For the second time in a row in recent days Vladimir  Shumeyko  has made some stunning statements. On a visit to Kaliningrad  last week the speaker of the upper chamber announced that the  government is preparing a decision on a 50-percent  across-the-board tax cut. "Nothing of the sort is planned,"  Deputy Finance Minister Sergey Aleksashenko stated in an  interview with IZVESTIYA, delicately suggesting that Shumeyko's  interpretation of the president's wish to alleviate the tax  burden as expressed in his message to parliament seemed somewhat  free.    And now society is yet again being invited to unravel the  remarks of a politician whose public status obliges him to use  precise and unambiguous phrases.    However, are we simply talking about linguistic sloppiness  here, the kind that gives rise to free interpretations? In an  interview with INTERFAX, Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin announced that  the day before Vladimir Shumeyko did in fact discuss with him  the possibility of adopting a law on a state of economic  emergency. Moreover, Rybkin claims that Viktor Chernomyrdin also  took part in the discussion of this matter, which took place  late in the evening of 14 March. "The three of us discussed  which was the best of three possible options for approving the  second-quarter budget. How should we approve it: By a special  law, by suspending various articles of the law in a state of  emergency regime, or by continuing to work normally, in which  case we would need at least two or three months to approve the  budget." Ivan Rybkin declined to say which of the three options  he had listed seemed to be the most expedient.    Meanwhile nobody has yet officially dismissed the specter of  economic state of emergency conjured up by the remarks -- be  they careless or cunning -- of two leading politicians. And we  can only guess what form it will take. Perhaps, following the  Belorussian [Belarusian] example, we will witness the  confiscation of enterprises' foreign currency funds, resolute  cessation of auctions at the Interbank Foreign Currency  Exchange, the imposition of a fixed ruble exchange rate, and the  nationalization of a significant proportion of assets belonging  to commercial structures? It cannot be permitted for a  government, even a government that is as closed to the press as  the present one, to keep society in a state of ignorance  regarding such intentions. If it harbors no such intentions,  then it ought to announce this fact officially and extremely  clearly.    But yet again we are in a complete fog. Ivan Rybkin has just  refuted press reports of his conversation with Shumeyko and  Chernomyrdin. "I have never had occasion to hold talks on this  topic with anyone," the speaker stated at a plenary session of  the Duma in reply to a deputy's question.    On the same day Aleksandr Livshits, leader of the group of  economic experts affiliated to the Russian president, circulated  a statement saying that "at the present time he sees no need for  the highest organs of the country's state power to adopt any  emergency measures regarding the economy."    ...As he left for a vacation in Sochi Boris Yeltsin  announced  that while he is on leave he intends to get down to formulating  a mechanism for implementing his message to parliament. Could  it be that the government, supported by the parliamentary  speakers and wishing to spare the president this concern of  state during his leave, has already set about formulating such a  mechanism by introducing a state of economic emergency? Or will  the explanation that once again we have misinterpreted somebody  be forthcoming tomorrow?</p>

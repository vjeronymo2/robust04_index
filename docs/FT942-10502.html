			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Schroder Ventures raises Dollars 100m for healthcare fund Schroder Ventures has raised Dollars 100m for a venture capital fund to specialise in life sciences including biotechnology and healthcare services companies. The International Life Science Fund is Schroder Ventures' first fund to invest in several countries and in a specific industry, said Dr Henry Simon, a partner and head of the investment team. The vehicle is a 10-year closed-end fund. About 60 per cent of investors are in the US, 27 per cent in the UK and the remainder in continental Europe and the Middle East. The Dollars 100m was raised over an 18-month period. This was longer than expected, conceded Dr Simon. He said that US investors had been cautious about an international fund, and Europeans were wary of venture capital vehicles. All had concerns about the impact of healthcare reforms on the profitability of the sector. Nevertheless, Schroder Ventures succeeded in raising almost twice as much as last month's Rothschild Asset Management's International Biotechnology Trust which secured less than Pounds 40m, compared with a target of Pounds 100m. The Schroder Ventures trust will invest in several sectors within healthcare in Europe and North America. Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology should take about 40 per cent of the total. The fund will seek companies researching into disease areas such as cancer and virus infections, and those involved in technologies such as gene therapy and transplants. Between 5 and 10 per cent will go into each of: Healthcare services, such as specialised clinics; diagnostics, such as home tests; medical devices including scanners and monitoring; and environmental products and services such as biochemical waste treatment The fund will invest a significant proportion of its capital as seed money and early stage investment. UK companies will be a high priority.</p>

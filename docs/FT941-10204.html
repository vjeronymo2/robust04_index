			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Receivers called in at FMT FMT Holdings, the former Vickers subsidiary which is viewed as one of the last global competitors in the British-owned machine tool industry, has called in the receivers. Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, was this week appointed receiver at the Brighton-based company, whose chairman, Mr Mike Bright, is one of the the best-known figures in the industry. News of the receivership was immediately described by observers as a 'disaster' for the industry. However, the company is continuing trading, and it is understood that the receivers will try to sell it as an ongoing business. FMT is one of the few British producers to compete head-on with the much larger Japanese and German machine tool builders in high-technology machining centres, linked together by computer control to create flexible manufacturing systems. The timing of the receivership was a shock to the industry - many UK producers have recently been expressing cautious optimism after three years of recession. FMT even held an open day last week to display new products, and according to one observer, appeared to be relatively busy. However, it is believed that the company has been short of new orders and has also been hit by price-cutting in the UK market by German and Japanese companies. It is understood that the receivers have already made about 30 redundancies from a workforce of 160. The receivership is a further twist in the chequered history of a company that, as Kearney, Trecker and Marwin, once employed 2,000 people with several factories in Sussex. In the 1970s, as KTM, it became a subsidiary of Vickers, but in 1988 Mr Bright and five senior managers bought it from the luxury cars and engineering group in a Pounds 10.6m buy-out.</p>

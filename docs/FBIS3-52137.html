AL-ITTIHAD has learned that the meeting will be held in Amman  next week. This will be the first sign of a relaxation since  the eruption of the crisis four months ago.    Responsible Jordanian sources informed AL-ITTIHAD yesterday  evening that Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, envoy of the Yemeni  president, who has arrived in Amman on a visit, informed  Jordanian officials led by the Jordanian monarch, King Husayn,  that Salih and al-Bid have agreed to meet in Amman. The  JORDANIAN NEWS AGENCY has reported that King Husayn expressed  satisfaction over progress in the efforts to end the crisis  after the meeting he had held with the Yemeni envoy. The agency  added that the king also expressed his wish to continue to aid  fraternal Yemenis to enable them to surmount this transient  crisis in order to safeguard the special accomplishments of  fraternal Yemen as well as its great pan-Arab role, given that  the success of Yemeni unity will nurture the nation's hopes of  achieving unity and democracy.    Sanaa Television has also noted al-Bid's agreement to meet  with Salih. The television noted that al-Bid informed a  delegation of clergymen who are mediating the crisis between him  and Salih that he is ready to meet with the Yemeni president  once efforts to implement the 18 points the Yemeni Socialist  Party has proposed are started.    For his part, Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim  Basindwah has expressed optimism over the prospects of ending  the political crisis in Yemen. He added that the political  dialogue currently under way in Yemen has expunged the  likelihood of resorting to violence, and confirmed that unity is  there to stay. [passage omitted]</p>

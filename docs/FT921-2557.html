			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / World Trade News: EC fears Gatt obstacle to farm reforms BRUSSELS yesterday expressed satisfaction that Chancellor Helmut Kohl will take up with President George Bush this weekend the farm dispute between the EC and the US, which has threatened to stall the trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). But it was also concerned lest a Gatt ruling on soya beans push EC reforms off track. Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC farm commissioner, said he was confident the German leader's discussions at the White House would 'cover all aspects' of EC concerns about proposed Gatt farm reforms, and not just the US restraint on cereal substitute exports that Mr Kohl was reported to be seeking. 'Once serious consideration at this level is given to recognising Community concerns, we can be hopeful,' he said. Recent EC-US contacts had produced some progress, but it was not yet sufficient. The commissioner said he could not comment on the still-confidential Gatt panel ruling this week, which is understood to have sided with the US in criticising the Community's system of direct subsidies to soya bean producers. But he said: 'I am satisfied that these per hectare payments will be allowed - otherwise it will not be possible to have reform accepted by the EC Council of Ministers.' After Gatt ruled in 1989 that the EC was discriminating against imports, the EC switched payments away from intermediary soya crushers to EC soya growers, calculated on a per hectare basis. This form of direct support was considered a precursor to Mr MacSharry's subsequent overall reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). This is why Brussels is concerned lest Gatt overturn its principle. Mr MacSharry yesterday confirmed he was proposing a roll-over of existing farm prices for 1992-93. Proposing cuts would only distract EC ministers from the far more important goals of CAP reform and a Gatt deal, which would themselves lower prices.</p>

			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (4): Third place in US new car production - Martin Dickson says the motor industry is benefiting from a trend among manufacturers to look south 'Ganbaro]' says a large sign at the trim shop in Nissan's Tennessee car assembly plant. The Japanese slogan means 'Make it happen' and could stand as a motto for the Tennessee state motor industry, which has grown from small beginnings to one of the most significant in the US over the past decade. Tennessee has been involved in the motor industry for many years, but its recent rise to prominence owes much to Nissan, which in October 1980 selected a site at Smyrna, Tennessee, south of Nashville, as the site of its first vehicle assembly plant in the US. Production began there in June 1983 and it now employs about 6,000. Then General Motors selected Spring Hill, a tiny rural community hidden away in the rolling hills south of Nashville, as the manufacturing site for its new Saturn car, a project designed to show that a US company, starting from scratch, could build a small vehicle equal to the Japanese competition. Saturn production began in 1990 and the company now employs more than 7,000. The presence of the two assembly plants has greatly increased the number of vehicle parts suppliers in the state. Among the largest are Ford Motor, which makes vehicle glass, Nippondenso Tennessee, which makes starters and alternators, TRW, manufacturing air bags, and Harman Automotive, making mirrors. Seattle-based Paccar's Peterbilt subsidiary has manufactured trucks in Nashville for the past 25 years and over that period it has doubled in size to employ about 1,000 people. Tyre manufacturers Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber and Japan's Bridgestone-Firestone both have large manufacturing plants in the state and Bridgestone-Firestone moved its US headquarters to Nashville from Akron, Ohio at the start of this decade. Bridgestone, which had long been headquartered in Nashville, had shifted its headquarters to Akron after merging with Firestone in the late 1980s. But when this merger ran into financial problems, Bridgestone's management decided to return to Nashville, both to make a fresh start and have a geographically central location. This influx means that Tennessee today ranks third in the US in new car production. It made some 514,000 vehicles, or 8.7 per cent of US production, in 1993. Admittedly, that is a long way behind Michigan, with 33 per cent of US production, and Ohio, with 16.2 per cent, but it makes Tennessee the leading southern car producer, followed by Georgia, with 6.4 per cent, and Kentucky, where Toyota has a large plant, with 4.5 per cent. In trucks, Kentucky is the leading southern manufacturer, ranking fourth with 10 per cent of output, while Tennessee is 13th with just 2.2 per cent. The state has been one of the prime beneficiaries of a trend among manufacturers in general, and the car industry in particular, to shift production from high wage, unionised states in America's northern 'rustbelt' to the south, where pay is lower, unions are less well entrenched, and employees retain a strong work ethic. Other factors helping it attract manufacturing industry include relatively low taxes, utility costs, and living expenses; an innovative school system; and a central location, with good transport links to the industrial mid-west and south-east. Tennessee lost out in recent tussles among south-eastern states to attract America's two newest car plants - one being built by BMW in South Carolina and the other by Mercedes-Benz near Tuscaloosa, Alabama. But both these states lured the German companies with huge subsidies which have raised eyebrows in state development agencies across the US. Still, the Tennessee vehicle parts industry should benefit greatly from the Mercedes plant, which lies just 150 miles to the south of the state and is due to produce 65,000 vehicles a year from 1997. Alabama has virtually no motor industry of its own, and in choosing the Tuscaloosa site Mercedes expected to draw on Tennessee's supplier base. But for all its strong growth, the Tennessee motor industry has not been immune from hiccups. Nissan, which led the Japanese import charge into the US market in the 1970s, saw its car market share stagnate in the 1980s. While other Japanese companies enjoyed large market share gains, Nissan produced dull, boxy cars at its Smyrna plant and sold them through a lacklustre US dealer network. Now, however, Nissan is doing much better. After a Dollars 490m capital spending programme, the Tennessee plant has been manufacturing an attractively priced, stylishly designed new family sedan, the Altima, which has enjoyed strong sales. The Smyrna plant has a capacity of about 450,000 units a year and a reputation for good labour relations. Apart from Altimas it makes the Sentra small car, pick-up trucks, and stampings for a mini-van which is manufactured in conjunction with Ford. Asked what advice he would give BMW and Mercedes as they prepare to manufacture in the US, Mr Jerry Benefield, president of the plant, says: 'Localise, localise - labour, parts supply, engineering.' For by local sourcing a company not only saves costs but also understands the political and cultural subtleties of the US. Saturn has also had problems. The plant got off to a dazzling start, creating an innovative, co-operative labour relations agreement with the United Auto Workers which has been widely hailed as a model for the industry. And the Saturn car rapidly became a strong seller, with a reputation for high quality. However, the project has cost GM Dollars 5bn, is barely turning a profit and is facing stiff competition from a new generation of rival small cars. Production at Spring Hill was trimmed back in March because of heavy stocks of unsold vehicles but late in April the company said it was returning output to full capacity.</p>

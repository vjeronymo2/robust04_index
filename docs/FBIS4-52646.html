			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, May 12 (AFP) -- King Norodom Sihanouk  said Thursday that the UN peacekeeping operation in Cambodia was  a waste of three billion dollars, as because there is no hope  for peace in his country.    "I have no illusions. I know there will be no compromise in  Jakarta, Paris, anywhere," the king told journalists at the  Royal Palace, explaining that he was leaving for China two weeks  earlier than planned, in part because he had no hope of solving  Cambodia's ongoing conflict.    "Even with 100 round tables (peace talks), there will be no  peace," the king said, apologizing to the United Nations for  sending 20,000 peacekeepers to enforce a peace plan and hold  elections last year.    "It was a waste," the king cried disparagingly. "We did not  deserve those three billion dollars, because our behavior is so  bad."    The ailing 71-year-old king, who spoke for more than one  hour  about politics, his eventual death and his despair over the  situation that remains in Cambodia, said he was continuing to  offer solutions for peace out of desperation.    The Khmer Rouge want ultimately to retake power in Cambodia  and return it to "the Stone Age" in line with their communist  ideology, he said.    "They have not changed their leadership, their policy, their  approach," he said. "Even when they say they accept a round  table, it is not sincere. They are not sincere. They are just  maneuvering to show plenty of good will," the king said.    "I must confess today ... that as king, I have to promise  peace," he said, adding that the prospect was "very bleak."    "Knowing we are going towards the death of Cambodia, I  should  not remain as king ... but if there remains civil war, people  would say it is because the king has left us," King Sihanouk  said.    "I am in a very bad situation, worse than Shakespeare's  hero,  Hamlet," he said.</p>

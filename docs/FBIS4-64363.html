			<p>BFN     [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will submit  his report to the UN Security Council on the confidence-building  measures [CBM's] in 10 days. This period will be used as a new  silent deadline for the Turkish side to accept the CBM's.    According to information from the Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation correspondent in New York, the reason for the new  deadline is the secretary general's heavy work schedule. In  reality, though, the new deadline is due to the weakness of the  Security Council permanent members to agree on a common line.  The silent deadline was decided by the ambassadors of the five  UN Security Council members in Nicosia. Joe Clark, the UN  secretary general's special representative in Cyprus, agrees  with this decision in principle but appears dissatisfied, mainly  about the tolerant stance that the United States is showing  toward Turkey. Clark links the renewal of his contract with the  outcome of the efforts at the end of the 10-day deadline.    A UN official said he hopes the CBM's will be accepted while  the report is being written, otherwise the UN secretary general  will proceed based on UN Resolution 889.    Clark met Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special  coordinator on the Cyprus issue, in San Francisco last night and  discussed ways to utilize the 10-day deadline as well as what  must be done if nothing happens by the end of the deadline.    A UN statement said that Clark and Butrus-Ghali discussed  the  preparation of the report and the future direction of UN  efforts. A UN source in New York said that despite the failure  of the latest efforts of the UN envoys, the United Nations will  not abandon its efforts to implement the CBM's. The same source  said it is almost impossible for the United Nations to wash its  hands of a problem to which it has devoted so much time and  energy.</p>

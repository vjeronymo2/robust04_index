			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THIRD WORLD POVERTY  </P> <P> I want to congratulate Bruce for his excellent column. I want to add that Third  World countries are not the only ones to blame for the present world-debt  crisis.  </P> <P> Banks can only make money by loaning money. After a long influx of  petro-dollars after OPEC's success in raising oil prices, banks had to lend  these newly deposited funds out to make money on them. Since "countries do not  cede to exist" (former Citibank bank official), countries were considered an  excellent credit risk. When banks loan out money for commercial purposes, this  money is generally used for production equipment that can generate income in  the future. Banks are very particular when loaning money to companies. They  weren't that particular with countries though. Funds were used for prestige  projects, military spending (that does not create future income), Mercedes cars  for families of influence and bribes, among other things.  </P> <P> Now the International Monetary Fund is forcing the poorest people in these  countries, the people who reaped little benefit from the loans to begin with,  to pay back the debt of their previous rulers. They are expected to reduce  imports of medical supplies to preserve foreign reserve in spite of their  already dismal health situation. They are expected to substitute their present  food crops like grain with export crops like soybeans to feed cattle in Europe  and America. And this when 40,000 children die each day of hunger and  hunger-related diseases.  </P> <P> Bruce gives some excellent suggestions on alternate courses of action. So does  the Global Poverty Reduction Act, presently pending before Congress.  </P> <P> REINHARD CLEVER  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

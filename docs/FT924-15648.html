			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Italy in talks on stand-by loan to boost the lira THE Italian government yesterday said it had begun discussions with its EC partners on a stand-by loan to boost the lira and sustain confidence in plans for an early return to the European Monetary System. The surprise move was announced along with Italy's 1993 budget which was approved yesterday by the cabinet and promises to reform the country's deteriorating public finances. The government also announced a plan to create a special fund, using privatisation receipts and dividends from state owned companies, to help pay off the state's debts. Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, said the aim of the EC loan was partly political. At one level, he said Italy wished to demonstrate its continued commitment to the EMS, but at the same time the loan appears designed to provide a rigid external framework for Italy's economic performance. It would make it more difficult for parliament to water down the budget. Officials declined to reveal the amount of the loan, but said the move was different from the UK's decision earlier this month to go to the markets for an Ecu loan to help protect sterling. It is expected to take up to four or five weeks to negotiate and would not be drawn down until after the 1993 budget was approved. There was speculation yesterday that the stand-by facility might not be fully used if granted, providing the currency markets stabilised and interest rates began to fall. Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said the facility would be a 'super-certification' by Italy's EC partners of the country's credibility. The lira was still under pressure yesterday, hovering around L880 to the D-Mark. Brussels officials predicted a sympathetic response to the loan request. Mr Amato is seen as the best hope for tackling the country's budgetary crisis and restoring international confidence in the economy, but he needs outside help, an EC official said. An EC loan would support his efforts to win parliamentary approval for his economic package, rather than a potentially contentious loan from the International Monetary Fund. 'We would be keeping the problem within the family,' the official said. Brussels expects Mr Amato to seek financial aid under Rule 1969 adopted in June 1988 allowing the EC to help countries which experience balance of payments problems or adverse capital movements. Some Ecu16bn (Dollars 22.4bn) has been set aside for support. Greece is the only EC member to have applied, securing a Ecu2.2bn stabilisation loan in February 1991. International bonds, Page 23</p>

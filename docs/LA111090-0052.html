			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HAT TRICKS BY WADE, DOUGHERTY PACE SOCKERS  </P> <P> Socker Coach Ron Newman has spent the first few weeks of the MSL season trying  to figure out where Wes Wade fits into the lineup.  </P> <P> After what happened at the Baltimore Arena Friday night, Newman might have a  solution.  </P> <P> Wade scored three goals, including the game-winner with three seconds left in  regulation, to give the Sockers an 8-7 victory over the Baltimore Blast in  front of a crowd of 7,423.  </P> <P> Paul Dougherty, who played last season with the Blast and was signed by the  Sockers as a free agent in the off-season, added a hat trick in a rematch of  last year's MSL championship series won by the Sockers, four games to two.  </P> <P> Newman said Wade's scoring output was a bonus -- since Wade was inserted into  the game as a defensive ploy.  </P> <P> "We put him up there to stop Baltimore from knocking balls into the corner,"  Newman said. "We put him there to put pressure on Baltimore. We played him up  there last year as a defensive runner, and he's matured a bit."  </P> <P> That's what happened on the game-winner. With Socker defender Kevin Crow  battling a pair of Blast players for a ball in the right corner, Wade sneaked  into the penalty area.  </P> <P> Crow bounced a pass out of the corner, and Wade beat goalkeeper Hank Henry from  10 feet out.  </P> <P> "It was just a scramble in the corner. I fought off a defender and got just  enough room. The ball hit at my foot. It was a little bit of luck, too," Wade  said.  </P> <P> Wade's goal spoiled Henry's Baltimore debut.  </P> <P> Henry, who had trained with the Sockers for two weeks before signing with the  Blast Thursday, made 15 saves. His Sockers counterpart, Victor Nogueira, made  18 stops to help the Sockers break a three-game losing streak.  </P> <P> Wade said Blast Coach Kenny Cooper's decision to start Henry against the  Sockers "put too much pressure on him (Henry). He did a great job, but we got  chances we shouldn't have gotten and we put them in." Newman said Baltimore  (2-4) expected too much of Henry, whose MSL resume expanded to five games after  Friday's action.  </P> <P> "It's a tough thing to ask of the boy," Newman said. "We tried to make it as  difficult as we could for him. But he didn't make a big mistake that hurt  Baltimore."  </P></p>

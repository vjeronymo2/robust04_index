			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DINERS ARE APPROVED  </P> <P> In an article by Dolores Long (Valley View, July 19) on the Single Diner Social  Club, she stated that during an interview with me regarding the club, I was  hesitant to give the group my approval.  </P> <P> Since Long did not ask me whether I approved of the club, I am not sure how she  concocted such a distortion.  </P> <P> Had she inquired, I would have been able to tell her that I very much approve  of the club, and have helped promote it with referrals. I have been friends  with its founder, Marilyn Wolff, since nearly the beginning of her  organization, and have been able to watch with admiration the steady growth of  the club resulting from the hard work, great patience, hospitable personality  and inventive ideas that Marilyn has demonstrated during the last three years.  </P> <P> Perhaps Long was disappointed when I did not respond positively to her  implication during part of her questioning that this could be a "lonely hearts"  club. That it is not. But it is an active organization for kinetic and spirited  people who enjoy dining and traveling. The people are not "cliquey," and the  conversation at the tables is always openly shared. It is simply a pleasant way  to enjoy new restaurants with new people.  </P> <P> I endorse and enjoy the Single Diners Social Club and encourage other singles  to give it a try. It is a great alternate and an enjoyable way to simply get  together with other singles for a nice couple of hours.  </P> <P> DAVE LYONS  </P> <P> Canoga Park  </P></p>

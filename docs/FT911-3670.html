			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / France ordered to justify state aid THE European Commission has told the French government to furnish detailed proof that it is not using the flagships of its public sector to funnel illegal state aid to smaller companies in industrially declining regions. This latest row over state aid between Brussels and Paris comes shortly after the Commission announced it would examine French plans to provide over Dollars 1bn in fresh capital to two big state-owned companies, Bull, the computer manufacturer, and Thomson, the defence and electronics group. Thomson is one of six state-owned companies named in the Commission's letter, along with Electricite de France, Elf Aquitaine, Pechiney, Rhone Poulenc, and Enterprise Miniere et Chimique. The Commission has given Paris two months to provide details of the funding which would enable it to compare it with the activities of three private groups, BSN, CGE and Saint-Gobain, which France maintains behave identically. 'As major local employers (they are) merely assuming responsibility for the survival of part of the economic fabric,' the French authorities wrote to the Commission last April. Brussels says the subsidised loans, provision of services, and, in some cases, acquisition of holdings by the six state companies may constitute a distortion of competition. It has reminded the French government that if this proves to be the case, it will have to recover the aid. Last year the Commission made Renault, the state-controlled car manufacturer, repay more than Dollars 1bn in assistance which Brussels judged illegal.</p>

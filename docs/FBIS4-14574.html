			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Zamyatina and Anna </F> Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow March 31 TASS -- Kazakhstan President  Nursultan Nazarbayev's initiative about the creation of an  Euroasian union, which he put forward during his visit to  Moscow, was met with "cautious interest" by Russian President  Boris Yeltsin, his press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov told a  briefing in the Kremlin today.    Kostikov called the initiative "unexpected," although he  admitted Nazarbayev could not have made his idea public at a  meeting with Moscow State University students without having  discussed it with the Russian president beforehand.    Kostikov expressed his opinion that "Nazarbayev's idea has a  geopolitical logic, but that logic is already contained in the  CIS formula, so it is hardly necessary to replace one good idea  with another, but there would be some sense in their mutual  evolution."    The presidential press secretary said that Yeltsin has taken  a time-out to examine the arguments pro and contra Nursultan  Nazarbayev's initiative.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Motoring: The fast way across France (for lorries too) THE GOOD news is that with the opening of the A26 autoroute extension between Chalons-sur-Marne and Troyes on June 30, one can now drive from Calais to the Mediterranean without seeing a single traffic light. The bad news is that if you tried to do so last week, you would have been stuck in the world's biggest jam, courtesy of anarchic French farmers and lorry drivers. My wife and I were lucky. Invited to attend the official opening, we drove off Sealink Stena's Invicta at Calais and pointed the Audi 100 tdi east. Two and a half hours and 172 miles (270 kms) later we had parked at Hotel Les Consuls in Reims. Over dinner at Le Vigneron (a mere two knives and forks in Michelin does it less than justice) Didier Kreig, of Champagne-Ardennes comite de tourisme, suggested that we await events in the morning. The opening ceremony was off. With sang froid a stiff upper-lipped Englishman would have been proud of, Didier proposed a drive to Epernay, a helicopter flight over the vineyards and, naturally, lunch. Later, when we reached the start of the new autoroute just north of Chalons, there was not a single farm tractor or lorry in sight - and virtually no other traffic, either. It was tempting to cruise the ultra long-legged Audi diesel at the 100 mph (161 kmh) and more it was clearly designed for. The new 47 mile (75 km) section links the A4 autoroute 16 miles (26 kms) south east of Reims with the A5 near Royes. From there it is 93 miles/150 kms to Dijon and another 118 miles/190 kms to Lyon by the A6 via Beaune. Unlike British motorways, which seem to be open for years before service areas are built, the SANEF company operating the A26 made sure that by June 30 a filling station, shop and restaurant, the Sommesous aire de service at half distance, with everything a traveller could need, from showers and a sauna to coin-operated fax machines, were all up and running. Drivers traveling from Calais to southern or eastern France or to Switzerland will not have to go near Paris and the dreaded peripherique again. Instead, they should try breaking their journey at the ancient city of Troyes. Parking may not be easy, but it is worth a visit.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Despite a projected P30.6 billion [Philippine pesos]  deficit for 1994, the national government improved on its fiscal  position in the first quarter of the year with a P13 billion  surplus in actual revenues and disbursement.    This was made possible by a P1.3 billion increase in revenue  collections and a savings of P11.7 billion from actual expenses  during the period.    Statistics from the Bureau of Treasury showed that as of 30  April 1994, actual collections reached P113.8 billion or P1.3  billion more than the P112.5 billion in programmed revenues for  the first quarter.    Collections by the Bureau of Customs were P1.8 billion  higher  than the P25.2 billion it expected to generate.    Other revenue agencies also increased their take by P1.8  billion to P13.5 billion from the programmed P11.7 billion.    But the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) failed to realize  its target revenues of P68.2 billion for the first quarter of  the year, generating only P66.5 billion, or a P1.7 billion  shortfall.    The Bureau of Treasury also fell last 16 May following the  approval of the expanded VAT [value-added tax].    The national government deficit according to the new budget  proposal will be P16.4 billion, compared to the P49.2 billion  estimate made last December.    Under the new program, the national government is even  expected to have a P15.5 billion surplus but would have to  resort to borrowings to absorb the P31.9 billion liabilities of  the old Central Bank.    The December estimates had the national government in the  red  by P22.7 billion to finance operations and would have to raise  P26.5 billion more for the rehabilitation of the Bangko Sentral  ng Pilipinas [Central Bank of the Philippines] (BSP).    The government deficit is expected to reach P30.6 billion by  year's end, with P4.7 billion from daily operations and P25.9  billion to save the BSP.    Three adjustments in the fiscal program were made in  reducing  the proposed budget.    -- Reduction of the debt amortization estimates to consider  the rollover of P36.3 billion in FRTNs [floating rate treasury  notes] and Treasury bills which were previously assumed to be  redeemed in 1995.    -- Scaling down of the budgetary support to government  corporations in consonance with the policy of reducing  assistance of GOCCs [government owned or controlled  corporations] by 10 percent in 1995.    -- Absorption into the Internal Revenue Allotment of the  provisions for the Magna Carta of Public Health Workers devolved  to local government units.    The biggest cut was for debt appropriation, followed by the  special purpose funds, subsidy to government corporations, funds  for flagship projects, department/agencies budget and support  for local government units.    In the December estimate, the government was to appropriate  P155.1 billion for debt servicing but this was reduced to P109.4  billion. This year's budget for servicing is P117.8 billion.    The compensation adjustment fund, initially earmarked at P25  billion so government could dramatically increase wages of civil  servants, was slashed by P3 billion in the new proposal.    Despite the cut, appropriations for salary increases were  still at least 300 percent higher than the P9.3 billion allotted  for 1994.    Enriquez said only five departments -- Science and  Technology, Tourism, Energy, Budget and Management, and HUDCC  (Housing and Urban Development Coordinating Council) --  submitted budget proposals within the ceilings approved by the  president and the Cabinet.    Of the total budget proposals, P30.6 billion were in excess  of the prescribed ceiling.    Preliminary results of the technical budget hearings showed  that the education department would still be given the biggest  slice of the budget with an appropriation of P41.7 billion, P5.1  billion less than the agency's proposal of P46.8 billion.    Public works and highways was allotted P23.7 billion (P5.8  billion less; national defense P23.1 billion (P2.4 billion  less); and, interior and local governments P14.7 billion (P1.8  billion less).    Enriquez told the president that proposals in excess of  ceilings which were already approved by the Cabinet had made the  preparation of the budget more difficult.    "Unless the departments voluntarily reduce their proposals,  DBM [Department of Budget and Management], in consultation with  the president, will have to assert its authority to maintain the  approved budget program," he said.    "Agencies who submitted proposals grossly in excess of the  ceilings cannot expect favorable action on their requests," he  added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prosperity Party [PP] leader Necmettin Erbakan has  said that the Poised Hammer mandate has been extended, despite  the fact that a majority of the people are against it.    Addressing the PP assembly group, Erbakan said the Poised  Hammer forces are extending aid to the PKK [Workers Party of  Kurdistan] terror organization and to Armenia. He noted that  these forces are stationed in Turkey not to defend northern  Iraqis but to watch over U.S. interests in the Middle East.    [Begin Erbakan recording] Some 70 to 80 percent of our  citizens want these forces to leave Turkey. The administration  is fulfilling the wishes of foreign forces, despite the will of  the people and despite claims that there is democracy in Turkey.  [end recording]    Commenting on the constitutional amendments, Erbakan said  his  party wants a laicism similar to that in Europe to be  implemented in Turkey. Noting that constitutional amendments  have been presented with the aim of covering up the  deterioration in the economy, Erbakan added that the people  want, above all, to be fed.</p>

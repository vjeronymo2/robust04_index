			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (3): Europe gets message - Andrew Adonis looks at the paging market In the US and Asia-Pacific countries public radio paging, although less high profile than mobile telephony, is nonetheless a respectable and self-confident sector. In Europe, by contrast, the pager has long been the mobile communicator that dare not speak its name, with paging operators seemingly acquiescent in a course which has condemned paging to obscurity. That appears set to change. Radical reform is sweeping through Europe's paging industry, stimulated by the success of Sweden's state telecoms operator in marketing pagers to high street consumers. Meanwhile, paging continues to race ahead in Asia, and looks set for a further spurt in the US on the back on two-way paging and other enhanced services. The next step in what could become a transformation of Europe's paging sector comes this month with the launch by Mercury Paging, the UK's third largest operator, of a service tailored for the consumer market. Instead of the existing paging package - unattractive to personal consumers  -of monthly rental charges for restricted coverage zones, Mercury paging customers will be able to buy their pager from high street consumer electronics retailers with automatic connection and no subscription charge. Dubbed 'Minicall', Mercury will gain its revenue from the new service by charging callers premium rates for leaving messages. Each Message will cost the caller about 20p, which Mercury believes is unlikely to deter would-be callers. 'Minicall' is a numeric paging service. Numeric pagers, which display the caller's number on a one-line display, are an advance on 'tone' pagers, which simply bleep and flash to alert the owner. They are one step down from alphanumeric pagers, which allow callers to leave a text message on a multi-line display. 'This is a real breakthrough in the UK paging business,' says Mr Chris Neary, managing director of Mercury Paging. 'We have carefully studied Sweden's experience with calling-party-pays paging, and think there is a real opening for a similar offering in the UK. It is far cheaper to use than a cellular phone.' None of the other three UK paging operators offers a pure calling-party-pays service. BT, the largest operator with more than 400,000 subscribers, offers no alternative to monthly subscription charges related to zones: its tariff sheet setting out the options resembles a railway timetable, although subscribers can now buy their pager. But all three - BT, Vodapage and Hutchison Paging - are examining calling-party-pays (CPP) options, and may come up with similar services. Mercury cites three factors which have combined to make CPP at premium rates, with no subscription charges, a commercial proposition: The elimination of handling costs. 'Minicall' is a joint promotion with Motorola, the US telecoms equipment manufacturer, which will supply pagers directly to retailers. A sharp fall in the cost of pagers. Numeric pagers now cost almost as little to make as simple tone pagers: the Motorola numeric pagers will retail at between Pounds 79 and Pounds 99. The elimination of bureau costs, the most expensive part of a paging operators' overheads. Callers with touch-tone phones leave numeric messages by tapping in their contact phone number as requested by a voice prompt. The small minority of callers without touch-tone facility can leave their number by voice after the prompt. Mercury is also revamping its business service: subscribers will get a numeric pager for the existing price of a tone pager, with a monthly subscription charge of only Pounds 5.49 for national coverage. Mercury is keen to upgrade both new services to alphanumeric: the problem is the bureau costs, which are unavoidable until voice recognition technology produces a reliable service for turning voice messages into text. It is still some way off. Motorola has a 20 per cent share in Mercury Paging, but insists that it had little bearing on Mercury's decision to launch 'Minicall'. Mr Greg Nelson, Motorola's European paging subscriber president, has spent the last year trumpeting the virtues of CPP to Europe's paging operators, and claims that at least 10 more European operators are planning to introduce a similar service in the next three to six months. 'This idea is catching on fast: our role has simply been to get the operators to consider it seriously,' he says. According to industry sources, paging operators in Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Denmark will be among the next to launch CPP services. Some will be collaborating with Motorola, some with two or three partners, but the product will be broadly similar. All the operators are going for the market niche opened up by the continuing high cost of cellular telephony in an increasingly mobile-minded society - particularly among the young. The CPP model is Sweden, whose state operator, Telia, launched a successful service last year despite Sweden's high level (10 per cent) of cellular phone penetration. 'The crucial thing was to study the telephone market, not existing mobile markets,' says Mr Jan Holmgren, an ex-Motorola executive who moved to Telia to build up its paging division. Telia research showed a potential paging market of 1.9m out of Sweden's 8.5m population. More than 100,000 pagers have been sold through retail outlets since the launch of the service. They retail for as little as SKr1,000 (Pounds 87), with no connection fee. Between 9am and 4pm the calling charge is SKr6 (about 50p) and at other times and all day at weekends, it is SKr1.5 - a huge price differential with mobile phones. The new regime has had almost as great an impact on the business market as on the consumer market. Telia's traditional subscriber network has grown from about 70,000 to well over 100,000 since the CPP launch. Western Europe currently has about 3.2m paging subscribers. If CPP takes off, current projections of growth to about 5m over the next decade (from CIT Research, a London-based consultancy) could prove pessimistic. However, Europe will still lag far behind the US, which today has about 21m paging subscribers, and the Asia-Pacific region with 19m. Singapore alone has more than 600,000 paging subscribers, Hong Kong 1m, Taiwan 1.4m and Japan 7.7m. CIT projects that paging numbers in Asia will more than double over the next decade. Two-way paging is set to be the next innovation in the US. The auction last month by the Federal Communications Commission of eight blocks of radio frequency for narrowband Personal Communications Services will allow two- way paging for the first time. Five companies are likely to compete in the two-way market, with services such as 'acknowledgement' paging, allowing the recipient of a message to choose one of a number of set return messages. Other enhanced services in the pipeline include a voice-based service allowing subscribers to play back voice messages stored on a device no larger than an existing pager - 'an answering machine in your pocket.'</p>

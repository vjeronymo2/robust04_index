			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Soros Pounds 284m investment excites property market PROPERTY shares rose sharply yesterday after Mr George Soros announced plans to invest Pounds 284m in the stricken UK property market. Mr Soros, the international fund manager reputed to have made Pounds 1bn betting on a devaluation of sterling in the run up to Black Wednesday and who in April invested Dollars 400m (Pounds 260m) in a gold mining company, is forming a Pounds 500m partnership with British Land, the fourth biggest UK property company. Mr John Ritblat, British Land chairman, said yesterday's deal underlined his commitment to the sector's recovery. He said 'signs of recovery . . . are now more widely discernible'. The deal with Quantum Group, a Dollars 9bn investment management company advised by Mr Soros, would give 'additional firepower'. Mr Ritblat claimed a year ago to have seen a turnaround in the UK property market, where values have slumped during the recession. He said he had approached Mr Soros 'a couple of months ago' with the plan. Mr Soros reacted quickly, he said. Mr Soros tied up a deal in February with the Reichmann brothers, the Canadian property developers, to invest in North American property, and in January he took a 3 per cent stake in Berkeley, the UK housebuilder. British Land and Quantum are each putting up Pounds 250m, which will be used to buy a portfolio of properties by the end of 1997. The partnership is expected to be wound up by 2003. British Land will receive a fee rising to Pounds 5m a year for managing the portfolio, although both parties will agree investment decisions. Quantum is subscribing to 11.3m new shares in British Land, costing Pounds 33.7m, which would give it a 4.8 per cent stake in the company. Quantum will sell some of these shares to Mr Ritblat and place 4m shares into a British Land employee trust. Yesterday's agreement by two such influential investors was seen in the stockmarket as underlining recovery hopes in the commercial property market. Falling interest rates and expectations of economic recovery have already pushed property shares higher. The sector has almost doubled in value since last September. The property sector yesterday showed a further 6 per cent rise, with British Land shares rising 46p to 344p. The market was also excited by the thought that some of the funds could be used to finance a takeover in the sector. However, questions were being raised last night over an agreement under which Mr Ritblat will buy British Land shares from Quantum at 298p, Tuesday's closing price, and over possible conflicts of interest. Some investors were concerned about the profit Mr Ritblat would appear to make on the shares, but British Land defended the deal saying Mr Soros wanted Mr Ritblat 'to put his money where his mouth is'. Mr Ritblat is required to hold 4m British Land shares for a year and 2m shares until the end of 1997. British Land also announced a Pounds 132m rights issue yesterday to help finance its share in the partnership with Quantum. The issue is underwritten by SG Warburg. The company also reported profits for the year to March 31 up 3.9 per cent to Pounds 34.6m. Expensive vote of confidence, Page 21 Lex, Page 22 British Land results, Page 24 London stocks, Page 46</p>

			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / International Company News: Two businessmen in rival bids for Portuguese bank Two Portuguese entrepreneurs are lining up rival bids of more than Es100bn (Dollars 574m) to wrest control of Banco Totta e Acores (BTA), a leading Portuguese retail bank, from Banesto, the crisis-hit Spanish bank. The bids emerged following indications that Portuguese authorities may require Banesto to dispose of half its 50 per cent holding in BTA, which contravenes legislation limiting foreign ownership of the bank to 25 per cent. Potential investors believe Banesto may sell part or all of its stake in BTA to help bolster its depleted debt to assets ratios. Mr Eduardo Catroga, Portugal's finance minister, said he welcomed the proposals to re-establish Portuguese control of BTA. He has asked the public prosecutor's office to determine whether there are grounds for legal action to force Banesto to dispose of 25 per cent of BTA. The Spanish bank is believed to have acquired its shareholding in BTA by funding Portuguese companies to buy equity on its behalf. Mr Antonio Champalimaud, a Portuguese entrepreneur, has told the Lisbon government that he has raised Es50bn as the basis for a bid to acquire 51 per cent of BTA. The bank's current capitalisation on the Lisbon stock market is about Es200bn. However, Mr Champalimaud believes it will not be difficult to find partners to mobilise Es100bn or so for the takeover bid. Mr Jose Jose Manuel de Mello, head of a large industrial and financial group, has informed the Portuguese government of plans to make a similar bid for control of BTA. The two entrepreneurs count on acquiring both part of Banesto's holding in BTA and the 13 per cent of its capital that is held by the state following the bank's partial privatisation in 1989. The government said the state would only dispose of its remaining holding when a stable shareholder framework that complied with Portuguese law was established for BTA. Banco Comercial Portuguese, a privately-owned retail bank, is believed to be another potential bidder for a controlling stake in BTA. It has yet to register an official proposal with the Portuguese authorities.</p>

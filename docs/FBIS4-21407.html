			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Paul Ejime] </F>   [Text] Lagos, 22 Mar (PANA) -- The eighth Lake Chad Basin  Commission summit, opening Tuesday [22 March] in the Nigerian  capital, would, in principle, have concentrated on the worrying  shrinkage of water on what used to be the Lake Chad surface  area. The reduced water surface, mineral resources, and  environmental concerns are issues which affect all the  organisation's four-member states -- Cameroon, Chad, Niger and  Nigeria.    It is likely, however, that these pressing problems might be  overshadowed by the current border dispute involving Nigeria and  Cameroon over the ownership of the 1000 square kilometre Bakassi  Peninsula. The summit in Abuja, will take place against the  background of intense diplomatic. [sentence as received]    Diplomatic sources in the federal capital and Lagos said  that  apart from the commission's agenda, the summit could be a  prelude to the elusive summit between Abacha and Biya over  oil-rich Bakassi in the Gulf of Guinea. According to the summit  programme released by the Presidency in Abuja, Nigerian head of  state, Gen. Sani Abacha was to receive Cameroonian President  Paul Biya at the airport and later host the delegates, including  those from Chad and Niger Republic to a state dinner.    Cameroon has said the bilateral summit was subject to the  withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the disputed territory, while  Nigeria insists that it would not pull out its soldiers.    Egypt, the current chairman of the Organisation of African  Unity (OAU) had been previously mentioned as another possible  venue for the summit. But according to political analysts, the  venue of the eighth summit of the Lake Chad Basin Commission was  agreed at the last summit in Abuja in 1993.    The commission was set up in 1964 as a forum for mutual  exploration of the mineral resources in the Lake Chad region.  It also serves as a platform for the resolution of border  disputes among member states. One of such disputes involved  Nigeria and Chad in 1983, which led to the establishment of a  joint patrol team by both countries as an "interim measure for  eventual proper demarcation of the common borders." The issue  was eventually resolved at the 36th ministerial session of the  commission in Maroua, Camaeroon in 1989.    But of late, the lake region has come under what  environmentalists called "indiscrimate human activities,  especially the construction of dams," which threatens the area  with "extinction." The lake water is shrinking, and so are the  mineral resources.    An environmentalist, Enoch Okpara, told a recent seminar in  Lagos that "serious ecological deterioration has taken place and  this has affected the flora and fauna of the lake region. The  fish harvest and hence the nutritional health of the people of  the countries who share the waters of the Chad (lake) are  adversely affected," he said. In a paper titled "Environment  Watch: How Do Nigerians Know," Okpara said the problem had  accentuated migration with "unpleasant consequences on existing  inadequate infrastructure in various urban centres acting as  destinations for such migrants."    Quoting a recent environmental survey, he said that Nigeria  alone "lost about 351,000 square km of its mass land to  desertification, advancing southwards at an estimated rate of at  least 0.6 km per annum." On the global level, Okpara said that  the United Nations International Fund for Agricultural  Development (IFAD), has warned that the world might "lose all  its productive land mass if the current annual loss of 27  million hectares of its productive land to desertification"  remained unchecked.    The UN body estimates that some 900 million people are  afflicted by desertification worldwide, adding that the enormity  of the problem required urgent international and local remedial  measures.</p>

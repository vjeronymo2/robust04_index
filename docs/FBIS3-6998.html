The Thai Commercial Counsellor in Washington, Nupthong  Thongyai, said the US International Intellectual Property  Alliance (IIPA) recently submitted a request to the USTR that  Thailand be kept on the list until the Copyright Law is amended.    The IIPA also suggested placing China on the list of  Priority  Foreign Countries (PFC) which may face trade retaliation from  the US because they do not have sufficient protection for US  copyright works. It said copyright violations in China were  hurting US manufacturers. China is on the PWL after being  removed from the PFC list in 1991.    The US will announce this April whether it will remove  Thailand from the PWL, but such a move is not expected until the  draft amendment of the Copyright Law passes its third reading in  Parliament.    A source in the Thai music industry said China was copying  foreign compact discs. Some of the copies were being shipped to  Thailand for sale locally and resale aboard.    Mr. Nupthong said the US still wanted Thailand to lower its  tariffs on exposed film from the current rate of 10 baht per  metre to five baht, but the case was not serious as the  countries had agreed they should negotiate on this issue under  General Agreement on Tariff and Trade talks.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (xii) Subsection (m) requires an agency to cause the requirements of the Act to be applied to a contractor operating a system of records to accomplish an agency function. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Inspection Requirements_Investigative File System, USPS 080.010 and Inspection Requirements_Mail Cover Program, USPS 080.020. These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3) and (4), (d)(1)&hyph;(4), (e)(1)&hyph;3, (e)(4)(G) and (H), (e)(5) and (8), (f), (g), and (m). The reasons for exemption follow: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Disclosure to the record subject pursuant to (c)(3), (c)(4), or (d)(1)&hyph;(d)(4) could (A) alert subjects that they are targets of an investigation or mail cover; (B) alert subjects of the nature and scope of the investigation, and of evidence obtained; (C) enable the subject of an investigation to avoid detection or apprehension; (D) subject confidential sources, witnesses, and law enforcement personnel to harassment or intimidation if their identities were released to the target of an investigation; (E) constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation; (F) intimidate potential witnesses and cause them to be reluctant to offer information; (G) lead to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction or alteration of evidence yet to be discovered, the fabrication of testimony, or the compromising of classified material; and (H) seriously impede or compromise law enforcement, mail cover, or background investigations which may involve law enforcement aspects as a result of the above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Application of subsections (e)(1) and (e)(5) is impractical because the relevance, necessity, or correctness of specific information may be established only after considerable analysis and as the investigation progresses. As to relevance (subsection (e)(1)), effective law enforcement requires the keeping of information not relevant to a specific Postal Service investigation. Such information may be kept to provide leads for appropriate law enforcement and to establish patterns of activity which may relate to the jurisdiction of the Postal Inspection Service and/or other agencies. As to accuracy (subsection (e)(5)), the correctness of records sometimes can be established only in a court of law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would require collection of information directly from the subject of a potential or ongoing investigation. The subject would be put on alert that he or she is a target of an investigation or mail cover, enabling avoidance of detection or apprehension, thereby seriously compromising law enforcement, mail cover, or background investigations involving law enforcement aspects. Moreover, in certain circumstances the subject of an investigation cannot be required to provide information to investigators, and information must be collected from other sources. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The requirements of subsection (e)(4) (G) and (H) and (f) do not apply because this system is exempt from the individual access and amendment provisions of subsection d. Nevertheless, the Postal Service has published notice of its notification, access, and contest procedures since access may be appropriate in some cases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Application of subsection (e)(8) could prematurely reveal an ongoing criminal investigation to the subject of the investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) The provisions of subsection (g) do not apply because exemption from the provisions of subsection (d) renders the provisions on suits to enforce (d) inapplicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Personnel Records_Preemployment Investigation Records, USPS 120.110 and Personnel Records_Postmaster Selection Program Records, USPS 120.130. These systems of records are exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a, (d)(1)&hyph;(4) and (e)(1) to the extent that information in the system is subject to exemption under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) as relating to the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government in confidence as a part of an investigation conducted solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications of an individual for employment. The reasons for exemption follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) In the course of its investigation and evaluation of an applicant for a position, the Postal Service contacts individuals who, without an assurance of anonymity, would refuse to provide information concerning the subject of the investigation. If a record subject were given access pursuant to (d)(1)&hyph;(d)(4), the promised confidentiality would be breached and the confidential source would be identified. The result would be restriction of the free flow of information vital to a determination of an individual's qualifications and suitability for appointment to or continued occupancy of his position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) In collecting information for investigative and evaluative purposes, it is impossible to determine in advance what information may be of assistance in determining the qualifications and suitability of an individual for appointment. Information that seems irrelevant, when linked with other information, can sometimes provide a composite picture of an individual which assists in determining whether that individual should be appointed to or retained in a position. For this reason, exemption from subsection (e)(1) is claimed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

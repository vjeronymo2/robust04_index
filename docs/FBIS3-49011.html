			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent's report: "The Army Will Not Have Money for </F> Development in 1994"]    [Text] Compared to previous years, it will only be  possible to maintain the Hungarian Army's ability to function  through much greater sacrifices, Defense Ministry Spokesman  Colonel Lajos Erdelyi told NEPSZABADSAG.    The Army's planned 66.5 billion-forint 1994 budget is only  enough to maintain the current level but not to carry out  serious development. Some 90 percent of this amount will be  spent on daily operational expenses, Colonel Gyorgy Paszto,  leader of the Defense Ministry's Defense Management Main  Department, said after President Arpad Goncz signed the Defense  Law on 23 December and, at the same time, the government had  accepted the regulation on its implementation.    In connection with this, Lajos Erdely pointed out that in  the  1994 budget it is envisaged that the Army would acquire 8  billion forints in income from the sale of stocks, army  barracks, and similar buildings. It will be very difficult to  achieve this, Erdelyi said. Although in 1994, in real terms, the  Army will dipose of a sum which is more than 2-billion forints  more than in 1993, financial problems are anticipated because of  inflation and the tasks that will be new in 1994. Erdelyi found  it especially worrying that the amount that can be spent on  material and technical development has decreased to a minimum  level. For 10 years, the Army has been unable to ensure the  supposedly ideal 60 percent to 40 percent maintenance and  development ratio. In 1994, less than 5 percent of the 66.5  billion forints will be left for development; the change of the  Army uniforms is also included in this. The financial problems  are made worse by the running costs of the 28 Russian MiG-29  aircraft that were included in the system at the end of the  year, the planned launching of air force officer training in  Szolnok, and the previous commitment to set up a Hungarian UN  training base, Erdelyi said.    In 1994, U.S. military industrial enterprises will deliver  113 complete electronic Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) systems to  the Hungarian air-force. As is known, Parliament earmarked 1.1  billion forints from the budget for this purpose in 1993.  According to the plans, the specialists of the U.S. air-force  will fit the equipment on 28 MiG-29, nine MiG-23, 65 MiG-21, and  11 Su-22 aircraft. The prototypes on the various types of  aircraft have already been set up and tried out. In addition to  this, the suppliers will also fit four Russian-type land-based  location systems with "questioning equipment." Putting these in  position will probably begin mid-1994.    According to the NAPI VILAGGAZDASAG, a deal that is part of  a  U.S. Government program will amount to some $12.7 billion.</p>

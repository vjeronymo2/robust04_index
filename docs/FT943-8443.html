			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / New style can't hide scope for surprise Hanson's proposed flotation of a majority stake in Ertl, the US toy manufacturer, together with its pending acquisition of Scholes, the UK-based electrical equipment manufacturer, highlights the Anglo-US conglomerate's twin-track acquisition and disposals strategy. During the 1980s the group, led by founders, Lord Hanson and Lord White, aggressively stalked and picked off corporate giants such as SCM Chemicals, Imperial Tobacco and Consolidated Gold Fields. Since then the business, market and political climate on both sides of the Atlantic have changed and most analysts believe Hanson's appetite - and capacity - for multi-billion dollar deals has waned. At first sight the group's Dollars 3.4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) acquisition of Quantum Chemical, the US polyethylene and propane group, at the end of September last year appeared to signal a return to the old swash-buckling style. But in reality the deal represents a carefully calculated gamble on the petrochemicals cycle. The clear message from Mr Derek Bonham, Hanson's chief executive who was given the additional title of deputy chairman last autumn, has been determination to reduce debt through disposals and flotations and concentrate on expanding its main businesses, both organically and through 'bolt-on' acquisitions. These core businesses include aggregates, chemicals, natural resources and tobacco. In the wake of the Quantum acquisition, Hanson's net borrowings mushroomed to Pounds 3.4bn from Pounds 774m a year earlier and represented gearing of 86 per cent at the end of September. Hanson then cut its interest costs by refinancing the Dollars 2.35bn of junk bond debt assumed with the Quantum purchase at preferential rates. It has raised about Pounds 815m, including Pounds 490m in the UK, through a succession of disposals including the flotation of its Beazer housebuilding operations on both sides of the Atlantic earlier this year. Hanson has also sold 11 UK companies to management buy-out teams backed by Electra, the venture capital group, at the end of December for Pounds 90m. In America Hanson has sold the Axelson oil industry equipment group for Pounds 56m and Hanson Office Products contract stationery business for Pounds 110m. The group recorded a profit of Pounds 333m from disposals in its first half and gearing fell to 69 per cent by the end of March. Excluding the proposed Pounds 96.1m purchase of Scholes, which has yet to be completed - the company has agreed to the Hanson bid, but said it was open to higher offers - analysts estimate that net borrowings are around Pounds 2.55bn, putting gearing at around 54 per cent. The planned flotation of Ertl, whose products include die-cast models of Thomas the Tank Engine, plastic model kits and the best-selling Bumble Ball, is expected to generate Dollars 200m in cash for Hanson this autumn. Hanson plans to retain a 37 per cent stake in the Iowa-based toy maker. But despite Hanson's balance sheet improvements, Ertl's stock market debut this autumn is unlikely to signal the end of the disposal programme. Analysts expect Hanson to focus on its smaller US consumer and industrial subsidiaries as the group has already sold most small non-core operations in the UK. Among the US recreation and leisure operations which could be sold are Tommy Armour golf equipment, the Valley pool table business and Farberware kitchen products. Elsewhere Hanson is expected to continue making smaller bolt-on purchases such as the proposed Scholes deal. If completed, Scholes would be used to strengthen the position of Hanson's Crabtree subsidiary in the increasingly competitive UK electrical installation equipment market. Hanson's transformation from an acquisitions-driven, deal-making machine of the 1980s into a more conventional international conglomerate is being orchestrated by Mr Bonham, heir apparent to Lord Hanson, and his US counterpart, Mr David Clarke, chief executive of the US operations. Analysts caution that while most of the future acquisitions are likely to be of the 'fill-in' type, it is too soon to dismiss the possibility of Hanson making further big opportunistic acquisitions - particularly as gearing is brought down to more comfortable levels. Underlining this, Mr Clarke has been quoted as saying that the US disposal programme enables management to focus on 'the next big deal'.  ---------------------------------------------------------        Acquisitions              Disposals  --------------------------------------------------------- 1989   Consolidated Gold         52% stake in        Fields Pounds 3.5bn       Smith Corona Pounds 250m  ---------------------------------------------------------                                  ARC US assets                                  Pounds 415m  --------------------------------------------------------- 1990   Peabody Holdings          49% stake in Newmont        Pounds 715m               Mining Pounds 840m  ---------------------------------------------------------        Cavenham Forest           Tucker Housewares        Industries Pounds 840m    Pounds 119m  --------------------------------------------------------- 1991   Beazer Pounds351m         11.2% stake in Shanks        2.8% stake in ICI         &amp; McEwan Pounds 49m        Pounds 240m  --------------------------------------------------------- 1992   (failed Pounds 740m bid   2.8% stake in Shanks        for Ranks Hovis           ICI Pounds 280m        McDougall)  ---------------------------------------------------------                                  Ever Ready                                  Pounds 146m  --------------------------------------------------------- 1993   Costain's Australian      Hanson Office        mining interests          Products Pounds 110m        Pounds 157m        (final legal victory)  ---------------------------------------------------------        Quantum Chemical          Axelson        Corporation               Pounds 56m        Pounds 2.2bn  ---------------------------------------------------------        Watt Housing Corp        Pounds 75.5m  ---------------------------------------------------------        ARC buys Econowaste        assets Pounds 44.2m  --------------------------------------------------------- 1994   Scholes Pounds 96m        Beazer flotation        bid                       Pounds 463m Proposed                                  Ertl flotation                                  Pounds 130m  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

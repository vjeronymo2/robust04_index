			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Gorbachev faces test at party plenum SOVIET President Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday met Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian leader, for the first time since Mr Yeltsin announced his intention to run for the presidency of Russia. The meeting, at the end of two weeks in which both have been urged to discuss forming a coalition government, came on the eve of what promises to be the most severe test Mr Gorbachev has faced from within his Communist party. A plenum of the ruling central committee gathers in Moscow this afternoon angry and despondent at Mr Gorbachev's handling of the economy. This mood may prompt calls for his resignation from his party post as general secretary. Yesterday's meeting, on the outskirts of Moscow, was held under the framework of the Federation Council and brought together leaders of the nine Soviet republics prepared to discuss a union treaty. Mr Yeltsin has in the past routinely delegated attendance at meetings of the Federation Council to his senior deputy, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov. His attendance, and the location of the meeting on neutral territory away from the Kremlin, suggests an effort will be made to rebuild a bridge between the two most powerful figures in a rapidly declining country. An aide to the president said the subject of round-table talks as a prelude to a coalition government would be mooted between the two leaders. Deputies in the Supreme Soviet endorsed the anti-crisis programme introduced in the on Monday by Mr Valentin Pavlov, the prime minister. Their vote, by an overwhelming 323 to 13, followed a speech by Mr Pavlov in which he called for a 'state of emergency' covering banks, tax collection, transport and power supply. He also revealed that a presidential decree had been prepared to index incomes to a basket of commodities. However, most economists - including those working on the programme - believe it will fail unless agreement is reached between the main political forces, and crucially the leaderships of the republics, on its shape and implementation. Workers in Minsk, the capital of Belorussia, left work again yesterday and demonstrated in the city centre after the breakdown of talks with the republican authorities which had temporarily ended a previous round of strikes in the capital and elsewhere. Elsewhere, the strike wave in the pits and other plants appeared to be contracting.</p>

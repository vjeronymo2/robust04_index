			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Hunt offers 'partnership' to unions Britain's trade unions were offered a new partnership with the government yesterday by Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, but he told them they would have 'no direct role in the determination of policy'. Responding to last week's relaunch of the Trades Union Congress he told a meeting of the Industrial Society that his door was 'always open for dialogue' with the trade unions. 'But unions must recognise their own limitations,' he said. 'There will be no preferential status for unions on the inside of government.' The employment secretary highlighted the development of the government's proposed new apprenticeship scheme to train about 40,000 young people a year in technical, craft and supervisory skills as an issue on which trade unions and government could have a dialogue. Mr Hunt said it was 'heartening that unions may be shaping up and modernising'. He urged them to support employers in achieving greater competitiveness and concentrate on providing more individual services to their members. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, welcomed employ Mr Hunt's remarks. He said: 'It was good to hear that he and the government recognise the potential for a positive trade union role. I do see plenty of scope for discussion.' Mr Monks added, however, that he was disappointed that Mr Hunt had not acknowledged the big contribution trade unions had made to the success of 47 out of the top 50 profitable companies in Britain.</p>

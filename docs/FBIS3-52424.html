			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Palestinians and the War of Nerves"] </F>   [Text] Apparently, these days Palestinians are being  subjected to a multifaceted war of nerves aimed at pressuring  them to adopt specific positions whether on the Arab level or in  the talks with Israel. Obviously, the Palestinian stance  regarding the issues under discussion does not please the other  parties. Therefore, sometimes the Palestinian side is given a  breather, and at other times it is spurned until its positions  have cooked on a low fire until the pressure affects it.    Although comparison between the Palestinian-Arab dealings on  one hand and the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations on the other  is not pertinent, especially after taking into account the  common Arab destiny and the single pan-Arab affiliation, those  pressures have, however, drawn the attention of observers and  made them inquire about the secret of their sequence within a  span of a few days. Observers are also intrigued by the  Palestinian reaction, which presumably will be forthcoming, and  by the possible repercussions of such a reaction.    Palestinians have the right to adopt positions compatible  with their supreme national interests just as any other people  inside and outside the Arab world, particularly as those  interests do not at all contradict the interests of the Arab  brothers. Hence, apart from being natural and healthy,  disagreements between Palestinians and their brothers are at the  same time premature since the occupied territories are still  subject to the authority of the Israeli occupation. Any talk  about agreements, regardless of their shape or extent, is like  placing the cart before the horse.    The Palestinian stance seeks an honest implementation of the  Declaration of Principles, as affirmed by Egyptian Foreign  Minister 'Amr Musa, who prior to leaving Amman stressed the need  for implementing the provisions relating to Israeli withdrawal  and establishment of a Palestinian national authority.    In the face of rapid developments, the Arab brothers are  supposed to rise to the level of the historic and grave  responsibilities and challenges and enhance coordination to  confront the dangers threatening the unity of their positions  and the comprehensiveness of their cause.</p>

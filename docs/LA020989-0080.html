			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROGRAM FOR PAROLEES  </P> <P> Last year it was LAMP (Los Angeles Men's Place) in the Echo Park area, and now  another program ("Parolees Forced Out of Mt. Washington," Glendale Section  1/26/88) is in serious (closure is serious) trouble because of the arrogance  and ignorance of the administrators of the program. LAMP failed too, but strong  community support might have circumvented the tangential issue that appeared.  </P> <P> This time it's essentially a public agency program, not a private one. While  some parolees may have done well in the long run, the secrecy and multiple  violations of law, regulations and ethics would have caused major problems in a  program for ex-convicts. Money is wasted, and both parolees and public are  ill-served. Such events are not rare, and it should surprise no one that  "rehabilitation" is viewed so negatively. (Recall the events of the recent  presidential election.)  </P> <P> A major battle was fought to get the law exempting facilities of six and under  from local zoning control. Such dishonesty helps no one, and I really have to  wonder about the meaning of Bible study in the program. Jackie Brown is not  entitled to be "disconsolate," not even close to it. She is still arrogant and  self-centered, given what the Department of Corrections, Transwestern Institute  and Jackie Brown did. They hurt many others and damaged the future.  </P> <P> PAUL LOGAN  </P> <P> Glassell Park  </P></p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Serb leader pledges to let convoys pass MR Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, yesterday gave an undertaking to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that blocked relief convoys would be allowed to pass through Serb lines to besieged Moslem towns in eastern Bosnia. The UN High Commissioner, Mrs Sadako Ogata, yesterday received an assurance to this effect from Mr Karadzic, whom she had telephoned from Geneva. The Bosnian Serb leader, it was reported, was speaking in the presence of President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia. UNHCR spokeswoman Lyndall Sachs said that Mr Karadzic had also promised that aid workers would be allowed to enter the besieged town of Srebrenica and that the sick and wounded could be evacuated. Combatants would also be allowed to leave, on condition that they surrendered their arms. However, the UNHCR had earlier said that it would not allow any convoys to proceed to Srebrenica, after the Serbs had refused to allow them to have a military escort or radio communications. According to UNHCR officials, some 60,000 people were cut off in Srebrenica, which UN relief convoys have failed to reach in 11 months of fighting and where dozens of people a day are dying of hunger, starvation, disease and war wounds. In addition, thousands of refugees from neighbouring Moslem townships captured by Serb militias have swollen the population of Srebrenica and many are sleeping in the open air and suffering from exposure. Mr Karadzic was due to fly to New York yesterday for peace talks with leaders of the other warring parties, under the chairmanship of Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord David Owen. President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia, the Moslem leader, was also reported to have left for New York from Sarajevo to attend the peace negotiations. Ms Sachs said that General Philippe Morillon, the UN military commander in Bosnia, who has set up temporary headquarters in Srebrenica in an attempt to make the Serbs let in aid, was due to have more talks later with Bosnian Serb army commanders. France, which has expressed full support for General Morillon, said yesterday that getting international aid into Srebrenica was a test of Serb will to contribute to the peace process in Bosnia. A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said that continued obstacles to the delivery of humanitarian aid to Srebrenica would be a serious blow to the UN Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Opposition Should Stop Creating Troubles on the </F> Nuclear Issue"]    [Text] The government's refusal to discuss the nuclear  issue in the National Assembly can be understood by the wise and  patriotic circles in the nation. There seems to be reason to  make this sensitive issue a subject of discussion after the  statement issued by our foreign minister on the nuclear program.  Even most of the opposition parties have expressed satisfaction  over the government's stand that whatever happens the nuclear  program will not be rolled back keeping in mind the greater  interest of the nation. However, Mian Nawaz Sharif and his  followers, just out of their old habit, have made the nuclear  program a subject of controversy. According to one sources, the  prime minister has directed the president's attention to this  issue and told them that all of us have taken the oath to  protect national secrets; therefore, we cannot allow open debate  over the nuclear program. She added that the noise raised by the  opposition is meaningless. The prime minister asked the  president since he is the custodian of all national assets  including the nuclear program. As the leader of the nation, he  should officially remind the opposition leader of the oath which  he has also taken.    In our opinion, the opposition leader is not a naughty child  who should be admonished from unnecessary stubbornness. He knows  well that nothing was done about the nuclear program that could  have made our government's policy disputable. The present  government if following the same policy as formed during Nawaz  Sharif's government. The only difference is that the U.S.  government has introduced a new amendment in the Congress. This  proposed amendment will remove the clause in the Pressler  Amendment that was used to stop aid to Pakistan. This amendment  will also the give the right to the U.S. President to exempt  specific nations from restrictions on U.S. aid that come under  the Symington, Clayton, and Solarz amendments, if it is  necessary to achieve his foreign policy goals. The U.S.  President, however, will make sure that such countries are not  involved in terrorism, violating human rights or nuclear  proliferation before he grants exemption. This progress is  positive from Pakistan's point of view. Perhaps, the opposition  leader has concluded from this progress that the prime minister  and the U.S. government has some secret agreement, and decided  to challenge the government in his ritualistic attitude. He  smells some conspiracy and threatens that rivers of blood will  flow if the nuclear program is rolled back. Perhaps because of  this noise raised by the opposition, it was necessary to warn  Pakistan that it should not be deluded to believe that the new  legislation will give it freedom to make nuclear weapons.</p>

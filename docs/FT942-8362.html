			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Woolworth inquiry finds cover-up Employees of Woolworth, the US retailer, falsified the company's financial results in the first two quarters of last year because they believed they were acting under orders to show a profit, an internal investigation has found. In spite of a conclusion that wrong-doing occurred within the company, the report stops short of pinpointing blame. 'Recollections clashed sharply and the evidence is in conflict,' it said. However, Mr Charles Young, the chief financial officer, has resigned and Mr William Lavin, chairman and chief executive officer, has been stripped of his chairmanship. He will become vice-chairman Woolworth's board launched the investigation in March after realising that, although the previous year's annual results were correct, the quarterly results were wrong. Profits had been reported in the first two quarters when the company had in reality incurred losses. Employees tried to conceal losses by deferring costs till later in the year, when the financial position was expected to improve. The plan went wrong when the company stayed in losses for the third and fourth quarters. The report, released late Wednesday after the stock market closed, presents a picture of management and employees contradicting each other over who was to blame. It says a large number of employees interviewed commented on 'a reporting environment at the company that placed extreme emphasis on maintaining quarterly earnings, and more specifically, reporting quarterly financial results consistent with budget projections.' Mr Selig Adler, chief financial officer of Woolworth's Kinney Shoe Corporation subsidiary, told the board that Mr Young, the parent company's chief financial officer, had instructed him to report inaccurate quarterly results 'so as to inflate the company's publicly reported profits'. Mr Young conceded he might have described some preliminary results as 'unacceptable' but said he had never asked anyone, directly or indirectly, to report inaccurate figures. An employee of Woolworth's Canadian subsidiary told the investigators he had been directed by Mr E. Ronald Gamble, the unit's chief financial officer, to report monthly financial results 'that differed from the numbers contained in the general ledger, thereby overstating Canada's interim operating results'. Mr Gamble confirmed this but said he had been directed by the then chief executive of Woolworth Canada and Mr Young to report different numbers. The former Woolworth Canada chief executive and Mr Young denied the allegation. Mr Lavin, group chief executive, conceded in interviews with the investigators he had pushed employees hard to verify earnings numbers. 'It is conceivable that because of my position and forcefulness, subordinates could feel pressure and misperceive my intentions.' But he added: 'I certainly did not intend my remarks to be construed as encouragement to report other than truthful numbers.' Mr Young, resigning as chief financial officer, denied any misconduct. But in his resignation letter dated May 17, he said conditions had so changed he could no longer effectively discharge his duties. Mr Lavin and Mr Young stepped aside during the investigation. Mr Young will be replaced by Mr Andrew Hines, earlier appointed his temporary replacement, while the new non-executive chairman will be Mr John Adams, the outside director who headed the investigation. A criminal investigation appears unlikely, but the Securities and Exchange Commission has launched an inquiry into the accounting irregularities. The company remains the target of shareholder lawsuits.</p>

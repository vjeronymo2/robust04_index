			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Hewden Stuart chief takes a swipe at City short-termists The chairman of Hewden Stuart, the UK's biggest independent plant hire company, took a swipe at the City yesterday when the group reported interim profits well above expectations. Sir Matthew Goodwin, former deputy chairman of the Scottish Conservatives, blamed short-termist pressure from the City for the failure of many British companies to maintain investment through the last recession. He attributed the sharp rebound in the Glasgow-based group's profits to heavy investment in new plant - worth more than Pounds 100m in the last 18 months. Hewden Stuart reported a 77 per cent increase in half-year profits to Pounds 16.2m - about 20 per cent ahead of City expectations. Sir Matthew said trading was continuing at a high level and told analysts: 'You ain't seen anything yet.' Sir Matthew, 65, a chartered accountant who has been chairman since 1979, said he 'did not give a damn' when the group's pre-tax profits collapsed to Pounds 12m in 1992, compared with Pounds 36m in 1989, at the peak of the boom. Cash flow, the most important element in evaluating a company, had remained strong and the company continued to invest in spite of the downturn. Known for its cautious approach, the group decided to increase capital expenditure sharply in July 1993, when it became convinced that recovery was definitely on the way. It secured good terms from manufacturers, such as a Belgian supplier of compressors which was about to put its workforce on a three-day week. Sir Matthew said the group had continued to invest, even although doing so depressed immediate profitability. He said it was 'a tragedy' that so few companies had maintained investment during the recession and blamed the City's constant demand for short-term performance. He noted that British Steel had recently warned that supplies of steel were already tightening. He said: 'Coming from Scotland, you have to wonder whether we should ever have shut Ravenscraig. We also see shortages of bricks, because so many kilns have been closed.' Sir Matthew did not conceal his pleasure at exceeding the analysts' forecasts. He said Hewden Stuart had decided not to try to upgrade expectations, since such guidance gave an unfair advantage to institutions and 'was tantamount to insider dealing'. Details, Page 24</p>

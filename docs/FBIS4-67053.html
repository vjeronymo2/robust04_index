			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Letter submitted to CAMBIO 16 by Gilberto and Miguel </F> Rodriguez Orejuela]    [Text] Because of the media's attitude toward us, an  attitude motivated by a need to create a stronger impact and  sensation with the news, as citing specific names certainly  draws a wider audience and increased circulation, this arbitrary  and constant persecution and the sacrifice of our constitutional  rights by people who would rather make news than present the  news is becoming intolerable to us. We are, therefore, making  the following remarks.    1. The dissemination of this large amount of news, most  often  at odds with reality, persistently ignores our constitutional  rights contained in Articles 15, 20, 21, and 29 of the National  Constitution. We have not waived those rights, and we will  defend ourselves by using the instruments provided by law.    2. The essence of a democratic state of law is based on the  fundamental rights of the individual. These pillars of democracy  cannot be resigned or renounced. One such right is the right to  information contained in Article 20 of the Constitution in its  two major aspects: the right to inform and the right to be  informed. We respect this important and universal principle, and  we defend its historic and political raison d'etre.  There can be no doubt that we have always greatly respected, as  we shall continue to do, the oral, written, and television  media, because of the convictions imparted to us by our academic  and political background.    3. A free press, so cherished by democracy, must act  responsibly (Article 20, second paragraph of the Constitution).  The parameters of this responsibility are described in the  Constitution. The right to information loses primacy when it  clashes with individual rights; therefore, it must be exercised  truthfully and impartially (Article 20, first paragraph) so  these rights will not be damaged.    4. Most recently, all news reports on the antidrug campaign  and the seizure of prohibited substances that create physical or  psychological dependency have been accompanied by three  references that have become a standard and mandatory feature:    4a. Ownership of the cargo seized, no matter where these  substances were found in Colombia or elsewhere, is attributed to  the "Cali Cartel."    4b. It is stated that the Cali Cartel is an organization  created and run by the undersigned.    4c. The article is illustrated with photos of the  undersigned, depending on the desired magnitude of the impact.    We dispute all of the above: there is no proof to support  the  constant linkage of our names with the criminal deeds reported  in the news. Even worse, it can be corroborated by the news  accounts themselves that the reported events have no connection  to us, and our names, photos, and images were used improperly  only to give color, illustrate, and capture the attention of the  listener, reader, or viewer.    5. Neither of the undersigned has ever been convicted in  Colombia or in any other country of the crime of drug  trafficking. We have borne the legal proceedings against us both  here and abroad with dignity, decorum, and respect for justice.    6. According to our Constitution, those who bear great  responsibility to ensure the community's respect for the  Constitution, that is, the National Government, particularly the  Office of the Prosecutor General and the Office of the Attorney  General, and what is known as the fourth estate (the media),  must perform their duties and uphold the principle of the  citizens' equality before the law (Article 13 of the  Constitution). Therefore, it is clear that the guarantee of the  presumption of innocence contained in Article 29 of the  Constitution protects us, and no one can incriminate us,  especially publicly. This is illegal when no charges have been  proven against us in any court, nor has our guilt been  established by a definitive court ruling (Article 29 of the  Constitution and Article 2 of the Criminal Procedures Code), the  only judgment that a state of law accepts. Otherwise, we may at  some time take legal action.    Because of our respect for the law, when any of the media  has  proof of criminal activity on our part, including a definitive  conviction, we will not oppose publication of that information  with whatever publicity the media consider appropriate. But  until that happens, we demand that our constitutional rights be  respected and observed, by virtue of our status as Colombian  citizens.    [Signed] Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, Miguel Rodriguez  Orejuela, Cali</p>

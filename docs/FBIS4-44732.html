			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Major Opportunities for Tiny Structures"; </F> Subhead: "Micro- and Nano-Structure Engineering: Fantastic  Innovations on Prototype Scale"]    [Text] Mainz, 8 April 1994--Micro- and nano-structure  engineering is calling attention to itself with fantastic  innovations on the prototype scale that will in fact decisively  alter our technical environment and even the quality of our  lives in a few years. New growth markets are beginning to  develop for micro-structure products and industrial nations are  preparing for a new technology race with support programs  measuring in the billions. In the following article, professor  Wolfgang Ehrfeld of the Institute for Microengineering [IMM] in  Freiburg, describes the current situation.    Critical functional elements of modern engineering are  growing increasingly smaller, attaining molecular dimensions,  and at present it is even possible to manipulate individual  atoms. Concurrently, the level of integration is increasing. In  microprocessors and memory chips many millions of transistors  are combined on a single tiny silicon chip and the  billion-threshold, the gigabit chip, no longer appears to be so  far removed. Together, miniaturization and integration are the  engine for engineering progress. Micro- and nano-structure  engineering is becoming the basis of our future security.    Internationally, microsystems that combine micromechanical,  microoptical, microacoustic, microthermal and other  microfucntional elements with microelectronics, constitute the  technological basis for modern products. There are markets for  microstructural products everywhere: automation, information and  communications engineering, automotive engineering, aerospace,  chemical process engineering and entertainment electronics  deserve mention here along with medicine and bioengineering.    Research is still unambiguously uppermost in the case of  nanostructures, thinking here of molecular storage devices or  so-called "quantum devices." When considering films of a few  layers of molecules or atoms, however, that are decisive for the  operations of many chemical and biological sensors, for  optoelectronic components or for diverse, technically relevant  interface phenomena, then nanoengineering -- quite apart from  the scanning tunnel microscope and its various derivatives -- is  already a significant economic factor.    The technological basis for the manufacture of  microstructural products developed from semiconductor  engineering, precision mechanics and optics. It is possible to  produce high-precision three dimensional microstructures using  anisotropic etching of single-crystal materials, dry etching  processes with low-pressure plasmas, with electron, ion and  laser beams or using depth lithography with x-ray beams. It is  possible, using casting, stamping, electroplating or other  shaping processes, to replicate such microstructures, if  necessary, with nanometer precision, over and over again and to  transfer them into other materials.    The compact disk [CD] is an example of the success of this  type of replication design, wherein semiconductor  microlithography, thin-film engineering and ultra-precision  injection molding are in synergy. Using lithography,  electroforming, casting [LIGA] engineering, developed in  Germany, based on a combination of depth lithography,  electroforming and shaping, the two-dimensional CD replication  process is extended into the third dimension of microstructure  engineering and an inconceivably broad diversity of products is  developed, as demonstrated by the IMM in Mainz at the research  and technology innovation market of the Hannover fair on the  basis of microsensors, micromotors, microoptical systems, etc.    The extensive menu of microsystems engineering is  exemplified  through many other examples: Friedrich-Schiller university in  Jena is displaying as a microsystem optical chips for laser  doppler anemometry and magnetic sensors based on squids for  accurate administration of ion rays in tumor therapy;  Hamburg-Harburg technological university [TU] is presenting  chemical gas sensors; and Bayreuth university is displaying the  effectiveness of nanotechnology by means of materials research  using combined scanning power and friction microscopy.    Absent materials research, micro- and nano-structure  engineering are inconceivable and in this case the innovation  market demonstrates many new approaches. We may mention here:  Mossbauer spectroscopy (Goettingen university); the use of RFQ  accelerators (Framkfurt university); high-resolution computer  tomography (federal department for materials research);  time-resolution materials research using the emissions electron  microscope (Mainz university); analysis of extremely thin films  using the Brewster angle microscope (Goettingen NFT GmbH) and  differential reflectometry (Vilseck ATZ.    To be sure, this is only a tiny portion of the broad  technological basis for micro- and nano-structure engineering.  But it is one approach to engineering progress in products,  materials, testing processes, production engineering and  applications in virtually all sectors of modern engineering.    Already in existence today as prototypes on the laboratory  scale are: chemical analysis systems that are no larger than a  sugar cube; micromotors that have been engineered together with  ultrasound sensors and micromechanical instruments for vascular  and neurosurgery in catheter systems having a one to two  millimeter diameter; microsensor rays for the most diverse  measurable quantities; and a multitude of micromechanical,  microoptical or fluid engineering components. Using modern  production methods of microengineering it is possible to produce  various inexpensive connections for monomode glass fibers for  optical data transfer with submicrometer precision and  integrated switch or multiplex functions as well and photonics  microcomponents are being developed for optical computers.    As fantastic as such applications may seem at present, it is  also equally certain that in the foreseeable future our daily  lives will be inconceivable without them. Still, microsystems  for medicine, the new energy-saving injection system, that can  be realized only with microengineering methods, the microsensors  in tennis rackets or in the safety bindings of skis and many  other micro-, and in the future, nano-structure products, can be  produced inexpensively only if there are professional production  equipment, product-specific materials, semi-finished products  and fabricated products, design tools and a plethora of services  in the hardware and software sectors and, of course, also in  marketing and sales.    The federal ministry for research and technology has already  allocated 400 million German marks [DM] for the support of  microengineering and another 600 million is supposed to be  forthcoming in the follow-on program, as the minister for  research reported in February. Combined projects, in which a  number of firms and research facilities are each participating,  are foremost in this context and are supposed to accelerate  progress through cooperation and a division of labor.    Compared to the outlays by other industrial nations or the  total amount that the European Union [EU] plans to allocate to  microsystems engineering in the fourth framework program, a  support volume of a total DM1 billion is very significant. But  even in the U.S. and the Far East, the key function of micro-  and nano-structure engineering has been acknowledged for a long  time and they have developed their own strategies for success.  It is not just the amount of the support total, but rather the  strategic approach that is decisive in a broad spectrum  technology in which producers of microstructural products have  to cooperate closely with their users as well as suppliers of  production equipment, materials manufacturers and special  services firms.    In microengineering, both Japan as well as the U.S. have  demonstrated that they have better concepts of cooperation and  innovation than Germany or Europe. Still, international  technological competition in micro- and nano-structure  engineering has just begun. A visit to the research and  technology innovation market and an exchange of ideas with the  exhibitors may contribute to progress through cooperation in a  key technology.</p>

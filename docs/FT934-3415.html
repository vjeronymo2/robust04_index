			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Venezuela heading away from trade liberalisation Mr Rafael Caldera, victor in Venezuela's presidential election on Sunday, is expected to consider measures to revise the free trade policy of the government of former President Carlos Andres Perez. Economic advisers to Mr Caldera indicated this week they were examining ways of overturning aspects of the trade liberalisation, in order to encourage development of Venezuelan industry. One adviser, Mr Rafael Kries, was quoted yesterday in the Economia Hoy newspaper as describing the Perez trade policy as 'unconditional and indiscriminate'. A return to protection would not be indiscriminate, he said, and there were 'para-tariff mechanisms' that Venezuela could use to help industry. Mr Caldera said this week he was sympathetic to hemispheric trade integration, and that the North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico was a 'very interesting idea'. Venezuela has been mentioned by US officials as a possible Nafta candidate. But Mr Caldera - scheduled to begin his five-year term in February - also said: 'I doubt very much whether we'll arrive at the point that we'll be able to join Nafta in the next five years.' Businessmen said this week Venezuela's obligations under Gatt and its economic integration agreements under the Andean Pact and the Group of Three  -which brings Venezuela together with Colombia and Mexico - would limit the new government's freedom of action to increase protectionism. The Andean Pact has agreed on a four-level common external tariff with a maximum of 20 per cent. Mr Pedro Vallenilla, president of the Venezuelan paper producer, Venepal, which forms part of the Mendoza group of companies, said the Andean pact meant the common external tariff 'cannot be changed unilaterally by Venezuela'. The Andean Pact groups Venezuela with Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru, but Peru's membership has been temporarily suspended. There have been concerns Mr Caldera's strong nationalist streak could increase tensions with Colombia over the disputed Gulf of Venezuela. The interim government of Mr Ramon Velasquez has already implemented several measures to protect agriculture, and there is pressure for protection from other industries - notably textiles and shoes.</p>

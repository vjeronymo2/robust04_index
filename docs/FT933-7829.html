			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Currency deals should be put in writing Sir, A good way to reduce the malign influence of currency speculators would be to insist that all transactions should be in writing (or confirmed in writing) in order to form a contract. Electronic transmission would be acceptable. It would then be possible to require a delay of, say, three days in clearing all transactions, as the banks find it 'necessary' to do with cheques in order to persuade their clients to use debit cards.

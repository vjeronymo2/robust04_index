Making proper arrangements for people who have been  released after serving prison sentences or who have been  relieved of reform- through-labor terms and giving them help and  education, so that they can truly be reformed, is the  continuation of the effect of this policy. The practice in many  areas proves that wherever this task is given adequate  attention, the effect is always good and crime can be reduced;  in areas where such people do not receive proper arrangements  and help and education, there is a high recidivism rate and some  of them go on to commit bigger crimes, seriously jeopardizing  social wellbeing. In the new context of the establishment of a  socialist market economic system, this task involves many new  conditions and new problems. It is necessary to carry on with  the good methods that have proved effective on the one hand, and  to keep improving work methods on the other. Six central  departments, including the Central Committee for Comprehensive  Management of Social Security, put forward working  recommendations [gong zuo yi jian 1562 0155 1942 6015] for  solving this problem after investigation and research. This is  of great significance to maintaining social stability.    Helping those who have been released after serving prison  sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor  terms to find means of livelihood is a key link in preventing  recidivism. It is necessary to support and assist them in  seeking jobs on their own; and to encourage enterprises and  various kinds of economic entities to accept and give employment  to such people. Meanwhile, appeals have been made for all  circles in society to show concern for and take part in  providing placement, help, and education, so that such people  can find means of livelihood and employment.    Those who have been released after serving prison sentences  or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor terms enjoy,  by law, citizens' rights and should perform their obligations as  citizens. In job placement, housing distribution, and provision  of social relief, they should be treated in the same way as  anyone else without being discriminated against. Meanwhile, we  should also recognize that a considerable proportion of them do  have much difficulty in finding employment and should be given  some special care. They still have some mental obstacles to  overcome, so education for them should be strengthened. In this  sense, those who have been released after serving prison  sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor  terms are a special social group. To give them more assistance  and education and help them narrow and eliminate the gap they  feel in a social and psychological sense after they return to  society as quickly as possible is the common responsibility of  the whole society. Naturally, however, while stepping up our  efforts to make arrangements for them, we should selectively  strengthen help and education for those who have more  deep-rooted negative traits or who have not been so well  reformed and show a tendency toward recidivism; and sternly  punish those who break the law and commit crime again.    To make a good job of the placement, assistance, and  education for those who have been released after serving prison  sentences or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor  terms requires close attention and support from the party and  government leaders at various levels, the cooperation of  relevant departments, and concerted efforts from all circles in  society, so that joint and comprehensive management can be  achieved. We believe that with the joint endeavors of the whole  society and timely implementation of various work measures, more  of those who have been released after serving prison sentences  or who have been relieved of reform-through-labor terms will  embark on the road of rebirth, the incidence of recidivism will  drop, and society will be more stable, peaceful, and harmonious.</p>

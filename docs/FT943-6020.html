			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / The IRA Ceasefire: Development fund stands to gain new cash  -International aid If the wheels of peace are to be partly oiled by a fresh injection of foreign finance, then the International Fund for Ireland is likely to be among the main recipients. With reports suggesting that the administration of Mr Bill Clinton, US president, could provide up to Pounds 130m in aid, the fund - which already gets Pounds 13m a year from the US government - could soon find itself receiving extra cash. At the same time, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, said in London he would be proposing an increase in aid. He added: 'The future of Northern Ireland is a matter for the Irish, but also a European matter.' The fund, which already has the confidence of the US and of European Union nations, would provide a ready-made conduit for much of the promised additional money. It was set up in 1986 by the governments of the US and the Irish Republic and has now established itself as an engine for improvement. Until recently US budget cuts meant the fund faced a reduction in the annual contribution voted to it by the US Congress. At the beginning of August, however, the sum was again fixed at Pounds 13m and the figure could now be raised several times over. Since 1989 the EU has contributed Ecu15m (Pounds 12m) a year. The fund, whose total available resources by the end of last year stood at Pounds 225m, was established by the two governments to promote economic and social advance both in Northern Ireland and in the six border counties in the south. It is also charged with encouraging 'contact, dialogue and reconciliation' between nationalists and unionists throughout Ireland. Last year it helped create more than 2,600 jobs. Although the US and the EU have been among the principal sources of its finance, the fund has also been supported by Canada and New Zealand. The board of the fund is appointed jointly by the Irish and British governments and operations are controlled by joint directors-general based in Belfast and Dublin. Much of the day-to-day work, however, is carried out on the fund's behalf by government departments and agencies. The organisation, which has laid great emphasis on its independent status in order to give it credibility, has acted as a catalyst in encouraging economic regeneration in many of the most disadvantaged areas. It provides seed funding to stimulate public and private-sector investment and also encourages self-help schemes to bring together alienated communities. Particular efforts have been made to promote cross-border projects. These, together with additional help programmes in inner-city areas, could be significantly expanded. There have already been a series of 'flagship' cross-border projects, such as the Shannon-Erne waterway. Aid also goes to creating community-based businesses, developing science and technology and tourism. The EU has already allocated Ecu1.23bn in structural aid to Northern Ireland for 1994-99, up from Ecu1.07bn in 1989-93, mostly to develop infrastructure, training schemes, research and development and small businesses. Under a separate programme, the EU intends to spend a further Ecu100m on improving frontier links between the north and the republic.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Europe To Cofinance `Vegetation' Instrument"] </F>   [Text] The EEC is financing half the construction costs of  the vegetation-observing radiometer to be built by Aerospatiale  for the French SPOT 4 satellite. Launch is scheduled for 1997.    On 17 January the European Commission, represented by  Jean-Pierre Contzen, director of Italian Ispra's Joint Research  Center (CCR), and CNES [National Center for Space Studies],  represented by its director general, Jean-Daniel Levi, signed a  cooperation accord that involves the European Community in  realization of the "Vegetation" instrument destined for France's  SPOT 4 observation satellite to be launched in mid-1997.    Under the accord, the European Community will cofinance  construction of the Vegetation instrument, for which  Aerospatiale will be prime contractor, and as such responsible  to CNES. The program is being expanded to allow for the  participation of France, Belgium, Sweden, and Italy, with  subcontracts for the project going to manufacturers in these  countries. The Community will contribute ECU16 million (about  105 million [French] francs [Fr]), or half the estimated Fr210  million cost of the instrument.    The Vegetation instrument will provide full global coverage  at 1-km resolution, in the same HRVIR (visible and near  infrared) spectral bands as SPOT 4's two primary cameras. "This  instrument will be of great scientific interest and facilitate  monitoring of natural ecosystems and continental agricultural  systems," says CNES. The Community will use the instrument to  support its policy in the domains of agriculture, environment,  research, and international cooperation. The data will be  intensively exploited by CCR's Institute for Remote Sensing  Applications.    This accord adds both Vegetation and SPOT itself to the  European Community's stock of operational "tools."</p>

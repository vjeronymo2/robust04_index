			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah by </F> Sawsan Abu-Husayn in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] [Abu-Husayn] Is your visit to Cairo in the context  of the principle of reviving the mediation and ending the  current war?    [Basindwah] I met with President Mubarak and handed him a  written message from President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih to reassure  him about the country's security and safety. I told him that  what is taking place in Yemen is a case of a mutiny and a coup  against constitutional legitimacy and that the north never  sought the military option but it was imposed on us by the  mutiny command, namely the leader of the Socialist Party [YSP]  who violated constitutional legitimacy, compelling us to  confront this and to confront the coup attempt made by him and  his colleagues with the aim of destroying the country's unity.  All the Yemeni people are with us, and the mutineers will be  defeated. We do not want the Yemeni people to continue to bleed  and pay the price for the losses currently sustained in the  country. The price must be paid by the YSP leadership.    [Abu-Husayn] What is 'Ali Salim al-Bid's position now?    [Basindwah] You should ask him, if you can contact him. I  believe he is now trying to find a place to flee to abroad.    [Abu-Husayn] Would the Yemeni leadership deal with him?    [Basindwah] We cannot deal with him. He should face a fair  trial because he dragged Yemen to this tragedy and he must pay  the price.    [Abu-Husayn] But Aden accuses the legitimate leadership in  Sanaa of declaring war in a speech on 27 April.    [Basindwah] The conflict is not between the north and the  south. It is between the legitimate leadership headed by  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, with the people on his side, and  the mutineers in the YSP leadership.    [Abu-Husayn] So, we have to ask you: How will the war end?    [Basindwah] There is no civil war at all. What is going on  is an operation to repulse a rebel group.    [Abu-Husayn] Are we to understand that Sanaa is trying to  enter Aden by resorting to the military option?    [Basindwah] That is not true. I am Yemen's foreign minister  and I tell the truth which is the opposite of what the media is  saying. We will never fight Aden. We are trying to end a  mutiny. The mutineers will surrender and flee at any moment and  calm and stability will be restored. The mutineering group must  be brought to trial. Thy YSP's history provides evidence that  it is bloodthirsty and its bloody practices have been going on  for 30 years. So we certainly must take practical steps to  settle the clashes, which means that the southern command should  surrender the forces under its control.    [Abu-Husayn] Sanaa will today receive an Arab League  delegation. What is the mission of that delegation?    [Basindwah] The Arab League delegation will not be visiting  Sanaa for the purpose of mediation. An envoy of Arab League  Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid was supposed to meet  with Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih before the fighting  to be briefed on developments. As regards mediation and other  such matters, everyone knows Sanaa's position on the Arab  League's meeting and its rejection of any mediation by the  League or anyone else on the grounds that what is taking place  in Yemen is an internal mutiny and coup attempt against the  country's constitutional legitimacy.</p>

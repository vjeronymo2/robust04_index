			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: T&amp;N sells German engine seals subsidiary to SKF T&amp;N, the automotive components and engineering group, yesterday said it was selling Goetze Elastomere - its German engine seals subsidiary - to SKF, the world's leading manufacturer of roller bearings. The Swedish group is understood to be paying more than Pounds 20m for the Cologne-based business, which T&amp;N inherited last year following its DM250m (Pounds 102m) acquisition of Goetze, the German piston ring producer. Mr Colin Hope, T&amp;N chairman, said: 'The activities of Goetze Elastomere do not fit in with the rest of the group's product range and we believe that the company and its employees will benefit from being part of a group with a larger worldwide presence in this particular market.' SKF plans to integrate the business into its core seals and bearings division, complementing existing operations in North America and Italy. 'We've been looking for an opportunity in Germany for some time, and this will improve our position in the European automotive market,' said Mr Lars Malmer of SKF. T&amp;N had indicated earlier that the deal could signal the start of a series of non-core disposals aimed at reducing the group's Pounds 362.6m net borrowings, equivalent to gearing of 60 per cent. By helping to reduce gearing, such disposals are likely to give the UK group additional borrowing capacity should it decide to buy a majority stake in Kolbenschmidt, a German motor components manufacturer. Last month, T&amp;N acquired options on a 52.2 per cent stake in the piston and bearings company, which could greatly strengthen its position in the German market.</p>

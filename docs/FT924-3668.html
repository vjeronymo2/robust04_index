			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Tajik war refugees stranded at border UP to 140,000 refugees fleeing Tajikistan's civil strife are stranded near the Afghan border, Reuter reports from Tashkent. 'We were told by Russian border guards that the number of refugees near the Afghan frontier has reached 140,000,' said Mr Dieter Pfaff, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross mission in the Tajik capital Dushanbe. 'We're unable to reach the area, but we are planning our relief operation on the basis of these figures.' Hundreds of people in the impoverished Central Asian republic have been killed in fighting between ex-Communist rebels and Islamic militants since former President Rakhmon Nabiyev was ousted in September. Mr Pfaff said up to 500,000 people, 10 per cent of the population, were believed to be have been displaced by the fighting. The refugees were fleeing recent fighting in the southern town of Shartuz about 15 miles north of the Afghan border, which is guarded by Russian troops.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Court removes European threat to national lottery A potential threat to the planned National Lottery was lifted yesterday by the European Court of Justice. The court decided that the government's ban on the advertising and sale of tickets in the UK for large-scale foreign lotteries was legal. The decision has implications for state lotteries throughout the European Union. The Office of the National Lottery is currently studying eight applications for licences to run the lottery in the UK. The national lottery is due to start late this year or early next. Had the European Court forced a lifting of the ban, it could have caused confusion in the market, with operators from other EU countries including Ireland being free to sell tickets in the UK with the prospects of millions of pounds in prizes. The case arose in 1990 when British Customs &amp; Excise officers seized lottery tickets sent to the UK by Mr Jorg Schindler, a sales agent for the German state-supervised Suddeuttschen Klassenlotterie. Mr Schindler claimed that the seizure contravened the Treaty of Rome on the free movement of goods throughout the EU. The UK, backed by at least eight other EU members, argued that lotteries intended to raise money for good causes were issues for individual national social policy. The European Court ruled that EU laws did not preclude legislation such as that introduced by Britain 'in view of the concerns of social policy and of the prevention of fraud which justify it'. British lottery law, until it was amended by the National Lottery Act last year, had been designed 'to ensure that lotteries could not be operated for personal and commercial profit but solely for charitable, sporting or cultural purposes'. The court said the British government could justify restrictions on freedom to provide services in such a context.</p>

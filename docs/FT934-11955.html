			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Costco news hits retailers NEWS that Costco, the US food and retail discount group, had won its court battle with the leading British supermarket companies to open its first warehouse site in the UK impacted across several retail sectors yesterday. Worst hit were the supermarket groups, which had argued in the High Court that the US company should be treated as a retailer and not a wholesaler, and therefore have the same regulations applied to it as other food retailers. After an initial strong opening, supermarket stocks tumbled as the mid-day news came into the market. Of the groups challenging Costco in the courts, J. Sainsbury fell 8 to 416p and Argyll 5 to 304p, while heavy trading in Tesco saw 18m shares change hands, the price finally closing 4 1/2 down at 216p. However, food retailing analysts said that the reaction was a symptom of sentiment rather than a belief that the sector was under serious threat from the new discounters. 'The food retail stocks have had a good run and some investors are using Costco as an excuse to take profits,' was the view from one leading salesman. Nurdin &amp; Peacock, which intends to open its own warehouse operation under the 'Cargo' logo, advanced strongly, although analysts pointed out that its substantial cash and carry operations might suffer from any subsequent expansion of companies similar to Costco. The shares added 7 at 191p. Although many of yesterday's share falls were described as 'knee-jerk' reactions by analysts, it was admitted that the continuing focus on discounting in the food sector was likely to drag down sentiment in food retailing and manufacturing. 'It underlines that margin pressure is here to stay in both sectors,' said one food specialist. Other sectors were also hit. Argos and Dixons weakened on fears that their electrical appliance sales might be affected. Around half of Costco's sales in the US are in household goods, with electrical products featuring strongly. Argos slipped 7 to 349p and Dixons 3 to 274p. DIY groups were also said to be affected. Ladbroke, owner of Texas Home Care, shed 2 1/2 to 176 1/2 p. Boots fell 8 to 507p, but WH Smith, joint owner with Boots of Do It All, firmed 2 to 492p, while Kingfisher, owner of B&amp;Q, added 6 at 650p.</p>

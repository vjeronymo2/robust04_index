			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Lessons of Bombay broker's fall: India's financial markets need more radical reform than is contemplated WHEN India came close last year to defaulting on its foreign debt payments, the shock to national pride precipitated the most radical change in economic policy India has seen since independence. Mindful of the precedent, many bankers and brokers in Bombay have been saying this week that the nation's worst financial scandal, reducing stock market values by almost a third from their mid-April peak and causing heavy losses to banks, including Britain's Standard Chartered and Australia's ANZ Grindlays could also bring radical change. 'This could be a blessing in disguise,' said one Indian broker. 'It is far better that it has happened now rather than in three years' time,' said a foreign banker reflecting on the potential damage to India's credibility if the collapse had occurred when both foreign direct investment and portfolio investment were much higher. But such expectations of radical reform are pitched too high. The Indian financial markets, as the traumatic events of the last three weeks have shown, are a chaotic mixture of archaic procedures, increasingly large trading volumes, inadequate supervision, more aggressive broking practices and new financial instruments adapted from more sophisticated markets. Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay broker now under investigation for fraudulent securities dealings, had an Olympian grasp of these markets, the players and the loopholes. He had learnt the hard way through defaulting in 1987. His genius was to realise two years ago that the Indian market was headed strongly upwards. The corporate sector could only gain from the change from the highly regulated environment hostile to business to a more market-oriented climate. He bought stocks like Associated Cement Corporation (ACC) for Rs50 (Pounds 1) and helped propel them to a peak of Rsll,500 in April. But his ambitions overtook him. After going bust in 1987, he relaunched himself in the government securities market where banks trade among themselves in government and public-sector debt. As the stock market took off, he financed forward trading in shares out of funds raised on the collateral of bankers' receipts - an instrument used only in India, by which a bank pledges later delivery of securities already paid for. In many cases, the securities did not exist or had not yet been purchased. State Bank of India, the largest bank, forced Mr Mehta to repay Rs6.2bn in April. Badly overstretched, he raised funds from National Housing Bank on purported bankers' receipts. A cheque for Rs3bn-Rs4bn was mistakenly credited to his account at Grindlays. What is now clear is that Mr Mehta was by no means alone in siphoning funds out of the government securities market into share purchases. Banks could face losses of Rs25bn. As with any financial collapse, the immediate effect has been to show up the weaknesses of the system. Both state-owned and foreign banks maintained inadequate controls over their treasury departments, which had been a major source of profit. The Reserve Bank of India (the central bank) failed to keep an up-to-date record of transactions because entries are still made by hand in the public debt office. Bankers' receipts were transferred between banks - notwithstanding regulations to the contrary - and banks failed to verify their authenticity. In the stock market, as well, abuses abound. Large companies merrily purchase their own stock to push up prices. Insider trading is still not illegal - though regulations are now being drawn up to forbid it. Corporate reporting of accounts is well below international standards. The volume of floating shares is relatively small because in many companies, the state-owned financial institutions and the founders hold between them up to 60 per cent of the shares. Foreigners are still not allowed to purchase shares directly in the Indian market, though they can invest indirectly through a limited pool of shares held by offshore funds. Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said in his February budget he would allow 'reputable' foreign institutions to buy directly in the Indian market. But foreigners are likely to stay out of the market until prices - still reflecting average price/earnings ratios of 35 - drop to a more realistic level. Foreigners will also want to see that the abuses and those responsible for them, have been removed. The government would like to prosecute Mr Mehta but is still uncertain if it can substantiate its case. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) does not have the expertise for tackling highly complex issues in the securities market. Mr Mehta has powerful friends among industrialists, senior civil servants and politicians - many of whom have benefited from his dealings or are themselves guilty of illegalities in a society where bribery is common. Banks want their money back and know their best chance of getting it is acquiring Mr Mehta's shares. Mr Mehta strides the town like a man who expects a deal to be done. The scandal will undoubtedly lead to tighter discipline in the market. Banks will keep a closer check on their treasuries. The Reserve Bank is to computerise its register of security transactions. Stockbrokers who before the crash closed the stock market in protest at attempts by the newly created Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to force them to register with it, have submitted this week. 'They are chastened men,' says Mr GV Ramakrishna, the board's president. But the real lesson of the crisis - which still paralyses the money markets and frightens investors away from the stock market - is that financial markets need far more radical changes than the government is contemplating. It refused last year to privatise state owned banks, which would have made them operate on a commercial basis. The government is now in a dispute with the World Bank over the Bank's demand for big cuts in state directed lending through the banking system - a dispute which has led to the freezing of Dollars 500m World Bank financial sector loan. It is nervous of pressing banks to cut their surplus labour because of union opposition. In the capital markets, it is still heavy-handedly intervening through state owned institutions to prop up prices - to protect the small investor but also to increase the government's revenue from planned Rs30bn-Rs40bn sales of minority stakes in public sector enterprises. Unluckily for the cause of radical change, the securities scandal has occurred when the prime minister is in a weak position. The momentum of economic reform has slowed as he has been forced to deal with challenges from within his party. More than ever he is seeking consensus rather than confrontation. This is an attitude bound to colour the government's handling of the scandal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There are violent incidents and riots by residents  in numerous places in the territories. Our correspondent Moti  Amir reports that 28 residents were wounded in the Gaza Strip by  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] gunfire. Fire was directed at an  Israeli car and a Border Police patrol in Bethlehem. The car  was damaged, but its passengers were not harmed. A while later,  an Israeli bus was stoned, and one of the passengers fired his  gun, killing one of the stone throwers. The IDF imposed a  curfew on the Bethlehem area.    Stones were hurled at cars in the garages in Nazareth. Calls  were heared from the town's mosques not to forgive the massacre.  The commander of the police's northern district conferred with  area notables, expressed his sympathy for the Arab population,  and tried to calm down moods.    The defense minister's media adviser denies Hebron  physicians' claims that the IDF and Israeli hospitals refrained  from extending aid to the Hebron casualties. He told our  correspondent Hayim Hecht that the IDF offered helicopters for  the transfer of the wounded, and that Jerusalem hospitals  prepared to receive them, but the Arab physicians rejected all  IDF offers.    The Health Ministry has deployed over the last hour to  extend  all possible medical aid to hospitals that treat the Hebron  wounded. Our correspondent 'Ofra Nehmad notes that Dr Yehoshu'a  Shemer, the Health Ministry's assistant director general  announced that he instructed the blood bank to prepare as many  blood units as necessary for the Arab medical elements, as well  as to extend any other medical assistance. Our correspondent  notes that seven of the Hebron wounded reached the Jerusalem  Hadassah hospitals, and Magen David Adom ambulances are on the  alert to transfer wounded people to the town's hospitals.</p>

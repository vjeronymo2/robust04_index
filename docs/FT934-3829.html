			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Company News: Iktisat Bankasi Iktisat Bankasi, the Turkish trade finance bank controlled by Mr Erol Aksoy, is planning to make an initial public offering on the Istanbul exchange, writes John Murray-Brown from Ankara. An issue of up to 10 per cent of its share capital is being considered as Mr Aksoy looked to raise funds to finance his media businesses. Iktisat, which is a specialist trade finance bank, reported profits of TL165bn (Dollars 12.2m) in 1992 on assets of TL5,874bn. The sale of a 10 per cent stake would raise about Dollars 30m, the bank said. Mr Aksoy owns 45 per cent of Iktisat while his family-controlled holding company owns a further 50 per cent.</p>

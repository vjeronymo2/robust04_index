			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Japan's ruling parties seek compromise Japan's fractious coalition parties will this weekend try to reach a compromise on controversial tax reform plans after the prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa agreed yesterday to freeze the proposals. Mr Hosokawa yesterday apologised for failing to 'ensure sufficient contact' with his seven coalition partners before announcing a Y6,000bn (Pounds 36bn) per year tax cut to be financed by a 7 per cent tax on goods and services to be introduced in 1997. The move provoked the Social Democratic party, the coalition's largest member, and a strong opponent of a rise in the present 3 per cent sales tax, to threaten to leave the government. The row has delayed a record Y15,100bn economic stimulus package which Mr Hosokawa hopes to publish before he meets Mr Bill Clinton, the US president, in Washington next Friday. Next year's budget, already two months late, and a supplementary budget for the current year, are also deadlocked by the tax row. Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, said the government now hopes to present its economic package - originally due in December - by Monday or later and a draft budget before the end of the week. 'The schedule is already very tight, but we must keep that deadline,' he said. There was 'a direction towards some form of compromise,' in the coalition, he said. Mr Hosokawa had asked cabinet members 'calmly to reconsider'. The proposed tax cut and counterbalancing sales tax rise is the centrepiece of the package, which includes government spending and loans. The prime minister yesterday stuck to his position that the new 'welfare' tax - to replace the current sales tax - is essential to finance the proposed income tax cut. He received unusually outspoken support from Mr Jiro Saito, vice finance minister - the most senior bureaucrat in Japan's most powerful ministry - who argued that any reduction in the proposed 7 per cent welfare tax would make income tax cuts impossible. The row has widened a growing rift between the centre right of the coalition and the rest. The tax plan has the general support of the Japan Renewal party, which dominates coalition economic policy, and the Buddhist-backed Clean Government party, as well as the Finance Ministry and parts of the opposition Liberal Democratic party. Yet some of Mr Hosokawa's strongest supporters, in his own Japan New party and in its ally, the New Harbinger party, share the Socialists' doubts about the style, if not the content, of the tax proposal. Despite the seriousness of the row, there were no calls from the cabinet yesterday for Mr Hosokawa's resignation.</p>

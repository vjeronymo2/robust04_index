			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lt Col V. Sharnauskas: "Aviation Command and </F> Control in Combined-Arms (Operations)"]    [Text] Army Aviation is rightfully considered the most  mobile arm of the Ground Troops and moreover possesses a high  fighting strength. In the hands of a skilled commander, it can  significantly influence the course of combat operations. The  experience of combat and operational training of troops and  staffs indicates that due to low effectiveness of command and  control, in most cases its capabilities are only half realized.    By command and control we mean the purposeful activities of  commanders and staffs to maintain combat readiness of aviation  units (subunits) of the Ground Troops, preparing them for a  battle (operation), and leading them when performing assigned  missions. Its organizational and technical basis is a command  and control system which today is viewed as a command and  control subsystem of the Ground Troops. A close analysis makes  it possible to talk about the existence of serious problems in  the structural and functional configuration of command and  control bodies and facilities if Ground Troops aviation does not  conform their capabilities to modern conditions.    For example, in questions of efficiency and quality of  command and control, requirements today are being satisfied at  less than two-thirds the optimal level.    In our view, this situation is largely explained by the fact  that at the front-regiment echelon, two independent systems of  control posts exist to this day: Ground Troops aviation and  Front Air Army [FAA] aviation. Elements of the first are: In the  front--front aviation command posts [KP]; in army-level  formations--army command posts. Each includes tactical control  groups [TCG], a vectoring and target designation post [VTDP],  and a forward air controller control post [FAC CP]. It should be  emphasized that the control posts of Ground Troops  aviation are a component part of command posts of combined-arms  formations. Command and control of frontal aviation large  units and units is accomplished, as before, through the FAA KP  and the FAA tactical control center [TCC], which today also  include their own VTDP, TCG, and FAC.    Thus, the timeliness of receiving (transmitting) information  is decreased, and it is more difficult to organize and maintain  coordination not only between air components but also with  ground units. What is more, centralized planning of combat  employment of aviation is disrupted.    The second problem I would like to touch upon is equally  timely and concerns equipping control posts of Ground Troops  aviation with communications and automation equipment.  Unfortunately, the existing equipment does not provide the  necessary efficiency, and the capabilities for processing,  storing, and transmitting information to interested echelons are  insufficient. There is virtually no system of information and  operational-tactical computational tasks.    Thus, communications equipment at the army-division echelon  provides high speed in the telegraph and telecode mode at 50-75  bits per second, time stability, and information reliability of  10&lt;sup&gt; -2&lt;/sup&gt; ...10&lt;sup&gt; -3&lt;/sup&gt; . Is it not a paradox that at  the regiment-battalion level, the forward air controller  is deprived of equipment for communications with combined-arms  subunits, precisely in whose interests aviation is  performing missions!    The radio allocated to the forward air control for  communicating with helicopters (aircraft) has a limited  operating range and is not resistant to jamming. This fact makes  it extremely difficult to organize coordination of aviation with  ground units (subunits) and does not meet the requirements of  security of joint combat operations.    The situation is no better with command and control bodies  and facilities being equipped with automation equipment. The  "Manevr" automated command and control system (front-regiment)  includes only the aviation combat control group MP-23 command  and staff vehicle; other levels of the Ground Troops command and  control system do not have them.    Unclear differentiation of the functions of command and  control bodies and facilities of Ground Troops aviation and  front air army aviation, and incomplete definition of the duties  of control post officials in organizing combat employment of  aviation and command and control of it during an operation  (combat), also have a negative effect on aviation command and  control.    Incidentally, similar problems also had to be solved by U.S.  Army command authorities in the early 1980's when army aviation  was made an independent combat arm. Over the course of several  years, three interrelated levels were created in the U.S. Army  Aviation command and control system: Command, coordination of  operations in the airspace, and air traffic control. The Army  Corps [AC] Combat Operations Control Center [COCC] has army  aviation squads from the operations office of the corps  headquarters and an airspace operations coordination team. The  division COCC includes an airspace operations coordination group  [AOCG]. Combat support groups (which organize coordination with  army aviation) and a brigade staff aviation officer,  coordinating operations in the airspace over the combat  operations area, are located at the brigade command post. The  coordination group is formed when the antitank helicopter  battalion is transferred to the operational subordination of the  combined-arms brigade. At the battalion's command post are a  fire support coordination officer and a staff representative of  the motorized rifle battalion (tank battalion).    The composition of the COCC and AOCG includes an air defense  officer, tactical and army aviation officers, a field artillery  officer, an electronic warfare [EW] officer, an air traffic  control officer, and also support personnel, who all together  participate in organizing and accomplishing coordination.    To increase the effectiveness of command and control, army  aviation created its own ATMAC automated control system (similar  to the 485L tactical aviation automated control system).    In the future it is planned to equip tactical and army  aviation aircraft and helicopters with a new system for  determining the location of troops, installations, and  communications--the PLRS/JTIDS, which will enable airborne  objects to determine their location with an accuracy of up to 25  meters and to exchange information in the data transmission mode  using the automated control system. (There is virtually  continuous coordination with the control post of the Ground  Troops and even with individual objects--tanks, self-propelled  artillery mounts, surface-to-air missile systems, self-propelled  antiaircraft guns, infantry fighting vehicles, and so forth).    It seems that it is also time for our army aviation to  determine the directions of improving the command and control  system. These directions are seen as conducting a set of  measures of a military scientific, technical, and structural  nature aimed primarily at increasing the functioning  effectiveness of the aviation control post system of the Ground  Troops.    In the author's opinion, it is necessary to reorganize the  system of command and control bodies and aviation control posts  of the Ground Troops. In particular, it makes sense to make  wider use of the modular principle of building the control  posts. The primary module in a motorized rifle (tank) regiment  may be an aviation control team [ACT] made up of 4-5 people (ACT  chief; coordination officer; officer for collection, processing,  and analysis of information on the air and ground situation; and  1-2 guidance and target designation officers).    In a division (brigade) it is desirable to create an  aviation  control group [ACG] of 18-20 people. Several independent groups  can be assigned from it, each of which would include a position  for a tactical control officer [TCO] of the front air army  operations group. The ACG must be equipped with a radar with an  operating range of up to 40 km.    In a combined-arms formation (army corps, army) it is  advisable to have an aviation control center [ACC] with 30-36  people, in which a front air army operations group [OG] also  works.    For increasing the timeliness and quality of aviation  command  and control, closer coordination with Ground Troops units, and  centralized command and control of weapons of the combat arms,  it is necessary to locate all the above aviation command and  control bodies together with the control posts of the missile  troops and artillery, air defense, and electronic combat. It is  also necessary to form a main Combat Operations Control Center  [MCOCC] at a front, a Combat Operations Control Center [COCC] at  a combined-arms (tank) army, a Combat Operations Control Group  [COCG] at a division (brigade), and a Combat Operations Control  Team [COCT] at a regiment. A structural model of the proposed  system of aviation control posts is shown in the diagram.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-002C-06A>           Structural Model of Proposed System of Aviation Control Posts </FIG>  &lt;/graphic&gt;     Aviation tactical control complexes [ATCC] can make a  significant contribution to increasing the effectiveness of  command and control of aviation in a battle and operation.  Equipping them with advanced communications and data  transmission equipment will ensure complete technical  compatibility of the ATCC with aviation ground control posts of  the Ground Troops deployed on the base of the "Manevr" automated  command and control system and its effective use in the  interests of both organic and supporting aviation.    In addition, for vectoring helicopters to ground and  airborne  targets, it makes sense to install a special radar on the  ATCC's, which would provide an information field for command and  control of combat formations of Ground Troops aviation in the  zone of operations of the combined-arms formation. Use of the  ATCC could ensure not only detection of enemy offensive air  weapons but also reconnaissance of moving ground targets.    Practical implementation of the proposals outlined above, in  the author's opinion, would make it possible to reach a modern  level of command and control of Ground Troops aviation and would  ensure maximum realization of the combat capabilities of units  and subunits.    In conclusion, let us emphasize this thought. In our time,  command and control, including of forces and assets of Ground  Troops aviation, is becoming perhaps just as important a factor  of success as the number of troops (forces) and weapons, and the  correlation of command and control capabilities of the opposing  sides often decides the outcome of a battle.

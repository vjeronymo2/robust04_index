			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volvo ahead after better than expected results The rise in US interest rates overnight on Tuesday provided markets with an early opportunity to advance, but this was not sustained in many cases. STOCKHOLM featured Volvo, which gained SKr10 at SKr768 in the 'B' shares after the vehicle manufacturer came in with results that exceeded expectations. The shares had been actively traded prior to the results, rising by some 5 per cent. Commenting on the figures, James Capel in London said that it had increased its full year forecast from SKr11bn to SKr13bn and expected 1994 earnings per share to reach SKr80, rising to SKr95 in 1995. The Affarsvarlden General index finished 9.00 down at 1,543.50. Turnover amounted to SKr3.6bn. FRANKFURT just failed to breach its record high, with the Dax index closing the official session up 7.70 at 2,267.41. In the post-bourse the index declined to close at 2,254.21. Turnover came to DM8.8bn. Among the active stocks, BMW fell DM17.50, or 1.8 per cent, to DM939.50 ahead of results due out today. In contrast Linde put on DM17.00 or 1.8 per cent to DM943.00 after the engineering group said that it might lift its dividend this year. It said that it expected a rise in sales of 10 per cent this year. Daimler-Benz, which held its annual meeting yesterday, lost DM3.50 to DM890.00. The group reported a rise in first quarter turnover of some 20 per cent. ZURICH gave up most of its early gains as a weak futures market and Wall Street's hesitant mood triggered late profit-taking. The SMI index finished 13.5 ahead at 2,740.6, after positing an earlier high of 2,773.8. Roche certificates paused after their strong performance earlier in the week, giving up SFr25 to SFr6,680, although it was still the day's most actively traded issue. Banks and insurers put in a strong performance on hopes for steady or lower long term interest rates. UBS bearers rose SFr18 to SFr1,151 and Zurich Insurance was SFr32 higher at SFr1,372. CS Holding, which said it had no immediate comment on a report quoting its chairman as saying he hoped to make a written offer for Creditanstalt-Bankverein, added SFr6 to SFr621. Brown Boveri finished SFr13 higher at SFr1,288 after ABB released first quarter results that were near the upper end of analysts expectations. Among the smaller issues, Saurer rose SFr40 to SFr3,050 after the company reported that 1993 profits more than doubled than said that it planned a new corporate and capital structure. PARIS was hit by profit-taking following a string of upward moves in recent days. The CAC-40 index slipped 11.18 to 2,183.99 in turnover of FFr4.5bn, having opened higher in reaction to the overnight news from the US. Oil stocks continued to ebb, with Elf Aquitaine down FFr2.70 to FFr427.00. MILAN moved strongly ahead at the opening before profit-taking emerged to trim gains as the Comit index appeared to be heading for resistance at the 815-820 level, and ahead of the the parliamentary vote of confidence on the government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi, scheduled to come after the market closed. The Comit index finished 4.66 higher at 806.28. Blue chip industrials felt the effects of the change of mood with Fiat losing L50 to L7,138, Pirelli L22 to L3,000 and Montedison L13 to L1,520. But the telecommunications sector was mixed. Sip rose L65 to L4,689 ahead of today's vote to give the go-ahead to the Telecom Italia fusion, but Stet fell back L19 to L5,689. AMSTERDAM edged higher in the absence of major domestic news. The AEX index added 2.33 to 416.04. Profit-taking was in order on a number of major issues, such as Royal Dutch, off Fl 1.40 at Fl 206.20, while PolyGram slipped Fl 1.30 to Fl 79.00. However, strength was provided from financials and publishers in general, with Wolters Kluwer adding Fl 5.50 to Fl 117.90 and Elsevier Fl 2.40 to Fl 177.40. MADRID saw late profit taking take the shine off the day's performance although prices still extended their rally to seven days. The General index rose 1.87 to 336.78 in volume of Pta44bn. Banks were out of favour as investors switched their attention to electric and motorway stocks. Santander fell Pta120 or 1.9 per cent to Pta6,230 but Banesto was Pta5 higher at Pta1,125.

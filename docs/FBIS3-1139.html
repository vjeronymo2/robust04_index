The absence of President Biya at this meeting is linked --  it  is generally believed -- to the border conflict that broke out  between Cameroon and Nigeria over the Bakassi Peninsula.    The points on the agenda of the summit -- to which the heads  of state of the border states of Lake Chad (Cameroon, Niger,  Nigeria, and Chad) are invited -- include the launching of a  campaign "for the safeguarding of Lake Chad" aimed at  solliciting the aid of the international community to finance  the necessary works that would prevent the lake from drying up.    "Up to now, the name of President Biya does not appear on  the  official list of the heads of state who expressed the wish to  take part in the summit," a source from the Nigerian Foreign  Affairs Ministry confirmed.    Cameroon Ambassador to Nigeria, Samuel Libock Mbei, is  currently on an official mission to Cameroon, it was learned  from that country's embassy, with no more details.    The Bakassi Peninsula -- with about 1,000 square km in the  Gulf of Guinea -- is rich in natural resources (primarily fish)  and is said to contain important hydrocarbon deposits.    While seeking a diplomatic solution to that conflict that  escalated at the beginning of March, Cameroon and Nigeria  deployed troops on Bakassi and Yaounde regularly reports clashes  between the two troops.</p>

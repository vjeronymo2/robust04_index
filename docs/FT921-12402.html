			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Anxious Asean leaders tighten economic knot: Plans to set up a south-east Asian free-trade zone SIX south-east Asian leaders are expected to sign an agreement in Singapore tomorrow on a mutual reduction of tariffs aimed at creating a free-trade area within 15 years. The pact, worked out for this week's summit of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean), which embraces a population of 320m, owes as much to fears of rising protectionism in world markets as to the regional trend towards economic liberalisation. Asean leaders - from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Brunei - are worried the Uruguay Round of trade talks will fail and that their export-dependent economies could be left out in the cold by trade blocs such as the European Community and the North American free-trade area. Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, said at the weekend that the Asean free-trade area (Afta) would make the region more attractive for trade and investment in the face of competition from Europe and America. The draft Asean agreement calls for a system of common effective preferential tariffs (Cept) for intra-Asean trade to be introduced on January 1 1993, starting with manufactured goods, processed agricultural products and capital goods and leading to the Asean free-trade area, with tariffs of 0-5 per cent within 15 years. More than 12 sectors - including cement, electrical items, textiles, rubber and plastic goods and vegetable oil - have been earmarked for the first stage, which is expected to set initial intra-Asean tariffs for the products at 20 per cent or less. Sceptics point out that Asean is already operating preferential tariff arrangements which have been notable for their half-heartedness and lack of success. The latest proposals continue to include an opt-out clause known as 'six minus x' allowing individual countries temporary exemptions. The private sector, in the form of the Asean Chambers of Commerce and Industry, has expressed concern over non-tariff barriers and the exclusion of services from the Afta proposals. But businessmen and officials believe fear of protectionism in foreign markets and continuing liberalisation in individual Asean states will be sufficient to ensure progress. Trade within Asia as a whole is thriving, but intra-Asean dealings have done no more than maintain a 4-5 per cent share of the association's growing international trade, if Singapore and its huge re-export trade is excluded, leaving its members vulnerable to external shocks. Mr Anand Panyarachun, the Thai premier who has vigorously promoted Afta and wants it implemented in 10 years rather than 15, says: 'The actual level of intra-Asean trade and intra-Asean investment has not risen significantly in the last 20 years. 'Now we find access for our exports to markets abroad being not as open as before. At the same time our industries have matured and become more competitive internationally, and this has led us to be more confident about pursuing policies of economic liberalisation.' Mr Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore's trade and industry minister, put the case for regional tariff cuts in a statement last week. 'If a company in one against other Asean countries,' he said, 'what hope does it have on world markets, where the competition is much fiercer?' Asean would prefer multilateral world trade liberalisation under the auspices of Gatt, and Asean officials last week shelved a controversial Malaysian proposal for an East Asian economic caucus which would have excluded the US. But, as one minister said, the idea is being put in a 'glass case' from which it can be removed if a battle of the trade blocs begins.</p>

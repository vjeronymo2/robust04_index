			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Eastern comrades strike back: Unions in the ex-Soviet bloc are regaining some vigour Over the weekend, the threat of strike action was enough to win a 55 per cent pay increase for the unionised employees of Romania's public television station. Bulgarian trade union leaders may take industrial action in the autumn to protest at the government's austere social policies. And in Russia coalminers are threatening to go on strike because of month-long delays in the payment of their wages. This rash of industrial action throughout eastern Europe signals a change in the role played by unions in the post-communist world. In the initial rush to build market economies that followed the collapse of communism, unions seemed to be relegated to a bit part. But there are signs that post-communist trade unionism is now beginning to find its feet. 'We are like a youngster learning very fast,' says Mr Richard Falbr, president of CMKOS, the Czech trade union confederation. The reformed former communist unions and those that have been set up more recently face an uphill struggle to win credibility with employers and workers in an uncertain economic climate. Western trade unions would recognise the low prestige of many of their opposite numbers in the east and the concentration of their influence in a shrinking public sector. 'Trade unionism has a bad image from the decades when it was just a transmission belt in the factory for (Communist) party instructions,' says Mr Falbr. Even basic trade union concepts, such as 'worker solidarity', have negative associations - conjuring up the image of having to work an extra Saturday morning shift for some far-away, anti-imperialist struggle. In Russia, where the unions have changed little since Soviet times, a recent poll found that 73 per cent of workers thought them ineffective at defending workers' rights. The existence of state-imposed incomes policies - in the form of limits on wages - in Russia and elsewhere in the region adds to the feeling that the unions make little difference in workplaces. And continuing rows between the old unions and the new reduce what little collective power the unions might be able to muster. Moreover, the labour market shake-out - supported by most mainstream political parties - does not make fertile ground for trade unionism. Excluding Russia, where formal unemployment is still less than 3 per cent, employment has fallen by an average of 20 per cent in the former eastern bloc in the past four years and average real wages in most countries are only now regaining their pre-transition levels. In Russia, Ukraine and some other countries of the former Soviet Union, they are still substantially below that level. Despite guidance from western unions on recruitment strategy, unions remain weak to non-existent in the private sector, which now employs more than 50 per cent of workers in more advanced states such as Poland and Hungary. 'Subject to state regulations, it appears that private employers can set pay levels, pay structures and employment conditions unilaterally,' says a recent World Bank survey. Mr Guy Standing, head of the International Labour Organisation's Eastern Europe unit in Budapest, says this is a worrying long-term trend. But there are countervailing factors - economic and political - which should ease his fears. As big, strongly unionised plants are moved into the private sector through accelerating privatisation programmes, the union foothold there may strengthen. Thanks to the distribution of shares to workers in many countries, as part of the privatisation process, several large companies now have an important element of worker ownership. The better organised unions are exploiting that to influence ement decisions. Further, despite the free-market rhetoric of many governments, there are national tripartite commissions (governments, unions and employers) of varying influence in most countries. The newly elected Polish government has raised the status of its tripartite commission. Similarly, the left of centre government in Hungary wants to strengthen the voice of organised labour in revising the country's labour law. In pay setting, too, union influence may be growing. Though their strength lies in the public sector, unions may be affecting wage levels in the private sector. Mr Simon Commander of the World Bank says average wages in the two sectors are almost identical throughout the region, with the exception of Russia. At workplace level, unions are scoring successes in some countries. Mr Christoph Drzewicki, a senior official of Solidarity, says the Polish union recently won an important recognition battle at Elgaz, a private sector heating company. He also points to the new co-operation between Solidarity and its ex-communist rival, OPZZ, in a strike, recently ended, at the Italian-owned Lucchini steel plant. In Russia, unions may be weak but they remain relevant in millions of people's lives. The enterprise remains an important source of welfare services and even of food and housing, and in most big plants the unions are still allowed to play an important role by managers, who see maintaining high employment levels as a crucial part of their job. The Russian Confederation of Trade Unions, with more than 60m members, lobbies alongside managers to maximise subsidies. The mass membership and substantial resources of the unions also give them potential clout in a region where political parties have only tiny memberships. The percentage of workers in unions ranges from a low of about 40 per cent in Poland to a high of 75 per cent in Bulgaria. The influence of unions in some pockets of the economy can be considerable. Workers in the Fiat and GM plants in, respectively, Poland and Hungary have also been asking for wages to be raised in stages to western levels. Most foreign employers expect wages to rise, given the proximity of much better-paid western Europeans. In the Czech Republic, for example, Mr Falbr, the union leader, is pushing hard to lift wage levels. 'At present our productivity is about one-third western levels, but our pay is about one-tenth western levels. That cannot last,' he says. Official Czech unemployment is lower than anywhere in the region apart from Russia. That is partly because wage and non-wage labour costs are lower than in Poland and Hungary (where non-wage labour costs are about 50 per cent of wages costs), unemployment pay is less generous, and there has been less corporate restructuring. He rejects, however, the claim by union leaders elsewhere that the Czech unions are among the weakest in the region. 'We may have been less militant, but we still have a lot of influence,' he says, pointing to a successful lobby to reform a recent pension law. In the long run, Mr Falbr would like to see Czech industrial relations following a German model of works councils in companies and union representation on company boards, but he recognises this is some time away. Others, such as Mr Drzewicki of Poland's Solidarity, suggest that the French model - with low union presence in factories and offices, but strong labour laws and an influential voice for labour at national level - is a more realistic long-term option. Just as trade unionism in Asia has not followed practice in Europe or America, so in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union a new model may emerge. Despite the tough times the unions are going through, one thing seems certain: they are here to stay.</p>

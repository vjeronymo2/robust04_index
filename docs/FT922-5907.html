			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Kubota hit by higher costs and weaker tractor sales KUBOTA, the Japanese producer of farm equipment and pipe systems, yesterday reported a 5.9 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y36.8bn (Dollars 285.2m) for the fiscal year ended March 31. The company blamed the decline - its first in six years - on rising operating costs and weaker overseas sales of tractors and other farm equipment, especially in Europe and the US. Sales increased by 1.8 per cent to Y909.2bn, reflecting a 2.5 per cent rise in domestic revenues. Overseas sales, which account for 16 per cent of the total, declined by 1.4 per cent to Y144.1bn. Net income dropped by 41.6 per cent to Y4.2bn because of the liquidation of its troubled Stardent Computer subsidiary in the US, which brought an extraordinary loss of Y17.1bn. On an unconsolidated basis, pre-tax earnings fell by 12.6 per cent to Y31.7bn. Sales are expected to rise to Y750bn from Y728.6bn, and net profit to fall to Y18bn from Y18.5bn.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Yeltsin was real target of no-confidence motion in duma: John Lloyd explains the political machinations behind yesterday's vote on the future of the Chernomyrdin government Technically, yesterday's no-confidence vote in the Russian parliament was aimed at the government of Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin. But it had a bigger target in its sights as well - President Boris Yeltsin. The government won the vote, but the relatively high figure of 194 deputies voting against the government - just 32 short of a majority - shows that opposition to Mr Yeltsin has grown significantly. The impression is strengthened by the small number of deputies from normally supportive liberal parties - 54 - who voted against the no-confidence motion, with another 55 who cast an abstention (the remainder simply did not vote). The opposition's hard core is the Communist Party of Russia, led by Mr Gennady Zyuganov. The party, relatively disciplined and normally able to count on the support of the Agrarian Party, has rejected any compromise with Mr Yeltsin, refused to sign his (now somewhat tattered) Pact on Social Consensus and has said it will refuse to accept seats in the cabinet. The other large anti-presidential group is the Liberal Democratic Party, led by Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky - who yesterday confirmed his unerring feel for the quotable remark when he warned ministers to resign when they could - or face arrest when he came to (presidential) power next year, to institute a dictatorship. However, it lacks the discipline of the Communists and its members probably both abstained and as well as voted against the government. The same is true of the Agrarians and the communist-leaning Women of Russia Party - though Mr Yeltsin's naming yesterday of Alexander Nazarchuk, an Agrarian and chairman of the duma agriculture committee, as agriculture minister in place of Mr Victor Khlystun, may have swung a few votes the government's way. Mr Khlystun was no radical - but he had angered the Agrarians and others on the left by going along with modest reform in the agricultural sector, and his successor is unlikely quickly to repeat the mistake. At the same time, however, the nomination showed on what a fine line Mr Yeltsin is now treading as he seeks to sway this way and that to retain his government. On its announcement, Mr Yegor Gaidar, leader of the main liberal party, Russia's Choice, commented sourly: 'It now makes it impossible to speak of any reform in the agricultural sector at all.' He threatened to change his party's vote and oppose the government. The Democratic Party, which had tried to keep to the shifting centre, is now split - with half of its 15 MPs rallying round Mr Sergei Glazyev, the young former trade minister whose pungent and informed attacks on the budget have put him at the head of those in the Duma opposing the economic strategy. He knows from the inside the horse trading, heroic assumptions and guestimates which make up the Russian budget - and, with a burning conviction that a monetarist policy is destroying Russian industry, he has positioned himself to be high in the ranks of any opposition cabinet which might take over. But that will not be tomorrow. This opposition is composed of men and women whose inexperience of party politics, desire for individual prominence and fear that they may have to take responsibility for the economy was always likely to combine to undermine the no-confidence vote. Mr Zyuganov's bitter comment last night that 'we did not get rid of the government because such a vote would require courage' had some truth - though it is unclear how far those who voted for the no confidence motion lacked courage, or folly.</p>

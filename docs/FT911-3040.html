			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Philippines moves to attract foreign investors THE Philippines' central bank plans to simplify procedures for repatriating proceeds of portfolio investments. These could take effect from June. This measure, with imminent reforms to laws governing foreign investments, appears to be a manifestation of the government's desire to make the country more attractive to foreign investors. Mr Gabriel Singson, deputy central bank governor, said the rules will simplify the registration and repatriation of foreign investments in officially-approved Philippine securities. They would cut down the registration and repatriation time to an average of 10 working days, against three months currently. The changes include the central bank authorising custodian banks - which conduct 90 per cent of securities transactions - to issue securities transaction documents. The measure is therefore expected to ease the workload of the central bank, cutting processing time for the remaining 10 per cent of investors. Dividend repatriation is to be speeded by removing the need for approval from both the corporation issuing a security and the broker or custodian bank involved. Approval of the 'transfer agent' - invariably a bank - will be sufficient. Furthermore, foreign investors will no longer need to submit a stock certificate. Mr Singson said the reforms would address stockbrokers' concerns about delays in the repatriation of foreign investments in central bank-approved Philippine securities and the lack of effective control by the custodian banks of the central bank registration documents.</p>

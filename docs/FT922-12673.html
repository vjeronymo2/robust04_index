			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Helical Bar Pounds 6.5m in red after provisions HELICAL BAR, the property development, investment and trading company, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.49m for the year to January 31 compared with a profit of Pounds 2.71m. The loss was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 4.62m relating to provisions at its London properties in City Road. Interest payable fell from Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 16.7m as borrowings dropped because of the sale of properties worth Pounds 47m. Extraordinary losses on sales of investment properties were Pounds 216,000 before tax. Turnover declined to Pounds 31.1m (Pounds 74.7m) and rental income fell from Pounds 18.8m to Pounds 16.5m. The group warned that the property industry in the south-east would continue to be depressed for the rest of the year. However, the bulk of the group's properties are in the north-east and West Midlands, which have shown signs of recovery. Losses per share were 35.4p (earnings of 7.8p) and the final dividend is cut to 1.6p (7.6p) making a total of 4p (10p).</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                 Damascus turned the unprecedented visit of an Israeli Arab  delegation to Syria into a major media event, eliciting from the  visitors strong rhetorical support for Syrian policies.  President Hafiz al-Asad also used the event to restate Syria's  overall position on the peace process.  The visit itself, and the  fact that the delegation head was permitted to use Syrian media  to portray a relatively positive image of the Israeli public and  government, marks a significant, albeit limited, step in the very  gradual thawing of Israeli-Syrian ties--a step that Damascus  probably hopes will play well in Washington and Israel.                             END SUMMARY      Both Damascus and the 57-member delegation of Israeli Arabs  professed that the delegation's 7-10 March visit was for the sole  purpose of extending condolences to President Hafiz al-Asad on  the death of his son Basil in January.  (For example, Jerusalem  Qol Yisra'el, 18 February; Damascus radio, 7 March); nonetheless,  the event was also viewed by both sides as having clear political  significance.  For their part, Syria's tightly controlled media  gave the visit far more extensive coverage than they did a visit  of a large Druze delegation from the Golan Heights in September  1992.  Reflecting the political nature of the visit, both  President al-Asad and delegation head 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah-  -leader of the Arab Democratic Party and Knesset deputy--spoke  only briefly about the death of al-Asad's son, focusing instead  almost entirely on the Arab-Israel peace process, in televised  speeches (Damascus Television, 9 March).      A Show of Support for Syria      Syria orchestrated the visit as a show of support for its own  policies, from the peace process, to the PLO, to Syrian Jews.  Damascus elicited the visitors' vocal support via the Syrian  media, which carried numerous statements by Darawshah extolling  Syria and scoring Israeli policies.  For example:      -- According to Damascus radio, Darawshah called the destruction  of Qunaytirah1--which the delegation visited on its second day in  Syria--"a deplorable crime" and "praised the heroic struggle of  the Syrian Armed Forces supported by the heroic Syrian people in  defense of Arab territory" (8 March).  In his address to al-Asad,  he asserted that "we share the same position with you" on the  peace process.      -- Damascus radio quoted Darawshah as saying that the purpose of  his delegation's visit with Syrian Jews was "to clarify some  Israeli political and public opinion issues" and "prove to all  who seek to distort the truth that Syria does not discriminate  against the Musawi community" [community of the followers of  Moses].      -- In an interview with Damascus radio, Darawshah said the  delegation had found that in Syria "everything is abundant,  freedom is available, and loftiness and dignity characterize  every action by Syria, led by President Hafiz al-Asad, may God  preserve him" (9 March).      -- Delegation member and Knesset deputy Talib al-Sani' was even  quoted as scoring Israel for trying to "penetrate the Arab world  economically and to propagate the idea of a Middle East market"  (Damascus radio, 10 March)--a recurrent theme in Syrian media in  recent months (for example, a Tishrin editorial, as reported by  Damascus radio on 8 February).      Even Syria's choice of personalities to greet the delegation on  arrival at the airport was clearly meant as a statement: Khalid  al-Fahum, head of a Syrian-backed umbrella group of Palestinian  rejectionists opposed to the PLO, was the only figure reported to  accompany the governor of Damascus to the airport (Damascus  radio, 7 March).  The Syrians thus created the appearance of an  affinity between Israeli Arabs and Palestinians supported by  Damascus, while giving the PLO--still scorned by the Syrians  because of the 13 September Israeli-PLO declaration of  Principles--a symbolic jab.      1Qunaytirah was captured by Israel in 1967 and returned to Syria  in ruins following the conclusion of a disengagement of forces  agreement in 1974.      Al-Asad Uses Visit for Peace Message      While the visitors were used as channels for extolling Syrian  policies, the visit also afforded Damascus an opportunity to send  some signals on the peace process for foreign--particularly U.S.  and Israeli--consumption.  Al-Asad used his meeting with the  delegation as a platform for his first policy statement since the  death of his son.  While breaking no new ground, al-Asad stressed  Syria's commitment to peace, at times echoing his now famous  "peace of the brave" speech to the 1992 Druze delegation  (Damascus radio, 9 September 1992).  He told the Israeli Arabs:  "We seriously seek peace, and the Israeli officials know this,"  adding, "In light of what they [Israel] are proposing, it seems  that their vision of peace is not the same as ours.  Therefore,  we will struggle until their peace becomes identical with our  peace . . . . Peace means rights.  In other words, each party has  its rights and each party is the master of itself and its  interests . . . . When we said the peace of the brave, we meant  that each party will achieve full peace with all its rights, and  that neither party will humiliate the other."      A Limited Opening to Israel      The visit itself marked a symbolic though limited advance in  Syrian willingness to take small steps toward opening contacts  with Israel.  It follows such modest advances as an evidently  officially sanctioned series of meetings outside the Middle East  between Syrian and Israeli academics reported by Israeli and  international media (for example, Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el, 31  December 1993; Yedi'ot Aharonot, 2 January 1994), and the 1992  visit by the Druze delegation, which crossed into Syria directly  from the Golan Heights and--according to Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin--included some Israeli passport holders (Jerusalem  Qol Yisra'el, 1 September 1992; Tel Aviv Bamahane, 23 September  1992, respectively).  The fact that Darawshah and al-Sani' are  not only Israeli citizens but also members of Knesset made the  symbolism of the visit still more salient.  In addition, coverage  of the visit for Israel radio by Israeli Arab correspondents who  filed a series of live dispatches from Damascus was another  unprecedented event.      Damascus took pains to prevent the visit from appearing as a  precedent for normalization with Israel but nonetheless allowed  the visit's symbolism to be clearly conveyed to the Syrian  public.  On the one hand, delegation members were forced to  travel to Syria via Cairo rather than directly from Israel and  were barred from using Israeli passports (Cairo MENA, 7 March,  Qol Yisra'el, 1O March).  In addition, Syrian media--and even  the delegation members--avoided any explicit reference to the  group's citizenship, referring to the visitors repeatedly as  "1948 Palestinians."  On the other hand, the political status of  the delegation members was made perfectly clear on Syrian media.  For example, Darawshah was quoted by the official Syrian news  service SANA as saying on arrival in Damascus:  "We represent the  Palestinians in the Galilee, in the Negev, and other cities" (7  March).   Moreover, Syrian media's airing of remarks by Darawshah  even made it clear that he is a Knesset member.  For example,  after calling in a Damascus television interview for Israeli  withdrawal from all the occupied territories, Darawshah declared:  "We say this from Damascus, and we also say the same thing in the  Knesset in Jerusalem."      The visit also brought somewhat greater openness in Syrian  media's treatment of Israel, as Darawshah was permitted to use  Syrian television to convey an unusually detailed and relatively  sympathetic portrayal of the Israeli government, the internal  Israeli political situation, and Israeli public opinion.  After  calling in his televised address for an Israeli commitment to  withdraw from the occupied territories, Darawshah asserted that  "of late, many people in Israel have begun to express stands  supportive of this formula" and that their numbers are  "increasing."  In his 1O March television interview, Darawshah  depicted the government as interested in making further  concessions but constrained by domestic political factors.  He  noted that the current Israeli coalition government "is supported  by the Arab parties" and that an expanded coalition "would enable  the government to continue the peace process and to make  concessions that will respond to the true Arab demands."  He also  described what he said was "a rational trend" in Israel that is  "strong indeed" and which believes that "we must end occupation."  He observed that "the demonstrations staged by tens of thousands  of people" in the wake of the Hebron massacre "was a joint  demonstration by the Arab and Jewish pro-peace forces," adding  that "we participated in it."      Although the Syrian television host openly took issue with some  of Darawshah's remarks--such as the notion that there are doves  in Israel--the visitor's overall message was evidently agreed on  in advance, as suggested by the manner in which the interviewer  appeared to pave the way for Darawshah's comments.  For example,  he asked Darawshah, "What is new in Zionist thought and  direction?"      Further Visits?      The delegation's visit has prompted reports in Israeli media that  there will be future visits to Syria by other Israeli citizens,  but there have been no such reports in Syrian media.  Evidently  based on comments by an Israeli Arab journalist who was part of  the delegation, Qol Yisra'el reported that Foreign Minister Faruq  al-Shar' had told the group the delegation's visit "is an opening  for additional visits to Syria by Israelis" (11 March).  Ool  Yisra'el reported the same day that a delegation led by Ibrahim  Nimr Husayn, chairman of Israel's National Committee of Arab  Local Councils, and Ahmad al-Tibi, an Israeli citizen and adviser  to PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat--"may soon leave for Syria."  Another  Qol Yisra'el report claimed that a 170-member delegation of Golan  Druze was being permitted by Israel to visit Damascus to extend  condolences to al-Asad on his son's death, but that the Syrians  had not yet approved the visit (15 March).      Implications      The very fact that Darawshah was given a forum for his more  favorable statements on Israel suggests that Syria wants the  visit to be seen as a significant indication of a genuine Syrian  openness to peace with Israel and as meeting Israeli demands that  such openness be conveyed more clearly to the Syrian public.  Now  that the barrier to visits by Israeli Arabs has been lifted,  there may well be more such visits.  But, considering Syrian  sensitivity over even the appearance of normalizing relations  with the Jewish state, and given Syria's repeated objections to  Israeli demands for a commitment to such normalization in the  future, similar visits by Jewish citizens of Israel are probably  not imminent.

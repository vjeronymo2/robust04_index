			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: A risk-free bond that may be worth the wait - Why the latest National Savings product has upset the building societies THE LAUNCH this week of a new National Savings product has provoked calls of 'foul]' from building societies in the competition for deposits. The First Option Bond was promised by Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in the Budget when he forecast a doubling of the public sector borrowing requirement, compared with last year, to Pounds 28bn, an amount that will have to be raised in part through National Savings and government bonds. Mark Boleat, director-general of the Building Societies Association, said this week that National Savings was trying to raise Pounds 6bn at the expense of building societies. He did not welcome the competition because 'it is not on proper terms'. Building societies claim the competition is unfair because, unlike the lending institutions, the government does not have to be profitable. The row intensified this week after National Savings announced an interest rate of 7.75 per cent net on its new one year fixed rate First Option Bond (see box for details). Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said the government was mindful of protests from banks and building societies that rates from National Savings were too high and had pitched the interest level accordingly. 'We don't want an embarrassment of riches,' he said. Privately, building societies felt this to be disingenuous. This week few offered a better rate of interest than the new bond's. The Halifax, the UK's largest building society, said it had anticipated public demand for the bond and believed its recently launched Guaranteed Reserve account, with investment terms from six months to five years, offered 'attractive and realistic rates of interest.' The sting is in the word 'realistic,' with its implication that National Savings is paying above current market rates. The rate of interest on Halifax's Guaranteed Reserve account at 6.66 per cent net (8.88 per cent gross) is more than a full percentage point below the First Option Bond, although the rate increases to 6.83 net (9.11 gross) on Pounds 10,000 and above. The minimum investment of Pounds 2,000 is also double that for the National Savings bond. A rate similar to the First Option Bond was offered by Nationwide through its one year Fixed Rate Bond fixed at 7.73 per cent net last month. But the minimum of Pounds 10,000 would be beyond the reach of small savers. In any case, Nationwide was unable to satisfy demand for the bond and it was withdrawn within a month of issue. Britannia has tried to steal some of the thunder of National Savings with an index-linked account, paying 4.5 per cent gross (exactly the same rate as National Savings on its index-linked certificates). The NS certificates have the great advantage of being tax-free but they are less flexible since they have to be held for five years, whereas the Britannia account operates on 90 day notice. It is paying 6.6 per cent net (8.8 per cent gross). Higher rates than on the First Option Bond can be found in the building societies but on their variable rate accounts. These are shown in our Best Rates table on Page VI. Banks and building societies do not offer much choice of fixed rates for savers. Guaranteed income bonds are the most directly comparable product to the First Option Bond. According to Baronworth Investment Services, the best rate on a one-year Gib with a minimum investment of Pounds 1,000 is 7.4 per cent net from Acuma. The National Savings rate of 8.05 per cent net on Pounds 20,000 is bettered by American Life's one year Gib, which is paying 8.25 per cent on Pounds 20,000 to just under Pounds 50,000. Savers are unlikely to have much sympathy with the building societies and may argue that in a competitive market, the lending institutions will just have to raise interest rates to compete. Building societies say they cannot afford to do this because they are also trying to cut mortgage rates. They accuse the government of pushing them to lower mortgage rates as a spur to a revival in the housing market, while poaching savers through National Savings. Two of the largest mortgage lenders said this week that they would have to consider raising mortgage rates unless there was a base rate cut, because they could not afford to lose more savers to National Savings. Simon Briscoe, of Greenwell Montagu, points out the potential that the government's policy has for delaying the recovery. 'Why encourage savings when it is spending that ought to be encouraged?' he asked. Building societies are on the defensive because net receipts - the difference between deposits and withdrawals - have been unusually low this year. Net receipts last year totalled Pounds 5.8bn but they amounted to only Pounds 657m for the first five months of this year. By contrast, National Savings has attracted Pounds 1.53bn of net receipts so far this year (excluding accrued interest). For the building societies, this drop in growth of receipts comes when the ratio of peoples' savings to income is at a 10 year high. Building societies' share of the personal sector financial assets market dropped from 16.2 per cent in 1980 to 15.3 per cent in 1991 but this is not entirely attributable to National Savings, since its market share has also declined, from 4 per cent to 2.8 per cent during the same period. The clear winners have been the life and pension products. Their market share rose from 34.8 per cent to 52.3 per cent, mainly as a result of the growth of endowment mortgages which have a life assurance element. Other reasons why net receipts have fallen include the offers of shares in newly privatised industries during the 1980s, which sucked funds out of the personal sector, and the growth in unit trusts, according to a report on building societies by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, published last month. But the report also attributes the fall in net receipts to lower saving rates offered by the building societies: 'Due to their bad debt problems, building societies have kept their savings rates low relative to money market rates, despite mortgage rates rising to well above money market rates.' Bad debts relative to advances tripled last year to 0.6 per cent from 1990; they doubled to 38 per cent relative to operating profit over the same period. Yet the report says that building society profitability as measured by return on capital is much higher than for banks. The return on capital for the 20 largest building societies in 1991 was 17.8 per cent compared with 8.5 per cent for the Big Four banks and it forecasts that the building society industry will 'continue to remain inherently strong and successful.' So savers should not be constrained by a philanthropic desire to help out the building societies - they should put their money where the highest rates are, with the usual caveat that this should not be with a shady institution. In this case, that caveat is not needed - short of revolution, National Savings is risk-free and the First Option Bond offers the highest one year fixed rate for a bond of its type. As long as you are happy to tie the money up for a year, what are you waiting for?</p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / People (Names in the News): Treasury moves in Italy The Italian Treasury has completed the reshuffle of its council of expert advisers, naming successors to Francesco Giavazzi and Alberto Giovannini, well-known in the world of international finance for their work on privatisation and debt policy over the last two years, writes Andrew Hill. The council of experts was set up in 1992 by then treasury minister Guido Carli to advise on economic policy. Members were drawn from top international financial and economic positions. Professors Giavazzi and Giovannini - nicknamed the G2 in academic circles for their joint publications - are both returning to academic positions, at Milan's Bocconi University and Columbia University in New York respectively. Their successors are from the same high-flying economic background. Vittorio Grilli, a member of the Treasury's council of experts since last year, succeeded Giavazzi last week. Grilli, 37, was educated first at Bocconi and then gained a Masters and a PhD in economics from the University of Rochester in the US. He is currently deputy director of the Program for International Economic Studies at Georgetown University in Washington DC, and the Woolwich Professor of Financial Economics at the University of London's Birkbeck College. Vincenzo La Via has joined the council of experts from Akros, the Italian investment group, where he was partner and senior fund manager. La Via, who has also held positions at the World Bank, has a doctorate from UCLA. It has yet to be decided who will take on Alberto Giovannini's role as coordinator of the council of experts. Giovannini himself, now Jerome Chazen Professor of International Business at Columbia, will continue to advise the Treasury on the privatisation of Italy's state electricity company, Enel, likely to take place late this year or in early 1995.</p>

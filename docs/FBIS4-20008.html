Two months after it established a branch in  that country, Ciba's Plants Protection Division signed an  agreement with the Qingdao Pesticides Factory in Qingdao on  Thursday [21 April], the Basel-based chemical group said. The  new company will produce active substances as well as compounds.    The Chinese partner will hold 45 percent of the assets, the  other 55 percent being the property of Ciba, which also will  designate the director. The new company, which will start its  activities in 1996 once its production units have been  completed, will employ around 180 people.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Nestor-BNA declines 34% to Pounds 5.31m THE EFFECTS of the UK and US recessions together with political factors were blamed by directors of Nestor-BNA, the international healthcare and specialist personnel group, for a 34 per cent fall in 1991 profits to Pounds 5.31m pre-tax. Part of the downturn, an exceptional charge of Pounds 840,000, reflected reorganisation costs. Earnings worked through at 5.81p (8.64p) but a proposed final dividend of 2p maintains the total at 3.15p. Turnover slipped from Pounds 104.4m to Pounds 100.5m.</p>

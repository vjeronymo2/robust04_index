			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Rolf Falter: "Not Indispensable"] </F>   [Text] With what sense of exaggeration could we say today  that Jean-Luc Dehaene has become a destabilizing element in  British domestic policy? Dehaene's unspoken candidacy for the  succession of Jacques Delors as President of the European  Commission (EC) has attracted great attention in the British  press and produced a real hate campaign which is apparently also  being fueled from Whitehall. From now on, the European profile  of the Belgian prime minister will be an element in the debate  that has arisen again in the governing Conservative Party.  Officially, that argument revolves around Great Britain's  future in Europe, but it is also just as much about the future  of John Major as the British prime minister.    In the flood of words, not everyone appears to be too  bothered about the facts. And one section of the British press  does not know the difference between intelligence and intellect.  However, the polemics also show how self-satisfied the European  Union (EU) would be even without the ever-critical and  suspicious British. Over the past few days, some British  newspapers quite rightly denounced the fact that the EC  president is being chosen on a French-German couch from people  who should above all deny that they are candidates and who have  not necessarily reached their present position through  elections. The British very modestly say nothing about the  logical conclusion of their criticism: Let the European  electorate or the democratically elected European Parliament  designate the EC president.    Should no German candidate emerge, then the fight will be  between Dehaene and his Netherlands colleague Ruud Lubbers.  With France and Germany backing Dehaene, Lubbers will probably  only have a chance if Major finds support for him in Madrid or  with Silvio Berlusconi. That could result in a nice little  auction of European structural funds.    The qualities of both candidates matter less. Those who say  that the EU today needs, above all, to make the inspired ideas  and decisions of Jacques Delors workable and practicable will  find Jean-Luc Dehaene the natural candidate. On the other hand,  anyone who is seeking any degree of understanding for the  Anglo-Saxon skepticism regarding a forced trend toward European  federalism, the craving to squander and to be meddlesome, and  the democratic deficit in the EU must choose Lubbers. Moreover,  both prime ministers are pragmatists, hard workers, poor  orators, and highly experienced politicians.    Meanwhile, in Belgium, people are driving themselves crazy  wondering whether Dehaene can and may go. That is pure  nonsense. For apart from concluding that the prime minister can  earn himself a healthy promotion, it would also be good for this  country to have someone occupying Jacques Delors' seat.    Then there remains the argument that Dehaene is  indispensable  for the present government and for this country. That argument  says more about Belgium's vulnerability than about the man who  has dominated and fashioned politics for 15 years. Nobody is  indispensable. Neither a government nor a country deserves to  survive if its fate is determined by a single heartbeat.</p>

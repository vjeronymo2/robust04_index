			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Ireland to help exporters hit by slide in the pound THE Irish government is to announce support measures today for exporters who have been badly hit by sterling's continuing slide on the foreign exchange markets, but Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, again ruled out devaluation as a policy option. Yesterday sterling fell to a new record low of Pounds 1.10 against the punt, which prompted Mr Terry Hobdell, the chairman of the Irish Small Firms Association (SFA), to say: 'This issue calls for immediate action by the government. It is a serious crisis, not just for exporters but for manufacturers who face the problem of much cheaper imports from the UK.' He said the SFA is looking for a package of around IPounds 150-200m 'to underwrite exporters and those facing competition from the UK'. The government said IPounds 50m was to be made available, along with IPounds 25m, from EC structural funds. The package is expected to include direct employment subsidies and selective reductions in employers' national insurance contributions. Although the financial markets anticipate a punt devaluation, all the main economic lobby groups continue to back the defence of the punt, including unions. A spokesman for SIPTU, Ireland's largest trade union, said yesterday: 'Special supports for those worst-hit by sterling's weakness will be cheaper and better for the country than devaluation.'</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Ex-PM faces funds charge Police in Papua New Guinea charged former Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu yesterday with misappropriating government funds, Reuter reports from Port Moresby. The charges relate to money which four of Mr Namaliu's ministers demanded in 1990 in return for their support in a planned vote of no confidence. Police said Mr Namaliu was charged with about 14 counts of misappropriation. He was allowed to leave police custody but was due to make a court appearance today.</p>

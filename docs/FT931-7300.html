			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lawson criticises the government LORD LAWSON, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday criticised the government for failing to consult the German central bank before taking sterling into the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Lord Lawson told the Commons foreign affairs committee that failure to agree a level for sterling with the Bundesbank ahead of entry contributed to Britain's forced withdrawal last year from the semi-fixed currency grid. 'In 1990 there was no agreement of the rate at all,' he said. 'The Germans had to take it or leave it. That was not a sensible basis.' He called last September's ERM withdrawal a 'humiliation and a defeat for Britain,' saying it had led to a collapse in confidence within the British economy.</p>

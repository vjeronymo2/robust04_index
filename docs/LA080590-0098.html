			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FAULTY BEARING ON LONDON'S BIG BEN HALTS MARCH OF TIME ON 3 OCCASIONS  </P> <P> It's not the heat but a faulty bearing that stopped the clock of Big Ben three  times last week, the government said.  </P> <P> The hands of the famous clock on the tower of the Houses of Parliament stopped  at 5:11 a.m. Friday, which is about where they snagged on Wednesday and  Thursday nights.  </P> <P> "We believe, as a result of investigations carried out this morning, that the  problem is to do with a bearing in the eastern face of the clock, and that once  that bearing has been replaced or lubricated, that the problem will go away,"  said Toby Sargent, spokesman for the Department of Environment.  </P> <P> Big Ben is the name of the bell that tolls the hours, but the name is  informally applied to the clock as well.  </P> <P> Sargent said it apparently was just a coincidence that the clock broke down  during the hottest days of the London summer. On Thursday, the temperature  reached 97 degrees.  </P></p>

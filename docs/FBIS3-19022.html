The total value of the projects is $15 million, or  532.5 million Belgian francs. These contracts were signed by  LenBell, a Russian company in which Alcatel Bell is the majority  shareholder. They concern the delivery of 50,000 telephone  lines of the Alcatel 1000 System 12 type to a mixed  Franco-Russian company.    The order will be spread over four years and involves the  delivery of a combined international-interurban-local exchange  and several local exchanges, distant subscriber units,  analog-numerical conversion equipment and material for  transmission by fiber optics and electromagnetic waves. The  first combined exchange will be put into service next September.    Last year Alcatel Bell and LenBell had already signed  contracts for the delivery and installation of 84,000 phone  lines in the cities of Novosibirsk, Kostroma, Dubno, Ufa,  Moscow, Voronezh, and Pakov [as published]. Most of the  exchanges will be delivered before the end of 1994.  <H5>  And in Korea too </H5>   On Wednesday Alcatel Bell also announced winning a 140  million Belgian franc contract in South Korea. Signed with  Dacom Corporation, the contract also concerns the delivery of an  Alcatel 1000 System 12 program. "This contract is the result of  an international public call for tenders," a company press  release stressed. The company headquarters are in Antwerp.</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Changes to libel laws announced CHANGES in the libel laws designed to simplify court hearings and to give judges greater control over the level of damages awarded were announced yesterday by the Lord Chancellor. The most radical change involves the introduction of a new 'offer of amends' defence which will allow defendants to cut cases short by admitting they have defamed the plaintiff and agreeing to pay damages set by the judge. Lord Mackay said he had decided to introduce the changes following recommendations from a committee chaired by Lord Justice Neill which looked at ways of reducing the complexity of defamation hearings. Under the other changes announced yesterday the normal time limit for bringing defamation claims is to be cut from three years to one from the date of publication. Judges are also to be given the power to rule on the meaning of words complained of. Lord Mackay said he had also decided to accept a suggestion made by Lord Justice Hoffmann for a new summary procedure that would enable the plaintiff to claim damages up to a fixed ceiling. Some of these changes will be made by amending the rules of the Supreme Court. But other changes will require legislation which Lord Mackay said would be introduced 'as soon as a suitable opportunity occurs'.</p>

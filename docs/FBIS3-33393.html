Presidential spokesman Francisco Baker denied the president  of the Republic is thinking of resigning to run for election.    Baker remarked that Franco cannot run for a seat in the  Senate, as a Brasilia daily reported last weekend, because he is  not affiliated with any political party. Moreover, the deadline  to become affiliated expired in early January.    President Franco will only be at Planalto Palace a few days  this week because on 24 February he will travel to Caxias do  Sul, where on 25 February he will open the grape harvest. On 26  February, he will travel to Porto Alegre, where he is scheduled  to meet Rio Grande do Sul Governor Alceu Collares; from there he  will go to Canoas, where he will dedicate the expansion of the  (Aupec Pascualinho) refining plant. On 27 February, Franco will  travel to Sao Jose dos Campos, Sao Paulo, to attend the  launching of General Motors' economy model, (Costa).    Franco will return to Brasilia on 28 February after the  launching ceremony, but he will only remain here a few days.    On 3 March, he is supposed to leave for Guaira, near  Caracas,  Venezuela to discuss issues related to border affairs, gold  diggers, and the preservation of the environment.</p>

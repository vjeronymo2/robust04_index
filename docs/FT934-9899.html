			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Britain favoured for manufacturing investment BRITAIN is reckoned by European business leaders to offer the best potential in the European Community for manufacturing investment, narrowly pushing Germany into second place, according to the survey. Eighteen per cent of respondents put the UK in first place, compared with 17 per cent for Germany, 14 per cent for Spain, and 12 per cent for France. Illustrating how European business is focusing on Germany's economic problems as well as its potential, 19 per cent of companies surveyed gave the Federal Republic the worst rating among EC investment sites. The favourable impression of the UK contrasts with the country's position at the bottom of last year's survey. The jump appears closely linked to the improvement in Britain's economic outlook since it left the European exchange rate mechanism in September of last year. UK respondents in the survey were the most confident about economic conditions, with 77 per cent expecting an improvement in their company's position over the next 12 months. This compares with an average of 56 per cent across the seven countries. Medium-term confidence in the UK economy seems to have greatly increased. Germany still leads countries expected to show the strongest economic growth in the next few years, although its position has deteriorated compared with the autumn 1992 survey. Britain, by contrast, has risen strongly in the medium-term prospects league table, now taking second place. Among executives taking part in the poll, 43 per cent put the UK among countries with the best three-year outlook, against 51 per cent for Germany. A year ago, 71 per cent of respondents thought Germany had the best prospects, with only 12 per cent saying the same for the UK. As far as currency stability is concerned, Germany retains the highest confidence by a wide margin - 78 per cent believed the D-Mark would be the strongest currency during the next 12 months and next three years. Only 7 per cent favoured sterling, a percentage shared with the Dutch guilder.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / International Company News: Ferfin rescue faces fresh delay FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the Italian holding company burdened with total borrowings of about L31,000bn (Dollars 19bn), will have to wait at least another month for the five banks preparing a rescue plan to finalise their proposals. The plan was originally expected at the end of this month, although Ferfin's foreign creditor banks yesterday appeared prepared to continue supporting the group. News of the delay and of the reaction of foreign banks, which have lent Ferfin about L6,500bn, came as members of the Ferruzzi family discussed their investment. Serafino Ferruzzi, the ultimate family holding company through which the Ferruzzis control 48 per cent of Ferfin, indicated it had made a heavy loss for 1992, though no figures were released. However, the fact that Serafino Ferruzzi will have to recapitalise to meet the requirements of Italian company law implies that the 1992 loss exceeded L460bn, the holding company's capitalisation. A date for a shareholders' meeting to consider the company's financial position and its legal relationship with the five Italian banks leading the Ferfin rescue was put off until the plan was ready. The banks are expected to unveil their proposals by August 31, when Ferfin is due to hold a special shareholders' meeting. The assembly, called last month to approve a drastic write-down in Ferfin's capital, may be followed by a rights issue. If the deal goes ahead as expected, it would probably allow leading creditor banks to exchange some of their loans to Ferfin for equity.</p>

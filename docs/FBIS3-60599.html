But the euphoria which greeted the event is now long forgotten.    The inherited weight of the Communist system has crushed the  enthusiasm of the young American or Canadian graduates -- the  grandchildren of Ukrainian immigrants -- who returned to the  land of their ancestors to help the government in Kiev to build  a new society. Most of them have now made the return trip back  across the Atlantic, such as the senior manager with the Bank of  Boston who gave up a very comfortable salary to take up the post  of deputy governor of the new central bank of Ukraine.    After more than two years of independence, the Ukraine has  still not managed to be rid of its past as a formerly model  Soviet province and to set a new path once and for all, in  economic and political terms.    With respect to the economy, the strategy pursued by  President Kravchuk -- democratically elected in December 1991  with 62 percent of the votes -- , a mixture of disorganized  liberalization and steps backwards toward a planned economy, has  led to an unprecedented social bankruptcy. Inflation is verging  on 2,000 percent; deprived of raw materials, firms are simply  ticking over; barter has become the principal medium of  exchange; wages have failed to keep pace with prices; people  survive only thanks to support within the family and the black  market. The "karbovanetz", the money issued two years ago in  order to leave the rouble zone, has lost more than 30 times its  value against the Russian currency -- which itself is hardly  known for its stability.    More than anything else, the Ukraine suffers from its  dependency on Russia for energy supplies. The time when oil and  natural gas were virtually free is well and truly past. Moscow  now demands payment in hard currency at worldwide oil markets.  The energy bill alone absorbs 80 percent of the Ukraine's  export revenue. The population has already been informed that  it should not expect their apartments to be heated above 10  degrees centigrade this winter.    Politically, the central authority is relatively stable,  thanks to President Kravchuk's skills as a political maneuverer.  A former Soviet apparatchik, he has succeeded in steering a  course avoiding both the pitfalls of super-nationalism and  communist nostalgia. But on the international stage, the  Ukraine is in the process of alienating itself from the powers  which were most favorably disposed to this former Soviet  province. They are concerned by Kiev's prevarication in the  matter of nuclear disarmament.    [Girard] On 19 November the Ukrainian parliament only voted  for a partial ratification of the START 1 Treaty. During a  previous interview, in January 1992, you told me that the  Ukraine would be rid of all its nuclear weapons by December  1994. What is the situation regrading your country's  denuclearization?    [Kravchuk] It is true, at the time I told you that the  Ukraine intended to become a non-nuclear state. I maintain this  commitment. The Ukraine must pursue its policy of  denuclearization. Because I remain convinced that there is no  other solution for the Ukraine. The Ukraine is not going to  build up its international prestige and reputation by possessing  nuclear weapons, but rather by respecting the undertakings it  has made and pursuing its policy of denuclearization.  Unfortunately, our parliament failed to ratify all the  documents I submitted for its signature. Why? First of all,  because the world's other nuclear powers did not work together  with us during the 12 months which preceded the START 1  agreement. They made no effort to understand our particular  situation and the concerns of a parliament with which they  established no dialogue.    [Girard] What is causing concern to the Ukrainian members of  parliament?    [Kravchuk] They fear the territorial claims which are being  expressed in certain nationalist circles in Russia. Their vote  reflects the opinion -- which is widely held here -- that  nuclear weapons are a means of protection against threats to the  integrity of Ukrainian territory. My opinion has not changed:  The country must be denuclearized. But the West should  understand that a president does not have the authority to run  the legislative at will. Fortunately, the text approved by  parliament allows me a certain margin of maneuver in order to  continue diplomatic negotiations to achieve the conditions for  our denuclearization. I intend to make full use of this.    [Girard] If you are a candidate at next June's presidential  elections, will you campaign for the Ukraine to be a signatory  of the NPT [Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]?    [Kravchuk] It all depends on the legislative elections next  March. If the new parliament is dominated, as I would like it  to be, by a majority of competent men who are able to understand  the country's domestic situation and international interests, I  will again go on the offensive. I will do everything in my  power for the Ukraine to ratify the START treaty, the Lisbon  protocol, and the NPT. But as I said, it all depends on the  parliament.    [Girard] Will you stand in June?    [Kravchuk] You will know two months in advance, when the  candidates have to register.    [Girard] Dismantling nuclear weapons is an expensive  process.  What are you expecting from the West?    [Kravchuk] Reciprocal action. The West must understand that  the text approved by parliament does not under any circumstances  mean that the denuclearization process has arrived at an  impasse. It allows the executives in the different countries to  continue to work in concrete terms. Rather than speculating on  the consequences of this vote, the West would do better to  provide me with technical and financial assistance in order to  destroy the nuclear warheads! I am also ready to make a gesture  to ease international concern. I am ready to start defusing our  nuclear missiles and even to dismantle a part of our warheads,  while awaiting the time when we can completely dismantle all our  nuclear weapon sites.    [Girard] But what specifically do you want from the West?    [Kravchuk] Above all else, security guarantees. You must  understand the fears of the Ukrainian people.    [Girard] Are you hoping for defense agreements, or NATO  membership perhaps?    [Kravchuk] No, but simply declarations by the major nuclear  powers undertaking not to attack the Ukraine and, at the same  time, to guarantee its territorial integrity. If we receive  such undertakings from Russia, the United States, France and  Great Britain, the Ukrainian population will feel they are  living in safety.    [Girard] On 1 October the five permanent members of the UN  security council thanked Russia for its action in maintaining  peace in the former USSR. What do you think of this declaration?    [Kravchuk] I find it premature to say the least. Without  wanting to judge the responsibility of any of the parties in  complex ethnic conflicts, the fact is that Russian troops were  often locally involved. Before applauding a country as a  "peace-keeper" you must first be sure that its action is not in  any doubt.    [Girard] Are the conditions present for Crimea -- which only  left Russia under Khrushchev -- to become a new Abkhaz  Republic? After what has happened in Georgia with the Abkhaz  minority, do you not fear that Crimea, whose population is  mainly Russian, will soon revolt against the Ukraine?    [Kravchuk] There are two reasons why the situation in Crimea  cannot degenerate into a conflict of the Georgia-Abkhaz type.  First of all, there is constant dialogue between Russia and the  Ukraine. At the outset, I took the initiative for a negotiated  regulation of all questions relating to the status of the Black  Sea -- including, above all, Crimea. This initiative was  approved by President Yeltsin and the process is functioning.  The same applies to the dividing up of the Black Sea fleet.  The different ethnic groups who make up the population in this  region must understand that the interests of both the Ukraine --  in whose territory it lies -- and of Russia must be taken into  account. Secondly, the Ukraine has granted almost total  economic and social autonomy to Crimea. We do not dictate terms  to Crimea.    [Girard] Judging by the meddling of Moscow in the conflicts  in Georgia, Azerbaijan, Moldavia, Tajikistan, do you not see a  return to Russia's imperial policy?    [Kravchuk] I would not like to state in such a direct way  that there is a return to Russian imperialism. But it is clear  that there does exist a strong heritage of imperial policy as  pursued first by the tzars and then by the Soviet Union. We  must also remember that there are 25 million Russians living in  the territory of the former USSR. It is not realistic to expect  Russia to give up all its interests outside its own territory.  The United States is able to maintain its interests outside  American territory: So why should such a policy be denied to  Russia?    [Girard] So what is the problem then?    [Kravchuk] The problem with the Russians is their way of  acting, the methods they use to defend their interests.  Admittedly, Russian troops were already on the spot in all the  conflicts you have just mentioned. Moscow did not send in  troops. These troops were faced with very delicate situations.  But I believe that they should refrain from intervening in  ethnic conflicts. Good intentions are needed on both sides.  The local populations should not be too arrogant with regard to  the Russians who have stayed behind and at the same time the  Russians should renounce any temptations of imperialistic  manipulations.    [Girard] How are you going to explain to the Ukrainians that  independence has meant heating and electricity cuts in the  middle of winter?    [Kravchuk] All countries have gone through difficult periods  such as we are going through now. Independence is not the prime  cause. It is the transition between two different systems of  organizing society. You cannot change overnight from a planned,  centralized economy to a market economy. We have chosen the  Western model in order to obtain a new quality of life. That  means breaking with a lot of things. Under the former system,  the Ukrainian economy was fully integrated into the Soviet  economy, of which it represented 20 percent. The division of  labor -- and not regional autonomy -- was the rule in the former  USSR. We were specialized in processing industries. Under such  conditions, how could we build up an independent economy?    [Girard] You have debts of 2.5 billion dollars to Russia.  This summer, the Russians had suggested that, in order to repay  them, you should sell your share of the Black Sea fleet. Now  they are calling for a share in Ukrainian companies. Do you  consider these demands to be justified?    [Kravchuk] We are going to set up mixed companies with a  capital open to foreign investors. It is only natural to have  industrial relations with Russia. Our companies need its oil,  gas, raw materials. In return, we can offer it our refining and  processing capacities. The two countries have everything on  which to build mutually rewarding industrial relations.</p>

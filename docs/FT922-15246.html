			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / UK Company News: Losses at Acsis rise to Pounds 4.5m as sales slump ACSIS GROUP, the nursing recruitment and sales promotion company, yesterday reported a further fall into the red but said the worst of its problems were now behind it. For 1991 the loss rose to Pounds 4.53m at the pre-tax level on sales nearly halved at Pounds 29m. Profits for the previous year amounted to Pounds 4.94m. Losses per share of 1.8p compared with earnings of 2.8p. The dividend is being omitted - the 1990 payment was cut to 0.4p. The group's banks, which last year agreed to reschedule Pounds 8m of its debt with the first repayment after three years, have to approve any dividend payment. The group has to hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss the fact that net assets have fallen below half its called-up share capital. The board plans to take no action. Mr Robert Ledger, finance director, said the group had traded profitably in the first quarter of this year. 'We are trying to rebuild the value of the company for the benefit of the shareholders and the banks,' he said. 'In three years time if we can treble the number of nurses recruited this business becomes extremely cash generative.' Mr Ephraim Barsam, the company's largest shareholder and a large creditor, is to become chairman at the annual meeting, replacing Mr Neil Balfour, who became acting non-executive chairman following the departure of South African Mr Darryl Phillips. Mr Ledger said that following the sale of certain businesses, more than half Acsis's sales this year would come from the nursing business which recruits English speaking nurses for the US market. Heavy expenditure on recruiting and training nurses last year should begin to produce additional revenues this year, Mr Ledger said.</p>

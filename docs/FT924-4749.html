			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Row focuses on two lives of Lamont THE HAZY divide between a cabinet minister's private and public life is at the centre of the political squabble over who should have paid the costs that Mr Norman Lamont incurred last year in evicting his tenant. The Treasury says it was right for the chancellor to have had financial help after the antics of his tenant appeared in the News of the World in April last year. Maintaining public confidence in his office justified the expense, in the view of Sir Peter Middleton, then Treasury permanent secretary, according to memos released yesterday. But Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said guidelines had been interpreted so widely that they could be used to resist 'almost every attack against any minister'. The chancellor had, in fact, brought in his own libel lawyer to protect his personal reputation, Mr Brown said. Supposedly defining the divide between costs incurred by ministers in their private and public capacities is guidance supplied to departmental permanent secretaries by the Treasury solicitors. The Cabinet Office took the unprecedented step yesterday of publishing an extract from that guidance. It says that, 'where the libel relates to the conduct of a minister in the performance of his official duties and it is in the public interest that proceedings should be brought, the minister may properly be indemnified out of public funds for the reasonable costs of bringing those proceedings'. Whitehall insiders confirmed yesterday that it is standard practice for ministers to use government lawyers when they believe newspapers are about to publish untrue allegations about their private lives. Other precedents, confirmed by the government, were help given to Lord (formerly Mr Nigel) Lawson when chancellor over legal proceedings brought following remarks he made about the Johnson Matthey Bank and to Lord Young as trade and industry secretary when challenged over his private interests in relation to the House of Fraser stores. In Mr Lamont's case - at least in the eyes of Labour - the distinction between public duty and private responsibility and the argument about using private lawyers are less clear. Certainly the Treasury believed Mr Lamont had a case. It initially proposed paying more than just Carter-Ruck and Partners' Pounds 4,700 bill for the initial press statement and handling press inquiries. A memo in May last year suggested also paying 'a share of the costs of the legal proceedings to secure the removal of an unsatisfactory tenant and all those associated with the application for an early hearing'. Mr Lamont said that memo came at Sir Peter Middleton's initiative. The offer of extra help had been diluted by the time Sir Terence Burns - his successor - approved the Pounds 4,700. A memo sent to the Treasury accounts branch in August last year said the sum had been approved 'on the grounds that it was important quickly to put the record straight so as to retain full confidence in the office of chancellor and its holder'. The Treasury said that a private lawyer was used because a statement had to be issued on the night the News of the World was printed and required specialist lawyers.</p>

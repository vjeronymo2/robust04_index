			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Schroders close to takeover of US affiliate in Dollars 150m deal Schroders, the UK merchant bank, is close to taking control of Wertheim Schroder, its US affiliate, in a deal approaching Dollars 150m (Pounds 102.7m). The takeover will give Schroders the biggest wholly-owned Wall Street investment banking business of any British merchant bank, leapfrogging SG Warburg, its main rival. Senior Schroders executives said execution of the deal was being delayed pending the formal settlement of a Dollars 375m suit against Wertheim by the Ames department store group. Agreement in principle has been reached for Wertheim to pay an estimated Dollars 19m to Ames to settle the proceedings, but the terms are subject to court approval. 'As soon as the case is settled, the takeover of Wertheim will take place,' a banker said. He added that Schroders would pay up to Dollars 150m for the 50 per cent of Wertheim's voting shares and 57.5 per cent of the preferred shares it did not already own. It bought half of Wertheim in 1986. Wertheim's managing partners hold the other 50 per cent of the voting shares, while Bank of Boston, Massachusetts Mutual Life and Mitsubishi Trust Bank each have small non-voting stakes equivalent to 4.9 per cent of the total equity. A senior Schroders director said: 'The deal will enable us to compete with the big boys in the US by controlling a US bank with a proven track record.' But another Schroders executive said that there were risks because the merchant bank was so different from Wertheim. The US firm is a securities trader, while Schroders has concentrated on investment management and giving advice to companies. Schroders' corporate clients also tend to be the biggest UK and European companies, whereas Wertheim specialises in medium-sized US businesses. The biggest source of tension, however, is likely to be remuneration, a banker said. 'The top guys at Wertheim earn over Dollars 1m, far more than Schroders' executives,' he said. The banker said he expected Schroders to reorganise the senior management of Wertheim soon after the takeover. Schroders has delayed the acquisition to avoid liability for damages from the Ames dispute. Ames accused Wertheim of breach of fiduciary duty, professional malpractice, unjust enrichment and other improper conduct relating to its work as adviser in Ames' Dollars 1.3bn purchase of the discount store division of Zayre Corporation in 1988. It alleged that it paid too much for the discount stores and that the highly leveraged takeover was largely responsible for financial difficulties which led Ames to seek Chapter 11 protection from its creditors in 1990. Ames has now emerged from Chapter 11 protection. The suit also alleged that Mr James Harmon, Wertheim's chairman who also headed the Ames board between January 1988 and June 1990, breached his fiduciary duty during the deal.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESCUER INVENTS BETTER WAYS TO SAVE LABOR, LIVES IN MOUNTAINS  </P> <P> If you have recently helped carry a 200-pound victim with a broken leg down a  narrow, rocky trail, you probably owe one to Russell Anderson.  </P> <P> Back in the days when being on a search-and-rescue team often meant tracking  victims down in the wilderness, then using sheer muscle to haul them out,  Anderson got to thinking. A longtime Sierra Madre Search and Rescue Team  member, Anderson is fit but not particularly muscular, and he has a bad back.  Hauling heavy loads in the mountains -- that's agony, he says.  </P> <P> "Hit a narrow spot in the trail, and only two guys can carry the litter. It  took a couple of gorillas," said Anderson, 56, a slim, talkative man, with  short gray hair cut into what he calls an "Ollie North."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Looked for Solutions  </P> <P> So Anderson, who operates a tree service out of his Sierra Madre home, started  looking for solutions. What if, Anderson wondered, he could fit a wheel to a  standard Stokes litter and turn the wire stretcher device into a kind of  backcountry wheelbarrow? Somebody had once tried rigging a bicycle wheel to a  litter, of course. But it tended to veer out of control on the rough spots.  Unless it was being used on a paved road, the device was useless.  </P> <P> Anderson disappeared into the little machine shop he has equipped behind his  garage, and, a few days later, he came out with the Russ Anderson litter wheel.  It was a fat wheel from an all-terrain vehicle, about two feet in diameter with  thick rubber cleats, and it was fastened to an aluminum clamp, which could be  easily slipped onto the bottom slats of the litter.  </P> <P> It worked phenomenally well, Anderson's admirers say.  </P> <P> In the 11 years since Anderson developed the idea, the litter wheel has become  an indispensable item in the arsenal of mountain rescue equipment. "We couldn't  do without it," said Arnold Gaffrey, a Sierra Madre team member and a past  president of the Mountain Rescue Assn., a national umbrella organization for  rescue squads. "It's taken a back-breaking job and made it a do-able job."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aversion to Hard Labor  </P> <P> Ever since he first fell in love with the wilderness about 40 years ago,  Anderson has been combining a brilliant grasp of mechanics and an aversion to  hard labor to come up with labor-saving or lifesaving mountaineering equipment.  </P> <P> Six years ago, the Seattle Manufacturing Co. made a deal with Anderson, who  never went past high school, to market his ideas.  </P> <P> Now all Anderson has to do is gather in the royalties (modest ones, he insists)  and come up with new ideas.  </P> <P> They seem to come in a steady stream. "Every time I'm out there, either  backpacking or working on a rescue operation, I'm always dreaming about how to  make the equipment better or simpler," he said. "Any money I make is kind of  secondary."  </P> <P> Things seem to get miraculously transformed under Anderson's pensive gaze,  fellow rescue team members say. An ice ax, a standard mountain climbing device,  suddenly acquires a rubber hand grip at one end. The Stokes litter gets broken  into two easily-packed parts that can be reattached in the field. A winch used  for hauling victims up mountain sides is mounted on a custom-built platform.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Array of Pulleys  </P> <P> By now, the pieces of equipment manufactured with the Russ Anderson stamp  include an array of sturdy but lightweight mountaineering pulleys, an "edge  roller" to reduce the friction on ropes being pulled over rocky outcroppings,  and a specially modified "figure-8 descender," which helps to reduce accidents  to climbers or rescuers while they are rappelling down ropes.  </P> <P> Anderson builds the prototypes in his shop, which includes metal lathes and a  milling machine, and ships them to Seattle for mass production. The products  are sold either through catalogue orders or in mountaineering specialty shops.  </P> <P> "He's been among the most influential innovators of technical rescue equipment  in the United States," said Tom Vines, the Montana-based editor of Response  Magazine, published by the National Assn. for Search and Rescue. "He's not only  developed new technology but he's taken previously existing technology and  brought it to the point where it's easier to use and safer for the user."  </P> <P> Anderson reacts to such kudos with embarrassment. "You go to a national  conference with him," said Steve Millenbach, president of the Sierra Madre  rescue team, "and you hear people saying, 'God, you're Russ Anderson?' and Russ  will say, 'Oh, me?' "  </P> <P> </P> <P> Consults His Friends  </P> <P> Anderson often consults fellow team members and friends on his inventions, he  acknowledges -- people like Norman Batterson, an aerospace researcher who  belongs to the Altadena Search and Rescue Team. And he uses ideas that come  from mountaineering or outdoorsman's lore, Anderson said.  </P> <P> "I've copied concepts that have been used for years," Anderson insists.  </P> <P> Copied and modified. Take the figure-8 descender. This is a device designed to  exert friction on a rope so that a climber, rappelling down a cliff or out of a  helicopter, won't lose control of his descent. The problem with earlier  versions of the device was that the rope tended to slip around the sides and  lock into a knot called the girth hitch.  </P> <P> "I've seen it happen three or four times," Vines said. "It usually happens when  your weight shifts while you're rappelling over a sharp edge, like a helicopter  skid." The climber's only recourse is to shimmy back up the rope, taking his  weight off the figure-8, and slip the rope back into position, often while  dangling a hundred feet in the air.  </P> <P> But Anderson built his own version of the figure-8, based on a concept  developed in Great Britain. He put "ears" on the device, prongs which prevented  the rope from slipping. "It added a degree of safety to the job that we never  had before," Gaffrey said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Got Nature Bug Early  </P> <P> Anderson got the nature bug as a teen-ager. One of his teachers in South  Pasadena, Robert Franklin Leslie (who later achieved some renown as the writer  of such children's nature books as "The Bears and I" and "In the Shadow of a  Rainbow") invited him on a 220-mile trek along the John Muir Trail in the  Sierra Nevada. It was an inspiring 24-day experience for the 16-year-old  Anderson.  </P> <P> "I got all fired up about mountaineering," he said.  </P> <P> In those days, outdoor clothing was made of wool and cotton, instead of the  tightly woven lightweight synthetics like Gore-Tex that outdoorsmen use  nowadays. And mountaineering equipment tended to be unwieldy and burdensome.  </P> <P> But Anderson was an innovator from the start. He and Leslie, using military  surplus materials, built their own lightweight pack racks for the Sierra trip.  "Those were probably some of the first aluminum pack racks," he said. "Too bad  we didn't get a patent on them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rocket Test Technician  </P> <P> Anderson graduated from the high school branch of Pasadena Junior College (now  Pasadena City College), went to work for an assembly plant and ended up as a  rocket test technician for Aerojet General in Azusa.  </P> <P> In 1964 he joined the Altadena Search and Rescue Team. In 1975 he switched to  the Sierra Madre team, in what has now been his hometown for 21 years.  </P> <P> "When I was with Aerojet, there was always a lot of standing-around time," he  said. "I always had some little project I was working on."  </P> <P> Pretty soon, Anderson developed the reputation as a can-do sort of team member  as well as a level head in rescue operations, said Miner Harkness, the  59-year-old patriarch of the Sierra Madre team. "He's very calm and cool,"  Harkness said . "He just goes along at the same level. All hell can be coming  down on you, and Russ'll be there."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anderson Tree Service  </P> <P> In 1968, Anderson started Anderson Tree Service, most of whose operations are  overseen today by his 30-year-old son Gary. "It's a lot more fun coming out  here after a leisurely breakfast," said Anderson, sitting in his sunny back  yard, with a cactus garden and citrus trees drooping with fruit, "and fiddling  around in the shop than working on an 8-to-5 job. That would kill me."  </P> <P> Running his own business has also given Anderson more time to respond to rescue  calls. His house is about four blocks from the rescue team's garage and a short  drive to the team's main field of operation, the San Gabriel Mountains. Because  of his mechanical aptitude, Anderson has unofficially been placed in charge of  the team's two vehicles.  </P> <P> Anderson, whose shop is stuffed with logs of rare wood that he collects while  pruning trees, is working on some new mountaineering devices, he said. But for  the moment, he is keeping them under wraps. The competition might be listening.  "There's not a whole lot of competition," he said. "But there's some."  </P> <P> His fellow team members wait with more than just a passing interest. "The  things he comes up with are important stuff," Harkness said. "It just makes  life a lot easier."  </P></p>

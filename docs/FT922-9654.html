			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Campaign to swap debt for drugs aid gathers pace: The third world has told UN it cannot afford the fight against narcotics A LARGE group of third world countries has told the United Nations they cannot afford to fund the fight against drugs. They want to swap some of their international debt to help pay for combating illicit drug growing, production, trafficking and abuse. The move is being opposed by most developed nations, particularly the US and Britain, which regard third world debt as a bilateral matter between individual borrowers and lenders, not as something on which the UN can act collectively. They also say the global fight against drugs and drug-related crime is embedded in international treaties which all nations have a duty to implement. Their efforts cannot be made conditional. Nevertheless, the UN is being forced to investigate and develop the 'debt-for-drugs' concept after Bolivia, Colombia, Egypt, Nigeria and Peru this month forced a motion through the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna. Nigeria acted on behalf of the Group of 77, the third world's counterweight to the smaller, but more powerful, grouping of developed nations. The Group of 77 is gradually increasing its representation on the commissions and committees that formulate UN policy, so as to have a voting majority wherever it can. The UN International Drug Control Programme, which gets most of its Dollars 100m-plus budget from the US, Japan Australia and east European countries, has to report back to the commission in 12 months on making the debt-for-drugs concept work. One idea canvassed is for some government-to-government debt to be converted into local currency, forgiven but frozen in place, and the former interest payments diverted into anti-drug projects. Bolivia is being suggested for a pilot scheme with some of its Dollars 200m debt to US agencies retired for the purpose. A parallel is being drawn with 'debt-for-environment' schemes which UN and other agencies are also exploring. Here, third world countries can agree, for example, not to clear areas of rain forest in exchange for debts being forgiven. However, opponents of the debt-for-drugs idea say the parallel is false. The debt-for-environment swap would work through a value being placed on a section of rain forest not being developed and being designated a conservation area or international nature park. This would turn it into an asset for the country concerned, making money-earning development, such as tourism, possible. Debt-for-drugs is being seen as more like blackmail because international crime and widespread corruption are involved. At best, countries with debts would be tempted to let their anti-drug performance deteriorate so as to force a debt-for-drugs agreement on the international community. Illicit drug producers could then simply transfer operations over the nearest border, thus compounding the problem in a neighbouring country and encouraging debt-for-drugs swaps there. The UN already has experience of unexpected side effects from anti-drug initiatives. When it started crop substitution programmes, some farmers started growing opium for the first time in order to qualify for the subsidies that then enabled them to switch back to their original crops. The Group of 77 nations says, however, that diverting already scarce resources into fighting drug cultivation, reduction, trafficking and abuse strains the countries' national economies. At the same time, debt burdens diminish their ability to promote alternative economic development to persuade people away from the easy money drugs provide. There is also a view in the UN that much third world debt is never going to be repaid anyway, so debt-for-drugs would at least give the developed world some benefit from writing off what is in effect dead money. However, the 'blackmail' connotations have already registered strongly with several developed nations. This is thought likely to make some of them wary of channelling money to UN agencies, using instead bilateral agreements with individual third world countries, with close monitoring of the anti-drug projects involved. Illust. Specially chosen Guarijos Indian troops carry out a drugs search in the Colombian town of Riohacha, but they are failing to keep pace with the traffickers</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIGHT FOR DISABLED -- HE MAKES IT HIS BUSINESS  </P> <P> There are parties that Ed Tessier doesn't go to, plays he can't see, guest  lectures he won't hear.  </P> <P> It's because the events aren't accessible to wheelchairs.  </P> <P> Some people might just accept that and move on. But not the 21-year-old  Tessier, who was left a quadriplegic by an accident at age 16.  </P> <P> He decided to do something about it -- and make some money in the bargain.  </P> <P> Three days a week, the Pomona College student leaves campus for an office in  Pomona, the home of Designs for Independence, a nonprofit corporation he  founded 1 1/2 years ago. There, he doles out information and advice to  businesses, private homeowners and schools on how to make buildings more  accessible to the handicapped.  </P> <P> "There's a real gap between knowing the code and how best to apply it," Tessier  said, sitting behind a desk stacked with state and federal building code  requirements. "I quickly learned I had a point of view the building industry  wasn't familiar with. I could learn their lingo and translate my practical  expertise into practical suggestions."  </P> <P> Tessier said he has learned that "the biggest thing that can sell the business  community to wheelchair access is that access means good business. There are 43  million Americans with disabilities, the largest portion of whom live in  California. The ones wanting to get ahead in this game are the ones that are  going to get the business."  </P> <P> After enrolling in college in 1986, Tessier was struck by how many places were  closed to wheelchair users: bookstores, government offices, fraternity parties,  dormitories. He soon became an active member of several disabled-rights groups.  Now, he chairs the Committee on Disability in Claremont, which has awarded him  a grant to study accessibility issues in the city.  </P> <P> His involvement in the community, coupled with the founding of Designs for  Independence, led to his being awarded Time magazine's College Achievement  Award in April. It is given each year to 20 juniors in North America.  </P> <P> Sometimes, Tessier said, clients will shun his advice and go with a cheaper,  less reliable plan -- for example, wheelchair lifts instead of elevators -- or  no access plan at all. Although ignoring access codes might be grounds for a  suit, Tessier said, he refrains from threatening the company because he is  playing the role of professional consultant, not of activist.  </P> <P> "When a firm decides not to do the legal minimum there's a real conflict of  interest," he said. "I feel ethically I can't use the knowledge against them at  that time. But if that lack of access becomes an issue later on, if there's an  accident for example, I'll be the first to offer my information."  </P></p>

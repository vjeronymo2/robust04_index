			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Kim Song-sik, MAL Editorial Board member: "Outlook on </F> Phase-Two Reform Fronts Uncertain"]    [Text] President Kim declared the "continuation of  change and reform to strengthen the nation's competitiveness."  But bureaucrats continue the foot-dragging while the public  sentiment shifts from expectation to indifference. Where can  creative energy for transcending the "Kim Yong-sam-style reform"  be found, and how?    Phase One of the Kim Yong-sam administration saw the  civilian  president lead the way with reforms based on his initiative and  carry out the shifting of power within the ruling group to form  a new clique. Also in this period, we saw a political world  making little change in both players and in their performance,  the vested interest groups persisting in obstinate resistance,  the bureaucrats continuing the foot-dragging, and the public  mood shifting, psychologically, from expectation to  indifference. The first-year reforms, while proving successful  in various sectors, demonstrated the limitations in strength and  vision. As they encountered the "upheavals from the blitz" and  the "post-Uruguay Round political crisis," the need for a  turnabout in the atmosphere proved to be inevitable.    As for President Kim, he must be hoping that his second year  will be a period for him to expand reforms he launched and, at  the same time, to prepare for major elections to be held  successively, beginning in 1995. Consequently, the president is  expected to maintain his initiative through continued reforms in  specific sectors, such as those in the political,  administrative, educational and other sectors, rather than the  sort of reforms that accompany the shifting of power, and at the  same time to put emphasis on internationalization and the  revitalization of the economy. In political management, he will  try to remove elements of political harassment and to  focus--through a working-type staff--on intensifying his  administrative push. On the other hand, the overall enhancement  of economic logic will result in increased pressures on the  workers.    Kim Yong-sam's decision, announced in the New Year news  conference held on 6 January, to postpone the national  convention of the Democratic Liberal Party [DLP] was a  multipurpose card. In connection with the postponement, media  described it as if it had added to the importance of Kim  Chong-pil, DLP chairman. As for Kim Chong-pil, however, who is a  veteran politician, he must have sensed that it meant nothing  more than an extension of his unstable political status, for the  deferment deprived him of an opportunity to bolster his  influence through a reelection. Furthermore, the decision seeks  to prevent the election of a new party chairman from triggering  a full-blown power struggle within the DLP, and the formation of  a new party leadership from weakening the president's  centripetal power. Thus, Kim Yong-sam sees a political  realignment--in whatever form--as premature.    The simple patch-up work with the DLP shows President Kim's  will to continue his way of political management relying on  Chongwadae staff and cabinet members. The DLP national  convention was put off, ostensibly, for "sustained changes and  reforms to build up the nation's economic strength." It actually  is a move designed not only to suppress elements of political  harassment within the DLP but to neutralize offensives from the  opposition, thereby enhancing the cohesiveness of the executive  power of the president. Needless to say, how it will work out is  another question.    The underlying tone was in evidence in the way the party and  cabinet reshuffles were carried out. The late-December  reshuffles and changes of Chongwadae staff could be viewed as  the deployment to forward positions of figures close to  President Kim and personalities of the new regime. They included  Choe Hyong-u, minister of home affairs; Kim U-sok, minister of  construction; So Chong-won, first minister of state; Yi  Won-chong, senior presidential secretary for political affairs,  and Mun Chong-su, a member of the former Democratic Party [DP]  faction in the DLP who was appointed DLP secretary general. Also  included were many promoted from among Phase-One staff members  such as Yi Hoe-chang, who was appointed prime minister; Chong  Chae-sok, director of the Economic Planning Board; Hwang  Yong-ha, minister of government administration; Yi Pyong-tae,  minister of national defense, and Kim Yang-pae, minister of  agriculture and fisheries. An overall view of this new,  Phase-Two lineup--including those retained from the previous  lineup such as Pak Kwan-yong, Chongwadae secretary  general--suggests that it is not a compromise arrangement but a  measure giving priority to a setup that puts Kim Yong-sam more  strongly in charge for an effective exercise of power.    Also, the party and cabinet reshuffles seem to be aimed at  straightening out the present bureaucratic system. The changes  in administrative posts such as the new Home Affairs Minister  Choe Hyong-u, Government Administration Minister Hwang Yong-ha,  and Yi Ui-kun, senior presidential secretary for administrative  affairs, can be seen as a step to deal with the foot-dragging by  bureaucrats and prepare for the gubernatorial and mayoral  elections scheduled for next year. While President Kim is  expected to take some actions for administrative reforms too, as  he suggested in his New Year news conference, he seems to be  also planning to use the local elections for a major step to  correct the hardened arteries of the nation's officialdom.    Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that Assemblyman Kim Tok-yong,  previously regarded as an influential person, was placed on  "political probation." While it is in part an aspect of the  power game within the DP faction, the development demonstrates  President Kim's firm will to tolerate no potential elements that  could weaken the president's power. Assemblyman Kim Tok-yong's  comeback is of course possible but the fact that his associates,  including some personalities of the 6.3 generation, were left  out from the new lineup are full of suggestions, in many ways.    Put simply, through the reshuffles and the decision to  postpone the DLP national convention, the president let his  strong will not to let go of his political centripetal power and  his political initiative be known. However, the moves were  passive and defensive ones in nature, rather than positive and  offensive. As some called it "the DP-faction regime," they were  tantamount to rearrangements of the line of battle inside the  closed circuits of the president's men.    The moves were made against the backdrops of the  successes--and limitations--of reforms that were pushed on last  year, and of the sociopolitical dynamical relationships as  unveiled in that process. The series of reforms carried out in  1993 were in fact remarkably successful for the original  limitations surrounding the regime, thanks largely to the will  of the president and expectations of the people. Powers were  restructured through the public disclosures of property owned by  high officials, the successive audit-and-inspection probes, the  by-elections, the rush of personnel changes, as well as the  presidential decree outlawing the uses of aliases or borrowed  names in financial transactions; as a result, President Kim  succeeded in dismantling the political military leadership that  had been the core of power in this country. However, except for  securing power in the very core of government and implementing  partial reshuffles in several departments, he failed to deliver  fundamental reorganizations of power and politics. The fate of  the probe into property owned by public officials that ended in  an anticlimax, and the proposed amendments to political laws  that failed to be acted on, demonstrated this reality  symbolically.    President Kim, preparing for his second year in power under  such circumstances, had these options: arriving at some  power-sharing compromises with the vested interest groups; on  the contrary, bringing in pro-reform forces from outside to  expand his reform hegemony; or putting off such political  maneuvers until the political season of candidate endorsing for  the scheduled elections and, for now, strengthening his direct  exercise of power through aides close to him. He chose the last  option, as seen in the party and cabinet reshuffles. The action  is, of course, based on the consideration that this is the only  election-free year of his tenure, but it also reflects the  present situation where the power balance is not in favor of an  immediate settlement of a political deadlock and where the time  is not ripe for it either. In the final analysis, the recent  reshuffles were made not in the direction of expanding the  reform hegemony, involving either vested interest groups or  pro-reform forces, but took the form of placing the president's  men in forward positions; therefore, it became difficult to  expect an expansion, horizontal or downward, of the power base.  This also means that there will come a time sooner or later when  the existing human resources for replacements will be exhausted.  Considering these factors, it is more appropriate to view the  recent reshuffles as a passive defense of the existing front  than as an expression of President Kim's self-confidence.    It can be said that Phase One was dedicated, basically, to  political reforms to liquidate military rule and  authoritarianism, reforms to end irrationalities in the  financial and other branches, and to the New Growth economic  line. The broad framework defining the nature and depth of  future reforms is not likely to surpass that of the Phase One  program. However, things noteworthy will be: In his push for  administrative and educational reforms, how successful will the  president be in overcoming the reactions of the vested  interested groups? And what kind of social tensions will the  pressures on the workers from various internationalization  programs create? Some observe that a breakthrough in North-South  Korea relations may emerge as a political factor; however, while  there may come some partial improvements in relations, it is  difficult to expect an epoch-making change. After all, the speed  and intensity of specific reforms will be fluid, not fixed,  depending on the outcome of competition and cooperation between  the forces involved. Although big-size reforms on the  second-year agenda will be fewer than in the first year, the  offensive and defensive battles will intensify between forces  over specific reforms--and over how the turf boundaries, left  ambiguous by the first-year reforms, should be reestablished.    I referred, in the opening part of this article, to the  political world with little change, with the same players  playing in the same fashion, be it the ruling camp or the  opposition; the obstinate resistance of the vested interest  groups; the continued foot-dragging of bureaucrats, and to the  mood of the public shifting psychologically from expectation to  indifference. Over the period from the Yellow Sea ferry disaster  to the furor over the opening of the rice market, we saw  President Kim's initiative running into difficulties everywhere,  and a strange mood of indifference proliferating in public  opinion. It can be said that the Phase One reforms actually  entered a new critical stage immediately after the financial  reform--"the reform of all reforms"--was put into effect.    As asserted by many, it is true that this situation  basically  stemmed from the limitations inherent in the Kim Yong-sam  government, but such rhetoric alone cannot solve the problem. In  fact, we see more fundamental limitations with the reform  capabilities and the vision of our whole society, do we not?  Debates merely highlighting "the limitations of the president"  can be a way of political offensive but they do not serve the  purpose of finding a way for true, in-depth reforms. And it is  the task of history unaffected by personal interests of any  individuals that our society needs overall reforms and that they  have to be more thoroughgoing ones than the Kim Yong-sam-style  reforms. Criticisms against the ruling party can be effective  only when backed up by counterproposals superior to theirs  instead of indulging in faultfinding. A look at the various  difficulties confronting the reform program shows that we cannot  afford to sweep everything under the carpet by blaming it on the  "original sin of the three-party merger" and that we ourselves  have a great deal of homework to do, namely, self-reforms in  various fields.    So, we will examine a few points in this respect, from the  viewpoint of how to revitalize the reform capabilities of the  entire society, let alone the conservative, vested interest  groups whose ears are "deaf to any preaching."    Let's begin with problems inside the civil society. De  Tocqueville and many scholars after him maintained that the  civil society is the very stronghold of democracy. Despite  degrees of difference, the latest line of debate on democracy  basically holds that we should revitalize the independent,  critical energy of civil society and intervene in the coming  onslaught of the logic of power and economy with the principle  of democracy, forcefully and to the maximum degree.    Democratization has become the general trend since the June  Uprising despite turns and twists. Progress in democratization  means the process of ending the suffocation of civil society at  the hands of state power. As democracy advances, the days of  almighty state power are fading into the past, giving way to an  era in which the civil society has a distinct role of checking  antireform reactions of the vested interest groups.    However, our civil society today lies in a state of "too  much  money power and too little citizen power." In other words,  vacancies created by the retreating state power are being filled  not by the sound citizen power but by the exorbitant money  power. Furthermore, forums and media are largely in the grip of  established journalism which is weak in its consciousness of  history and not positive for reform (and is even conservative).  The logic of citizens for establishing their autonomous,  collective identity is suffocating under the pressures of  parochialism and built-in connections, which make rational  judgment itself impossible. The creative energy of citizens is  far from being revitalized.    Viewing the present situation in this light, we find that  the  overall strengthening of the reform fronts through self-reforms  of the civil society and struggles against the vested interest  groups entrenched in it, along with the unity of the sound  energy of the civil society, is our major task. And social  movements, precisely, provide opportunities for positive  demonstrations of the autonomous energy and critical power of  the civil society. There is a need to further develop diverse  citizen movements, including environmental, consumer, women's,  civic legislation, media reform, human rights, watch-parliament,  and political reform movements and movements for economic  justice, as well as the traditional mass movements such as labor  and peasant movements. To that end, the government should lift  not only economic controls but also various other restraints on  social movements.    At the same time, each social movement should make  self-reforms to ensure support and participation by a majority  of the people. This process involves the abilities of  self-reflection and solidarity, including those to reexamine  one's own vision, stamp out factional vestiges, renew the sense  of responsibility toward the state and the times, and to wage  criticism backed up by alternatives. Also, it is necessary to do  away with the way of thinking that what a certain person says or  what a certain group does is always right or always wrong, and  to develop maturity in perception so that we can weigh any  specific position on its merit. In particular, it is important  in this period of transition that in countering the resistance  of vested interest groups, we actively focus on pending reform  issues.    Without changes in the political power and political camps,  social movements alone have their limitations, in many ways.  Speaking of political camps, the problems are far more serious.  Earlier in this article, I pointed out that President Kim  employed a stop-gap policy toward the ruling camp to preserve  his centripetal power.    The opposition party did the same thing. While the viability  of Chairman Yi Ki-taek and his faction in the Democratic Party  remains a question, it also appears difficult for the  increasingly visible "nonmainstream alliance," led by  Assemblyman Kim Sang-hyon and Supreme Committee members Yi  Pu-yong and No Mu-hyon, to free itself from the magnetic field  of Kim Tae-chung, the former party chairman. Thus, the two-Kim  era is still on. With a view to keeping their own political  influence from being weakened, the two Kims are deliberately  preventing a new leadership from emerging. To make it worse, the  TK [Taegu-Kyongsang] force says it will carry on the "Taegu  sentiment," while the Sinjong Party of Assemblyman Pak  Chan-chong is trying to take advantage of anti-DLP,  anti-Democratic Party feelings and fish in troubled waters. From  all this, we can reconfirm a political world in which reforms  are being stalled because of the same old regional political  turfs. The Kim Yong-sam administration has entered its second  year, with no change at all in this respect.    A political landscape like this renders it impossible to  promote a productive competition between a reform plan and its  alternative. President Kim emphatically stated that his  administration will seek justice based on facts and promote  pragmatic well-being. For now, success with the policies is  difficult to expect, however. They are bound to end up in  unproductive skirmishes between political forces; moreover, they  will basically impede the development of a desirable public  opinion structure in our society. Furthermore, the continued  presence of the regional political turfs means that there will  be unopposed elections in many districts once candidates obtain  party endorsements. Government for the people is simply  impossible under such circumstances. It also means that the  rooms are extremely narrow for both the ruling and opposition  camps to bring in fresh forces from outside. This would even  disrupt the normal relationships among the state, the political  communities and the civil society, and we will see only reports  of the political sphere's foul power games fill up the pages of  the media. As long as that sort of situation continues, the  nonresponse of the majority of our people to President Kim's  reform program--and to the activities of the political  world--will also continue.    The nation's political sector remains least competitive of  all in this era of internationalization. The problem is that the  range of possible reform within the established political world  is extremely narrow. This raises the question: Should we remain  a spectator to the power games that continue to be waged over  parochial interests--or pry the established political world with  a lever of realignment from outside? The civil society is indeed  faced with the dual tasks to further elevate the levels of its  movements on one hand and, on the other, to form new political  forces to usher in a truly new era. This is not to say that the  established political world should be shunned in its entirety,  but that there is a need to first establish a leadership to  speed up its reforms and changes and lead it in a desirable  direction.    What is truly needed at this point of time is a challenge  and  practice to bring an end to the era of epigones, rather than  commentaries on the same old things. If we should seek a career  in the shadow of existing authority or be content with peace  within our private castle, we can neither open the horizon of  reform forcefully nor produce a dignified political leadership  worthy of a transition period. The need to transcend the era of  epigones is not confined to political practices. The roaring  tide of the transition period demands that the administration,  the legislature, the judicature, businesses, schools, research  institutes, media, citizen movements and all other organizations  launch sweeping reform drives. The political world may be adrift  as it is, but our society, having no surpluses of time and  resources, cannot afford to delay those reforms in any specific  sectors. In conclusion, let me add that I firmly believe that  each and every sector has its reformists with true passions.</p>

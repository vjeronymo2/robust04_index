			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / World Trade News: Brittan bangs drum for E European trade TWO-WAY trade between the European Community and its eastern neighbours must not falter because of recession in western Europe, Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said yesterday, writes Lionel Barber in Copenhagen. He was speaking at a conference on economic development in central and eastern Europe organised by the Danish government. But Bulgarian, Czech and Hungarian delegations from among the 30 countries present complained that EC promises of more liberal trade jarred with the EC's one-month ban on imports of live animals, meat, milk and dairy products from across eastern Europe. Mr Geza Jeszenszky, Hungarian foreign minister, said the embargo was 'entirely unwarranted' and 'it smacks of a most regretable survival of the notion of an eastern bloc'. Sir Leon avoided reference to the ban, but spoke of 'misguided perception' that western industries needed special protection from artificially privatised state companies in eastern Europe. 'This approach is as disloyal to our eastern European partners as it is to the facts.' He himself was isolated within the Commission earlier this year when he appealed for a more generous approach to trade with eastern Europe, but he won some concessions from member states. Yesterday he promised to use the EC's anti-dumping measures only against 'genuine breaches' of multilateral trading standards. According to a draft of the conference's final commnique, the EC and Efta pledge to open up markets progressively, but only on a 'mutually advantageous basis'. It also urges the east European countries to re-inforce trade relations between themselves and the former Soviet Union. The EC runs a trade surplus of Dollars 1.3bn (Pounds 860m) with Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech and Slovak republics.</p>

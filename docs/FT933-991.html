			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Cookery: Food to warm the hearts of Britain - Philippa Davenport cooks comfort foods for autumnal evenings WHEN EVENINGS begin to draw in and bonfire smoke gives way to ground frost in the garden, a yearning for comfort foods begins. Game pies and stews make splendidly meaty offerings when the game season gets properly under way. In the meantime my thoughts turn to less carnivorous dishes. Regional recipes such as Dublin Coddle, Pan Haggerty and Anglesey Eggs clearly lack sophistication but, like hot water bottles and vests, their aim is not glamour but to supply feelings of wellbeing. That said, Anglesey Eggs is a more refined dish than the ingredients list suggests. It is sufficiently filling to satisfy a family for supper, but not solidly stuffing. In fact it could be served to lunchtime guests. Two things keep it delicate: a sauce that is silky, not a heavy wallpaper paste, and the lightness of the puree, which stems from a high ratio of leeks to potato. ANGLESEY EGGS (serves four) Quails' eggs are fiddly to peel but two dozen of them nestling in the puree make a pretty alternative to hens' eggs. 1lb floury potatoes; 6 leeks (or more as needed to yield 1 1/2 lb after trimming); 6 eggs; 3oz butter; 1 tablespoon flour;  1/2 pt gold top milk; freshly grated nutmeg; 2-3oz Cheddar cheese; a spoonful or two of breadcrumbs (optional). Peel the potatoes, and clean and slice the leeks, tender green parts as well as whites. Boil the potatoes and steam the leeks over them, cooking both vegetables until they are well softened. Forget about al dente in this instance. Whizz the leeks in a food processor with 2oz butter to make a sloppy green puree. Mash the potatoes, season them lavishly and beat in the leeks. Make a sauce with the remaining 1oz butter, the flour and the milk. Let it simmer for 10 minutes then flavour it with salt, lots of pepper and nutmeg and 2oz grated cheese. While the sauce cooks, hard-boil the eggs, shell and quarter them. Spoon the puree into a ring in a baking dish. Pile the eggs into the centre of the nest (sometimes I scatter snippets of ham among them) and pour the sauce over them. Sprinkle on the remaining 1oz grated Cheddar (or a few spoonfuls of breadcrumbs) and bake at 400F (200C) gas mark 6 for 10 minutes or so until bubbling hot. PAN HAGGERTY (serves four/six) Rosti, crique and other potato cakes are much enjoyed in fashionable circles, so why not our own Northumbrian version? The richness of this dish calls for a large green salad afterwards. A mixture of faintly bitter chicory, frizzy endive and peppery watercress is particularly good. 2lb potatoes; 3/4 lb onions; 6oz mature farm-made Cheddar cheese; 4 tablespoons fat (beef dripping is traditional, butter and bacon fat are also good). Chop the onions finely and let them fry gently in two tablespoons of fat in a very heavy based (or non-stick) frying pan about 11-12in in diameter while you peel and thinly slice the potatoes and grate the cheese. Away from the heat, lift the onions from the pan. Add a little more fat to the pan and spread half the potatoes over the base. Season them well, lay the onions over them and cover with the cheese. Finally spread the rest of the potatoes over the top, seasoning well as before. Cover the pan (a double-thick sheet of foil makes a good lid) and steam-fry over a fairly low flame for, say, 30-35 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Remove the foil and turn up the heat towards the end to drive off most of the moisture and to brown the underside of the potato cake. Brush the surface of the potatoes with a little fat and slip the pan under a hot grill to brown the top well. DUBLIN CODDLE (serves four/six) This is said to have been a favourite dish of Dean Swift. Some cooks use milk instead of water, which makes for a richer sauce, though the texture can appear a little curdled. The proper accompaniments are soda bread and stout. 1lb sausages; 1/4 lb thick cut streaky bacon; 2 onions; 2lb waxy potatoes; a bay leaf and a bunch of parsley. Dice the bacon and cook it gently until the fat begins to run. Remove it and stir in the chopped onion. Five minutes later add the sausages. Turn them to coat them with fat. Return the bacon to the pot, add the potatoes cut into chunks, the bay leaf, a couple of spoonfuls of chopped parsley and a good grinding of pepper, but no salt. Pour on water to come just level with the top. Bring swiftly to simmering point and stew gently (on the hob or in the oven) with the lid slightly askew for at least 45 minutes until the ingredients are very tender but not falling apart, and the 'gravy' is reduced and well flavoured. Lift out the solids and boil down the liquid at the end if there is too much. Sprinkle with extra parsley and adjust seasoning to taste.</p>

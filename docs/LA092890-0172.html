			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LINCOLN S&amp;L STILL BIG LOSER: 2ND QUARTER OFF BY $163 MILLION  </P> <P> Nearly 18 months after federal regulators seized Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan,  the thrift is continuing to lose big bucks. In the second quarter, the  insolvent thrift posted a second-quarter net loss of $163.9 million.  </P> <P> The loss, revealed in a quarterly report thrift regulators released Thursday,  puts the S&amp;L's loss at $327.3 million for the first six months this year  ended June 30.  </P> <P> Since federal regulators seized the thrift in April, 1989, Lincoln has reported  losses of $1.3 billion, most of it attributed to write-downs they say prior  owners should have made.  </P> <P> Lincoln's deteriorating condition raises questions about how much its failure  may ultimately cost taxpayers and why the government has been unable to sell,  close or otherwise resolve problems of the troubled institution.  </P> <P> Regulators, who refused to comment Thursday, have said the thrift's collapse  will cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2 billion, making it one of the most  expensive thrift failures ever. Its collapse has been attributed to risky junk  bond investments and real estate projects.  </P> <P> The failure has prompted numerous criminal investigations and civil lawsuits.  Charles H. Keating Jr., former chairman of American Continental Corp.,  Lincoln's parent company, was indicted last week on 42 counts of securities  fraud stemming from the thrift's failure. He is being held on $5-million bail  in Los Angeles County Jail.  </P> <P> The quarterly report shows that Lincoln, whose 29 branches are still open, is  paying $50 million more to cover deposit rates than it collects from the rates  it charges on its loans. In addition, regulators have listed $924 million in  mainly construction and land loans as slow-paying, overdue loans and have said  $626.9 million more in similar assets simply aren't paying.  </P> <P> The losses, industry experts said, may simply be part of running what was once  an institution with $5.3 billion in assets, invested mostly in risky projects  such as undeveloped Arizona land and junk bonds. Lincoln's assets at the end of  June were $2.6 billion.  </P> <P> "If we think the losses are eventually going to be $2 billion, then what we're  seeing is loss recognition on the installment basis," said Bert Ely, an  Alexandria, Va., industry consultant and analyst.  </P> <P> For others, though, the skyrocketing losses are evidence of the government's  ineptitude at running businesses.  </P> <P> "They just keep writing down assets. That's how they keep losing money," said  James J. Feder, lead counsel for American Continental in Phoenix.  </P> <P> Feder, who is in charge of the company's legal affairs while it is in  bankruptcy, said regulators have been compromising troubled loans, settling for  less than their true value and writing off the balance as a loss.  </P> <P> In another matter, Feder said the firm has reached a general agreement with  regulators and creditors on a public statement that would disclose how American  Continental would be liquidated. A federal judge in Phoenix indicated this week  that he would approve the statement.  </P> <P> Once the statement goes out, U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby then must  approve the liquidation plan itself.  </P> <P> American Continental is expected to object to certain provisions in the  liquidation plan, but Feder predicted that Bilby would approve a plan by the  end of November.  </P> <P> American Continental liquidation value is no more than $30 million, Feder  estimated. Most of that would come from recoveries on lawsuits the company  would file, including one against lawyers and accountants for $12 million in  fees paid during the year before the company's collapse.  </P> <P> In a related ruling Wednesday, Bilby approved a partial settlement in lawsuits  filed by small investors of American Continental debt securities. Settlements  totaling $24.3 million will be paid by two law firms accused of helping Keating  deceive investors about the company's financial condition. The amount  represents less than 10% of the more than $250 million investors lost.  </P> <P> * RELATED STORY: D5  </P></p>

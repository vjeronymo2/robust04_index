			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTUMN OF A DICTATOR  </P> <P> Most readers probably believe "The a masterful rewrite of Chilean history.  Dorfman claims that Gen. Augusto Pinochet was a tyrant, seeking to reign  forever; "ended democracy there" by ("backed by the U.S.") overthrowing  Allende; "terrorized" the people and brought "economic crises" to Chile.  </P> <P> But, the worse lie is that Pinochet "hit upon . . . an ingenious idea" to turn  National Stadium into a concentration camp for torturing and executing  dissidents.  </P> <P> It was Allende, not Pinochet, who first filled National Stadium with  "dissidents." One was my wife's brother, severely tortured but released. Not so  lucky were hundreds with him who Allende killed.  </P> <P> Yes, "all the atrocities must be remembered." Let's remember every communist  killed by the military in the battle for Chile; let's also remember those  hundreds, maybe thousands, of anti-communists killed by Allende.  </P> <P> ROBERT G. HAMLIN  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

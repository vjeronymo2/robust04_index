			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Management: Black magic at work around the world - Is entrepreneur Conrad Black a supreme strategist or a lucky deal-maker? Ian Hargreaves and Bernard Simon examine both his doggedness and inconsistency Conrad Black is not a man who excites neutral judgments. For every media watcher who will tell you that Black, at 48, is the emerging global media boss of the 1990s, there is another who will say he is a lightweight whose fortunes rest on one great deal - his purchase and subsequent turnround of Britain's Daily Telegraph. Fresh from quitting the battle for the New York Daily News, Black is certainly the stuff of which tycoon legends are made. Ever since he was expelled from a posh Canadian boarding school for stealing and selling exam papers, a mythology has grown around him. Over the years, we have had Black the historical biographer, Black the student of Napoleon, Black the military/corporate strategist, Black the deal-maker, Black the establishment man, Black the Catholic convert, Black the political philosopher, Black the potential (Canadian) prime minister, Black the press baron. By the age of 40, he had already built, dismantled and then re-assembled what he told his biographer in 1982 would be 'a diversified major enterprise carrying the name of Canada to the four corners of the earth'; his interests extended from farm machinery to oil. 'I'm proud of that era because I created a significant amount of wealth legally and fairly,' he says. 'Napoleon said 'force is mass times velocity' and I did demonstrate a rather high velocity.' Black's 1982 prediction, however, has not quite worked out. In the last decade, he has sold most of his non-media interests to pay for the Telegraph, whose controlling shareholder is Vancouver-based Hollinger, Black's main quoted company. Today, Black spends nine months of the year in London, where he has two houses, one a residence, the other a library. His office high in Canary Wharf, where the Telegraph is based, looks like a film set for an English colonial drawing room, dressed with paintings of naval battles. Hollinger owns or controls more than 100 daily newspapers and about 200 weeklies, most of them tiny, in North America, Britain, the Caribbean, Australia and Israel. The jewels are the Daily Telegraph, which last year contributed 80 per cent of group profits, and the Telegraph's 15 per cent stake in Fairfax, a top Australian publisher. Even with group sales of CDollars 780m (Pounds 351.3m) in 1991 and paid daily circulation of 2.5m, however, Hollinger is way behind Rupert Murdoch, whose Sun alone outsells all of Black's daily titles. Black is proud of the relative stability of Hollinger's cash flow during the recession, although revenues and profits have stagnated since 1989 and the company has had to U-turn on its debt profile. In 1991, Hollinger piled on debt to buy into Fairfax, to add American titles and to obtain extra Telegraph shares. This year, Hollinger has floated part of the Telegraph, raising Pounds 84.5m, and sold at a CDollars 38m loss a stake in United Newspapers, paying down CDollars 522m of debt and improving its debt to equity ratio from 1.96:1 to 1.1:1. This has not prevented Black from maintaining his velocity on the deal-hunting front. The question is: does Black have anything which can be described as a strategy? Or is Hollinger a company driven only by deals? 'The common thread is they're all newspapers, highly economically priced given their potential turnaround,' says Black. 'If we think the franchise is good and we can make a good deal and manage it up from there and physically cope with the distance involved, we'll do it.' The classic execution of this strategy has been at the Telegraph, where Black's astutely timed purchase of a minority share and pre-emptive rights on other holdings in 1985, has been followed by a dramatic recovery in the business. Under Black, the Telegraph has cut production and distribution costs while more than doubling the editorial budget to make the newspaper more attractive to younger readers. At the same time, its cover price has been shifted from a no man's land between quality and popular titles to price leadership among the white broadsheets, so reducing exposure to the advertising market. This has more than offset a continued decline in circulation, which has fallen from 1.4m in the early 1970s to a whisker above the 1m mark. With inflation lower, Black says 'a little more caution is called for' on cover prices. It is not exactly clear how Black will develop his UK media interests from this healthy base. His courtship with United Newspapers apparently signalled interests in popular newspapers. Black now describes as 'a mistake' his belief that United faced a takeover struggle, leading to a possible 'partial merger between us or of exchanging shares for some of United's desirable assets'. As for the timing of his costly exit, Black absolutely denies pressure from his bankers, but says he was influenced by poll predictions that Labour might win the election and further depress the value of his holding. Others in the Black camp say he received a political warning that the government could not allow the construction of yet another large, Conservative national newspaper group in Britain. 'I never heard that and never solicited a view,' says Black. It may yet be that Black will test this by bidding for the Mirror group, of which he says: 'it's possible'. He sees no problem owning a pro-Labour newspaper, 'so long as it was militating within the labour movement for a moderate position'. Even clearer is Black's desire to establish himself in the British regional newspaper market, although again the way forward is not obvious. He is excluded from boardroom influence at Trinity International, in which the Telegraph inherited a 13 per cent stake from Hollinger. Trinity owns newspapers in Britain and north America, but has a tight share voting structure established in 1904 to protect the then Liberal publisher from Tory predators. Black fulminates on cue about this 'antediluvian, gerrymandered share structure', but claims: 'We're completely passive investors.' This does not quite fit with his comment that the Trinity shares were bought as 'a play on the shareholding structure'. Nor is it in full harmony with Black's generalisation that 'we're rarely long-term minority shareholders'. Black's probing manoeuvres at Trinity and United have also characterised his so far not very successful approach in the UK television industry, where inter alia he expressed an interest (since withdrawn) in Channel 5, bought a 5 per cent stake in Carlton (winner of the London weekday ITV franchise) but lost out in manoeuvring over the breakfast television franchise. The word is that a relationship with Michael Green, the boss of Carlton, has cooled, as Black implies when he dismisses the Carlton stake as 'just an afterthought'. He now says: 'The software companies might be better than the licence holders.' But he concedes that 'no-one can foresee a big increase in the circulation of our newspapers . . . so it's natural for us to want to diversify a little'. There is in all these situations an odd mix of doggedness and inconsistency, as there has been in north America, where Black and his partner, David Radler, have been buying newspapers since 1969, while going in and out of broadcasting, supermarkets and oil wells. Black is cross that his north American publishing interests received such a sniffy press during the Telegraph flotation and proclaims them an example of his ability to break creatively with conventional wisdom, in this case the view that circulations lower than 25,000 are not worth the bother for a leading publisher. Computerised data analysis has given the lie to that, says Black. From the published figures, however, it is difficult to assay the performance of a big Hollinger division like American Publishing. Black says his style in running the group is to delegate and 'to monitor what's going on in as unobtrusive and little irritating a way as possible'. Newspapers, he says, are 'conceptually very simple. If you watch the payroll, circulation and the ad revenue you have the picture.' This surveillance is mostly a weekly task, with figures going to Black and Radler. Black says he spends a lot of time 'thinking about how to expand sensibly, working on whether a proposition is sound'. How many deals has he looked at this year? 'Personally about a dozen, the company dozens.' Colleagues across the world confirm that he does indeed delegate, seldom visiting properties. Other features of his management style are: close attention to costs; heavy borrowings linked to the projected earnings stream of acquisitions and what might be grandly styled the geopolitical criteria for investment. Black says he invested in small town America because he believed in its potential under Ronald Reagan, just as the election of Margaret Thatcher made it possible for him to live and work in Britain. He even defends his most controversial publishing deal, the purchase in 1989 of the Jerusalem Post, on the grounds that Israel's sclerotic statist economy is due for improvement. Hollinger paid Dollars 20m for the Post, more than twice the level of the nearest bid, and quickly switched its political support from Labour to Likud, raising suspicions that Black's motives were less commercial than political. The Post is managed by Yehuda Levy, a former army officer befriended by David Radler, a fellow Jew, during a stay in Vancouver. Levy claims that since the purchase, another Dollars 10m has been spent on modernisation, but that with staff numbers falling by 60 per cent to 210, the paper is on the road to profitability. Black denies non-commercial motives and says the switch in editorial line has been exaggerated. 'I have been accused of devising a form of Jewish fascism, which is just outrageous,' though he admits some editorials 'get a little carried away on Jewish issues'. Black's politics are the subject of much scrutiny as he extends his interests. His newest editors at Fairfax are especially nervous, particularly with regard to his plans for the leftish Melbourne Age. 'I am more interested in the professional presentation of information and the publication of intelligent advocacy than I am in propagating my own views. I don't try to turn foreign newspapers into organs of what I believe,' he says. So can he imagine the Melbourne Age backing the Labor Party in a general election? 'I can conceive of circumstances.' How likely? 'Not likely, but not out of the question.' Will he be changing editors at Fairfax? 'I think I'll duck that one.' Black says he has 'a constructive relationship' with Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, which is just as well, since he badly wants to extend the Telegraph's shareholding in Fairfax beyond its current legal limit, something he concedes is more likely if Keating loses the election. Without access to a bigger holding, Black has all the management responsibility at Fairfax for limited reward and security. Black argues that shareholders get a better deal from companies run by strong proprietors with clear views and that readers get better newspapers. 'Can anyone imagine that this mighty enterprise built up by Rupert Murdoch could have been accomplished by people who did not have a significant financial stake in it?' he asks. His political views, he says, are not 'far to the right of the general orthodoxy.' His all-time political hero is Abraham Lincoln, but he also praises FDR as the president who 'saved the capitalist system' in the 1930s by preventing the growth of an American hard left. But he prefers Bush to Clinton. He says that newspaper owners have three choices: like Roy Thomson to focus only on business performance; like Robert Maxwell to dictate editorial lines in some detail; or, as he sees it, a middle way. In practice, says Black, editorial decisions fall into three categories: the trivial; the moderately important, when he might write a signed letter or article; and big issues when 'I have a discussion with the editor and we work out a common policy.' A year ago, Black pursued a category two issue in the Spectator, which he bought for Pounds 2.5m in 1988, complaining about 'an error-ridden cover piece on the Reichmanns and a gratuitous sketch of Lord Carrington.' He added that these two gentlemen 'would have the right to expect to be treated fairly by the Spectator even if they were not directors of the companies that ultimately owned it and friends of its proprietor.' 'Black doesn't use his papers to attack his enemies, but he doesn't like them attacking his friends,' says one of his journalists. Black can recall two occasions when he has insisted upon his personal view in the Telegraph leader column: that the paper remained loyal to Thatcher during her leadership crisis and that there be no ambivalence about the desirability of a Conservative victory at the last election. Two years ago before giving a Eurosceptical speech to a Tory party fringe meeting, he ensured in advance that the Telegraph's leader writers were prepared to support its thesis. 'I was not prepared to give an address which was sharply contradicted in our own leaders.' It is, in the end, impossible to separate a judgment of the man and his companies. Black's taste for financial deal-making, VIP-networking and public debate combine in the newspaper business in a way they did not when he was running shops and oil wells. It is easy, for example, to mock Black's boardroom collections of public figures, but unwise to overlook the shrewdness of his links with a body like the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, upon whose board Black sits and whose former chairman, Donald Fullerton, this year joined the Hollinger board. But it is also true that on the global media stage, Black has not found steady partners. His links with Kerry Packer foundered in Australian politics (and, some add, in mutual rivalry) and in Britain he has yet to make a solid alliance. Black admits that he sometimes misjudges public relations. In the early 1980s he was embroiled in a notorious battle over a pensions fund surplus. It took the intervention of the Ontario courts to force Dominion Stores, a Hollinger company, to agree with its trades union to divide the disputed surplus between the company and fund members. 'It has taken some considerable time and a number of libel suits for me to live down the reputation attached to me by a left-wing politician in Toronto of being, in effect, a brigand who helped himself to the pension entitlements of defenceless people,' says Black In conversation, Black displays an unpredictable blend of bluster, wordy explanation, caution and mischief. He's a cross between an investment banker and a 19th century belletrist. So it not surprising that there is an impulsive, accidental quality about the way Hollinger has sometimes surged ahead, to be checked as the boss becomes distracted or decides to take stock. Everything still stems from the availability and quality of the individual deal, even if the deals today are largely confined to the media. Black has not yet had time to prove that he can sustain high quality management of a global range of media properties. 'The problem with Conrad is that he's always looking to the next deal,' says Hal Jackman, lieutenant governor of Ontario and a Hollinger director until last year. Black counters that he is not known for overbidding and cites the New York Daily News. His cautious side is, he insists, deeply rooted in his experience. 'If you want to be an objectively wealthy person, you have to bet everything once. It was my experience to do that twice and I did not find that a stimulating experience. If other, more daring or more imaginative people make more money than we do, then God bless them. I don't want to wake up every night worried about my borrowings.' Perhaps he really doesn't want to be Rupert Murdoch.

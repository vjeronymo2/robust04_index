			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> NOT HERE: Air travelers could be taxed $2 or $3 each time they board a flight,  the money going for local airport development, if the nation's airport  operators get their way. . . . Sentiment for a departure tax is building in  Washington -- but not at John Wayne Airport, despite its $310-million  expansion. . . . Even if Congress authorized the tax, "we already have our  sources of funding lined up," Airport Manager George A. Rebella said. "We  probably wouldn't levy the tax." Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

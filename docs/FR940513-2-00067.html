			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> &bull;Advancing our knowledge and understanding of current program and policy issues, such as community and in-home long-term care service systems and programs, significant to the well-being of the older population;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Improving the effectiveness of Older Americans Act programs by testing new models, systems, and approaches for better providing and delivering services to older persons; and providing training, technical assistance, and information that will increase our ability to serve older Americans with skill, care, and compassion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 2. Coordination With Other Federal Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In accordance with Title II of the Older Americans Act, the Assistant Secretary for Aging and the Administration on Aging (AoA) function as focal points within the Federal government for aging-related concerns. In that capacity, the Assistant Secretary advises the Secretary of Health and Human Services on matters affecting older Americans and provides consultation and information to units across the Federal government on the characteristics, circumstances, and needs of older persons. AoA has a strong commitment to working with other Federal agencies on policy and program development in issue areas of importance to older Americans. To carry out its national level program and advocacy responsibilities, AoA places major emphasis on developing collaborative relationships with other Federal agencies aimed at coordinating diverse and wide-ranging Federal program resources and linking those resources to the similarly diverse needs of older persons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dating back two decades, AoA has worked hard to develop and implement a network of Federal Interagency Agreements to better serve older Americans, combining our resources with those of the Departments of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Labor, and Education, the Farmers Home Administration, and the Corporation for National and Community Service (formerly ACTION), as well as with other agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, such as the Social Security Administration, the Health Care Financing Administration, the Administration for Children and Families, and the Public Health Service, including the National Institute on Aging.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These interagency collaborations represent a strategic coupling of AoA's resources to serve the nation's elderly, especially those at risk of losing their independence. AoA's Federal Interagency Agreements cover a spectrum of program efforts_in housing, transportation, health promotion, elder abuse, etc._that closely parallel a number of the priority areas in this Discretionary Funds Program Announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=2 --> 3. Dissemination of Title IV Project Results and Products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In keeping with the provisions of the Older Americans Act, all projects funded under Title IV are required to undertake vigorous steps to disseminate the results and products of their projects to appropriate audiences involved in promoting the well-being of older persons. This should include energetic marketing of products and results. Projects are strongly encouraged to utilize appropriate promotional media campaigns in order to insure that their outcomes receive the widest possible attention. Such campaigns should seek to educate consumers, providers (including the Aging Network), the private sector, and policy sector about their results and to promote use of their products. A special priority area in this Program Announcement further emphasizes the importance of dissemination and utilization of Title IV project findings, products, and results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described below in Part III, Section I.2, the most effective dissemination begins at the moment a project is conceptualized and includes the involvement of potential user audiences throughout the project, particularly in the design of products. As part of their dissemination plan, applicants are also encouraged to consider the development, as appropriate, of brief products suitable for widespread dissemination to older persons, their families and other caregivers, and practitioners who serve older persons. Advice on ways to maximize the utilization of a proposed project may be obtained by contacting Saadia Greenberg at the AoA Office of Dissemination and Utilization at (202) 619&hyph;0441. Applicants may also be interested in obtaining a publication entitled,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Dissemination by Design, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which may be requested by calling the above number.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Major Strategic Initiatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary of Health and Human Services has charged the Assistant Secretary for Aging with lead responsibility within the Department for four major strategic initiatives_home and community-based long-term care; older women; an aging blueprint for future generations; and nutrition and malnutrition. These initiatives are in concert with the Older Americans Act mandate to develop new and improved programs to help older persons. Through this Program Announcement, the Assistant Secretary is focusing Title IV Discretionary Funds support on each of these initiatives. (Full descriptions of the initiatives are available by contacting the Office of Program Development, Administration on Aging at 202&hyph;619&hyph;0441).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Home and Community Based Long Term Care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The home and community-based long-term care initiative responds to the central concern that persons with chronic illnesses and disabilities have the resources to live independently in their homes and communities as long as possible. One critical issue now being debated is how we can best ensure that government at all levels works in a more efficient and effective manner to help meet that concern. To focus attention on this and other key issues affecting home and community-based long-term care, the Assistant Secretary for Aging and the Administration on Aging convened a Health Care University in January 1994. The Health Care University provided a forum for (1) outlining the Assistant Secretary's home and community-based long-term care initiative; (2) encouraging the participants (including community, state, Tribal, and national organizations, agencies, and officials) to better understand and fully discuss the Health Security Act legislation proposed by the President, and; (3) providing preliminary findings of the AoA home and community-based long-term care survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

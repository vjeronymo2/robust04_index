			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / UK Company News: ACT to announce plans for networking services offshoot ACT, the Birmingham-based group whose fortunes recovered and flourished after the sale two years ago of its personal computer business to Mitsubishi of Japan, will today announce the formation of a new company to exploit a fast growing sector of the computing services mar- ket. To be called ACT Network Si, it will concentrate on the implementation and management of complex data networks for large corporate clients and local authorities. Logsys, another member of the group, is already active in central government networking where it has annual sales of more than Pounds 30m. Network Si will concentrate on systems integration, putting together networks from components supplied by a range of suppliers, and it expects to profit from the new trend to 'outsourcing', where companies use outside services suppliers to run their data processing and networking functions. Mr Roger Foster, chairman, said he expected Network Si to conclude deals worth Pounds 10m in the first year of operations. He believed the potential market for networking services was substantial. Figures from the Yankee Group Europe, a marketing consultancy, suggest that spending on network management is growing at 24 per cent a year compared with only 5 per cent a year for information technology budgets as a whole. Managing director of the new company will be Mr Chris Winn, a main board director and managing director of ACT Computer Support. Mr Paul Lindsey-Jones will be sales and marketing director. The company will initially be 45 in number but will be able to call on the expertise of the rest of the 1,800 strong group. Data network management, essential to the effective collection and distribution of information within an organisation, has emerged as one of the most serious technological problems large companies face in the 1990s. The tech- nology is complex and expensive and networking expertise is scarce. ACT is now one of the largest UK-owned software and services companies by market capitalisation. It has gone through several transformations in its 26-year life, catching each succeeding wave of change in the turbulent computer industry. It has extensive experience of networking following its early move into personal computer local area networks. The company's profitability improved markedly after it disposed of its hardware business; at the halfway stage last year sales were ahead 28 per cent at Pounds 52.6m while pre-tax profits were 22 per cent up at Pounds 6.61m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by "The Observer": "The Cowboy With the F-16's!"] </F>   [Excerpts] The saloon door opened suddenly. The dusty  cowboy, the "Lone Ranger" [preceding two words in English]  kicked the door, drew his pistols and fired "from the hip"  [preceding three words in English], breaking four whiskey  bottles over the bartender's head. It was a real "Western"  scene, which was repeated in recent days over Bosnia-Herzegovina  with the downing of the four "unknown" aircraft by the terrible  war machine of the "Master of the Planet" who went to his "oval  office" and, facing television cameras, spoke to his "subjects"  around the world. Because now the saloon has become  international and the cowboy's shots have been replaced with  "F-16's" carrying air-to-air missiles. Today, however, they did  not break some whiskey bottles, but four aircraft with four  persons aboard, while hundreds of lives are lost daily on the  ground. We are talking of human lives, and not of ethnicities or  religions.    Indeed, the logical explanation a simple man could give for  this incident is its relation to the cowboy's spectacular  entrance into the "international" saloon. Because the new world  gendarme, who also calls himself "Master of the Planet," wants  to remind people around the world that the power is his. Because  now, since there is no opposing power as there was some years  ago, all the world's inhabitants, and mainly those in Europe,  must digest the fact that there is a "Master of the Planet." And  of course, he found a little man he could hit to ensure that his  victims cannot react with real bullets. The simple man in the  street is asking: If the four aircraft, which were "like mice in  front of a tiger," were Russian, would American generals and  admirals, who used NATO as their "alibi," down them so easily?  NATO, this collective organ that has turned from a defense  mechanism against the communist threat to an executive tool of  the United States. So, we have "Rambo" leaving the swamps of  Vietnam and coming to Europe, and especially the Balkans. And of  course, he wants his entrance on the "scene"--because let's not  forget that everything today is a television spectacle--to be  made in an impressive manner. The "producers" have thus chosen  an easy target: the four little aircraft which, as the Americans  themselves would say, were "sitting ducks" [preceding two words  in English] for those awesome war machines, the F-16's.    It is difficult for the simple man in the street to  understand what is happening now in this tragic region of  Europe. Things are so mixed up, there are so many ethnicities  and religions fighting against each other, warring parties are  so confused that no one can comprehend what is really going on,  who is right and who is wrong. [passage omitted] No one knows  who is the real target of the various "events" that appear on  our television screens.    We thus find ourselves in a state of utter confusion. We are  not the only ones: more tragically, international "leaders" are  confused as well. Because, to begin with, they are all "little  men" disguised as "tigers" and they only think of their  reelection and of what "image" they will "sell" to their people.  But thousands of lives are lost in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It makes  no difference if they are Muslims, Serbs, or Croats. They are  all people losing their lives, their homes, their families. And  no one seems to really care. We see those who once upon a time  were demonstrating for the "Shining Path" or "Farabundo Marti"  remaining silent. And what are we doing? We are not speaking up.  Because we have lost our self-respect since selling our humanity  in exchange for a consumer pseudo-society!</p>

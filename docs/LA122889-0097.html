			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Sears Credit Rating Downgraded: Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. said it downgraded its  credit rating of Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s debt securities because of  uncertainty over the success of Sears' new retailing strategy. Duff &amp;  Phelps downgraded Sears' senior debt, acceptance senior debt and Discover Card  credit senior debt to AA-minus from AA. At the same time, the credit-rating  company reaffirmed the rating that it gave Sears' commercial paper, Duff  1-plus. The downgrading affects about $2 billion of debt securities. Duff &amp;  Phelps said the downgrading reflected the "increased risks and earnings  volatility" of Sears' retail operations after its switch last spring to a  strategy of "everyday low pricing."  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 22, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AT LONG LAST, ENGELBERT TO SCRATCH ACTING ITCH  </P> <P> One glance at Engelbert Humperdinck's tour itinerary would make it easy to  believe that he runs in the circles of the rich and famous.  </P> <P> A few shows in Vegas.  </P> <P> A couple of nights in Hawaii. Back to Atlantic City for a week. It all sounds  like an ideal lifestyle for a world-renowned performer who is still living off  a pack of hit songs from the early 1970s.  </P> <P> But Humperdinck is working very hard to change that image of the Vegas  performer.  </P> <P> Humperdinck departs soon for Luxembourg and an acting part in a miniseries  called "Sherlock Holmes and the Leading Lady," which stars Morgan Fairchild. In  November, after some more concerts, Humperdinck and Fairchild will team up  again for work in Florida on a feature film called "Point Blank," which will be  released in theaters early next year.  </P> <P> "It's pretty difficult tackling both right now," Humperdinck said. "It's like a  cramming situation in school where you're trying to learn your lines and keep  the shows going at a high level. But I believe that hard work brings out the  best in you when you're pushed."  </P> <P> Humperdinck, whose only other role of any note was in a "Fantasy Island"  episode eight years ago, said he had always wanted to dabble in acting but his  management would not allow it.  </P> <P> "I wanted to be an actor from the word go -- since 1967 when it all started,"  Humperdinck said. "But my company kept me on the road constantly because I'm a  moneymaker for them. These acting roles mean a big drop in income, but I'm  certainly willing to do that to have the opportunity to do what I've always  longed to do."  </P></p>

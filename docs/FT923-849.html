			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Wm Morrison It is surely something to ponder at Westminster that the market capitalisation of a regional UK supermarket company is now twice the size of one of Britain's leading exporters. Comparisons between Wm Morrison and British Aerospace, however, are only of limited curiosity value in the City. The relevant peer group for investors includes the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury, which in share price terms the West Yorkshire-based group has outperformed by 112 per cent and 35 per cent respectively since the start of 1991. At the current rate of progress it will be only a matter of time before Morrison becomes the fifth food retailer in the Footsie (assuming, that is, it does not replace a struggling competitor). The shares are on an ostensibly dizzy earnings multiple - equivalent to the mighty Sainsbury and 20 per cent higher than the market - but fans insist this is down to highly conservative accounting policies. Yesterday's announcement of a 34 per cent increase in interim profits came despite a 43 per cent jump in the depreciation charge. As the modest decrease in operating margins illustrates, though, even Morrison cannot buck the consumer's tendency to trade down; staff costs in the period, moreover, rose faster than turnover. That said, there is nothing in yesterday's figures to suggest that management is loosening its grip or that the company's low price/good service formula is losing its appeal. There may be reason to worry about the whole sector's expansionism, but Morrison's secret is that it requires just 7 or 8 store openings a year to keep up the pace against the 25 to 30 needed to keep the momentum going at its bigger rivals. The ability to finance them largely out of cash flow is just an additional trick.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 51. One comment suggested that ANDA applicants amend their patent certifications to a paragraph I certification if FDA or the NDA holder ``delists'' a patent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, the agency believes that a certification under &sect;314.94(a)(12)(ii), stating that no relevant patents claim the listed drug, would be more appropriate if a patent is ``delisted'' (see 54 FR 28872 at 28886).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 52. One comment asked FDA to clarify proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(A) so that an amended patent certification would be required if a patent were held valid and infringed but not required if a patent were held infringed, but not valid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a claim is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the patent will ordinarily be removed from the list, and applicants with pending applications containing certifications with respect to that patent must amend their certifications accordingly to certify that no relevant patents claim the drug or, if another relevant patent claims the drug, to make an appropriate certification regarding that patent. In the amendment, the applicant must state the reason for the change in certification (that the patent has been removed from the list). A patent that is the subject of a lawsuit under &sect;314.107(c) will not be removed from the list until FDA determines either that no delay in effective dates of approval is required as a result of the lawsuit or that any such period of delay in effective dates of approval is ended. The agency has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(B) to clarify its position regarding certifications and patents removed from the list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency also advises applicants to submit any patent certification changes by letter if the applicant has not received a ``not approvable'' letter from the agency. If the applicant has received a ``not approvable'' letter, it may include the amended certification along with the complete response to the deficiencies in the ``not approvable'' letter. This will enable FDA to process amendments more efficiently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 53. Six comments addressed amended certifications under proposed &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) which would not require applicants to amend their patent certifications when patent information is submitted after the abbreviated application's approval ``whether or not the approval of the abbreviated application is effective.'' One comment would require amended patent certifications only if a new patent issued after the ANDA had been submitted and make supplements optional after ANDA approval. Five comments would require ANDA applicants to amend patent certifications until the effective date of their ANDA approvals because the existence of a patent would affect the ANDA's effective date of approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of April 28, 1992 (57 FR 17950 at 17953), FDA stated that it had clarified its policies with respect to drug products with delayed effective dates of approval. The agency stated that an approval with a delayed effective date is tentative and does not become final until the effective date. Therefore, FDA has amended &sect;314.94(a)(12)(viii)(C)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) by deleting the phrase ``whether or not the approval of the abbreviated application is effective,'' and, consistent with this change, and in response to the comments, by requiring an ANDA applicant to amend its patent certifications until the effective date of ANDA approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Section 314.95_Notice of Certification of Invalidity or Noninfringement of a Patent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;314.95 described an ANDA applicant's obligations with respect to a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent. Proposed &sect;314.95(a), for example, would require an ANDA applicant to provide notice to the patent owner and the NDA holder. Proposed &sect;314.95(b) would require an ANDA applicant to send the notice when it receives an acknowledgment letter from FDA stating that the ANDA is sufficiently complete for review to begin. Proposed &sect;314.95(c) prescribed the contents of a notice of certification of invalidity or noninfringement of a patent, including ``a detailed statement of the factual and legal basis of the applicant's opinion that the patent is not valid or will not be infringed.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 54. One comment recommended that FDA revise the regulation by adding a mechanism whereby FDA or the United States Patent and Trademark Office would review notices of certification of invalidity or noninfringement. The comment would have FDA suspend the 45-day period provided by section 505(j)(4)(B)(iii) of the act until FDA or the United States Patent and Trademark Office determined that the notice was sufficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA declines to adopt the comment. As stated elsewhere in this preamble, FDA lacks expertise in patent law. Moreover, neither FDA nor the United States Patent and Trademark Office currently has access to the additional resources that would be necessary to review these notices, and a patent certification review system would subject the agency's decisions to questioning that would require further resource expenditures and create delays in the statutory patent certification and challenge process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

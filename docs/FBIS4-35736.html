			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of letter from PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to Israeli </F> Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin "in the wake of the Israeli  Government's protest against 'Arafat's statements in South  Africa;" date not given]    [Text] Mr. Prime Minister:    Greetings.    The PLO reiterates the following with regard to the  Gaza-Jericho accord signed in Cairo:    1. The PLO pledges that the Palestinian Authority, including  the police and other departments, will work in accordance with  this agreement and will effect a mechanism for coordination and  cooperation in the appropriate time.    2. The PLO pledges to cooperate with Israel and to help it  discover the location of and return the Israeli soldiers who are  still missing, as well as return the bodies of the dead soldiers  who have not been restored yet.    3. The PLO pledges to ask the Palestine National Council, in  its next session, to officially approve amendments to the PLO  National Charter in accordance with the pledge included in the  message signed by the PLO chairman on 9 September 1993 and  addressed to Israel's prime minister.    4. As I enter the Gaza Strip and Jericho area I will use the  title of the chairman of the Palestinian Authority or the PLO  chairman, not the president of the state of Palestine.    5. I pledge not to take any measures that would change the  status of Gaza Strip and Jericho area and to discuss this matter  during the talks for a permanent solution to the situation.    6. We pledge to implement Paragraph 3 of Article 4 of the  accord, which stipulates that we must inform the Government of  Israel of the names of the Palestinian Authority members in a  letter to be presented within a week. The appointment of  authority members will be effective in accordance with letters  to be exchanged to this effect between the PLO and the  Government of Israel. Also, any change in the membership of the  Palestinian Authority will be effective in accordance with  letters to be exchanged between the PLO and the Government of  Israel.    7. Following the endorsement of the accord, talks will begin  immediately to grant the authority the powers to implement  Article 6 of the Declaration of Principles. Both parties will  work toward exploring possible ways to expand the sphere of  talks so as to exceed the five fields. [not further identified]    8. Both parties will work toward giving momentum to talks in  light of temporary arrangements in accordance with the  Declaration of Principles and its objective.    9. We are committed to embarking on permanent talks on the  final status as soon as possible provided that they will not be  later than the beginning of the third year of the transitional  period.    10. We will decide -- through cooperation with Israel and  within one month -- on calling the Governments of Jordan and  Egypt to form a follow-up committee as noted in the Declaration  of Principles.    11. We will assess, together with the Government of Israel,  all necessary legislation that would help implement the accord.    12. We are ready to continue discussion on the following  issues:    A. Jericho area.    B. Allowing an official Palestinian presence on bridges.    C. Achieving additional measures in the Rafah crossing  area.    D. All suspended issues that are mentioned in the accord.    [Signed] Sincerely, Yasir 'Arafat</p>

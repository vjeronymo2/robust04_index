One of the objectives of this society is to  seek the lifting of the U.S. blockade against Cuba and the  development of ties between the Russian and Cuban peoples.    In remarks to PRENSA LATINA, (Anatoliy Burlov), vice  president of the organization, said that the legal registration  of this society is to promote rapprochement between the two  nations in important areas such as culture, tourism, and the  probable creation of joint ventures. (Burlov) said that this new  society headed by cosmonaut (Vladimir Shatalov) stems from the  principles of the previous organization founded in 1964 by Yuri  Gagarin.    According to (Shatalov), the main objective of this society  is to group the true friends of Cuba for the purpose of  defending bilateral cooperation and the interests of the two  nations.</p>

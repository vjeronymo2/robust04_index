			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Damage of property slump will continue PROPERTY lending was the most conspicuous, if not the most important, cause of Barclays' problems last year. Barclays was a principal banker to companies such as Rosehaugh, Mountleigh, Speyhawk, Heron, Olympia &amp; York and Imry. The write-down on Imry alone was Pounds 240m, one of the largest provisions in banking history. The pain is not yet over. Barclays, which yesterday provided against 10 per cent of its Pounds 7.7bn UK property and construction loan book, expects to take more, if smaller, provisions next year. Barclays, the largest lender to UK property, may be worse-placed than its peers, but it is not alone. The banks which together lent some Pounds 40bn to UK property are expected to write off billions of pounds between them. Estimates of banks' total provisions against property loans range widely. More sanguine commentators point out that at least half of the banks' property debt was agreed before 1988. But the banks have a disproportionately high exposure to unlet buildings and development sites, which are worth a small fraction of their value a few years ago. This suggests the assets that make up the banks' security may have fallen by far more than 40 per cent, the average fall in commercial property values since May 1989. Banks have considerable discretion in the extent of provisioning, which largely depends on their view of a company's prospects. Many advisers believe banks are not fully provisioning, partly because they want to spread the damage over time and partly because they have insufficient resources to devote to sorting out their bad property loans. 'A lot of banks are sitting on problems. They are not even looking at them' says Mr Richard Millward of Kleinwort Benson's workout unit. But provisions against property loans may be the tip of the iceberg for banks. A bigger problem is the the effect on their collateral, since property is the security against the huge majority of banks loans. The damage inflicted by the collapse in property values is far deeper than the provisions against property loans may suggest.</p>

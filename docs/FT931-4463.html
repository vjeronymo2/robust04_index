			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / E Europe more attractive: Hungary and Czech Republic top business poll WESTERN business executives rate Hungary and the Czech Republic as the best places for business in eastern Europe, according to a new poll. Some 48 per cent of executives interviewed in a survey by American Express said the business environment in Hungary was good or excellent and 43 per cent said the same of the Czech Republic. Budapest, where reforms towards a market economy and modernisation started first, led the pack in telecommunications, basic utilities, labour quality and trade regulations. Prague, which has a longer business tradition, followed close behind in most categories and led in terms of financial regulations. However the survey found that it was Poland's economic stability which had improved the most, with 41 per cent rating the country positive compared with only 3 per cent in 1990. That finding contrasted sharply with the view that economic stability in Moscow had deteriorated. A full 62 per cent rated the business environment in Russia as poor. The survey, which covered 126 leading executives of companies with links with eastern Europe, coincides with other indications of the countries' relative popularity. A multi-million dollar facility to stimulate tourism in central and eastern Europe is being launched this week by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, in collaboration with the World Travel and Tourism Council, writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor. Travel and tourism in the region have been badly hit lately. Earnings fell more than 8 per cent between 1989 and 1990, the last year for which the WTTC has data.</p>

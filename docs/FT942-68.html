			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: BellSouth to test new multimedia service BellSouth, the regional telephone company serving the south-eastern US, announced plans for a trial of new interactive multimedia video services to 12,000 homes in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, starting next year. BellSouth has lagged several other large regional US telephone companies in setting up multimedia trials. However, the plan it announced this week will have one novel element: it will combine existing analog cable television services with more advanced digital video services over a shared network. The use of analog technology means that customers in the trial area can opt to subscribe to BellSouth's cable television service over their existing cable operator without having to buy the new set-top box required to receive the interactive digital services. Customers will be able to choose between a 60-channel cable television service and possibly more than 300 digital channels offering services such as games and movies. 'We believe our proposal represents the fastest, most economical and fairest way to make these services a reality,' said Mr William Reddersen, a senior BellSouth executive. Telephone companies like BellSouth are forbidden by law from providing cable programming within their own local service region. The company, therefore, plans to lease the cable channels it is setting up to Vanguard Cable, a subsidiary of a Texas-based cable company called Prime II Management. BellSouth is acquiring a stake in another Prime subsidiary. BellSouth has selected Hewlett-Packard, the computer and instrumentation group, to provide interactive video servers for the field trial. In January, Pacific Telesis, the California telephone company, announced it had selected HP's servers for commercial deployment in four California markets.</p>

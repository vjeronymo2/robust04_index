			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> REPUBLICANS SHOOT DOWN RESOLUTION ON ART FUNDING  </P> <P> After angry Republican speeches calling for its defeat, the state Senate on  Thursday shot down a resolution that would have urged Congress not to cut  federal funding of art deemed obscene or offensive to religious, racial or  ethnic groups.  </P> <P> Republicans blasted the resolution by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) which  would have asked Congress to review selection standards for taxpayer-supported  art instead of restricting funding.  </P> <P> A leading opponent of the resolution, Sen. Larry Stirling (R-La Mesa),  declared: "We should be financing what's good about America, and what can be  better -- not the twisted, moronic, demonic, asinine, stupidity of some artist  who can't sell his works on the open market, and so (he) has to get some  leftist to get the government to finance it for him."  </P> <P> The measure was defeated on a 14-19 vote, with 21 votes needed for approval.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Washington Debate  </P> <P> In bringing up the issue, the Senate joined the debate raging in Washington  over two exhibits of controversial photographs supported by the National  Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) proposed restrictions on art funding after  outrage erupted over Andres Serrano's photograph of a crucifix submerged in a  jar of urine and an exhibit of homoerotic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe,  who recently died of AIDS.  </P> <P> Torres said that only a small fraction of federally funded art is as "clearly  offensive" as those exhibits and that the Helms proposal could allow for  censorship in virtually all areas of artistic expression.  </P> <P> "Under the Helms amendment, material could not be published that denigrates  Satanism or witchcraft. Shall we shelve Beethoven's . . . Ninth Symphony  because it's about war, and might offend Quakers?" Torres said.  </P> <P> Stirling and other Republicans said Helms' proposal addresses the responsible  spending of public money and has little to do with censorship.  </P> <P> "Artists can still bite the heads off chickens and all that nonsense . . . as  long as they don't do it with government money," Stirling said.  </P></p>

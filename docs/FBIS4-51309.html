			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhasa, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The Zham trading post in  Tibet, the only channel for trade between China and Nepal, has  been bustling in the past few years, as the annual trade value  on the Sino-Nepalese border hit 300 million yuan (about 35  million U.S. dollars) last year.    Located at the foot of the southern Himalayas, Zham has  served as a political, economic and cultural passageway between  China and Nepal since the Sino-Nepalese highway opened in 1965.  However, the annual border trade volume was worth only seven  million yuan (800,000 U.S. dollars) in 1979.    Along with China's reform and open policy, Zham has become  prosperous as hotels, power stations, post offices, banks, and  industry and commerce offices have sprung up and more business  people have been flocking there.    Now the port boasts 3,000 residents, most of whom are  businessmen from the Tibet Autonomous Region and other Chinese  provinces, and Nepal.    According to local officials, ten percent of the local trade  volume is done in U.S. dollars, 30 percent in Nepalese currency  and 50 percent in renminbi. The rest is barter trade.</p>

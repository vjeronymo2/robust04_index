			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Technology: 6,000km under the sea - A transatlantic breakthrough for fibre optic cables A revolution is taking place in the undersea telecommunications cables industry. New techniques for sending traffic through optical fibre are boosting capacity and slashing prices at an extraordinary rate. A milestone was reached this month with the placing of an order for a transatlantic cable providing 28 times the capacity for roughly the same price as its state-of-the-art counterpart of a decade ago. The Dollars 300m (Pounds 200m) order is for a 6,000km fibre-optic undersea system linking Greenhill, Rhode Island in the US, with Land's End in the UK, to be installed in 1995. Called Tat-12, it was ordered by a consortium comprising British Telecommunications, France Telecom and AT&amp;T of the US jointly from AT&amp;T's own cable manufacturing arm and STC Submarine Systems, the subsidiary of Northern Telecom which is about to be sold to Alcatel of France. The undersea cable market is dominated by AT&amp;T, STC and Alcatel. Tat-12, for which STC is the leading supplier, contains two fibre pairs. Each has capacity for 60,000 telecommunications circuits, together sufficient to carry about 600,000 simultaneous telephone calls through a cable little thicker than a finger. STC's first undersea fibre-optic system dates back only seven years, and its first transatlantic system to 1988. The first generation of fibre-optic undersea systems, including a transatlantic system still under construction, uses the 'regeneration' technique to convey signals across long distances of fibre. This requires elaborate, high-speed electronic 'repeaters' to be attached to the undersea cable at regular intervals, which re-form the signal and send it on to the next repeater. The breakthrough was the invention of an optical amplifying mechanism that can pass the signal along the fibre without having to regenerate it, so dispensing with the need for high-speed, sea-bed electronics. Amplification processes are at the leading edge of laser and fibre-optics research, making research and development costs a significant part of each new contract. In the new system, amplification is achieved by erbium-coated amplifiers - short lengths of fibre leaded with a small amount of the rare earth erbium, inserted at intervals along the transmission fibre and illuminated by high-power lasers to boost the telecommunications signals. Only basic electronic equipment is required. The effect is to create a 'lightpipe' whereby the optical signal put in at one end appears at the other, provided the signal has the requisite wavelength properties. Tat-12 is not the first STC system to use optical amplification - but it is the first to straddle the Atlantic. STC's first optically-amplified system was 'Rioja', an Pounds 80m system currently being manufactured for installation between Spain, the UK, Belgium and the Netherlands. Rioja contains the longest optically amplified cable attempted by STC - a 900km section linking Spain and the UK. At 6,000km, Tat-12 will leave Rioja behind, with the aid of 133 undersea amplifiers. In terms of capacity, the advance is dramatic. Tat-11, the last transatlantic 'repeater' cable installed by STC, has a 560Mbit/second capacity. Conveying 23,000 circuits, it can carry about 115,000 simultaneous telephone calls. Tat-12, a 5 gigabit/second system, has five times that capacity. 'It is truly a revolution in the way we transmit signals under sea,' says Phil Black, STC's technical director. 'It means we do not have to develop another generation of high-speed, under-water electronics and gives far greater flexibility and reliability in installation and operation.' Tat-12 is only the start of the revolution. At its plant in Greenwich, south London - where the first successful transatlantic telegraph cable was built in the 1860s - STC is working on a far more sophisticated system able to carry 10m simultaneous telephone calls - enough for the entire population of London to speak at the same time down one cable. The path to the next plateau is 'wavelength division multiplexing'. WDM enables a number of optical signals, each at a slightly different wavelength, to be sent down the same optical 'lightpipe' at the same time, significantly increasing the number of 'channels'. Since all the dividing up and sorting out of wavelengths takes place in stations at either end of the cable, there would still be no need for high-speed, undersea electronic equipment. The story of submarine fibre-optic cables in the last decade casts a telling sidelight on the cost of international telecommunications. STC estimates that the cost of providing a telephone circuit by fibre between London and New York has fallen by a factor of 10 over just the last seven years. According to its projections, the cost is set to fall by a further factor of 10 over the next five years, courtesy of optical amplification. Approximately 90 per cent of all BT's transatlantic calls travel by cable and just 10 per cent by satellite. Since 1986, BT's transatlantic call charges have fallen by about 40 per cent in real terms. Transatlantic operators are not slow to boast about their sizeable tariff reductions, but they need to be seen against the background of a dramatic decline in operating and new infrastructure costs. Greater flexibility and reductions in unit costs do not translate immediately into lower prices. Old equipment has to be serviced and written-off; markets have to be found for new capacity. The whole of London is not going to telephone New York at the same time, however cheap BT's tariffs. 'What is needed is more capacity-gobbling uses,' says Black. 'With the long-haul use of capacity-demanding applications becoming economically possible, opportunities for broadband applications for transferring data, high-definition television and multimedia, are developing rapidly.' It is not, of course, just the likes of BT and AT&amp;T that need the capacity-gobblers; without them, suppliers such as STC may soon have invented themselves out of business.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Juan Hernandez Acen] </F>   [Text] Caracas, 26 Jun (PL) -- Participation of civil  society, mechanisms of consensus to deal with third countries,  and free trade zones are some of the challenges and hurdles  facing the soon-to-be-created Caribbean States Association (AEC).    Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, a nation that belongs to  the Group of Three [G-3], along with Mexico and Colombia, which  tomorrow will become members of the AEC, will be the site of a  new regional initiative that intends to group 37 states and  territories in the Caribbean Basin.    The Caribbean Sea, a geographic, historical, and cultural  confluence once in the sight of extraterritorial nations, is  getting ready to become the center of an extended region of  cooperation in view of the challenges posed by the international  arena.    Andres Serbin, director of the Venezuelan Social and  Political Studies Institute (Invesp) and one of the advocates of  the integrationist initiative, said here today that the creation  of the AEC constitutes an important regional step toward  internationalization and the emergence of economic blocs.    In a conversation with PRENSA LATINA, Serbin maintained that  the association is a response to common fears of being excluded  and neglected by the international economic system. The expert  believes the search for methods to include civilian society in  the integrationist movement is one of the main challenges of the  AEC, which will group more than 200 million people.    He explained that the integration cannot be seen from a  short-term point of view; the participation of society in an  association where heterogeneity is the basic characteristic, in  addition to government and business agreements, is essential.    According to the initiative, the AEC is attempting to group  the English-speaking community (Caricom) [Caribbean Common  Market], Central and South American countries with coasts on the  Caribbean Sea, the West Indies (France), Aruba and the  Netherlands Antilles (Holland), Puerto Rico and the Virgin  Islands (United States), and British dependencies under a "broad  and flexible" system.    Contrary to the G-3, the Central American Common Market, or  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] (Brazil, Argentina,  Uruguay, and Paraguay), the AEC will be formed by a number of  mostly small countries, which in some cases have different  interests, development levels, culture, and languages.    If we want the emergence of a regional entity, Serbin said,  we have to establish the mechanism to get the people to contact  each other and to participate in the decisionmaking process. It  should not just be left up to the governments.    For the creation of a free trade zone, the AEC will also  face  the challenge of making the economies of independent states  compatible with that of 12 dependent states, which have also  shown an interest in participating in the association.    The participation of France, as an observer, involves a very  powerful actor, which opens up a crossword puzzle for the  regional participants. Such a situation also raises the question  of whether the creation of an AEC free trade zone will also open  up to the European and U.S. markets with a direct presence in  the Caribbean basin, the expert indicated. In this regard, the  AEC must be a convergence of regional interests that can iron  out differences with regard to other regional blocs, such as the  NAFTA (United States, Mexico, and Canada).    Drug trafficking, immigration, cultural integration, and  regional security are priority elements on the Caribbean agenda,  and a concerted regional effort must be made to approach these  issues, Serbin said.    On Monday and Tuesday, experts from 30 countries will give  the final touches to the draft charter of the AEC, the  consultations of which will conclude with a ministerial meeting  at the headquarters of the Latin American Economic System (SELA)  on Wednesday.    On 4 July, in Barbados, a new integrationist bloc, with a  gross domestic product of $500 billion, will be announced to the  international public. Its stage will be the Caribbean Sea.</p>

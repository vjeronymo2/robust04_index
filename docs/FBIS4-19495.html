			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [David Wastell and Toby Helm report: "I'll Share Power With </F> Unionists, Says Reynolds"]    [Text] Albert Reynolds, the Irish premier, last night  sketched out a plan for a united Ireland in which Ulster  Unionists would be guaranteed a share in the government.    As London and Dublin began a two-pronged attempt to  revitalise the stalled peace process, Mr Reynolds sought to send  a conciliatory message to the Unionists.    He said his own party, Fianna Fail, and the Ulster Unionist  Party were the two largest parties in Ireland, and both had a  responsibility to seek to "free our people from the present  violent situation -- and to join in developing a better future  for us all in the land we love."    Speaking at a Fianna Fail conference in Dublin -- attended,  for the first time, by a Unionist representative, Belfast  councillor Michael McGimpsey -- Mr Reynolds said he did not  believe unilateral British withdrawal from the North was the  answer.    "On the contrary, there would be a very real danger of  communal violence and the type of violent community upheaval or  worse which has characterised the political situation at  intervals in the past," he said. "That is a scenario which must  never be allowed to happen again."    Realistically, a united Ireland by consent was a long-term  goal, said Mr Reynolds, but both Unionists and nationalists  could play an important part in governing the whole of Ireland.  "I personally would be prepared to provide a guaranteed 30 per  cent of places in an enlarged government -- and throughout the  public sector -- for as long as was necessary, to members of the  two communities in the North in proportion to their respective  population, in accordance with systems that have been developed  on parts of the European Continent."    But Unionists were last night angered that Mr Reynolds had  reopened the prospect of a united Ireland. The Rev Martin  Smyth, Ulster Unionist MP for South Belfast and foreign affairs  spokesman, said they would reject Mr Reynolds's offer "out of  hand." It goes against the constitutional beliefs of all  Unionists.    "I cannot think of anyone who would support it in the  community."</p>

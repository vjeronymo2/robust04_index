			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / UK Company News: British Bio-tech to focus on cancer treatments British Bio-technology, the emerging pharmaceuticals company which floated on the stock market in 1992, yesterday announced it had decided to focus its own-funded research chiefly on products for the treatment of cancer. The statement fuelled speculation that results for the first clinical trial of its lead cancer drug, Batimastat, due to be announced next Thursday, will be favourable. The company also revealed it had patented a new oral version of the drug which would be more suitable for chronic treatment than the current injectable compound. This will start clinical trials next year. Mr Ian Smith, pharmaceuticals analyst at Lehman Brothers, said the decision to concentrate its resources on cancer suggested that the Batimastat trial had gone well. 'This is an important drug, not only for British Bio-technology but for the sector as a whole.' Following a strategic review the company has decided to focus its resources on the cancer treatments which it will fund right through clinical trials and on to the market worldwide. In its other main research areas of inflammatory diseases and virology it will be looking for development and marketing partners. The company reported a loss before tax of Pounds 4.74m for the three months to January 31, compared with a Pounds 3.32m loss for the third quarter last year. The shares, which added 3p to 438p yesterday, have risen 15 per cent in the past month, taking them back above the 425p flotation price. Although the company ended the quarter with cash of Pounds 34.4m it is planning a rights issue this year to fund further product development.</p>

			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRESIDENT WILL HAVE CYST ON HIS FINGER REMOVED TODAY  </P> <P> President Bush will undergo a minor operation today to remove a cyst on the  middle finger of his right hand, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater  said Thursday.  </P> <P> The spokesman said that "clinical observation" by the President's physicians  indicated that the mucoid cyst is benign. Although a biopsy will be performed  on the tissue after it is removed, mucus-filled sacs, by definition, are not  malignant, physicians said.  </P> <P> The surgery, which Bush called "a little tiny operation," will be performed at  Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington under a local anesthetic that  numbs the entire finger. Fitzwater said that while the growth has been present  for three years, "it simply has reached a point where it has gotten larger and  noticeable in (the President's) daily activities, and so he'd like to have it  removed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Causes Some Anxiety  </P> <P> "It's not really painful, but it's a nuisance in the sense that it is large  enough to cause him some anxiety," the spokesman said.  </P> <P> He described the procedure as routine, and said that it would be performed at  the hospital rather than in the White House physician's office, because "it  does require anesthetic, it requires an incision . . . and it will require  stitches."  </P> <P> Besides, he said, "you never know . . . what it takes to get it out of there  once you get in."  </P> <P> The cyst is positioned between the fingernail and the upper joint. Bush is  expected to be in and out of the hospital within an hour.  </P> <P> The location of the growth was the subject of good-natured teasing Thursday  when Bush posed for photographs at the start of a meeting with Jonas Savimbi, a  leader of the Angolan resistance group, UNITA.  </P> <P> When a reporter asked him to "show us which one hurts," the President laughed  and replied: "Don't tempt me! Come on, it is this finger -- this middle one."  </P> <P> He then pointed his ailing finger downward.  </P> <P> "This finger is sometimes identified with a bad gesture in the United States,"  he explained to Savimbi.  </P> <P> Bush also joked that "I have to undergo a serious operation. I will show you my  scar afterwards."  </P> <P> The procedure to remove the cyst commonly involves making an incision,  spreading the skin around the growth, tying the sac at its roots in the joint,  snipping it off and then sewing up the incision, according to Dr. John Reeves,  a dermatologist at UC San Francisco.  </P> <P> Other, less invasive, treatments involve draining the sac and injecting  cortisone, or giving the patient sterile needles to drain the sac himself  several times over a period of weeks.  </P> <P> Reeves said that the growth, which occurs more often in older people, is rarely  painful, although it can sometimes produce pressure or discomfort.  </P> <P> The surgery will be performed by Dr. Allen Smith, a colonel in the Army Medical  Corps and chief of hand surgery at Walter Reed, and by Dr. George Bogumill,  chief of hand surgery at Georgetown University Hospital. The anesthetic will be  administered by Dr. Charles Gandy, an Army lieutenant colonel stationed at  Walter Reed.  </P> <P> After the surgery, Bush plans to fly by helicopter to Camp David, Md., for the  three-day Columbus Day holiday. On Sunday, he will leave the presidential  retreat to speak to the National Federation of Republican Women, meeting in  Baltimore.  </P></p>

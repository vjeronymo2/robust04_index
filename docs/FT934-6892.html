			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Builders launch quality forum Construction industry leaders yesterday launched an initiative to stamp out building defects which they say cost the industry more than Pounds 1bn a year. The Construction Quality Forum will draw its members from developers, contractors, architects, subcontractors and building material producers. These will be expected to pool information on defects in a new national database to be established by the forum. Task forces from the industry and the government-sponsored Building Research Establishment will be established to resolve any common problems which emerge. The Department of the Environment, mainly through its construction sponsorship directorate, has provided Pounds 100,000 to establish the scheme which is expected eventually to become self-financing from selling services and from fees levied on members. The project, to be run by the Building Research Establishment, is supported by building insurance companies as well as contractors and property developers. Mr Paul Shepherd, managing director of Shepherd Construction said: 'The cost to the industry of defects is greater than the combined profits of all contractors. There is therefore real scope to in-crease financial performance.'</p>

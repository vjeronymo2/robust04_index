			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Technology: Ice that thinks it's a liquid It sounds like part of a fictional arctic vision of the future, a cold and forbidding landscape where computers hold sway. But binary ice is not something in the science fiction books and its applications are the mundane ones of the supermarket and the industrial plant. Developed by a British company called Solmecs Flo-Ice Systems, binary ice is formed through the suspension of microscopic ice crystals in a salt, sugar or alcohol solution. It has the properties of normal ice from frozen water but behaves like a liquid. This means it can be pumped and easily stored. Solmecs has been developing Flo-Ice technology for the past six years and has licensees in 20 countries in Europe (mainly Germany), Asia, Africa and South America. It hopes to conclude a further deal in France for use in supermarkets. Interest from British companies, however, is still lagging. 'There's lots of inertia over here,' says Len Constant, a Solmecs director, about UK companies' response to new ideas. With concern growing about the harmful impact on the atmosphere of refrigerants containing CFCs, Solmecs believes that the greater use of binary ice would have both commercial and environmental benefits. 'The increasingly intense discussion about future refrigerants is creating headaches for manufacturers of refrigeration equipment, installers and especially for end-users,' Joachim Paul, head of German-based Integral Technologie (a part owner of Solmecs), said in a recent paper to the UK's Institute of Refrigeration. Crystals of binary ice have a high heat absorption rate and, in their main application, can act as a secondary refrigerant flowing round large cooling systems at temperatures below zero. This allows companies to cut down on harmful primary refrigerants which are being phased out anyway. The need for large pipes and cooling equipment is thus reduced. Ice can also be made at night, when energy is generally cheaper, and pumped into a storage tank for use in the daytime.</p>

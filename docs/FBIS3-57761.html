The removal of Stanislav Shushkevich from the post of the  Belarussian parliament chairman was an unpleasant surprise for  Moscow and quite unexpected by Russian diplomats, according to  ITOGI host Yevgeniy Kiselev. He said the removal of Shushkevich  "means nothing good for Russian-Belarussian relations".    "Yeltsin has lost reliable ally who unconditionally took his  side last October," Kiselev said. "The Belarussian leader was  one of the few commonwealth leaders on whose loyalty Yeltsin  could always count. Shushkevich's reputation was very high also  on the international arena where he was viewed as a reformer and  a staunch advocate of the market economy.    A report from Minsk about the events preceding Shushkevich's  resignation and reaction to the fact in Russia and other  countries cited different views on what happened in Belarus.  Belarussian Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich disagreed with the  allegation that the toppling of Shushkevich was tantamount to a  "communist coup". "It was nothing of the kind. All the forces  in the pariament remained there and the policy pursued by the  parliament will continue to be pursued, Kebich said.    Itogi paid much attention to the unification of the monetary  systems of Russia and Belarus and the creation of a single  rouble zone of these two countries. According to a survey  conducted by the public opinion fund, 32 per cent of Russian  citizens last week believed that Russia should unify its  monetary system with that of Belarus, even if the Russian  economy suffers from the move. Fifty per cent of those polled  were opposed to the move, and 18 per cent had not yet made up  their minds.    As concerns changes in the Russian Government, most Russian  voters were "sceptical in their attitude", according to Yevgeniy  Kiselev. He proceeded from the results of another poll  conducted by the public opinion fund which revealed that 27 per  cent of those polled believed the reshuffle would affect  negatively the lives of the Russian people. Only 17 per cent  believed that the resignations and reshuffles in the government  would yield a positive result. Thirty per cent of those polled  said the government changes would not affect the life of the  population in any way. Twenty-six per cent were uncertain.    "The results of the past two years enable us to say that  many  tasks in reforming our economy and switching to a market economy  have failed to be accomplished," economist Stanislav Shatalin  said in an interview with the Ostankino television Sunday  programme Voskresenye. "An analysis of the past two years shows  that we must re-define guidelines for our social and economic  policy," Shatalin said.    "While the past week was critical and most unpleasant in the  political career of one of the initiators of the commonwealth,  Stanislav Shushkevich who resigned under the insupportable  burden of the problems -- political and economic -- which arose  in the wake of the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the  coming week threatens much unexpected in connection with the  same problems to another consignee of the first commonwealth  agreement, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk", Kiselev said.  Much will depend on the outcome of the second round of the  presidential elections in the Crimea, he said. A report from  Simferopol made it clear that the pro-Russia Yuriy Meshkov was  running well ahead of his rival in the first presidential  elections in the peninsula republic contested by Ukraine and  Russia.    Itogi recalled that a criminal cases was opened last week  against parliament member Vladimir Zhirinovskiy who heads the  parliamentary faction of the Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia.  Zhirinovskiy is charged with war propaganda under Article 71 of  the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.    First Deputy Chief of the Federal Counter-Intelligence  Service Lieutenant-General Sergey Stepashin spoke in an  interview with Itogi about the aims and tasks of this  organisation established on the basis of the former Security  Ministry. He said that although the number of the personnel has  been cut almost by half, the number of operational,  counter-intellligence units remained the same. Asked if the  names of KGB informers would be made public, Stepashin said, "We  will do everything to prevent it". He explained that all  similar services across the world maintained "undercover  personnels", "regardless of whether the state is democratic,  anti- democratic, communist or any other". Moreover he said it  was wrong not to keep the promise of confidence given to former  KGB informers, because "it was destroy their lives". The  general expressed anxiety about the considerable leaks of  nuclear, military and other technologies, as well as about  attempts at recruiting Russian researchers and specialists by  foreign special services.    Itogi reported on the latest developments in the Vil  Mirzayanov's affair -- this Russian chemist is now in custody on  charges of revealing state secrets relating to the production of  new chemical weapons in Russia. The programme reported that  Mirzayanov's colleague Vladimir Uglev announced his intention to  make public on February 4 the formula of the secret chemical  substance unless Vil Mirzayanov was released by that time.</p>

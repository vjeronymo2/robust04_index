			<p>BFN     [Text] A negotiation team of the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] arrived in Beijing this morning. This  negotiation team will enter North Korea tomorrow and have  consultations over details of how it will go about witnessing  the replacement of nuclear fuel rods at the Yongbyon atomic  reactor. Correspondent Yi Tong-sik provides us with this report  from Beijing:    [Begin recording] Two IAEA inspectors led by Inspections  Bureau chief (Perry Corse) arrived in Beijing via Scandinavian  Airways this morning. At the airport, he said only that he  would enter Pyongyang via Koryo Airlines tomorrow afternoon and  have discussions over technical matters in North Korea.    He added that he would soon meet the team conducting  additional inspections in North Korea, including Inspections  Section Chief (Heinonen). Therefore, he is expected to be  presented with a comprehensive report in North Korea, from  Inspections Section Chief (Heinonen) on the status of witnessing  and observing the replacement of nuclear fuel rods at the 5-MW  atomic reactor in Yongbyon and the sample-taking at the  radiochemical laboratory.    Although the IAEA negotiation team says that it will only  have discussions over technical matters, the main goal of the  negotiations of this time is reportedly to ask the North Korean  side to take necessary measures for confirming, and continuing  to confirm in the future, too, whether nuclear material has not  been diverted since the atomic reactor began operations in  (?1986) until now.    Those in diplomatic circles in Beijing predict, however,  that  these negotiations will not proceed smoothly, because although  the IAEA teams are being allowed to visit North Korea to witness  inspections, they will only be allowed to witness the sealing of  the removed nuclear fuel under the pretext of North Korea being  in a unique situation in which it has suspended the withdrawal  from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Traders angered by rise in charges on credit cards A LEADING RETAILERS' representative yesterday warned the high-street banks that their plans to increase credit card service charges may lead to reduced co-operation from retailers in the fight against fraud. Mr Bob Woodman, a director of the Retailers' Consortium, said price increases by Barclays and National Westminster had taken the spotlight away from the fraud issue, expected to cost the banks about Pounds 200m this year. He asked: 'How can we co-operate with them when there is this sort of friction between our two industries?' In the past two weeks Barclays and National Westminster have started writing to retailer customers informing them that the merchant service charge - the commission paid on credit-card transactions - will have to go up. The banks say reduced volumes of business are forcing them into losses on their credit card merchant services in spite of reduced costs and a price rise in unavoidable. Both NatWest and Barclays say that retailers pay an average merchant service charge of 1.6 per cent, though this varies from about 1 per cent for very large groups with a lot of negotiating power to as much as 4 per cent for some small businesses. Barclays Merchant Services, the plastic card processing arm of Barclays, said yesterday it would be raising charges by less than 10 per cent. This would mean an increase of about 14p per Pounds 100 of turnover for its average retailer customer. Privately bankers admit that they priced their credit card services too low in their scramble to enter the market from 1989. Until then, credit card merchant services in the UK were provided only by Barclaycard for Visa and by Access for MasterCard. Individual banks did not compete in the market. Barclays says that average merchant service charges fell by 26 per cent in the two years since 1989. Only one bank, Lloyds, says it is currently making a small profit from credit-card merchant services, but it admits that business volumes have dropped sharply because of the recession. Its 1991 results, published yesterday, show that its credit card income, including annual fees, fell to Pounds 72m from Pounds 81m a year earlier. Barclays last night dismissed the idea that the price increases might harm co-operation with retailers over fraud. 'It must be as much in the interests of retailers to discourage fraud as it is in ours.'</p>

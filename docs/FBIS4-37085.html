			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday sent PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat a letter in which he replies to the three  messages sent by the PLO chairman over recent days. The Rabin  response was sent to 'Arafat through a Palestinian mediator.  Earlier this week the prime minister said 'Arafat's letters  dealt with issues relating to the autonomy agreements and  problems that have arisen in the territories. Qol Yisra'el's  diplomatic correspondent says it appears the issues include the  closure on the territories, and clashes in Hebron between  Palestinians and Israeli soldiers and civilians.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Quadramatic buys Quota companies for Pounds 11.25m QUADRAMATIC, the coin-handling and optical group which came to the market in July, has moved swiftly to fulfil its promise to build a specialist engineering group by acquisition. The Oldham-based group is paying Pounds 11.25m for Quota, a private holding company for two high-technology businesses. Datapaq, based in Cambridge, supplies thermal monitoring systems. Automatic System Laboratories, a Milton Keynes company makes calibrating equipment for laboratories. The consideration is to be satisfied by raising Pounds 10.25m through a placing and open offer of 7m new shares at 145p per share and the issue of 689,800 shares to the vendors. Some 2.2m of the new shares have been placed firm with the remainder being offered to existing shareholders on a 1-for-4.18 basis. Quadramatic was floated at 123p, valuing the group at Pounds 36.4m. The shares yesterday closed 6p higher at 155p. Mr Tony Gartland, Quadramatic's chairman, said the businesses fulfilled the acquisition criteria he identified at the time of the flotation - that they should be earnings-enhancing, have quality products with good gross margins and growth potential. Datapaq, which also has a US operation in Massachusetts, reported turnover of Pounds 4.5m in the year to June 30 for operating profits of Pounds 1.3m. ASL had sales of Pounds 2.7m in the 15 months to June 30 and made an operating profit of Pounds 113,000. Mr Gartland said his group would keep the existing management and workforce of both companies. However the vendors, Mr Stephen Black and Mr Ian Williams, will play no further role in the company. He believed Datapaq's expertise could be extended into monitoring pressure and humidity, while ASL's products could be broadened out from the laboratory level to the much bigger industrial market. Quadramatic expects pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.59m and earnings of 9.8p.</p>

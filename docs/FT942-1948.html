			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Argentina miracle needs more foreign capital: Stephen Fidler and John Barham on a threat to high-growth, low-inflation economic policies For three years, President Carlos Menem of Argentina and his economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, have looked like economic miracle workers. Since 1990, when consumer prices rose by more than 2,300 per cent, they have brought inflation down to single digits, with the figure for the year to May, 3.4 per cent, the lowest in 41 years. But this has not been achieved at the price of a recession - in fact, just the opposite: from 1991 to the end of 1993, the Argentine economy expanded 25.5 per cent. The medicine for this magic combination of low inflation and high growth has been big inflows of foreign capital. The government's fiscal rectitude, the settlement of its 1980s bank debt defaults and Mr Cavallo's convertibility plan - which fixed by law the Argentine peso at parity to the US dollar - have led to enthusiastic support of the Argentine economy by foreign investors. An estimated Dollars 33.5bn (Pounds 22bn) of capital flowed into the country in three years, more than half - Dollars 17.6bn - entering last year. This year, though, things look different. Since February 4, when the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates, foreign investors have been stingier and inflows to almost all emerging markets have slowed. In Argentina, where the convertibility plan means there is a direct relation between capital inflows and money supply, slower capital inflows mean slower growth. As a result, Mr Miguel Angel Broda, who runs an economics consultancy in Buenos Aires, expects growth to fall this year to 3.5 per cent, from 6 per cent last year. Yet slowing growth and dependence on volatile foreign capital are not the only economic worries for Mr Menem, who is seeking, from a special assembly now in session, a constitutional revision to let him seek re-election next year. Argentine trade sank further into deficit in the first four months of the year - Dollars 2.4bn, against only Dollars 500m in the equivalent period of 1993 - providing grist for critics who say the peso is much overvalued. Yet Mr Cavallo says he is unworried. Although the deficit is high in terms of Argentina's trade - it has been running at more than half the level of exports - it is small compared with the size of the economy. Even if the deficit continues at this rate for the rest of the year, which is unlikely because of higher crop prices from May, it will be equivalent to less than 3 per cent of GDP. What's more, Mr Cavallo says, the figures also indicate a big jump in capital goods imports, providing the base for a new export sector. But economists say government statistics are inadequate and probably overstate investment. Even Mr Cavallo recognises that investment, 18.4 per cent of GDP last year, is too low, although he says it was 28 per cent higher in the first quarter than a year earlier. For more than a year, Mr Cavallo has promised measures to encourage domestic saving - necessary to reduce dependence on capital inflows - and investment. But the government's private pension fund plan has got off to a disappointing start and, says Mr Rosendo Fraga, a political analyst, there has been a paralysis in new structural economic reforms as Mr Menem has manoeuvred for the chance of re-election. The elections in April for the constituent assembly were also a setback, with Mr Menem doing less well than he had hoped, and a strong showing by the left being interpreted as an indicator of increasing concern about social issues, such as poverty and rising unemployment. Indeed, says Mr Broda, the overall strong economic indicators hide some profound weaknesses. 'There are some provinces where GDP has fallen 25 per cent in three years. There are geographical and sectoral distributions which are very different to the overall picture.' This has emphasised, says Mr Broda, 'that Menem is more dependent on Cavallo and the performance of the economy'. It has also 'put the government on the defensive. I don't think that, in the next year, they can advance the reform.' Yet, while developments such as riots last December in the provincial capital of Santiago del Estero have given cause for concern, few observers believe Argentina is on the verge of imminent social crisis. Mr Broda says the government had pushed through 85 per cent of the necessary reforms but that, without labour and social security reforms, 'you can't guarantee that you aren't going to have problems.' He and others believe there is a strong probability that capital flows will be sufficient to maintain growth in positive figures until beyond the presidential election, due to take place in the April-June period next year. The government has some leeway to supplement those flows for the coming 12 months - for example, by selling its remaining stakes in privatised companies. The sale of its shareholding in YPF, the privatised national oil company in which the government retains 20 per cent, could raise close to Dollars 2bn. Yet this cushion will not last for ever. By next year, the government will have run out of assets to privatise. Without growth in its capacity for exports and in domestic savings, there will remain grave doubts about Argentina's capacity, in the long run, to pay its way in the world. Until these doubts are removed, the inexorable logic of the convertibility plan means that a slowing of capital inflows will cause a deceleration of the economy. The survival of the Argentine economic plan will then depend on the willingness of Mr Menem - or of a successor - to tolerate recession.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] (HTV) -- Croatian Radio-Television Journal comments  on the proposal to appoint Veljko Knezevic the head of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] Government Office in  Zagreb:    ``Yesterday's news that Veljko Knezevic, former Zagreb  Radio-Television director, well-known albeit not held in good  repute, was proposed to be the head of the FRY Government Office  in Zagreb has spurred much comment and naturally posed some  questions.    ``The Belgrade Government has the right to propose its  representative in Zagreb; however, Croatia has the right to  accept or reject this appointment. If Knezevic's arrival means  that Belgrade wants to speed up the normalization of relations  and assure Knin's consent to its inclusion in the  constitutional-legal system of the Republic of Croatia with the  help of a man born in Knin, then it is expected that Zagreb will  accept this proposal. If, however, this appointment is intended  as a provocation, which cannot be excluded by any means, then  Croatia should not accept such a choice because it would  certainly not lead to a normalization of relations, which, we  repeat, is not only in the interest of Croatia, but should be  even more in the interest of Belgrade.    ``One may ask: What is the meaning of Knezevic's agreement  to  being appointed the Yugoslav representative in Zagreb. A logical  answer is that he has recognized the Republic of Croatia and  therefore would work towards the normalization of relations as  soon as possible.    "Of course, all this is pure speculation about what is  possible, but we will not need to wait long for the answers."</p>

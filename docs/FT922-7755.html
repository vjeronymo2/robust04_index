			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Dreams of China keep Hong Kong in favour / Review of the market's prospects Given its reputation for volatility, the 51 per cent rise over the last 12 months in the Hong Kong stock market should set off investors' alarm bells. Three years ago, Hong Kong equities traded at a discount because of the political uncertainty in China, but positive comments on economic reform from Beijing in recent months have virtually removed this risk factor, and the market is enjoying an upward re-rating. In 1991, Hong Kong was the best performing major stock market in the world, with the Hang Seng index climbing 42 per cent. This year, the index has risen 33 per cent to close at 5,704.50 yesterday. The stockbroking community is unanimous in its desire for a brief consolidation, but the weight of foreign money has kept the stock market firm. There are many reasons for the recent record-breaking rally. Corporate earnings for the Hang Seng index constituents are expected to grow by 20 per cent this year and next. The upswing in the economy is continuing, with 6 per cent GDP growth expected in 1992, against 4 per cent in 1991. The decision to go ahead with the Dollars HK112bn (Dollars 14.5bn) airport programme lifted overseas confidence last year, and the resolution of trade disputes between the US and China in January received whole-hearted institutional support. Despite its recent bull run, Hong Kong does not appear expensive. According to Baring Securities, the Hang Seng index is trading on a 1992 price/earnings (p/e) multiple of 11.9 and a 1993 p/e of 10.1. This makes Hong Kong cheaper than other investment destinations in south east Asia, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan and Indonesia. The p/e situation has been recognised by regional fund managers. The US fund managers, in particular, have been hypnotised by tales of China's economic potential. There has also been a substantial increase in retail investment. In 1989, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dispelled the myth that everyone from road sweepers to taxi drivers played the stock market, when it found that only 10 per cent of the adult population invested in equities. But in 1992 they have come back with a vengeance. The negative differential between the cost of borrowing and inflation in Hong Kong provides a strong incentive for local investors to remain in equities. The next interest rate down, as the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar demands a tracking of US interest rates. However, two factors could burst the bubble in Hong Kong: a drastic change of direction in China, and a weakening of the Hong Kong property market. The latter has been a concern as a result of government measures to quell property speculation, which has resulted in a sharp decline in turnover, but not in prices. Negative interest rates are a compelling reason why the property market should sustain the 10 per cent gain recorded in the first quarter, since property has always been the traditional hedge against inflation in Hong Kong. But at the same time, interest rate cuts put upward pressure on inflation. Analysts say that the territory's economic performance can be maintained in spite of double-digit inflation, so long as China remains a major attraction. China is a greater concern. Since the Tiananmen Square massacre in May, 1989, Sino-American relations have come into the foreground during this month, as the annual renewal of Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status is debated. Renewal for 1992/1993 is almost certain. However, the debate on renewal for next year could become a major issue in the US presidential election in November. This would hurt Hong Kong, where the failure to renew MFN would knock close to 2 per cent off its GDP. The engine for growth in Hong Kong has been in the neighbouring Guangdong province. Its economy is now overheating, with inflation on the rise; the last time this happened, in 1988/1989, a severe austerity programme ensued. China's paramount and aged leader, Deng Xiaoping, is in the middle of a power struggle between reformists and conservatives. Deng has considerable support for his economic reforms, but some observers say a setback is possible. It has been some time, for example, since the stock market has fallen on rumours of his death. HSBC's bid for Midland Bank could cause some uncertainty in the stock market, especially as the offer deadline on June 9 draws near. Since the Hong Kong market has always tended to over-react, some caution is advisable. Investors are sitting on substantial profits and it is only natural that they will want to cash in part of their winnings. But overall, analysts do not foresee a significant downside in the market, as current attitudes suggest that any setback will be seen as a long-term buying opportunity. 'We feel the Hang Seng index justifies a p/e of 13 .. and this would mean the index should be trading at 7,500 by the end of 1993,' says Mr Clive Weedon, research director of ChinTung Securities. This sort of optimism gives little incentive to sell.</p>

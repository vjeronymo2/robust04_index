			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 26 Feb (DPA) -- Peruvian Army Chief General  Nicolas De Bari Hermoza said today in Lima that the Armed Forces  does not control the government and affirmed that President  Alberto Fujimori holds the reins of the country.    In a brief news conference, Hermoza, who is also commander  of  the Armed Forces Joint Command, rejected allegations by local  and foreign observers that Fujimori is "mortgaged" to the Armed  Forces.    "Military forces have no influence on the government  whatsoever, and any statement to the contrary is groundless,"  Hermoza said. Several publications and commentators have  described him as the virtual "power behind the throne" in Peru.    Gen. Hermoza added that it is clear to the Armed Forces that  "Fujimori is the nation's first citizen based on the people's  democratic will," and therefore "he is the supreme chief of the  Armed Forces to whom it owes discipline and subordination."    Criticism has intensified in Peru and abroad about what many  have openly defined as "a civilian-military government" after  Congress and the government approved a controversial law giving  military courts authority to try a case involving a massacre  committed by soldiers.    Independent politicians, opposition leaders, observers from  various groups, and local and foreign media have said that the  government's "secretive attitude" corroborates the presumed  submission of civilian authorities to the military forces.    Fujimori has repeatedly said that it is not subordination  but  identification between the government and the military forces on  everything concerning the struggle against terrorism and drug  trafficking.</p>

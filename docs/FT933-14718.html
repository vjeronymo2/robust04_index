			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Leading Article: US-Japan trade WE AGREE,' declared last week's communique from the summit of the seven leading industrial countries 'that no recourse should be made to initiatives and arrangements that threaten to undermine the multilateral, open trading system.' After uttering these fine words, the US and Japanese governments promptly announced agreement on a new 'negotiating framework' to resolve the bilateral issues that divide them. Communiques are often ignored, but their promises usually last more than a few hours. The framework does not, at least so far, either establish quantitative goals for changes in Japanese macro-economic policy or lay down precise criteria by which the opening of the Japanese economy can be assessed. The two agreed aims are simply a reduction in Japan's current account surplus and the opening of markets. Talks on the latter are to be subdivided further into Japanese public procurement, particularly of foreign computers, supercomputers, satellites, medical technology and telecommunications; regulatory reform, which covers financial services, insurance, the distribution network and competition policy; 'other major sectors', particularly cars and car parts; economic harmonisation, including intellectual property; and the monitoring of agreements. One question is whether the objectives make sense. The answer is that they do so only up to a point. Faster growth in Japanese demand is desirable, for example, but a smaller external surplus may well not be. A second question is whether the 'objective criteria' the Japanese have proposed as a way of assessing the openness of their markets will turn into precise target, or not. Probably they will. Results-oriented trade would then become managed trade. A final question is whether these proposals are consistent with the summit's declaration in favour of multilateralism. They are not, in at least three respects: first, participants other than the US and Japan have been excluded; second, the discussion is being conducted outside the purview of the Gatt; finally, the agenda is dictated by specific US concerns. Many in the US believe that their concerns are more legitimate than those of other countries. They are mistaken. Judged by the ratio of their bilateral deficits to their total trade with Japan, many countries have a bigger problem, among them being Hong Kong, Taiwan and the European Community as a whole. Other countries should address their own demands to Tokyo. The US and Japan would probably reply that they are not powerful enough for a seat at the table, which would at least confirm the emptiness of the summit's declaration in favour of multilateralism. But perhaps the two powers would feel obliged to agree. Then the discussion would involve all of Japan's trading partners, not just the US. This particular cartel needs to be broken right now.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Indonesia attacked on E Timor human rights AMNESTY International said yesterday that Indonesia has arrested hundreds of suspected supporters of independence for East Timor ahead of the first anniversary of the November 12 massacre by Indonesian troops, Reuter reports from Lisbon. The London-based human rights group said Indonesia tortured political detainees and had failed to honour United Nations resolutions and recommendations on the former Portuguese colony. 'Torture and ill-treatment of political detainees continues to be both common and routine,' Amnesty said in a statement, made available to Reuters in Lisbon. 'In the weeks prior to the anniversary of the massacre, the authorities arrested hundreds of suspected suporters of East Timor's independence to prevent them from publicly and peacefully expressing their political views,' Amnesty said. Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 a few months after the departure of Portugal's colonial administration and annexed the territory of 750,000 people a year later. On November 12 last year, Indonesian troops fired on a crowd of anti-Indonesian demonstrators at a cemetery in the East Timor capital Dili, provoking international outcry. Eyewitnesses said up to 180 people were killed, but an official Indonesian report said 50 had died.</p>

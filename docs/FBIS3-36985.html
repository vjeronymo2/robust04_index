Igor Nikoforov, leader of the Independent Miners' Union in  the Pechorashakhtstroy concern told Interfax that the workers  would continue their protest action until back payment was  guaranteed to them.    Currently, 121 strikers are staying underground and about  the  same number of them engaging in a sit-in at surface  installations. Nearly 20 of them have come down with the flu.    Nikoforov, who stayed the weekend with the strikers trying  to  convince them to leave the pit and continue their action in  surface installations, said that the men were desperate. "They  are increasingly irritated with the indifference on the part of  the government and some of them suggest addressing the Liberal  Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy on the theory that  he would respond, at least," Nikiforov said.    "The strikers are demanding what they have earned and are  tired of problems in collecting the cash due them," Nikiforov  continued. They told him that they did not care who the  president or the prime minister is when their families are  starving.    The union has run out of the strike fund and has no cash to  buy foodstuffs for the mine construction workers, Nikiforov said.</p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Teamsters start haulage strike Picket lines went up across the US yesterday as the once powerful Teamsters' union launched its first big strike in 15 years against 22 road haulage companies, but little immediate effect was felt on deliveries, George Graham reports from Washington. Mr Ron Carey, Teamsters' president, called about 75,000 members out on strike after talks broke down over haulage companies' plan to use more part-time workers and to send more goods by rail. 'We have no other choice but to strike,' Mr Carey said. The companies targeted by the Teamsters' strike, which belong to a negotiating consortium called Trucking Management Inc, handle about half of all consolidated road freight in the US - single loads made up of consignments that on their own make up less than a full truck-load. They include haulage companies such as Consolidated Freightways, ABF Freight Systems, and Roadway Express, which have faced increasing competition from parcel delivery companies such as UPS. The strike is most likely to affect deliveries of manufacturing components, small finished goods and non-perishable groceries, but is not expected to constrict food supplies, since most supermarket chains have their own truck fleets. The trucking companies ship between 5 and 15 per cent of their freight by rail, but had proposed a new contract allowing up to 35 per cent to move by rail. They also wanted a quarter of the work in their terminals to be done by part-time workers, giving them more flexibility to deal with peaks in demand. Mr Carey's leadership has been challenged, and the union's finances, notably its strike fund, are in poor shape.</p>

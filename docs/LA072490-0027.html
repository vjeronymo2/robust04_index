			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN KILLED BY POLICE HAD HISTORY OF  PSYCHOSIS  </P> <P> A 69-year-old Los Angeles man, who was shot and killed Sunday by police in the  Westlake district, had a history of psychosis and had recently learned his  failing health had gotten worse, said an administrator at the retirement home  where he lived.  </P> <P> Frank Monteleone -- who allegedly threatened two Los Angeles police officers  with a knife while he exclaimed, "Go ahead and shoot me.  </P> <P> I have cancer anyway" -- had been refusing sedative medicine for about two  months, the administrator said.  </P> <P> Monteleone had been suffering from heart disease, glaucoma and an ulcer since  he moved to the Grandview Retirement Home on 6th Street about a year ago, said  Grandview director Charlene Prall. According to workers at the retirement home,  a physician had told Monteleone about two weeks ago that he was suffering from  cancer, Prall said. However, initial autopsy reports showed no sign of cancer,  said Bob Dambacher of the county medical examiner's office.  </P></p>

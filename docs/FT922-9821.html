			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Observer: Accountants in the red While singing the praises of its profession, the annual report of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales suggests it might do well to learn some of the business skills its members are expected to possess. Glowing words describing its activities nestle among colour photos of its London edifice at Moorgate Place. The figures at the back are rather more disappointing: the Institute is in the red for the second year running, with a pre-tax operating deficit of Pounds 241,000. Income rose slightly faster than expenditure, but even with a Pounds 117,000 tax offset the growing number of bureaucratic bean-counters (up from 386 to 415 staff) were forced to knock Pounds 124,000 off their reserves. Accountancy, its glossy magazine, and courses and conferences were among the loss-makers. To be fair, the losses are lower than last year, at a time when the Institute has had additional statutory obligations. It has also launched an ambitious campaign to persuade its members to vote to raise subscriptions. Still, the Institute is certainly not selling off the family silver to make up the shortfall. It purchased another Pounds 15,000 worth of silver and antiques to add to its revalued Pounds 2.4m collection. Readers may doubtless also be gratified to know that the value of wine held as stock has increased to no less than Pounds 59,000. In the meantime, members should perhaps be grateful that their Institute refrained from merger discussions last year - and hope that it does not indulge again for a while. The 1990 accounts show a remarkable extraordinary item of Pounds 240,000 incurred in relation to the 'joint consultation process' for the failed merger with the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy - in part payable, no doubt, to accountants acting as advisers.</p>

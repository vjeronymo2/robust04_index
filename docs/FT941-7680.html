			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Swedish PM defends EU budget demand: European Union enlargement negotiations A rejection of Sweden's controversial demand for reductions in its budgetary contributions during its first five years in the European Union would threaten the campaign for approval of union membership in a promised referendum, according to Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister. In a strong defence of Stockholm's attempt to phase in its budgetary contributions, Mr Bildt said having to pay up from year one the full SKr19bn-Skr20bn (Dollars 2.42bn) in gross contributions Sweden calculates it will owe would cause 'a severe fiscal shock' at a time when the government is having to cut back public spending to control a budget deficit running at almost 15 per cent of gross domestic product. 'That would cause us real difficulties in the referendum campaign,' Mr Bildt said in an interview. Sweden's demand, lodged last week, that it be exempt from three-fifths of its gross contributions for the first three years and not pay in full until the sixth year has strengthened counter demands from existing members, led by Spain, on how the new EU members' contributions are spent. Negotiations on terms of accession for Sweden and its fellow-applicants Austria, Finland and Norway are reaching a make-or-break stage with the EU's March 1 deadline for completion now less than a week away. If the deadline is missed, the target date of January 1 1995 for the four to enter the EU could lapse. Mr Bildt stressed that Sweden's budget demand was temporary.' We fully accept that Sweden will become one of the greatest - if not the greatest - per capita contributor to the budget. We are asking only that our present difficulties be taken into account for the first few years.' He said he remained optimistic that the accession talks could be completed by the March 1 deadline, but he attacked one Spanish demand, that the four applicants be excluded from plans to establish a European monetary union. 'It is plainly absurd to say we should be without any say on Emu. They cannot seriously think that this can be acceptable,' he said.</p>

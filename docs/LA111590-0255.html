			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BRITISH JOBLESSNESS UP SHARPLY  </P> <P> British unemployment showed its biggest monthly jump since 1986 in October,  rising above 1.7 million and bringing more bad news for embattled Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher.  </P> <P> Government figures released today showed the jobless line longer by 32,200 at  1,702,700, or 6% of the work force.  </P> <P> Economic troubles are among the reasons Thatcher's popularity has waned,  leading to a current bid to unseat her by former Defense Minister Michael  Heseltine.  </P> <P> After declining for four years, the number of jobless turned up again in March  and Employment Secretary Michael Howard said the rise is likely to continue  before Christmas.  </P> <P> British unemployment remains lower than in Spain, Ireland, Italy, France,  Denmark, Belgium, Greece and the Netherlands.  </P></p>

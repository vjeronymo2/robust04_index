			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> &bull;The hospital-specific rate multiplied by the DRG relative weight for the discharge and by the applicable hospital-specific transition blend percentage for the cost reporting period; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The adjusted Federal rate multiplied by the Federal transition blend percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The blend percentages for cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1995 are 40 percent of the adjusted Federal rate and 60 percent of the hospital-specific rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hospitals may also receive outlier payments for those cases that qualify under the thresholds established for each fiscal year. Section 412.312(c) provides for a single set of thresholds to identify outlier cases for both inpatient operating and inpatient capital-related payments. Outlier payments are made only on that portion of the Federal rate that is used to calculate the hospital's inpatient capital-related payments. For fully prospective hospitals, that will be 40 percent of the Federal rate for discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning during FY 1995. Thus, a fully prospective hospital will receive 40 percent of the capital-related outlier payment calculated for the case for discharges occurring in cost reporting periods beginning in FY 1995. For hold-harmless hospitals paid 85 percent of their reasonable costs for old inpatient capital, the portion of the Federal rate that is included in the hospital's outlier payments is based on the hospital's ratio of Medicare inpatient costs for new capital to total Medicare inpatient capital costs. For hold-harmless hospitals that are paid 100 percent of the Federal rate, 100 percent of the Federal rate is included in the hospital's outlier payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rules to establish outlier thresholds for FY 1995 are published in section II.A.4.c of the Addendum to this proposed rule. For FY 1995 we are proposing that a case qualifies as a cost outlier if the cost for the case (after standardization for the indirect teaching adjustment and disproportionate share adjustment) is greater than the prospective payment rate for the DRG plus $23,300. We are also proposing that a case qualifies as a day outlier for FY 1995 if the length of stay is greater than the geometric mean length of stay for the DRG plus the lesser of three standard deviations of the length of stay or 22 days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the capital prospective payment system transition period, any hospital may also receive an additional payment under an exceptions process if its total inpatient capital-related payments are less than a minimum percentage of its allowable Medicare inpatient capital-related costs. The minimum payment level is established by class of hospital under &sect;412.348. The minimum payment levels for portions of cost reporting periods occurring in FY 1995 are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Sole community hospitals (located in either an urban or rural area), 90 percent;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Urban hospitals with at least 100 beds and a disproportionate share patient percentage of at least 20.2 percent and urban hospitals with at least 100 beds that qualify for disproportionate share payments under &sect;412.106(c)(2), 80 percent; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All other hospitals, 70 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

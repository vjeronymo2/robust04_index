			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (1): A favourable moment THE euphoria of regained liberty has been replaced by sober recognition of the difficulties that lie ahead. But the Poland which is now busy building a market economy and pluralistic democracy has a vitality about it which bodes well for the future. Poland has had fresh starts - and tragic disappointments-before. It is one of Europe's historic nations -and wears that history like an old, familiar coat. When times are hard, or when fate opens up new perspectives, Poles tend to dig into its pockets for solace or instruction. The liberal constitution proclaimed on May 3, 1791 by Stanislaus Augustus, King of Poland 'by the grace of God and will of the Nation', was one of those glorious attempted fresh starts. The memory of its liberties sustained the nation through the dark years when the state itself was wiped from the map of Europe. By happy quirk of fate the 200th anniversary of that constitution is now being celebrated by a new Poland, one which is drawing up a post-communist constitution under conditions similar to those described in the preamble of 1791. Then, as now, the constitution was put together by men 'convinced by a long train of defects in our government, and willing to profit by the present circumstances of Europe, and by the favourable moment which has restored us to ourselves, free from the disgraceful shackles of foreign influence'. Alas, the favourable moment of 1791 evaporated fast. Four years later the 'enlightened' despots of Austria, Prussia and Russia dismembered the country and apportioned the pieces among themselves. Two centuries later the disintegration of the Soviet empire, and the reunification of a Germany firmly anchored in the European Community and Nato, have created another 'favourable moment'. The challenge is to remedy the defects of the previous system - and consolidate Polish sovereignty and prosperity while the going is good. The urgency of the challenge appears to be widely understood. Poland, with nearly 40m inhabitants, is the most populous of the six Warsaw Pact countries which regained their independence in 1989. It also fought the hardest for it. The cross erected at Solidarity's insistence in Poznan in 1981, just before martial law was imposed, symbolises that struggle. It commemorates the worker riots of 1956, which marked the beginning of the end of communist rule in Poland. Inscribed 'For freedom, bread and law' it carries the dates 1968, 1970, 1976 and 1980 - all years of rebellion, culminating in the rise of Solidarity., It does not, of course, record subsequent events such as the declaration of martial law in 1981 - or formation of the first non-communist government led by Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki in September 1989. But the monument built on Red Army Boulevard is now on St Martin's Street, the old pre-war name. The fact that Poland struggled so hard in the past could be its salvation in the future. Few have illusions that creating a market economy with a fast growing middle class to form the underlying basis for a stable democracy will be either quick or easy. Yet, creation of a middle class is the specific aim of the new government which, like its predecessor, is busy abolishing the economic and social distortions of 45 years. The IMF-backed economic stabilisation plan introduced by Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the finance minister, in January 1990 has already abolished most consumer and producer subsidies and made the zloty internally convertible. The government is finalising a large-scale privatisation plan, through a system of vouchers, which should create a whole new class of small owners. All new economic and financial legislation is being specifically tailored to EC norms, with help from an army of City accountants, assessors, lawyers and ex-patriate Poles. At the same time Warsaw is maintaining tough wage controls to prevent the kind of wage inflation and unemployment which has turned eastern Germany into an economic disaster. Such a policy could hardly be popular. The international financial community has given two conditional votes of confidence - the Paris Club agreement in March to reduce official debt by 50 per cent and the recent three-year IMF adjustment loan. But both depend on Poland achieving tough economic targets. But passive opposition to austerity policies is high - as revealed during the presidential elections when a quarter of the electorate voted for the previously unknown Polish-Canadian populist, Mr Stanislaw Tyminski. Much depends on President Lech Walesa, whose support for the government's anti-inflationary strategy could be crucial. He undermined the first post-communist government led by Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki but virtually hand-picked the present government led by Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki. Mr Walesa won his own personal mandate at the presidential elections in December. Ironically, however, Poland, which was the first to throw off the communist yoke, is the last to hold free, multi-party general elections. The elections were expected to take place in May but have been delayed, against Mr Walesa's wishes, until October. This means that parliament is still numerically dominated by former communists, who were guaranteed 65 per cent of the seats by the 'round table' agreement of April 1989 between the communist party and Solidarity, while the government, dominated by the small, Gdansk-based 'Liberal Democrat' party, has no popular mandate. This is a shaky political foundation on which to base a tough economic policy expected to lead to mass bankruptcies in coming months and see unemployment rise from the current 1.3m to 2m and beyond by the end of the year. With elections in the offing, siren calls are being heard to ease up on wage controls and go for faster growth, even at the expense of higher inflation. The next few months could be crucial. If the government, backed by the president, sticks to its guns, the first 'demolition' phase of transition to the market could be over soon. Already there is no mistaking the vitality of the private sector and the alacrity with which Poles are adapting to the new rules of the game. Making money is becoming the national obsession. A nation of shopkeepers appears to have sprung up overnight. However, many who were secure and even favoured by the old regime have inevitably lost out. Class and income divisions are widening rapidly after decades of artificial equality, mediocrity and shortages of everything. For some the cacophony of multi-party politics, the abrupt change in value systems - not to speak of prices - is confusing, even threatening. Poles are finding that democracy can be trying and 'normal' life in a 'free society' frustrating as well as rewarding. But they have rejected illusions of a 'third way' between communism and capitalism and seem determined to make a new brasher, richer and freer Poland work.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Raymonde Dury: "Bosnia and NATO"] </F>   [Text] The illusions about the post-Cold War period have  fallen away. The dividend peace was supposed to bring has yet  to be seen. The cancers of obscurantist nationalism, frozen  under the Communist regimes, have reappeared with ferocious  virulence. And the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been growing  worse for 20 months.    I am shocked. We all are shocked at the fate met by these  women, these men, and these children who succumb to the hail of  bullets, shells, rockets, and sniper fire. Yet how can we  forget? The inhabitants of Sarajevo are dying for our values  and the for the ideals we defend in Europe: democracy, human  rights, the rejection of borders changed through force,  tolerance, and multinational and multicultural coexistence.    The malaise and impotence of the UN troops on the ground  have  become more noticeable since the announced departure of General  Briquemont. Moreover, at the NATO summit, it was decided to  open up Tuzla, whose airport is essential for channeling  humanitarian aid, and Srebrenica, where three hundred UN troops  cannot be relieved. NATO is again talking of air strikes if the  Serbs try to prevent these actions.    This decisive tone is something new. To say that we let the  situation rot away until we reached the current impasse is an  understatement. Those people, and I am one of them, who have  always fought for peace in the world, have long demanded more  energetic action be taken in Bosnia -- apart from the required  humanitarian aid -- against militias on all sides which hold the  civilian population hostage and commit intolerable crimes. One  such person bitterly summed up the position of the international  community: "It is striving tirelessly to try not to be able to  do anything."    If NATO, with the agreement of the United Nations, finally  decides to move, and if all this is not just another gesture  like some Serbs are already saying, then we must be pleased that  Europe and the international community are finally taking their  responsibility without waiting for new disasters; without  waiting for war and winter to once again forge their horror or  for thousands more deaths and refugees to be added to a long  list; without looking for a scapegoat -- the United Nations --  or ways out, such as the lie of the land, guerrilla warfare, or  the price to be paid.    Coherence between the decisions made in the Security Council  and NATO, on the one hand, and their application, on the other,  must have a double objective: first a humanitarian one, and  then a political one -- because nobody believes that a military  solution alone is possible.    However, Europe and the international community must become  credible again in the eyes of public opinion -- and in the eyes  of the ethnic cleansers. Public opinion wants peace and  remembers that in a democracy, it is the one in charge. This  time, public opinion will not find it acceptable if these words  are not followed up with action. It will keep a close eye on the  action taken. And it will not forget Sarajevo.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Four Japan reform bills get go-ahead JAPAN'S coalition government yesterday approved four bills to overhaul the country's scandal-prone political system, setting the scene for a parliamentary battle with the opposition Liberal Democratic party. The coalition has promised that the bills will become law by the end of the year, meaning that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, will need to secure their passage during a 90-day extraordinary parliamentary session which began yesterday. Mr Hosokawa's proposals will be challenged by Mr Yohei Kono, who is certain to remain as LDP president after the position was declared open to challengers yesterday. The only potential challenger, Mr Michio Watanabe, the former foreign minister, has decided not to stand. 'I will be a strong opposition leader,' said Mr Kono, who was chosen as president after the LDP lost its parliamentary majority at a general election in July. His party will force prolonged debate on the four bills, which include replacing the present multi-seat constituencies with a mix of single seats and proportional representation. Under the coalition proposal, the 511 seats in the lower house, the more powerful of Japan's two houses, will be replaced by a 500-seat system, with 250 representatives chosen from single seats and 250 from a separate vote for proportional representation candidates. The bills include restrictions on donations by companies to individual politicians and their support groups, while a central election fund of about Y41.4bn (Pounds 253.9m) would be established to subsidise parties and reduce their dependence on donations, seen as the cause of most corruption. But doubt remains about the seven-party coalition's commitment to reform, as some members of the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, argue that the changes will benefit the LDP, which remains the largest single party. The SDP's position will be influenced by the outcome of an election beginning today for a new leader to replace Mr Sadao Yamahana, who resigned to take responsibility for the party's poor performance at the July election. One candidate, Mr Tomiichi Murayama, will continue support for the coalition's policies, while a far left-wing candidate, Mr Masatoshi Ito, opposes the electoral system bills. Divisions within the SDP highlight the fragility of the coalition, which has indicated that an election will be called after the electoral reforms are implemented. There is also a dispute between Mr Hosokawa and the Japan Renewal party, a coalition member, which has suggested that an election should be called later this year even if the bills are not passed.</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Arts: Claude Brumachon - Dance French 'modern dance' is one of the curiosities of the theatrical decade. For years, France welcomed the experiments of visiting American creators with a characteristic eagerness for the new. The consistently vital programming at the Theatre de la Ville in Paris, the wonderful Biennale de la Danse in Lyon, the choreographic competition at Bagnolet, are symptomatic of this willingness to enjoy innovation. The decision to start propagating more of the home-grown product, to bring into being a nationally indentifiable modern dance, a manifestation of the 1980s in France, and extensive coverage in the magazine Les Saisons de la Danse offers valuable testimony to this. If ministerial and departmental patronage, and a committed public, are enough, then France has a lively Free Dance identity. The problem is, as I have discovered to my cost, that much of this dance is rootless, provincial, intellectually costive. Though we starve much of our own new dance, the work of Robin Howard and Robert Cohan for the London Contemporary Dance Trust gave modernism strong roots, physical credibility through excellence of schooling and essential points of reference for development and even rejection. In France, this foundation is missing. The Place has been generous in offering a showcase to dance troupes, from Britain and Europe. Alastair Macaulay and I have charted on this page the torrent of ineptitude - it could not be otherwise - and recorded with hosannas the arrival of some few vital talents. The evenings of French dance have been, in the main, very taxing on a critic's willingness to enjoy, and never more so than on Tuesday night when Claude Brumachon returned with his troupe. Brumachon's ensemble forms the Centre Choregraphique at Nantes. His programme provides two works (each lasting 50 minutes) of staggering tedium. The first (Eclats d'Absinthe) shows four men and five women having hell in a Hamam, repeating feeble little gestures ad nauseam, and slamming their bodies about with a fine disregard for breakage. It is a terrible indictment of mixed bathing. The second piece, Fauves, is worse: more repetitious, more pretentious, and even less probable as choreography. For part of the time the cast behave as if in the last stages of delirium tremens. One chap strikes oriental poses and makes ungainly little runs, as if it were his turn this week to impersonate Ruth St. Denis. There is a good deal of heavy breathing. Costuming is uniformly hideous, and the sound tracks are detestable. Lighting is excellent. Advance publicity spoke of dance 'passionate, sensuous, erotic' - the writer is probably driven mad with lust by blotting paper - and one woman in the cast obligingly went topless all evening. In the closing moments, Brumachon pulled off a most beautiful image as a man and woman in trailing garments lay on some parallel bars while a second man became a boatman ferrying them to eternity. But this was no compensation for the aeons of aversion therapy that had preceded it. 'The Turning World' season continues with varying troupes at The Place, Duke's Rd, WC1, until May 23</p>

			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Golf: Secret joy of Ireland's missing links - Derek Lawrenson follows Nick Faldo to Ballyliffin in County Donegal So what else does Nick Faldo do with his spare time apart from strap his wrist to the latest high-tech gadgetry to ease tendonitis? This summer he donned his architect's hat and broadened his education by visiting some of the great Irish golf courses that never host a pit-stop on the European tour. His ambition is to design both a links and an inland course in Britain that stand comparison with any, so the journey was an essential one. Some Irish links courses, such as County Sligo and Lahinch, are known to most golf students, but there was one place that Faldo visited that has escaped attention. Ballyliffin, in Donegal, is the most northerly course in the whole of Ireland. It lies just below Malin Head. Quite why it is not recognised among Ireland's finest courses is something of a mystery. Its absence from most guidebooks explains why the fairways are largely deserted; a stark comparison to Ireland's most celebrated venues. But Malin Head did have 19 days in July when the wind's was gale force, and this was perhaps a contributing factor. Who, though, ever went to Ireland for the weather? Furthermore, Ballyliffin is a breathtaking links course, and the green fees, at IPounds 8, represent a bargain which you will have to search hard and long to match. What Ballyliffin is not, however, is a fair golf course. It is gloriously, maddeningly, unfair, as most links courses are. Its fairways are covered in pimples, and if you were not surrounded by some of the most sublime views to be found anywhere, you would be cursing as your 230 yard drive comes to rest on a vicious up-slope. The whole course is a hidden trove. It does not matter one score card you have picked up lists the fifth hole as a 389 yard par four, when what you are actually confronted by is one of the great natural par threes? You quickly grow used to the fact that the score card measurements are in yards while the marker posts on each hole are 150 metres from the flag. Of course if you do not accept these eccentricities, there are plenty of Pounds 75 per round courses in the UK where you will have time during the five hours it takes to play 18 holes to ruminate on the fact that everything is spot on. Ballyliffin itself contains, so far as I could see, two hotels, two shops, a post office, a couple of bed and breakfasts, two pitch and putts, a wondrous beach and the golf course. It lies halfway up the Inishowen peninsula, beloved of geologists, archaeologists, historians, naturalists, ornithologists but not yet golfers. Just do not tell too many about it, will you? Faldo, by the way, played off the back tees and breezed round in 69, which is three under par. He thanked club officials and left with a look of envy on his face that suggested his minders were about to be confronted with the questions: who is going to find me a piece of land that matches this one? The day I played the sun was shining. There was barely a breath of wind. I felt almost guilty standing on some of Ballyliffin's more exposed areas swinging the club freely and with no concern for the weather. There must be days out there when the wind possesses such strength that simply to address the ball would be beyond the efforts of most of us. I would not want to swap for one of those. Not that everyone was happy on this gorgeous day. On the first tee in front of us, there were two disgruntled Irishman. 'I don't know how they get away with it,' one of them said, to which his friend replied to anyone in earshot: 'Bloody disgusting charging Pounds 8 for green fees, isn't it?' Clearly some people do not know a bargain even when it is laid out in front of them in all its wonder.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AIRLINES GROUND MOST OF WORLD'S BOEING 737-400S  </P> <P> International airlines Wednesday acted to ground most of the worldwide fleet of  Boeing 737-400s after three separate incidents, including the crash in Britain  in January that cost 47 lives.  </P> <P> The airlines' grounding of the aircraft followed a recommendation by Boeing Co.  and CFM International that 33 of the world fleet of 50 737-400s should be taken  out of service for modifications to their engines -- the CFM 56-3C.  </P> <P> "This is the first time a Boeing fleet has ever been grounded. This is a major  problem," Boeing's Paris spokesman, Sandrik de Couriss, said at the Paris Air  Show.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Fundamental' Problem  </P> <P> Meanwhile, British Midland Airways, which has two Boeing 737-400s and also  operated the aircraft which crashed in Kegworth, Leicestershire, said it  regarded the problems as "fundamental." It would seek a long-term solution  before calling for the aircraft to be reinstated.  </P> <P> Twelve of the affected aircraft operated by U.K. airlines were grounded by the  Civil Aviation Authority on Monday night.  </P> <P> The engines were also used on two airliners, operated by Dan-Air and British  Midland Airways, which were involved in scares last weekend when fan blades  failed on flights from Heathrow and Gatwick. The 17 aircraft not affected are  in service in the United States and use a different version of the CFM engine  that has less thrust.  </P></p>

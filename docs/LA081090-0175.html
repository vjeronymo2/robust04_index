			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'TWIN PEAKS' CANS RECAP SHOW  </P> <P> What would seem an idea right out of "Mission Impossible" -- a one-hour  recapitulation of last season's many plot twists on "Twin Peaks" -- has been  canceled, ABC said Thursday.  </P> <P> ABC originally planned to air on Sept. 29 a show that would have recapped  important points in the surreal saga of sex, murder and doughnuts in a small  logging hamlet in Washington state.  </P> <P> The series now is in summer repeats.  </P> <P> But the network and the show's makers, Lynch-Frost Productions, mutually agreed  to call off the special and concentrate all their energy on the show's second  season, said ABC spokeswoman Janice Gretemeyer.  </P> <P> "Twin Peaks" will begin its second season with a two-hour Sunday broadcast on  Sept. 30, then appear regularly on Saturday nights.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BULGARIA PREMIER NAMES NEW MOSTLY-SOCIALIST CABINET;  </P> <P> BALKANS: HOPES FOR A COALITION GOVERNMENT FADE AS THE OPPOSITION FRONT REJECTS  COAXING.  </P> <P> Amid deteriorating economic conditions that include worsening shortages of  consumer goods and fuel, Bulgaria's Socialist prime minister announced a new  government Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Cabinet nominated by Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov includes only one  non-Socialist, although the list was not complete. The remaining ministers are  expected to be named when the National Assembly votes today on the government,  Lukanov's second in seven months.  </P> <P> Although the Socialists -- formerly the Communists who ruled Bulgaria for  decades -- won multi-party elections in June, the nation has been without an  effective government. Despite extended effort, the Socialists have been unable  to coax leading opposition groups of the United Democratic Front into a  coalition government, a deadlock that some analysts say led to paralysis.  </P> <P> In an interview Wednesday, Lukanov said: "I am still not happy about not being  able to form a multi-party government because I think that's what Bulgaria  needs most. But Bulgaria needs a government because the present situation can  have unpredictable consequences and can deeply hurt Bulgaria and its standing  in the world."  </P> <P> Since the election, the first free vote in four decades, the Socialists have  come under increasing attack as key food and other items have vanished from  shops and as oil shortages have disrupted daily life.  </P> <P> Last week, the authorities announced that white and yellow cheese, an important  food item here, will be rationed for the foreseeable future, and intermittent  power blackouts hit some parts of Sofia, underscoring a fuel crisis that the  government predicts will worsen in the coming months.  </P> <P> Motorists here are already waiting in lines up to three miles long and for up  to 36 hours to fill up their cars with gasoline.  </P> <P> The fuel crunch comes from a double blow: the sudden jolt to world oil prices  triggered by the crisis in the Persian Gulf and the decision by the Soviet  Union to demand hard currency for continued supplies of petroleum products to  its Eastern European allies.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Lukanov said he plans to organize a national program to mobilize  local sources of energy, including coal and wood, to help make up the  shortfalls. He also appealed to the West for aid, noting that Bulgaria has  strictly observed U.N.-imposed sanctions against Iraq, which have contributed  to his nation's shortfall.  </P> <P> The cash-strapped Bulgarian government has already suspended payments on its  $10.3-billion foreign debt and has also appealed to the Soviet Union for  economic aid to help get the country through the winter.  </P> <P> "I don't think there will be famine in the real sense of the word," President  Zhelyu Zhelev said recently, "but poverty is a fact."  </P> <P> Authorities say they hope to avoid meat rationing for at least the next two  months, but the recent long lines outside meat markets reflect the already  short supplies of beef and pork. Most shoppers were lining up to buy large  quantities of a cheap sausage.  </P> <P> Consumer complaints are directed at a variety of targets. Some shoppers blame  farmers for withholding goods from the capital; some attack poor market  organization, and most level their anger at the Socialist government for  failing to get a grip on the economy.  </P> <P> In addition to cheese and meat, Sofia residents say sugar, detergent, toilet  paper and children's clothes are difficult to find.  </P> <P> Perhaps most troubling to most consumers is the warning by the government that  electricity will be rationed to homes and industry this winter. Electrical  energy to industry will be cut by an estimated 10% to 20%.  </P> <P> In his proposed Cabinet, Lukanov dropped Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov, who  had been in office for 28 years, and replaced him with Yordan Mutafchiev. But  there were few new names in the list. All are former Communists except for  Science Minister Ilya Konev, who is not a national figure and has no known  affiliation.  </P></p>

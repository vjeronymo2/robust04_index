			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Activity in BAA Airport operator BAA endured a rollercoaster ride in the market as investors and analysts digested the company's half-year results. The shares tumbled initially, coming off 16 at one stage, as concern mounted that the group's dividend pay-out implied a poorer full-year total and hinted at lower earnings growth. However, BAA spent the day pointing out that this was not the case and the shares recovered. They were later squeezed up in what dealers described as a technical rally, ending 20 ahead at 921p. BAA's affirmation of its overseas ambitions, together with its declaration to move to quarterly reporting, fuelled speculation that the company may seek an ADR listing in New York. The group already has a management arrangement with one US airport and is known to want to further its US ambitions. Transport analysts left their full-year forecasts largely untouched, the market range remaining around Pounds 312m to Pounds 323m.</p>

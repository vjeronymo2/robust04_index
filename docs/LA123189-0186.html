			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TERM LIMITS FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS  </P> <P> You say (without explaining the connection) that term limits "would upset the  balance of power between elected officials, who often require years of service  to command the details of policy questions." But such limits would, on the  contrary, allow more fairness in elections. Any pol who can't give up  fund-raising long enough to learn such details in two terms should be replaced  by someone smarter and more dedicated.  </P> <P> Most disturbing, you say, is that term limits "would constitute a collective  admission that our government and our politics have failed." On the contrary,  both would be improved, because many more people would vote and the quality of  politics would thereby improve. Our present disgracefully low voter turnout is  directly due to a feeling of helplessness in any effort to displace incumbents,  no matter how incompetent. And finally, your professed faith in the people's  ability to recognize official corruption and turn the rascals out via vote or  recall in timely fashion is, unfortunately, pitiful.  </P> <P> CONRAD THOMAS  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

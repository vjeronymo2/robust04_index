			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Private View: Fantasies in the dust - Sol Kerzner built the notorious resort Sun City. He is about to open the grandiose sequel A WHITE Rolls-Royce shone in the street outside. A butler opened the door of the flat. A cool blonde in black stockings rose from a plump sofa; at the further end of the split-level room another smart blonde helped a little girl to her breakfast. When people begin to look like fashion accessories you know you are in the presence of the ruthlessly rich. The adornments of Sol Kerzner's London flat  -human and material - say more about him than a hundred breathless reports by the dazzled hackettes whom Kerzner has squired round his leisure empire. Kerzner is a very successful South African hotelier, best known for Sun City, the sin-and-fun resort he built in the scrubby black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana out of reach of the republic's sex and gambling laws and where in the heyday of apartheid white politicians could safely consort with their black mistresses. In a few days time he is due to open his sequel: the Lost City, a Pounds 180m resort next door. It comprises a fantastically-designed 350-room hotel pretending to be the restored palace of a lost civilisation, surrounded by 80 acres of imported jungle with huge water slides, artificial surfing lake, golf course, casino, bars and restaurants. The opening celebrations are to include a Jean Michel Jarre sound-and-light show, a golf tournament and the Miss World contest with Jerry Hall and Ivana Trump on display. Sol Kerzner, chairman of Sun International, proves two adages: audacity pays, if you give value for money, and publicity is all. At the age of 57 this son of poor Ukrainian immigrants has managed to acquire the aura of a Khashoggi - private jet, celebrity parties, late-night whisky sessions, leggy escorts, many homes and several wives. No doubt he varies his act according to the publication he is talking to, but after the advance billing I found Kerzner disappointingly restrained. He appeared the typically cautious, hard-headed businessman, a bit flashy, maybe, but hardly flamboyant. Of his reputed vile temper there was no hint. Kerzner is very short with big shoulders, broad chest, a modest beer belly and skinny legs. His eyes are unusually clear and at some angles he looks uncannily like the actor Richard Burton. He sat on the edge of the sofa running a set of worry beads through his fingers. The beads, and occasional shortness of breath, testified to the fact that he was once a heavy smoker and suffered a heart attack nine years ago. I said: It's quite a lot of money to spend on a fantasy. 'It's not quite a lot. It's a lot.' He laughed. 'It's a lot of money to be spending when world economies are not great, when we're looking to attract foreign visitors and when the domestic economy is dreadful.' He laughed again. I don't expect you to frighten the punters ahead of opening day, I said, but there is still a danger of civil war in South Africa. Doesn't that keep you awake at night? 'Well, you know, one cannot predict what the outcome will be. I believe the various leaders realise that even to prolong this hiatus period is going to wreck the economy to a point where it's going to be unimportant who wins. Our economy can't stand much more. We've had disinvestment, the sanctions period. What one needs now is investment, foreign investment. I think they all realise that.' Kerzner has been accused of profiting from apartheid, exploiting the pseudo- independence of the homelands to establish 'casinostans'. Four years ago he admitted to a government commission having paid some R2m to George Matanzima, former prime minister of Transkei, to secure sole casino rights in the territory. Kerzner says it was not a bribe, but extortion. These days, naturally, he is paying court to leaders of the African National Congress. You have been accused of making money on the back of apartheid, I said. 'If we had built gambling halls and movie houses purely for porn movies, that sort of stuff, then I agree with you. That would have been exploitation. But what we did was go in and develop a tourist industry; we give employment to over 18,000 people. That's not exploitation, that's development. We have trained people: 90 per cent of our personnel are from southern africa, indigenous. 'We've said in our annual reports going back years that the system is something we didn't subscribe to. There is no discrimination in our resorts or within our people. 'It wasn't within our power to break down the apartheid system. It was there. I think what we did was positive. We developed an industry - not a gaming industry, a tourist industry, of which, I agree absolutely, gaming was an important element.' I notice you're making friends with the ANC, I said. 'We have always spoken with the various political leaders, not specifically ANC. Tourism cannot be developed unless the government is behind it. My interaction with government is only at one level . . . to get infrastructure.' Have you invited Nelson Mandela to the opening? 'No, not to the opening. That really revolves around entertainment. This is not a political event.' Kerzner does not seem worried that gambling may be legalised in South Africa and kick one of the props from under his bantustan resorts. He already faces competition from illegal casinos in the urban areas. 'One would hope that it would be legalised in relation to tourism development. That's why we have developed Sun City to its present size, to give variety against the day when we compete.' That may also be why Kerzner is trying to erase Sun City's tacky reputation (though people who have been there say the place is actually very well run), and push the 'Bop' resorts as family places. Isn't sex part of the fun? I asked. 'Sex is not part of our marketing. Others project this singles sort of scene, We're not competing with that. I mean perhaps the stuff that we are projecting may look sexy, I dunno. But specifically looking to sell sex - absolutely not. We are definitely selling an experience, a discovery of what Africa is all about.' Even without the violence and uncertainty surrounding South Africa's move to universal suffrage, the Lost City fantasy is a gamble. Why should foreigners, in particular, fly to one of the most beautiful regions of the world in order to hole up in an ersatz creation like the Lost City? I asked Kerzner what made him so confident people would go for it. 'I think it's a combination of things. Instinct plays an important role. That's got to be part of it. Hilton, Sheraton, Interconti can go round the world with sliderules doing their feasibility studies. Their stuff is easy. When you get into the unknown it becomes more difficult. You've got to have an understanding of what the people of tomorrow want, not the people of today. 'People have said to me over the years 'Wow] Sol, how could you do that]' Like when I put every cent of the family money into our first hotel. 'It's far too luxurious,' they say, 'South Africans won't pay that]' They say I've got courage, this or that, and I think to myself: not at all. I felt good about it from Day One.' But what makes you so sure? 'Well, I think I know people reasonably well when it comes to leisure. I've done it since 1964. I don't want to blow my own trumpet, but I think I must have a reasonable feel for what will excite people. 'In our business the secret is to know how far to go, how much to spend. Not to overcapitalise, but if you get nervous and you cut back on the real concept that's the kiss of death. 'Everyone knows the ruins are just built. Everyone knows the palace is new and is a hotel. Yet it's got to be done on a scale and in terms of detail and quality that people are gonna believe it.' You think fantasy is what people really want? 'No, I think what people want is a mix of fantasy and reality. This thing is so good that when you walk in there you've gotta wonder when you look at the murals if it hasn't been there the last coupla hundred years. Take our forests. When you walk into this rainforest, you're going to believe it - you're gonna get lost in there.' Sol Kerzner believes the future of tourism lies in what he calls 'the total resort'. The idea is not exactly new: the Butlins holiday camps were based on the same concept, while Disney invented the fantasy. Kerzner is marrying the two and multiplying by ten. But he insisted: 'You've got to give value for money. If you take 'em for a ride, you're going to fail. But the total resort is where it's going. No doubt.' The cool blonde on the opposite sofa - a public relations girl she was  - started shifting about in that way they do when the time is up. Do you gamble? 'Not really. Yeah, I'll enjoy it if I go to Las Vegas. I'll sit there and have a bit of fun. But it's fun, it's not big money.' He thought for a second. 'I guess I could be. I just haven't allowed myself to be.' Well, I said, as I got up: good luck. Kerzner was matey. 'Perhaps we'll see you at Lost City one day' Thanks, I said. Perhaps.</p>

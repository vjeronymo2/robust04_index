			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "U.S. Concern Over Closer Ties </F> Between Iran and Pakistan"]    [Text] The head of the foreign relations committee in the  U.S. House of Representatives, Mr. Lee Hamilton, in an article  which appeared in yesterday's issue of the daily NEW YORK TIMES,  has stressed what he has described as the danger of  Pakistan-Iran closeness, calling on the U.S. Administration to  reconsider its ties with Pakistan and provide the ground for the  improvement of Washington-Islamabad ties.    The noteworthy point in Mr. Hamilton's article is that he  has  expressed concern over the reduced U.S. influence in Pakistan  and increased influence of the Islamic Republic of Iran and  China in that country. Besides, he has also mentioned the often  repeated claim that Iran is trying to acquire nuclear weapons.    The article is worth pondering from two aspects. First, as  has been confirmed by the world bodies, including the exports of  the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, Iran has no plan  whatsoever to use nuclear energy for military purposes. And  second, what the U.S. official has described as the so-called  increasing influence of Iran and China in Pakistan are actually  the joint efforts of the three countries, coupled with their  good will, to expand regional cooperation.    In the political lexicon of the White House the word  influence actually means to be forerunner of domination whereas  the foundation of Iran's ties with Pakistan, by being away from  any political ups and downs, is based on the principle of good  neighborly ties and nonintervention in each other's affairs and  is set on the track of making these ties evermore stronger.    Meanwhile China considers Iran as a very important country  in  west Asia, specially in the Persian Gulf, which has a strategic  role in maintaining peace and stability in the region. Iran and  China have had very high trade exchanges during the recent years  and in addition to Pakistan's stability and the recent visit to  Iran by the prime minister of that country, Mrs. Benazir Bhutto,  have depicted a very bright prospect for the future of the  Pakistan-Iran ties.    If we also take into account China's serious inclination of  expanding ties with the Economic Cooperation Organization, ECO,  we can understand the very roots of the U.S. fear from closeness  between Iran and Pakistan. Trade exchanges in the region, which  spreads from South Asia to Caucasia and Central Asia, with China  being next door, means the creation of a strong and independent  economic pole in the world; the world over which the United  States wants to establish its economic domination under the  cover of the new world order. This, and nothing else, is the  main cause of concern for the head of the foreign relations  committee in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p>

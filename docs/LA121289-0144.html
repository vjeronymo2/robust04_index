			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BIG STEEL EXPORTERS AGREE TO U.S. QUOTAS;  </P> <P> TRADE: NATIONS AGREE TO END SUBSIDIES AND KEEP MARKETS OPEN TO U.S. STEEL. SOME  FEAR DOMESTIC FIRMS WILL LOSE COMPETITIVE EDGE.  </P> <P> Major steel-producing nations have agreed to abide by new restrictions on  exports to the United States and to end subsidies on steel production, U.S.  Trade Representative Carla Anderson Hills said today.  </P> <P> Hills said the program extends existing voluntary quotas for 2 1/2 years and  commits the nations to end subsidies and to keep their home markets open to  foreign steel.  </P> <P> "The bilateral agreements restricting trade-distorting practices are the  cornerstone of the President's program to seek a consensus to address the  causes rather than the symptoms affecting world trade in steel," she said.  </P> <P> The program, announced by President Bush on July 25, is designed to shield the  U.S. steel industry from cheap foreign imports while it modernizes to meet  overseas competition.  </P> <P> Opponents of the program say that the American steel industry is profitable and  that continued curbs on foreign steel would hurt the competitiveness of  domestic steel users, who are handicapped in their own export drives by paying  higher prices for steel.  </P> <P> Foreign producers took about 30% of the U.S. steel market five years ago. Last  year the figure was about 20%.  </P> <P> The new quota program limits imports to 19.1% of the U.S. market in the first  year and 20.1% in the second, including incentives to nations that end their  subsidies.  </P> <P> Voluntary restraint agreements were reached with the 12 member nations of the  European Community, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, East Germany,  Finland, Hungary, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, China, Poland, Romania, Trinidad  and Tobago, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> Agreements to end many subsidies immediately and others in phases were reached  with the EC, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Australia, and Trinidad and  Tobago, countries that account for 90% of the imports covered by the so-called  voluntary restraints.  </P> <P> Hills also said that negotiations to end subsidies and keep domestic markets  open were under way with several other countries, including Austria, Finland  and Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> The agreements mandate binding arbitration to settle complaints, she said.  </P> <P> All the signers, Hills said, pledged to negotiate for rules to bar subsidies  and further reduce tariffs under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  </P> <P> S. Linn Williams, deputy trade representative, said the Administration had no  plans to extend the quotas again when they expire in 1992. He told reporters  that by then a global steel agreement is expected to be in place.  </P> <P> Williams said foreign nations would realize if they increased exports to the  United States when the pact expired that pressure would swell for renewed  quotas, particularly because 1992 is an election year.  </P> <P> He said the U.S. steel industry is free to file a complaint while the agreement  is in effect but that any nation named in a complaint likely would drop out of  the pact.  </P> <P> "It's a kind of a mutually assured destruction between the industry and the  exporting countries," Williams said.  </P></p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading STOCK index futures moved forward yesterday, the June FT-SE breaking through the 2,700 level for the first time this year, though volatility in trading saw it end below the day's best, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract started the session at 2,688, a 33-point premium to the underlying cash market, and a slight squeeze saw it advance to touch 2,700 by mid-morning. Nerves appeared to have set in on that advance and profit-taking saw June retreat to 2,677 by midsession, tracking the cash market, which was also in decline. However, sentiment changed again in the early afternoon, when June was once more in demand helped by a positive Wall Street - and this time the 2,700 mark was firmly passed, June accelerating to attain 2,707. June closed below the session's high at 2,696, just one point above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 18. In spite of the volatility, turnover was poor at 5,936 lots. In traded options, volume amounted to 43,468 contracts, with trading in stock options accounting for much of the day's total. The FT-SE 100 option had a mere 9,113 lots dealt, well below expectations ahead of its expiry today.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, ROMPRES, 22/06/1994 -- Tomorrow, a  delegation of the Moldovan Ministry of Transportation headed by  Minister Vasili Iovv, will leave for Bucharest to meet with  representatives of the Romanian Transportation Ministry. Vasile  Iovv told BASA that "the visit's purpose is to establish  cooperation relations in the field of transportation that will  yield profits to both states." Nicolae Ciobanu, deputy head of  the Roads Department, told BASA that negotiations on building a  bridge across the Prut at Radauti-Lipcani will be also  discussed. According to Ciobanu, a program on developing and  integrating Moldovan highway networks into the European system  will be elaborated. A program on repairing the bridges across  the Prut at Galati-Giurgiulesti, Oancea-Cahul and  Stanca-Costenti and the highways at these border points will be  drafted. According to the Galati agreement, these highways will  be passed to international regulations. Ciobanu pointed out  that a joint administration of the navigation on the Prut river  with an autonomous regulation of organization and functioning  will be created. Vasile Iovv stated to BASA that the railway  gauge will not be yet passed to the Romanian standards as  Moldova does not have sufficient funding for such works. The  last meeting between Moldovan and Romanian Transportation  Ministries occurred in November 1993.</p>

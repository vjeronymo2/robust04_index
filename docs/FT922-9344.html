			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Arts: Bounty in contemporary spaces - Paris Galleries At first glance Renn Espace looks like any contemporary art gallery off Boulevard St Germain in Paris, with all the requisite accessories: minimalist foyer, white walls and sunlight shafting through a glazed roof. Renn Espace is different. Unlike other contemporary art spaces in the city, it is neither commercial nor a state-supported institution. Instead it holds a series of exhibitions sponsored by Claude Berri, the film producer behind Jean de Florette and Manon des Sources and, for the past five years, one of Europe's most enthusiastic modern art collectors. The Berri collection is composed of established 20th century artists like Cy Twombly, Yves Klein, Jean Dubuffet and Lucio Fontana. Claude Berri has leased an old print shop, next to his own Paris home on Rue de Lille, to stage shows based on the work of artists within his collection. The first of these is devoted to the American minimalist painter, Robert Ryman. The show includes 50 of Ryman's 'white paintings' and covers his career from the late 1950s when Ryman, who started out as a jazz musician, was first making his name in the New York art scene, to last year. Some of the paintings come from Berri's collection, although the giant Ryman abstract for which he paid a record - and very controversial - Dollars 2m three years ago is still hidden away in his own home. The logistics of Renn Espace with its wide spaces and shafting sunlight, are ideally suited to Ryman's work. The 'white paintings', a series of austere white oils with intricate surface detail and barely discernible flecks of different colours, require very delicate display - and lots of natural light  -to show off the subtlety of Ryman's treatment of surfaces and his colour contrasts. They also benefit from being shown en masse which makes it easier to appreciate the differences from canvas to canvas. That said, it seems a shame that Claude Berri should have given over his gallery to so well-established an artist as Robert Ryman, who would have no difficulty in finding more conventional outlets. Indeed the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Gallery in London are already collaborating on a retrospective of his work. Renn Espace could use its special status to be more experimental in its choice of artists as the Saatchi Gallery in London. Across the Seine is the new Ashley Bickerton show at Yvon Lambert in the Marais. This exhibition, part of the body of work first shown at Sonnabend in New York last autumn, is Bickerton's first one man show in Europe and marks his attempt to distance himself from the commodity art cliche that has haunted him since he first surfaced in the Manhattan art world, alongside Jeff Koons and Meyer Vaisman, in the mid-1980s. When Bickerton first moved away from his early interest in consumption - the matt black sculptures emblazoned with fashion labels and art logos - he ventured into the newly fashionable field of the environment. At the time it looked suspiciously as though he had swapped one hip obsession for another. His new work seems much stronger in that it combines the two themes by exploring escapist fantasies of the tropics with images of the sort of desert islands which would not look out of place in 1970s' Bounty commercials, exotic liquor and equally exotic women. Bickerton, who now spends part of each year in Indonesia, says the show is all about 'sex, booze and escape, the things people look for in the Eden they will never find.' In his sculptures he has mixed images of the indigenous tropics - native photographs, old fishing net, coconuts and bottles of local liquor - with the totems of tourism - high tech sub-aquatic kit, reels of film, a cowboy suit and symbols of the sex industry. The indigenous images are often imprisoned within the tourist paraphernalia so the show looks like a visual game of double-bluff illustrating how one man's fantasy can crush another's. If Ashley Bickerton's work is about longing , however hopelessly, for escape, Suzanne Lafont's photographs at the Jeu de Paume act as an abrupt reminder of the angst-ridden reality his Bounty island-bound tourists want to escape from. The Jeu de Paume , the old Impressionist museum in the Tuileries Gardens, has already made its mark on the Paris arts scene since reopening last summer as the lynchpin of the ministry of culture's initiative to create more space for modern art in the city. The Lafont show is composed of four series of photographs - all anonymous portraits blown up into cinematic proportions in the style of stills from the films of the directors like Roberto Rossellini, Robert Bresson and Jean Luc Godard, who have influenced the artist. Lafont's subjects appear to be acting out their own modern horror stories. The victims of Le Bruit (The Noise) shrink visibly with terror, covering their eyes or ears in a futile attempt to hide. Les Souffleurs (The Blowers) are reduced to ridicule as they puff out their cheeks in a pathetic attempt to ward off whatever threatens them. The sheer size of the portraits forces the eye to focus on the subject's vulnerability , even on their tell-tale physical flaws, the frightened eyes and the weary wrinkles, in painful detail. Robert Ryman at Renn Espace, 7 rue de Lille, 75007 Paris, until June 30. Ashley Bickerton at Yvon Lambert, 108 rue Vielle du Temple, 75003 Paris until May 12. Suzanne Lafont at Jeu de Paume, 20 rue Royale, 75008 Paris until May 24.</p>

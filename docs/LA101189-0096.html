			<p><P> October 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Telerate Says Offer Inadequate: Telerate Inc. said the recent offer by Dow  Jones &amp; Co., which holds a 67% stake in the computerized financial  information company, to buy the rest of Telerate for $376.2 million is  inadequate. Dow Jones has offered $18 a share for Telerate. Telerate said the  offer is not in its best interests -- or that of its stockholders, other than  Dow Jones, which owns 63.6 million common shares. The Telerate committee  recommended that stockholders not tender any shares under the offer, adding  that it was advised by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. that the offer was  inadequate from a financial viewpoint.  </P></p>

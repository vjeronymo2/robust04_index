			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern Cape Province Premier Manne Dipico </F> in the Bloemfontein studio by announcers David Hall-Green and  Chante Hinds in the Johannesburg studio, followed by a phone-in  question-and-answer session, on the "Good Morning, South Africa"  program--live; italicized passages in Afrikaans]    [Excerpts] [Hall-Green] And now time to meet another of the  country's new regional premiers in Good Morning South Africa's  regular series. This morning it's premier of the Northern Cape,  Mr. Manne Dipico, and he is in our Bloemfontein studio. [passage  omitted]    Let's of course give you a little bit of background on Manne  Dipico. A Kimberley boy, and his mother brought him up. She  was a domestic worker at the local Kimberley hospital. He  started working in the diamond mines and became politicized. He  was fired from De Beers and went to Fort Hare University, and  went a pretty predictable political course -- the National Union  of Mineworkers and so on, and stood for the Northern Cape for  the ANC and won by a relatively narrow margin. Let's see if we  can now get Mr. Dipico on the line again. Good morning, Mr.  Dipico, can you hear me now? [passage omitted]    Mr. Dipico, with your rising up through the ranks of the  National Union of Mineworkers, and being so much involved in  that particular area, is this still an area of significance for  you in terms of mining in the Northern Cape region? Is this  going to be one of the big challenges?    [Dipico] It will definitely be one of the big challenges,  because when we look at the Northern Cape, we realize through  the breadth and length of this province, mining in Namaqualand,  mining in Kuruman area, mining in Kimberley, former strong  economic base and backbone for all these years; and you realize  that it absorbs a lot of labor. Workers within the province,  really, you find them at the mining industry.    [Hall-Green] A number of the papers are this morning running  the story of the laying off of something over 5,000 workers from  a regional mine. Is this particularly significant, you think?  Do you think this is a sign of things to come generally?    [Dipico] These are things to come. I've gone through painful  experiences where I had to sit with mining bosses who were  laying off workers, thousands and thousands of them. As we  realize within the Northern Cape most of the mining houses came  and actually benefited from the mines. They never looked at  alternatives, because they knew that at a particular time the  minerals will be exhausted, workers will have to be contained,  but nothing of this sort really was considered. That is a very  serious state of affairs, and that we will call upon the  provincial leadership, the new government to try and look at  alternatives: How do we remedy the situation in the future?    [Hinds] Mr. Dipico, if you had to give a list of priorities  that you would like to see changed in the Northern Cape -- we  have touched on one, the mining industry, so far -- what else  would you like to see changed there?    [Dipico] The other important thing that I believe is of  significance in our province is to change the whole scenario  where the economy has been based primarily on primary sector in  the mining industry and in the agricultural area. In the  agricultural area most of the raw materials taken and be  processed somewhere else. [sentence as heard]    We've got cattle, we've got sheep, we've got all the goods,  fruit and so on. But all this is being processed somewhere  else, and we need to change that whole scenario to move into a  secondary manufacturing industry that is light and medium  industry, and move into tertiary type of industries, which we  believe will give us more scope and more potential to be able to  jumpstart the whole economy of our province because it has been  neglected for many, many years.    [Hall-Green] You talk about tertiary industry, Mr. Dipico.  Could you be a bit more explicit and give a few examples of some  of the industries which you would envisage in this category?    [Dipico] We are looking at tourism, which we believe could  attract a lot of investors, and a lot of people from the world  to come and look at Northern Cape. We have been looking at how  best we can develop the area of Namaqualand, and be able to move  in such a way that it generates a lot of funding. Within the  Northern Cape we are looking at Kimberley itself as a historic  place -- but it has never been used profitably -- to move into a  lot of other important things which I think are viable for the  economy of the province.    [Hinds] Mr. Dipico, coming back to yourself as the youngest  premier so far -- have you come up against a lot of  apprehension, maybe?    [Dipico] Yes, but fortunately, one has gone through a  process  where one can stomach, one is in a position to face the  challenges of the future. I knew that it's not going to be  easy. When I was elected, a lot of people were saying that you  are very young, you don't know what you are going to look at,  but I've met people through the length and breadth of our  province who are prepared to cooperate, who are prepared to give  assistance and be able to give the strength and the leadership  to be able to overcome the problems of this province.    [Hall-Green] Our first caller is on the line. Sir, it's  Charles Mannenberg, appropriately from your seat of power, and  that of course is Kimberley. Good morning to you, Charles.    [Mannenberg] Good morning. Tell me, Mr. Dipico, with  Kimberley being dominated by the mining enterprise and the  conglomerate situation there, and the municipality tax has been  awfully high -- and Kimberley has been awfully deprived of  recreational facilities and sporting facilities for the last 100  years by such enterprises -- what are you going to do about the  situation to encourage youth to stay away from criminal  elements, and leaving school at very early ages. How are you  going to encourage them to uplift the situation in Kimberley  itself?    [Dipico] What we are fortunate about Kimberley is that we  are unanimous as a provincial legislature to accept Kimberley as  a capital, and we've gone out to sell Kimberley as a capital of  this province. That in itself brings confidence to the local  investors, and confidence in the foreign investors to come into  Kimberley and really to give it another picture, which is a  positive one. And we are also looking at the mining industry,  which is really going down. To look at new challenges and new  other avenues which we believe can actually give Kimberley a new  shape and a new future. This is going to go around the whole  tourist industry, and the whole secondary industries which we  believe will be able to absorb most of the mineworkers who have  been retrenched.    Coming to the youth, within my own office of the premier we  have set up a youth commission, and also we have a minister  without portfolio who is dealing with youth affairs. We are  looking at job-creation areas which we believe would be able to  absorb the youth which is running amuck, and also looking at  capacity building, and looking at other institutions which we  believe will be able to bring programs into play which will give  interests to our youth in our province, so they can be going out  not to molest people, but to engage themselves in youth programs  which we believe will be constructive for the province.    [Hinds] We have George van Tonder from Carnarvon, and  we say good morning.    [Van Tonder] Premier Dipico, I would like to know what  you are going to do about the transport services. The railway  service has been suspended by the National Party in our remote  towns, also the bus services. [passage omitted]    [Dipico] What we want to say is that we have suffered a lot  in our province. Transport industry has really contributed to  the neglect of our province. We have identified that we've got  only two national roads running into our province, and that is  very bad if you are going to link up the whole industry of our  province. The railway area, we believe, has been a source of  income generation. The railway....[pauses] We have been having a  meeting. We had a meeting two weeks back with Transnet  [Transportation Network] to look how can we give life to the  railway lines which were linking up most of the areas. When you  look into Kimberley, go into Carnarvon, you don't really have  public transport. When we have to go to Upington or Springbok,  there is really no transport at all. And we believe that the  railway needs to be given life so that we can link up our more  important key areas, coindustrial areas, and be able to have  roads. There is no road running from Kimberley as a capital to  Springbok. And we believe that the taxi industry, given better  roads, is in a position to move from one place to another.  Moving from Calvinia to Upington will be a much better road to  travel if we can prepare the roads. [passage omitted]    [Hall-Green] We have Mr. Vic Pienaar from Delportshoop. Good  morning.    [Pienaar] Good morning, Mr. Dipico. I first want to  thank you for everything that you are planning to do for us in  the region. As a diamond digger in the Barkley West area --  Delportshoop, Barkley, Winterton area -- we are fairly big job  creators for people in the area, but we are sitting with a very  big mineral rights problem. We must try to survive on old,  exhausted diggings -- proclaimed state diggings. Then there are  people and companies who have mineral rights, who are not  interested in using them because they are too small for them  perhaps, or difficult. What is the possibility of this business  being addressed, and will a change come about regarding this  mineral rights issue?    [Dipico] What I want to tell you is that the whole approach  of the big mining houses, which have been exploiting the  minerals of our province -- we have realized that it is not in  the interest of the majority of our people in the province  because they just took the minerals and did not plow it back.  We need to [word indistinct] they need to be processed within  our province. But coming to the point is that small mine  diggers around Kimberley and around Namaqualand have suffered a  lot. Others have been around, but they could not mine those  diamonds because companies like De Beers own the mineral rights.  We had a summit a month ago where we brought all the small  diggers together to look at the proposals how do we beat, and  how do we move in to correct the situation.    The proposals came to the fore saying that we need to meet  De  Beers and other big companies to actually bring it to their  attention that small diggers need to be given the right also to  dig. That will create jobs for our people in Delportshoop,  Gonggong, Barkley West, and surrounding areas, and even in  Namaqualand and so on. We believe that is a source for revenue  which our province is in a position to gain. These diamonds  will be brought and be cut in Kimberley -- processed, polished  and be sent as a complete product which has been processed  already. We believe that it's a source generation for us, and  we are going to have a serious meeting with the big mining  houses to try to give an opportunity to the mineworkers, because  they themselves are not interested really to mine these small  areas. [passage omitted]    [Hinds] We've got another caller, Lourens Estherhysen from  the Strand. Good morning.    [Estherhysen] Mr. Premier, I know there's a lot of work to  be  done, and the ANC government as such promised a lot of  development here, and I know there's a lot going on, and I know  you have done a lot already, but can you tell me or the man in  the street -- can you tell the man in the street why is there no  physical evidence of anything going on? It's still exactly the  same as in the old government, and most of the people in this  area are Afrikaans-speaking. I'd like you to address them in  Afrikaans, please.    [Dipico] Lourens, I would like to speak Afrikaans, my  brother. I was born in the Northern Cape, I tried Afrikaans,  but unfortunately I cannot do it -- at this moment. I try, but  my tongue gets tied. I will get better; you must just give me a  chance. I'll try to address you today in English, which is  also one of the official languages of our province. I think you  will have to please pardon me with that one.    We in this province have been inundated with calls from our  various areas to say that what are the visible things we can see  from the promises you have made during the campaign as the ANC  -- ourselves, Manne Dipico, and the leadership from Mandela? I  have been going out with my team to explain to our people what  the process is. We are still committed to those promises, and  we are going to fulfill these promises. We said that  there is a timeframe to everything. We know that people are  impatient, but we believe for Kimberley, and for Northern Cape,  we are worse off in a sense that we don't have a building for  the administration of running the province. We have never had a  bureaucracy which is there in Cape Town, which is there in  Pretoria, which is there in other provinces, even in the Free  State. We have to go through a process of building that  administration first and foremost. We are busy with the  process; things are moving very fast.    We hope that with an efficient and effective administration  at the provincial level, we are in a position to carry out the  mandate for the millions of our people, and in particular in our  province. And we are hopeful. As we are interacting, that is  the result of the election of our people, we hope that they will  be able to participate effectively, and involve themselves in  programs of the government which are geared to address their own  problems. We have been sitting this weekend in a general  council of the ANC to see how best we can accelerate the  program, how best can we attain the goals which we have set  ourselves during the election. That process, we believe, is  going to be accelerated in terms of the proposals which came  forward. And I know that people are impatient, but it is best  to be able to inform them how the procedure will go, how we are  going to assist, and they themselves how they are going to  participate and assist us to reach and accelerate that process.  I know they want to see visible things, but I hope that in the  near future, before the end of this year, they will be able to  see something happening, and something visible in their little  towns. Thank you. [passage omitted]    Hall-Green] Thank you, Mr. Dipico, and we wish you great  success with your revitalization program of the Northern Cape,  and great strength to you, and we thank you for being with us  via our Bloemfontein studio this morning.</p>

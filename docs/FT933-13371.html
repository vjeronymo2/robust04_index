			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Fresh charges brought over Maxwell case: Defendants accused of frauds totalling more than Pounds 300m THE SIX MEN charged over the collapse of Robert Maxwell's publishing empire were sent for trial yesterday facing fresh charges alleging frauds totalling more than Pounds 300m. The new charges replace the original holding charges, which alleged a number of offences including fraud and the theft of pension-fund assets, and totalled some Pounds 130m. The new charges were brought by the Serious Fraud Office against the six defendants amid considerable secrecy late last week. They were only disclosed at yesterday's magistrates court hearing to transfer the case to the crown court. In revising the indictment the SFO has made substantial changes to the charges faced by the defendants. The original theft charges brought against Mr Kevin Maxwell, the youngest son of the late publisher, and Mr Larry Trachtenberg, a former adviser to Maxwell, relating to the Mirror Group pension funds, have been replaced by one alleging conspiracy to defraud. One new charge, brought against Mr Kevin Maxwell and his late father, also alleges conspiracy to defraud the pension funds managed by Bishopsgate Investment Management. The charge involves Pounds 102m and relates to the sale of more than 5m shares in the Scitex Corporation. Other new charges have also been made alleging conspiracies to defraud Credit Suisse, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Mirror Group Newspapers. Mr Kevin Maxwell now faces 10 charges of conspiracy to defraud, totalling more than Pounds 300m. Those include alleged attempts to defraud the Mirror Group Pension Scheme and various banks such as Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corporation and Swiss Volksbank. Mr Trachtenberg faces four counts of conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 125m. Mr Robert Bunn, the former finance director of Maxwell Communication Corporation, faces five charges of conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 120m. Mr Ian Maxwell faces three counts of conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 71m. Mr Albert Fuller, a former MGN treasurer, faces two charges of conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 75m. Mr Michael Stoney, a former Mirror Group Newspaper finance director, faces one charge of conspiracy to defraud MGN of Pounds 50m and two related charges of falsifying documents. Five of the six men appeared at City of London magistrates court yesterday for the hearing to transfer the case to the Old Bailey - Mr Stoney is on holiday in Florida. Conditional bail was extended for all six. The first of the trials is not expected to begin until the middle of next year.</p>

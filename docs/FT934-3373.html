			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Sellafield deaths put at 200 worldwide About 200 people worldwide may die in the long term as a result of cancer caused by radioactive discharges from Sellafield, a government nuclear advisory committee has told the Department of the Environment. The Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee says in a letter to environment minister Mr Tim Yeo that the Thorp reprocessing plant, which is waiting for a licence to start operation, could be responsible for a fifth of this total. The letter, dated November 5, has been leaked to Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group. The letter emphasises that the projection covers tens of thousands of years, and that individual deaths cannot be predicted. It says the dose to the world's population from the discharges is tiny - only 0.03 per cent of the dose from background radiation. The significance of the letter is that it partly supports Greenpeace's claim that radioactive discharges from Sellafield will cause deaths - but also that it describes Greenpeace's use of such statistics as 'misleading'. Greenpeace's claim of an increase in deaths has been part of its campaign against the Thorp plant. A government decision on whether to license the Pounds 2.8bn plant, which has taken 10 years to build, is expected imminently. The environment department said yesterday: 'We asked RWMAC for their opinion and their views will be taken into account.' UK Nirex, the government's Nuclear Industry Radioactive Waste Executive, which has been given the task of finding a site to store nuclear waste, said yesterday that it would apply early next year for planning permission for a deep underground laboratory near Sellafield. The laboratory would explore whether a store could be built safely in the rocks at that site. Letters, Page 22</p>

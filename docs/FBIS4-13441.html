			<p>BFN     [Text] Pakistan has appealed for an emergency session of  the UN Security Council [UNSC] to consider the situation as a  result of the Serb attack on the besieged Muslim town of Gorazde  in Bosnia. An official press statement issued in Islamabad says  that, through Pakistani efforts, a group of nonaligned countries  have presented a draft resolution in the UN Security Council  demanding the withdrawal of Serb forces from Gorazde. The draft  resolution calls upon the UN protection force to use all  available means, including the use of force, to foil the Serb  aggression against Gorazde. Pakistan hopes that the members of  the UN Security Council will discharge their obligation to save  the people of Goradze from the aggression. They should take  urgent and concrete steps for the security of the population of  Gorazde and other UN-protected areas. Pakistan has especially  appealed to the North Atlantic Council [three preceding words in  English] to immediately order air action against the Serbs. The  statement says the government and people of Pakistan are deeply  anguished by the brutal action and aggression by Serb forces  against the Muslims of Gorazde.</p>

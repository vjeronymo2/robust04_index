			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Paterson Zochonis shares fall on warning Shares in Paterson Zochonis fell 51p to 438p yesterday after the detergent and soap manufacturer warned that profits for the current half year would be hurt by problems in Nigeria. The statement accompanied results for the year to the end of May showing pre-tax profits up from Pounds 25.3m to Pounds 28.1m, while sales increased from Pounds 233.4m to Pounds 266.6m. Operating profits at the group, 65 per cent held by the Zochonis family, the directors and related interests, were ahead from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 15.4m. The share of profits from associated companies - mainly in Nigeria - increased from Pounds 3.16m to Pounds 4.73m. Nigeria accounts for about 30 per cent of sales. Mr Alan Whittaker, finance director, said that the group's operations there were suffering from a lack of foreign exchange in the banking system, hitting their ability to import sufficient raw materials. Factory throughput would have to be reduced, Mr Whittaker said, and exports of chemicals from the UK to Nigeria would also fall. He hoped to see some improvement after the Nigerian budget at the beginning of next year. The second most important contributor to the group is Cussons in the UK, which accounted for sales of about Pounds 65m. Mr Whittaker said Cussons, owner of the Imperial Leather brand, had improved its share of the liquid soap market from 5 to 20 per cent, and had slightly increased its market share for conventional soap to 23-24 per cent. The Polish detergents operation, acquired in March last year, exceeded expectations and contributed Pounds 25m to turn-over. Profits were ahead in Australia and Thailand, and the Indonesian operations looked like moving into the black this year. Profits in Greece recovered from low olive oil prices and a decision on a second factory was expected soon. The pre-tax line was struck after investment income of Pounds 13.9m (Pounds 16.4m) and payment of Pounds 5.87m (Pounds 5.73m) in interest. The balance sheet shows investments of Pounds 167m. Mr Whittaker said further acquisitions were possible, but they were likely to be modest purchases in areas where markets were expanding, such as eastern Europe. Earnings per share emerged at 36.6p (32.01p). A final dividend of 11.4p is proposed, taking the total for the year to 13.85p (12.6p).</p>

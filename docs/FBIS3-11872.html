Nevertheless, diplomatic sources do not believe President  Gaviria will attain the needed absolute majority of votes during  the first round of balloting by the OAS foreign ministers.    Tomorrow in Washington, 34 OAS member-nations will elect the  seventh OAS secretary general. Colombian President Cesar  Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus are the  strongest candidates to replace Brazilian Joao Baena Soares as  secretary general.    [Soares] "The most important thing for me is to complete my  term in office by following the principles I established for  myself from the very beginning."    On the eve of the elections, President Gaviria seems to be  leading. Gaviria has the support of 16 countries, three more  than his closest opponent -- Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus.    [Niehaus] "There are no blocs, and there are no secret  commitments. We are only committed to ensuring respect for the  OAS Charter."    To win the election, a candidate must receive an absolute  majority of all votes cast -- in other words, 18 votes to keep  the election from going to a second round.    [Former Colombian Foreign Minister Augusto Ramirez Ocampo]  "If logic prevails, President Gaviria will win. Gaviria is a  president, whereas Niehaus is a foreign minister. Gaviria also  has the support of the largest countries on the continent."    Whoever the winner is, he will face the great challenge of  reviving what many international analysts have described as a  moribund organization.    [Analyst Diego Uribe Vargas, identified by caption]  "Whenever  it can, the United States disregards inter-American laws and  principles, beginning with nonintervention, which is the first  and foremost rule."    Experts say the new secretary general must bolster the OAS  profile, making it stronger in the face of the U.S. Government.  Many believe the OAS is excellent in theory, but that does not  work in practice.    [Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin] "The new secretary  general must have the discipline and commitment to work for  everyone while excluding no one, especially those that need help  the most."    This evening the Colombian foreign minister was working hard  to ensure the votes of two undecided countries to lock up the 18  votes needed by President Gaviria.</p>

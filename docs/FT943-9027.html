			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rate rise shockwaves ease in the afternoon The shock administered by Thursday's key rate rises in Sweden and Italy was alleviated to some extent by lower than expected inflation data in the US, a recovery in Treasuries and the same pattern in European bond markets, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was nearly 2 per cent down at one stage as the Bundesbank's average bond yield rose 26 basis points to 7.11 per cent. However, the Dax index closed the session 30.60 lower at 2,124.68, a 2.7 per cent loss on the week, recovered to an Ibis-indicated 2,133.74 at the end of the post-bourse. Turnover rose again, from DM7.1bn to DM7.7bn. The session was notable for falls in the leaders, Allianz and Daimler both dropping more than 2 per cent, Siemens by DM10.50 to DM673.10 and Deutsche Bank by DM12.80 to DM693.20. Germany's biggest bank was more than 6 per cent down on a painful week which culminated in debt rating fears, waved away by Standard &amp; Poors and Moody's, and an earnings downgrade by Lehman Brothers from DM50 to DM43.40 a share. Metallgesellschaft fared worse, DM16, or 7.7 per cent lower at DM190.50 after the board expressed caution about a DM250 a share rights issue price. PARIS just held the 2,000 support level, the CAC-40 index sliding by 31.98 or 1.6 per cent to 2,006.95, down 4.8 per cent on the week after a session low of 1,992.52. Turnover was FFr3.5bn. Alcatel Alsthom, down FFr23 at FFr600, was marked down sharply after Lehman Brothers downgraded the stock from outperform to underperform, cut its 1994 and 1995 estimates, and said that it was removing the company from its recommended list. Lehman said that problems in the German telecoms division would result in a 1994 loss, while its entry into the mobile telephone market was 'somewhat late, such that they (Alcatel) will produce 500,000 handsets in 1994, compared with Nokia's 25m. Other potential positives for the stock - orders in China and ATM (a new telecommunications technology) are either too small or too far off to have a material impact on earnings in the short term.' MILAN reacted to Thursday's after-hours rate move by marking down prices across the board. Nerves were frayed further by rumours that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, might step down as the lira came under renewed pressure on the money markets. Mr Berlusconi was due to make a televised address to the nation last night. The Comit index closed down 24.74 or 3.7 per cent at 644.43, a fall of 8.4 per cent on the week. Mr William Cowan of James Capel in London remarked that the Bank of Italy, through its 'opportunistic timing' of the rate rise, had sent a political message to the government of Mr Berlusconi. With most of the country's political leaders currently on holiday, Mr Cowan thought it was unlikely that the government would react immediately to the bank's action. However, he thought the bank's action would have a positive outcome, causing the government to take measures to reduce the budget deficit. AMSTERDAM ended a heavy week of results with good figures from Unilever, which came in at the top end of expectations; but the overall tone was negative. Unilever picked up Fl 2.10 to Fl 195.90, off a high of Fl 197.90 and unable to sustain the AEX index which closed off 2.38 at 414.43, a week's fall of 1.2 per cent. ZURICH recovered from an intraday decline of nearly 2 per cent to end with the SM1 index down 8.3, or just 0.3 per cent at 2,580.5, 0.4 per cent lower on the week. Financials were a percentage point weaker on the day. But Swissair, up SFr6 at SFr855, was 6.9 per cent up on the week and SMH, adding another SFr2 at SFr182, a full 10.3 per cent better over five days. MADRID's afternoon recovery left the general index down 5.49 at 312.89, 2.8 per cent lower on the week. Turnover of Pta35.1bn was high, considering the August holiday period. Analysts suggested that the market was still nervous because of rate-rise possibilities, especially in Europe. The banking group, Argentaria, obviously rate sensitive, weakened Pta230, or 4 per cent to close at Pta5,500. STOCKHOLM, too, closed above its worst, in this case falls of around 3 per cent, with the Affarsvarlden General index down 25.20 at 1416.30, off 4.7 per cent on the week, in heavy turnover of SKr2.73bn. Analysts felt that the big market correction was over, and anticipated rises.

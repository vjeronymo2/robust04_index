			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / It hasn't been a piece of cake: Two years on, John Major has survived several storms but still lacks a cohesive programme It is not an anniversary he can relish. As Mr John Major this weekend contemplates two years in Downing Street the unspoken question among his colleagues is whether he can be confident of a third and fourth. The answer is almost certainly yes. For all the errors, the self-inflicted wounds and the sheer bad luck of recent months, there has been no challenge to his leadership. But the simple fact that the question must be asked - and the response must be qualified - underlines the failure of his government to deliver on its promises. When he first crossed the threshold of Number 10 on November 28 1990, Mr Major promised to replace the final, frenzied, spasms of Thatcherism with policies to create a nation at ease with itself. Instead, two years of unremitting economic gloom have left the country depressed and demoralised. Caring Conservatism has a distinctly hollow ring. There is time for the prime minister to make amends and for the government to demonstrate the competence and authority which have deserted it since September 16 when sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism tore the heart from its economic strategy. If the Tory party and its leader keep their nerve, they have more than four years to fashion new policies from the wreckage and to erase the bad memories from the minds of the electorate. More than one minister has recalled in recent weeks that Harold Wilson survived the humiliating devaluation of 1967. And, for the moment, the Palace of Westminster has been enveloped by an eerie calm. Save for this week's revelations about the less-than-healthy state of the chancellor's personal finances, the government has been spared embarrassing headlines for nearly two weeks. The bunker mentality in Downing Street has lifted. Mr Major has appeared relaxed, if still fatigued, as he has returned to the ordinary business of government. He played a pivotal role in securing last week's farm trade agreement between Brussels and Washington. He is now making a start on the intricate negotiations which will precede the Edinburgh EC summit in 10 days. He has performed well in the House of Commons in the past few weeks, comfortably outscoring Mr John Smith in his question-time duels with the Labour leader. The government's supporters at Westminster - exhausted by the rows over Europe, the coal industry and the economy - have paused to lick their wounds. The economic recovery package which accompanied the Autumn Statement was well received. Tory MPs have turned their energies from faction-fighting on the backbenches to delivering the government's legislative programme. A senior minister says the same calm has returned to the cabinet table. A colleague offers an engagingly frank assessment: 'We are still in an enormous hole but we seem to have stopped digging.' Mr Major has made some bad mistakes; over the coal closures, in his handling of the arms to Iraq controversy as well as the ERM debacle. They may well deprive permanently his premiership of the youthful magic that came with victory against the odds in the April general election. He shares the weakness of many in the still relatively inexperienced team he has assembled in Downing Street: an unwillingness to admit those mistakes. It makes him appear brittle and defensive. But he is a more resilient politician than his critics sometimes imagine. He is clear-thinking and patient. He is determined to survive. The odds are that he will. The real question now perhaps is whether he can do more than that. Holding on to office is not the same as governing the country. The sticking plasters, U-turns and tactical swerves which have characterised policy since Black Wednesday are no substitute for a coherent strategy. Mr Major's government has to rediscover its energy and sense of purpose. The pessimists at Westminster - and there are plenty within the Tory party after the misfortunes of the past two months - see little immediate hope. The recession continues to drain the government's authority. The Treasury's forecasts point to no early respite. The consequences threaten to deprive the Conservatives of their most powerful political weapon: the scope for cuts in income tax. So it is not hard to sketch the gloomy scenario in which Mr Major remains a helpless prisoner of events as his government stumbles from one crisis to another. Output continues to fall, unemployment to rise. The government is forced to confront again the issue of closures in the coal industry. Public borrowing surges ever higher. The Treasury demands Budget tax increases just as the bills for the council tax land on the nation's doormats. The nurses mobilise opinion against public sector pay restaint. Euro-sceptics in the Conservative party call an end to the truce in their civil war over Maastricht. Perhaps, but the prime minister's friends argue with some justice that the pessimists ignore the undoubted successes of Mr Major's leadership - and his capacity to adjust. The critics also may be making the mistake of projecting the present into an indefinite future. If there is a single lesson to be drawn from events of the past six months it is the speed with which the political mood can change. Mr Major's defenders have a point. After his victory on April 9, there were few who suggested anything but that the prime minister was secure in office for at least five years and, quite possibly, for a decade. The dark prism of recent months obscures the undoubted triumphs of his premiership. The conventional wisdom now is that Labour could never have won the election. It did not seem like that at the time. If Mr Major's soap-box oratory was derided by the chattering classes, the electorate decided otherwise. He has restored cabinet government, decision-making by consensus rather than by diktat. Those who delighted in Mrs Thatcher's authoritarianism see it as sign of weakness. But amid the disasters of the past few months the restoration of collective responsibility has proved a useful shield. The anxiety now about the introduction next April of the council tax has tended to obscure Mr Major's success in ridding the country of its destructive predecessor. The poll tax has slipped from the news only because he abolished it. He knows, too, where he is going on Europe. His handling of the Maastricht treaty in the wake of the Danish referendum has been less than confident. At times he has appeared to pander to the irreconcilable Euro-sceptics on the Tory backbenches. Then he has veered into confrontations. But the policy which underlines his commitment to the treaty - swapping the angry Atlanticism of his predecessor for a policy aimed at keeping Britain at the centre of the European debate - is judged by most at Westminster to be compellingly right. His first foreign policy decision two years ago - to rebuild the bridges with Mr Helmut Kohl which had been burnt by Mrs Thatcher - has paid handsome dividends. It was Mr Kohl who gave Mr Major the support he needed to strike a deal at Maastricht. There are signs that the German leader may do the same again when the British presidency struggles to put the community back on course at next month's Edinburgh summit. The prime minister has also begun to take a grip on the government's economic strategy. He cannot escape the blow to his political and personal authority delivered by the ERM debacle. Nor with the economy in its present state can he argue with much conviction that the permanent defeat of inflation - once the centrepiece of his manifesto - is anything more than a pipedream. But after the initial shock of Black Wednesday the prime minister was the driving force behind the conversion to economic pragmatism reflected in the measures which accompanied the Autumn Statement. The abolition of restrictions on private financing of public sector projects, the investment incentives for industry and the tax concessions for motor manufacturers were pushed hard by Number 10 against a reluctant Treasury establishment. The government's policy now is to contain rather than eradicate inflation; and to deliver economic growth. It is one which recognises the importance of manufacturing industy and exports. His aides insist that the concept of a partnership with industry, which the prime minister floated in his speech to the Lord Mayor's banquet earlier this month, will be a recurring theme. A cabinet colleague admits happily that such policies mark another U-turn for a Conservative party which, in the 1980s, seemed to believe that manufacturing did not really matter: 'But if it works who cares?' The recent calm has allowed the government to focus again on other strands in its manifesto. The Citizen's Charter remains a target of derision but the critics may be underestimating its impact in transforming the public sector from a provider to a purchaser of services. The education bill marks another step along the road to individual choice which Mr Major argues is at the heart of his approach. The employment bill, currently before parliament, will mark the final nail in the coffin of trade union hegemony. After the upheavals since Black Wednesday this is not enough. Without a distinctive centre-piece for his economic strategy, Mr Major must give greater coherence to his government's programme. He has not yet found the rhetoric to translate a series of piecemeal measures into a cohesive philosophy. His premiership still lacks definition. In part it is a question of personal authority. Mr Major has been hardened by the ordeals of the past two months. But his enemies are not alone in complaining that Number 10 is neither decisive enough in its leadership nor robust enough in confronting critics. One test of his leadership over the next few weeks will be whether Mr Major is ready to reshuffle his cabinet. The growing consensus among his ministers is that the new economic policy demands a new face at the Treasury. Moving Mr Norman Lamont would require a toughness that the prime minister has yet to demonstrate. But more than anything else Mr Major needs economic recovery to restore his government's balance. The animosities and resentments in his party and the discontent and anxiety in the country at large will only be eased by a return to prosperity. Until then the best he can say is that he is bloodied, bowed but still standing.</p>

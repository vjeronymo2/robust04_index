			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Markets Report: Peseta features idle day The Spanish peseta was under pressure yesterday after Mr Pedro Solbes, the economics minister, said Spain would not be able to meet the Maastricht convergence criteria for economic union, writes Philip Gawith. The peseta fell to Pta82.33 per D-Mark, from Pta81.89 on Monday, after Mr Solbes said Spain would be unable to reduce its public deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 1997 - a condition laid down by the Maastricht treaty for monetary union. The news was hardly a surprise, but it was enough to dampen sentiment on a day when markets were stricken by a near paralysis of inactivity. Mr Nick Parsons, chief economist at CIBC, said a 'very large magnifying glass' was required to discern signs of life in the market. Mr David Barrett of NatWest Treasury commented: 'The foreign exchange market does not have too many ideas of its own. It is looking for some sort of outside impetus to give it direction.' The calm in foreign exchanges also reflects a return to stability in bond markets after the turmoil of last week. The main currency crosses were all stuck in very narrow trading ranges. Dollar/D-Mark traded in the DM1.7125 to DM1.7190 range; sterling/dollar in the Dollars 1.4865 to Dollars 1.4915 area and dollar/yen in the Y104.98 to Y105.51 range. Sterling failed to gain support from figures showing British industrial production and manufacturing to be stronger than anticipated in January. It finished weaker in London against the dollar at Dollars 1.4875 from Dollars 1.4906 on Monday. The Spanish economics minister's comments unsettled the Spanish bond markets and pushed yields higher. With a close relationship between the currency and bond markets, this weakness spilled over into the peseta. Analysts said there was perhaps also an element of delayed reaction to last week's 50 basis-point cut by the Bank of Spain in its key money rate. The market also clearly believes that the Spanish government is keen to lower rates to stimulate the weak economy. Also weighing on sentiment was the announcement by Moody's, the credit ratings agency, that it might downgrade the paper of Banco Central Hispano. Mr Chris Turner, currency analyst at BZW, said this had reminded the markets of the problems of another leading Spanish bank, Banesto, which ran into trouble in December. UK economic data releases showed industrial production up by 0.8 per cent in January for a year-on-year 4 per cent increase, and manufacturing output up 1.1 per cent from December. But sterling gained no support from this and ended at DM2.5516, a pfennig down from Monday's close. Most of this weakness came in a spate of late afternoon selling. Mr Mark Austin, treasury economist at Midland Global Markets, said the 'slight rumblings' about Prime Minister John Major's leadership had been a negative. 'The leadership talk has focused people's minds on the political problems that might occur later in the year.' Mr Turner said sterling appeared still to be suffering from the negative fallout that followed last month's rate cut. Many in the market chose to interpret that easing of policy as indicating a government view that the pound should not be allowed to rise too high on a trade-weighted basis. The D-Mark was fairly steady ahead of today's repo announcement, when the Bundesbank will announce the terms at which it is prepared to put money into the system. Banks are expected to have bid lower rates, encouraged by the view that the Bundesbank will continue easing credit. The lowest rate at today's allocation is expected to be in the 5.90 per cent to 5.95 per cent range. Last week the Bundesbank switched to a variable rate repo for the first time since mid-November. It had been setting tenders at a steady fixed rate of 6 per cent since December. The central bank allowed the repo rate to fall by 3 basis points to 5.97. The dollar traded quietly ahead of today's German repo announcement. It finished slightly easier at DM1.7155 from DM1.7184 and against the yen at Y105.225 from Y105.850. In New York it closed at DM1.7147 and Y105.25. Affecting the dollar's fortunes is the view that, on the one hand, the Bundesbank will only cut rates cautiously. On the other, although there is little dispute that the next move in US rates will be up, the timing of this is less certain. Mr Parsons argues that having destabilised markets with its last move, the Federal Reserve will be anxious to avoid a repeat performance when it next tightens. This may require a more cautious approach. The Bank of England did not operate in the early morning round yesterday after forecasting a liquidity shortage of Pounds 800m in the UK money market. In the afternoon it put Pounds 93m into the market through bill purchases at the established rate of 5 1/8 per cent. It gave Pounds 515m of late assistance.</p>

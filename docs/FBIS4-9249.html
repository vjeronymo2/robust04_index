			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 20 (CTK) -- The Czech Government today  approved a supplement to the payments agreement between the  Czech Republic and Slovakia eliminating the old account, Deputy  Premier Josef Lux announced. Payments on the old account of the  trade payments clearing system served for settling transactions  concluded between the two countries before the currency division  on February 8, 1993 and were effected at an exchange rate of one  Czech to one Slovak crown. Lux added that the government at the  same time agreed to discuss a new agreement between both  republics, under which non-government liabilities arisen before  the currency division would be transferred to the current  clearing account, used for the payment of liabilities arisen  after the currency division at the rate valid on February 8,  1993 -- 34.5 crowns (1.15 USD) to one ECU. State payments from  the old account would continue to be paid at the one to one  exchange rate.    According to data provided by the Czech Republic, Czech  companies owed 2 to 3 billion crowns (70-100 million USD) at the  end of the first quarter and Slovak companies 12 to 14 billion  crowns (400-460 million USD).</p>

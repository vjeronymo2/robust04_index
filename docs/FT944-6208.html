			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Solutions found at British Library Solutions to outstanding technical problems at the new British Library have been found, according to national heritage secretary Stephen Dorrell. The government's response to recommendations made by the National Heritage Select Committee confirms that construction is planned for completion by the end of 1996. Faulty cabling will be protected by automatic fuse switches and the sprinkler system will have increased capacity and be made more reliable. The Department of National Heritage plans to hand over the building to the British Library during the last quarter of 1996. It will then be for the Library to implement its plans for occupation and thereafter open to readers and the public.</p>

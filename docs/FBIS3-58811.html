			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Otmar Lahodynsky: "New EU Transit Position"] </F>   [Excerpts] The European Union (EU) shows itself ready to  recognize the main contents of the transit agreement for a  transition period for the entire national territory once Austria  becomes a member. A new, joint proposal by Germany, Italy, and  the Netherlands for the entry negotiations is making greater  concessions to Vienna's requests than the Commission's former  position, which wanted to limit the system of ecological points  to sensitive alpine regions.    The new initiative, the complete written version of which  should be presented as a new EU "joint position" next week,  provides, however, for a shorter period -- three years have been  mentioned -- for the ecological-points system, which was  concluded to last until 2004.    Three years have been mentioned as the EU's position for the  negotiations, while Germany would even accept a longer period.  In the case of an eight-year transition period starting in  1995, the agreed reduction of exhausts to 40 percent would be  achieved by the year 2002 according to the transit agreement  that came into force in 1993. In the Council's enlargement  group last Wednesday [19 January] there seemed to be a clear  majority in favor of the proposal offered by the three countries  most affected by the transit agreement. Some countries such as  France or Spain have not yet commented but do not reject the  initiative on principle. "Our proposal is certainly more  interesting for Austria than the former one, because it sticks  to those points of the transit agreement that are important for  you, such as its nationwide applicability," an Italian diplomat  told DIE PRESSE. [passage omitted]    Meanwhile, the transit issue is also straining ongoing  negotiations between the five EFTA [European Free Trade  Association] countries that participate in the European Economic  Area [EEA] and the EU on adopting over 400 EU legal regulations,  which have came into force in the EU since August 1991 -- the  date set for the EEA Agreement. Austria rejects some of the new  EU regulations regarding road-use fees or the transportation of  dangerous goods as incompatible with the transit agreement.</p>

			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Romania not to use force against Serb ships Romania yesterday said it would not use force against four Serbian ships travelling on the Danube towards Belgrade despite US calls on Romania and Bulgaria to prevent the vessels from breaking United Nations sanctions, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. The Romanian Foreign Ministry said it feared that the use of force against the ships, believed to be carrying more than 40,000 tonnes of oil, could lead to an 'ecological disaster'. Earlier this week a Serbian ship, also carrying oil, was allowed to pass into Serbian waters after its captain threatened to blow up the vessel or discharge its cargo into the Danube rather than surrender. The Danube delta in north east Romania is home to thousands of rare birds and other endangered species.</p>

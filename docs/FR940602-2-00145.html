A copy of this document may be obtained from the programmatic information contact designated in this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.

An original and two copies of the final performance report shall be submitted to the COTR.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The research effort described in this notice will be supported through the award of at least one cooperative agreement. NHTSA reserves the right to make multiple awards depending upon the merit of the applications received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contingent upon the availability of funds and satisfactory performance, a cooperative agreement(s) will be awarded to an eligible organization(s) for project periods of up to five years. No cooperative agreement awarded as a result of this notice shall exceed $550,000 per year or $2,750,000 for five years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to be eligible to participate in this cooperative agreement program, an applicant must be an educational institution or other nonprofit research organization. For profit research organizations may apply; however, no fee or profit will be allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each applicant must submit one original and two copies of their application package to: Cooperative Agreement Program No. DTNH22&hyph;94&hyph;R&hyph;07260, Office of Contracts and Procurement (NAD&hyph;30), NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., room 5301, Washington, DC 20590, USA. Only complete application packages received on or before the date identified above under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shall be considered. Submission of three additional copies will expedite processing but is not required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Application Contents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The application package must be submitted with OMB Standard Form 424 (Rev, 4&hyph;88, including 424A and 424B), Application for Federal Assistance, with the required information filled in and the certified assurances included. While the Form 424&hyph;A deals with budget information, and section B identifies Budget Categories, the available space does not permit a level of detail which is sufficient to provide for a meaningful evaluation of the proposed costs. A supplemental sheet should be provided which represents a detailed breakdown of the proposed costs, as well as any costs which the applicant proposes to contribute in support of this effort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

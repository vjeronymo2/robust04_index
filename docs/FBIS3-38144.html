			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paavo Rautio and Pekka Vuoristo: "Center and </F> Conservatives Unlikely To Throw Support"]    [Text] Leading figures in the two largest nonsocialist  parties believe that most of their supporters will get behind  Swedish People's Party candidate Elisabeth Rehn in the second  round. However, the Center Party is even more unlikely than the  Conservatives to give its voters any kind of recommendation as  to how to cast their ballots.    There are over a million votes to be gotten from those who  backed [defeated] Center Party candidate Paavo Vayrynen and  Conservative Party candidate Raimo Ilaskivi.    Forces working for Social Democratic Party's Martti  Ahtisaari  went immediately into action on Monday [17 January] to ward off  the threatening danger. SDP [Social Democratic Party] Member of  Parliament Kari Rajamaki declared Rehn the candidate of  far-right capitalist circles and reminded that she is a minister  in a government carrying out "an unjust social and economic  policy."    Similar expressions were heard in the stance taken by the  governing council of the National Labor Confederation's  Construction Workers Union. It believed a Rehn victory would  amount to a power-of-attorney letter for the present  government's economic policies, while Ahtisaari represents the  welfare state and common responsibility. The union board has a  Leftist Alliance leadership that is known to have been favorable  to Ahtisaari all along.  <H5>  Rehn Spirit in Center Party </H5>   The Center Party leadership will weigh its stance regarding  the second round in a party council meeting on Thursday. The  council is not expected to throw its support to another  candidate for the second round.    "This is hardly necessary," stated Center Party Secretary  Erja Tikka. According to Tikka, the overwhelming majority of  Center Party voters are going to back Rehn without any prodding.    Center Party Chairman and [Prime Minister] Esko Aho, while  following election returns on Sunday, let it be understood that  he is going to vote for Rehn. That party's provincial press also  began immediately on Monday marshaling forces behind Rehn's  candidacy.    If all of those who voted for Vayrynen decided to support  Rehn in the second round, she would get a good 6O,OOO votes.    The Center Party does not intend to punish editor Keijo  Korhonen nor Member of Parliament Eeva Kuuskoski for splitting  the party vote. It is only hoped in the leadership that Korhonen  and Kuuskoski will consider how they behaved.    Both Korhonen and Kuuskoski stated on Sunday that they do  not  intend "to bequeath" their votes to anybody.  <H5>  Conservatives Also Unlikely To Adopt a Position </H5>   Conservative Party Chairman Pertti Salolainen stated that  most Conservatives will support Rehn in the second round.    The Conservatives' Party Governing Board will discuss the  campaign situation on Wednesday, but according to Party  Secretary Pekka Kivela, it is unlikely to take a stand on a  candidate. On the other hand, it was not denied that a stand  would be taken. On Monday Salolainen stressed that discussion on  this issue had not yet started.    The reluctance to take a stand as a party is explained among  themselves by the fact that the party has favored direct  elections for the presidency.    Conservative candidate Raimo Ilaskivi garnered almost  one-half million votes in the first round.  <H5>  Haavisto Going To Vote for Ahtisaari </H5>   The governing board of the Greens discussed its choice for  president on Saturday in Helsinki. Party Chairman Pekka Haavisto  predicted that the board will not make a clear choice between  Ahtisaari and Rehn. It is to be expected that a list of both  candidates' pluses and minuses regarding most important issues  for the Greens will be drawn up.    According to Haavisto, this is going to be decided because  Rehn and Ahtisaari are tied in attracting Green votes.    Haavisto says he is going to vote for Ahtisaari. In his  opinion Rehn's stock is continually on the rise with Greens.  <H5>  Left Alliance Behind Ahtisaari </H5>   The Left Alliance is preparing to work behind the scenes  with  its own defeated candidate Claes Andersson and Ahtisaari  supporters who differ with him on European Union [EU]  membership. Party Secretary Matti Viialainen on Monday outlined  a position according to which the party is in support of  Ahtisaari. This would not be a vote recommendation, but in it  the party would express its view that Ahtisaari is the candidate  who would most creatively and decisively manage Finland's  foreign policy.    The party board will decide the issue on Wednesday, and  Viialainen assumed that coming to a decision will be difficult.  However, making the decision less onerous than it would  otherwise be is that both candidates are in agreement on Europe  policy. The EU question divides the Left Alliance, and it was  felt in advance that the party would have a hard time taking a  position if one candidate had been a Social Democrat and another  an opponent of EU.  <H5>  Christian Party Supporters Have Problem With EU </H5>   In the Christian League, the pro-Europe stands of Ahtisaari  and Rehn are causing an opposite phenomenon than that in the  Left Alliance.    According to the view of Party Secretary Jouko Jaaskelainen,  the party is going to have a hard time taking a position  precisely because neither candidate's opinion on the European  Union corresponds to the view held by the Christian League or  its [defeated] candidate Toimi Kankanniemi.    The Christian League governing board will discuss the  election today, but according to Jaaskelainen, it is not going  to give any recommendations. If any recommendations come, they  will be given by individual political figures, he stated.  <H5>  Rural Party Won't Bequeath Sulo Aittoniemi's Votes </H5>   Rural Party [SMP] Secretary Timo Soini said that his party  is  not going to make any definite vote recommendations. He  suspects, however, that some party leaders are going to state  their choice in advance.    The SMP will discuss possibly taking a position at a  governing board meeting on 26 January.    Soini also believes that among SMP voters Rehn has strong  support--mentioning veterans and active military personnel.  Soini also believes that the hardships of Rehn's personal  history will sound a note in SMP ranks.</p>

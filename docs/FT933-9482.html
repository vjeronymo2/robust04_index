			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Tesco halts imports of 25% cheaper Stella beer TESCO, the supermarket group, has stopped selling cut-price Stella Artois lager imported through its French subsidiary. The sales, though welcomed by consumers, had been seen as a threat to the profits of Whitbread, which brews the Belgian beer under licence in the UK, and to other brewers and importers of premium lagers. Whitbread has successfully promoted Stella Artois as 'reassuringly expensive', placing it in the premium price bracket. By obtaining supplies from France, where the beer is sold as a much cheaper standard brand, Tesco for the past four weeks has been offering a 24-pack of 25cl bottles for Pounds 9.99 - a discount of about 25 per cent. Though it seemed unlikely that Tesco could maintain the price for long without sacrificing profit margins, the move roused concern in the industry. British brewers and distributors saw it as a potential threat to their positions in the fast-growing premium lager market which they have created by spending heavily on marketing brands such as Stella Artois, Beck's and Holsten. Tesco's promotion was prompted in part by its concerns about the potential damage to its business of increased personal imports of beer by cross-Channel shoppers. Now that the promotion has ended, Whitbread, which also supplies Tesco with brands such as Heineken lager, Boddington ale, and Murphy's stout, will begin supplying the group with Stella Artois in continental-style packaging as well as cans, next month. 'It will be supplied at our usual prices,' the brewer said; and the 'reassuringly expensive' advertising will resume in October.</p>

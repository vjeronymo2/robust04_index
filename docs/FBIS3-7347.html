Bellicose, abusive remarks that threaten us are being uttered  by bosses in U.S. political circles who have started down a road  of breach of faith by overturning the DPRK-U.S. New York  agreement.    In a news conference on 18 March U.S. President Clinton  revealed his intention to resume the Team Spirit-94 joint  military exercise. On 22 March he ordered the deployment of  Patriot missiles to South Korea.    On 22 March U.S. Secretary of State Christopher, speaking at  the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, clamored that the  International community should take strong sanctions against  North Korea. On 24 March U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry  babbled that the United States will send additional troops and  weapons to South Korea in case the United Nations decides to  take sanctions against North Korea.    On 24 March Sam Nunn, chairman of the U.S. Senate Military  Affairs Committee, spreading a rumor that an attack by someone  is imminent, openly clamored that the United States should make  firm war preparations. In addition, the bellicose forces in the  United States these days are uttering random abusive remarks  threatening us militarily whenever an opportunity presents  itself.    At the same time, a Patriot missile battalion is moving from  the United States to South Korea, aircraft carrier fleets of the  U.S. Navy [mihaegun hanggong moham hamdaedul] are being  mobilized in the waters near our country, and large-scale U.S.  imperialist aggression armed forces on the U.S. mainland and in  areas near the Korean peninsula have assumed a mobilization  posture.    According to a South Korean newspaper report that quoted a  U.S. source, U.S. military authorities are mapping out an  operational plan in case of emergency on the Korean peninsula to  mobilize 600,000 troops, more than 200 naval ships, and more  than 1,600 airplanes from the U.S. mainland within 80 days.    Joining the adventurous war maneuvers by the U.S.  imperialists the South Korean puppet clique is now frantically  running wild to inspire war fever in an attempt to attack us.    On 21 March traitor Kim Yong-sam held a meeting of  security-related ministers in Chongwadae [presidential  headquarters] and clamored that a perfect military security  posture should be established to cope with someone's  provocation. On 22 March he again urged the puppet military  bosses to establish an iron-tight defense posture against North  Korea.    On 21 March traitor Kim Chong-pil of the Democratic Liberal  Party also clamored that a strong countermeasure should be taken  against the North. Furthermore, puppet National Defense  Minister Yi Pyong-tae clamored about a strong chastisement and  retaliation on 23 March at a meeting of the National Defense  Committee of the puppet National Assembly.    On 25 March puppet Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang clamored  about  the establishment of strong countermeasures in the puppet Joint  Chiefs of Staff and, thus, openly agitated for reunification  through a northward invasion. On 26 March he went so far as to  prowl about the puppet units in the frontline area, inspiring  war fever by babbling about the establishment of a perfect  defense posture.    According to a radio report from Seoul, the puppet Army held  an expanded staff meeting on 26 March and decided to further  strengthen its military posture in order to immediately perform  its combat mission in an emergency. It has also been revealed  recently that the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the  South Korean puppet Army has gone so far as to map out an  extremely dangerous new operational plan, known as 5027, calling  for northward invasion.    According to this war scenario the South Korean puppet Armed  Forces have been on security alert under traitor Kim Yong-sam's  instruction since 23 March. Along with this, the U.S.  imperialists these days are dragging various types of combat  planes, such as pursuit planes, vertical take-off and landing  planes, and fueling planes to the skies over South Korea to  stage with the puppets a provocative joint aerial war exercise  aimed at a northward invasion. The South Korean puppets are  firing weapons in the areas near the Military Demarcation Line  and the DMZ. Thus, day after day they are waging military  provocation maneuvers in the skies, on the ground, and at sea.  The whole land of South Korea is filled with a warlike  atmosphere.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Karlsruhe (DPA)--German firms have no right to  claim compensation from the state for losses arising from the  embargo imposed on Iraq in August 1990. The foreign trade ban,  decreed in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, was imposed by  the Council of the European Union (EU); thus, losses can only be  attributed to the "Community legislator," the Federal Court of  Justice said in a ruling announced today. A compensation claim  by a vehicle manufacturer, who has since gone bankrupt, has thus  been finally rejected.    In mid-1989, the company had concluded with an Iraqi  Government company a contract to supply 100 low-loader trucks  that were intended for use as transport vehicles in the Iraqi  oil fields. A total of 25 vehicles were delivered and paid for.  The delivery of the remaining 75 vehicles, which was due in the  summer of 1990, did not take place because of the embargo on  Iraq that banned, among other things, the export of all goods  from EU countries to Iraq and Kuwait. The vehicle manufacturer  demanded compensation for his fruitless expenditure and lost  profits. [passage omitted]</p>

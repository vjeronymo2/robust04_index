			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: Citic wins autonomy from Beijing CHINA has given Citic, the state-owned investment company most closely linked with economic reform policies, broad autonomy to borrow and invest without central government permission, the China Daily newspaper said, Reuter reports from Beijing. China International Trust and Investment Corp, Beijing's most westernised company with businesses ranging from banking to real estate to satellites, can now borrow overseas without obtaining prior approval, as long as it keeps within a ceiling set for the five years ending in 1995. Citic now also has complete autonomy to decide on investment projects under Yn200m (Dollars 37m) at home and Dollars 30m abroad, the official newspaper said. It did not say what the five-year ceiling on borrowing was. Mr Wei Mingyi, Citic president, said the organisation now had complete freedom to decide the amount of loans, their tenor, the market, the lead managing bank and the currency. Previously the government had to approve each case. The lifting of investment restrictions will also speed Citic's business. Mr Wei said in the past it had sometimes taken months to receive approval for even a Dollars 1m project. Citic hopes to have diversified investments around the world with its shares listed and traded on exchanges worldwide within a decade, the newspaper said. The company last year benefited from the fast growth in China's economy and recorded one of its best results. Profits jumped 42.5 per cent to Yn368.9m from Yn258.8m, according to its latest annual report. It recorded only 5 per cent profit growth in 1990 compared to 1989 because of a market slump and a domestic credit crunch.</p>

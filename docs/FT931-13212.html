			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Coal not dole Conveniently for the government, Friday's report from the mining engineers John T. Boyd gave structural support to the likely emergency exit route from the coal fiasco. While the general economic case for closure and selection of particular pits received backing, several pits could apparently be saved. Some 15m tonnes of additional domestic coal could be burned if no further gas-fired plant were ordered, no coal were imported and the electricity generators' coal stocks were not run down as quickly as planned. That might save around 12 pits, which, oddly enough, is about the number Boyd thinks could be made profitable if they were subsidised whilst working practices are changed. By making clear that the coal is uneconomic, the report also removes risks from the generators and regional electricity companies. They can hardly be expected to bear the extra Pounds 200m cost. With the Treasury strapped for cash, the subsidy will have to come from consumers. Since public opposition forced the coal review, the government may be tempted to make the costs as obvious as possible through a direct levy. To avoid electricity bills rising, however, it might contrive to reduce the current nuclear levy without substantially damaging Nuclear Electric. Such an outcome would suit the generating companies, whose helpful attitude will have earned them political brownie points, lessening the risk of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. The RECs, however, risk squandering political advantage if they continue to squabble about which of them should buy the extra coal-fired electricity.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Uk Kimseng] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh -- Two Vietnamese immigrants have been  killed at a fishing lot at Plalay Meas, Kompong Chhnang  Province, which is 90 kms north of the capital city.    The Socialist Republic of Vietnam, through its embassy here,  held the Khmer Rouge guerrillas accountable for the massacre.    The Embassy's open letter, received here recently, said an  armed group of the Khmer Rouge stopped the fishing boat  belonging to Le Van Tuong, 80, and his son Le Van Thanh, 20, who  were claimed to have lived here for a very long time.    The guerrillas were reported to have abducted the two  Vietnamese and beaten them to death on the heads with rowing  oars.    The dead bodies were found afloat in the river recently by  the bereaved family who were searching for the missing members,  according to the Embassy.    The Embassy has criticised the local police for delaying  further investigation when informed by a representative of the  Vietnamese immigrants.    The Embassy also said another four Vietnamese residents were  missing recently and their names and whereabouts have not been  verified yet.    The Vietnamese government looks forward to assistance from  the Royal Government in investigating and taking effective  measures to prevent the recurrence of the incident.    As far as illegal immigration is concerned a number of  newspapers here strongly condemned the Vietnamese government for  what they call encouraging Vietnamese migration to this country,  while the Royal Government has not been able to tackle the  problems of mismanagement and loose administrations within the  concerned authorities.    The newspaper SAKOL recently said "the influx of Vietnamese  immigrants into this country reveals the long-term objective of  the late communist hardliner `Ho Chi Minh' who wished to annex  and swallow Cambodia two decades ago".    "There are new Vietnamese squatters at Chrang Chamres, near  Monivong Bridge, who cannot speak a word in the Khmer language,"  the paper reported.    The paper accused the Royal Government of being indifferent  to the increasing number of illegal immigrants.    However, the Royal Government has managed to resolve some of  these immigration problems.    Reports from Takeo Province said about 50 armed Vietnamese  people have agreed to withdraw from Boreicholasa District where  they came from and did farming without the knowledge or  permission of the host district governor.    Previously, they illegally encroached on the nation's  territory 70 metres deep and 1,500 metres long for rice farming.    After several rounds of negotiations, the two governors of  Takeo-Cambodia and An Giang-Vietnam finally reached a solution.    It should be noted that the National Assembly has already  adopted the Immigration Law but the implementation is rather  slow.</p>

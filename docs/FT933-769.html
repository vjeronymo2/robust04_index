			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Investor holds Dollars 1bn in Brazil debt: Private stake held by Dart family of US complicates restructuring A US private investor has become one of Brazil's biggest commercial creditors and is complicating the restructuring of Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.9bn) of debt, according to bankers close to negotiations between the Brazilian government and banks. It is the first time a private investor has had a significant impact in a big bank debt restructuring, although banks began to sell their Latin American loans to private investors in the mid-1980s. According to bankers, a stake of close to Dollars 1bn face value has been built by interests belonging to Mr Kenneth Dart, president of Dart Containers, and the Dart family, which made its fortune from the invention in 1960 of the polystyrene cup. This stake, bought at significant discount to face value, would make the family one of the top five holders of Brazilian bank debt. Brazil offered holders of its bank debt a choice of six options in the restructuring, but reserved the right to alter the final balance between options. A majority of debt holders opted for a so-called 'par' bond, which is most expensive from the government's point of view. The government wanted to reduce the share of par bonds to 40 per cent of total debt. Most big banks agreed to adjust their choices but the Dart family was unwilling to do so, the bankers said. Representatives from the family were not immediately available for comment. Brazil's leading bank creditors, headed by Citibank of the US, and Brazilian officials have met representatives of the family to persuade them to adjust their choices, but appear to have failed. Notwithstanding this, bankers in Washington yesterday said the government and its leading bank creditors had decided to move ahead with the documentation and signing of the restructuring agreement. The documentation will be put before the Brazilian Senate for approval in early October. Brazilian officials said the plan was to begin signing the agreement by early October and complete it by the end of November. The deal would be closed by the end of February on the agreement of a standby loan accord between Brazil and the International Monetary Fund. This agreement would let the US Treasury issue bonds to Brazil to act as collateral in the deal. However, it is possible some banks will protest at large investors 'cheap-riding' by being allowed to choose a more favourable option than most of the banks. 'The problem is that this is an entity that is not sensitive to the usual concerns of central bankers and the regulators,' said one US banker. The development has led bankers to question whether the mostly co-operative approach to bank debt rescheduling can continue with an ever-larger proportion of the debt held by individual investors. A number of lawsuits, designed to force payments from debtor governments, have been filed by non-bank investors over last year.</p>

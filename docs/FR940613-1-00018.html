			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule would: Require the submission of a full appraisal report, including a complete and detailed description of the elements that make up an appraisal report, justification for the methodology employed and sufficient support for the conclusions reached therein; require a depositor vote on all mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks and prohibit management's use of previously executed (or ``running'') proxies to satisfy depositor voting requirements; for one year following the date of the conversion, among other things, require that any management recognition plans or stock option plans be implemented only after shareholder approval is received, require that stock options (if any) be granted at no lower than the market price at which the stock is trading at the time of grant and prohibit MRPs funded by conversion proceeds; require that the record date for determining depositors eligible to receive rights to participate in the subscription offering of the conversion stock not be less than one year prior to the date of adoption of the plan of conversions by the converting bank's board of trustees; require that the subscription offering provide a preference to eligible depositors and others in the bank's ``local community'' (as defined in the proposed rule) or within 100 miles of the bank's home office or branch(es); require that employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) not have a priority over subscription rights of ``eligible depositors'' (as defined in the proposed rule); require the submission of a business plan, including, among other things, a detailed discussion of how management intends to deploy the capital raised through the sale of stock in the conversion; and prohibit stock repurchases within one year following the conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Discussion of Each Proposed Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following is a discussion of each of the requirements in the proposed rule. Many of the requirements are engendered by the Board's concerns about bank management's proper exercise of its fiduciary duties. As discussed in the preamble to the Interim Rule, the duties and obligations of trustees and officers of mutual savings banks are identical to the responsibilities the FDIC has historically enunciated and enforced concerning directors and officers of commercial banks. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The two principal duties of care and loyalty that directors and officers of commercial banks must exercise on behalf of the institution and its constituencies ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , depositors, creditors and shareholders) also obligate trustees of mutual savings banks. Both duties have long antecedents in the common law of corporations and financial institutions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Statement Concerning the Responsibilities of Bank Directors and Officers <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (FDIC Legal Division, December 3, 1992); Pocket Guide for Directors (FDIC 1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Greenfield Savings Bank  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Abercrombie <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , 211 Mass. 252, 97 N.E. 897, 39 L.R.A.n.s. 173 (1912) provides a detailed discussion of liability of trustees of a savings bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Trustees (as well as officers) of mutual savings institutions are held to the same standard of care and loyalty as directors and officers of stock banks. Thus, the trustees must fulfill their duty of loyalty to the institution by administering its affairs with the utmost candor, personal honesty and integrity. They are prohibited from advancing their own personal or business interests or those of others at the expense of the bank. This general fiduciary duty has been frequently interpreted to include an element of fairness and good faith which, in the context of mutual-to-stock conversions, affords protection to the various stakeholders (particularly depositors) of mutual savings banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDIC, through the Interim Rule, also requires the trustees of mutual savings banks to adhere to the same standards of loyalty and care that are required of directors and officers of stock institutions in order to prevent insider abuse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Publicized insider abuse (and the lawsuits that such abuses may engender) may have a sufficiently significant impact upon the reputation of a bank to affect its continued viability and, thus, its safety and soundness, resulting in a regulatory violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As indicated above, the requirements in the proposed rule are rooted in concerns about safety and soundness, breaches of fiduciary duty and/or other violations of law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Sex-case senator vows to stay on SENATOR Bob Packwood, the veteran Republican from Oregon, yesterday said he intended to stay on in the Senate in spite of charges that he had engaged in a pattern of sexual harassment towards women for 20 years. He refused to discuss any of the dozen and more incidents of which he has been accused. But he apologised for behaviour which he said 'was not just inappropriate or boorish, but just plain wrong'. Mr Packwood conceded that 'the bonds of trust' linking him and the people of Oregon had been badly strained. He was narrowly returned for a new six-year term last month before the Washington Post published an article detailing the charges against him. He pledged to rebuild that trust and said that his actions had been 'out of synch' with a long political career in which he had consistently practised 'gender neutral' policies. His determination to stay in office may yet be tested further. The Senate ethics committee is to hold hearings in the New Year on his case, which has attracted wide public attention. In addition, Oregon has liberal recall statutes, which could lead to him facing a special election. Two other senators, Mr David Durenberger from Minnesota and Mr Daniel Inouye from Hawaii, have also faced recent allegations of sexual harassment. Some women's groups have demanded that Mr Packwood stand down.</p>

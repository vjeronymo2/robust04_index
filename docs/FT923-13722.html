			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Books: Eager debutants - Crime NO ONE who attempts to follow crime fiction expects to find a masterpiece every time he or she picks up a new book. The murder fan seeks not so much a great work as a comfortable read, a story that catches the imagination, but allows the reader to relax at the same time. If, into the bargain, the author writes well, so much the better. The current stack of new thrillers happily includes some debuts of distinct promise, even though there are no masterpieces to report for the moment. Veronica Stallwood's Death Spell (Macmillan, Pounds 13.99, 207 pages) has some Rendell-like skewed psychology, but also has some welcome, individual qualities, chief of which is an evident gift for characterisation. The protagonist is an attractive but irretrievable sloven, who lives with her atrocious second husband in a fairly grand house near Oxford. She is surrounded by a raft of children, some his, some hers, and the resultant dirty linen, unwashed dishes, racket and disorder. As you read Stallwood's wry, implacable description, you can almost smell the burnt toast. The marginal characters - husband, neighbours, and a splendidly efficient woman who runs a house-cleaning service - are neatly drawn. The actual murder may be something of a disappointment (the Rendellian element is too prominent), but the book is irresistibly readable. Scotland has always been an ideal venue for misdeeds, but in Double Entry, the first murder story of Margaret McKinlay (Collins, Pounds 13.99, 190 pages), the author uses local colour sparingly, and it is thus all the more effective. This is one of those stories in which an apparently harmless, virtually anonymous person becomes mysteriously the victim of violence and threats of worse. Numbed by the tragic loss of his young wife, the accountant John Leith has not cultivated other people, and even with his girlfriend he has a somewhat business-like relationship. His battle against evil ends with him not only victorious, but also re-humanised. According to the blurb, Leith will be the protagonist of future tales. It will be interesting to follow him. A nearly-decomposed body is found in a long-neglected farm building, and a 10-year-old suspicion of murder is revived. Ninette Walters, in her first novel, The Ice House (Macmillan, Pounds 13.99, 240 pages), bites off a lot of story, perhaps a bit more than the reader will want to chew. But, in allowing herself ample space, she makes it possible to develop a large cast of closely-observed, unusual characters, their complex relationships, and the social setting of their several dramas. Once in a while, the writer indulges in excessively colourful prose, but for the most part the writing is direct, telling, arresting; and the dialogue is intelligent, often funny. Colourful prose is the name of Rowland Morgan's game, and Morgan's first novel, Tall Dead Wives (Bloomsbury, 178 pages, Pounds 5.99), is so outrageously over-written that, short as it is, for some readers (including this reviewer) it will be impenetrable. A sample passage: 'An image of Peppi came to me: emerging from the turquoise sea, surging up on glistening honey-coloured thighs, with streaming golden seaweed hair. Incoherent jealousy stabbed my gut, curdling the juice of crazy love.' There is probably a story buried beneath all the adjectives, but who cares? Answer: somebody must, because a second Rowland Morgan has followed hard on the honey-coloured heels of the first.</p>

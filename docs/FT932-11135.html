			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Threat of defeat forces government retreat on treaty AN ignominious climbdown by the government over the Maastricht treaty's social chapter last night set the stage for a tortuous legal battle over British ratification of the treaty. Facing certain defeat in the Commons at the hands of an alliance of opposition parties and Tory Euro-sceptics, the government accepted an amendment which will delete from British law any reference to the treaty's social provisions. That left Mr John Major, who underlined again his determination to press ahead with ratification, facing two potential legal challenges. One is promised by the Tory Euro-sceptics, who hope to persuade the courts that the amendment has undercut the legal basis for ratification of the treaty. Another is expected from trade unions which want to force the government to abandon its opt-out from the social chapter. The embarrassing retreat came on the eve of today's Newbury by-election, where the Conservative majority of 12,357 is under serious threat from the Liberal Democrats. The government is braced for large losses in simultaneous county council elections. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, sought to play down the implication of the Maastricht decision by insisting the retreat would affect neither ratification of the treaty nor the status of Britain's social chapter opt-out. In a skilful and confident Commons performance which helped to minimise the government's public humiliation, Mr Hurd told MPs that the amendment was 'tiresome and undesirable but in practice irrelevant'. The fact that the social chapter and the accompanying British opt-out would not now be incorporated into domestic law would not remove them from the treaty. The attorney-general has advised the government that it can press ahead with the ratification process. But Mr Hurd conceded that a legal challenge, which could be mounted by the Eurosceptics within weeks, might delay ratification of the treaty. Ministers were admitting privately that the amendment will prolong the government's political agony over Maastricht. Mr Major, who had hoped to draw a line under the battle before the summer parliamentary recess, was said to have been intensely annoyed by the decision of Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, to agree a debate on the amendment. Later today Lady Thatcher is expected to add to his embarrassment by renewing publicly her call for a referendum on the treaty. She is committed to step up up that campaign when the Maastricht bill moves to the House of Lords early next month. For Labour, Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, insisted that the opposition's aim was to 'secure the benefits of the social chapter for the people of Britain'. But the opposition's allies among the Tory Eurosceptics took an entirely different tack. They claimed that they now had a powerful legal lever with which to undermine the basis of parliament's ratification. Doubts over challenge, Page 8 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

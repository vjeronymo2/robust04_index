			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Standard Chartered action Standard Chartered, the UK bank, has received Pounds 25.9m in a settlement of its legal action against the National Housing Bank of India. The claim was one of several against banks and financial institutions by Standard Chartered following irregularities in the Bombay securities market in 1991 and 1992. The bank disclosed in March that it had sustained a Pounds 305m loss on Indian operations last year and it raised its provision for possible bad debts resulting from the Bombay securities trading scandal to Pounds 272m. Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said: 'We are very pleased that (we) have been able to settle this outstanding claim in a sensible commercial manner. We shall continue to pursue our claims with other counterparties and hope that they will respond as positively and constructively as the National Housing Bank'. In November, ANZ Grindlays Bank, the Australian-owned group involved in the Bombay securities scandal, paid Rs5.06bn (Pounds 116m) to National Housing Bank against seven disputed cheques.</p>

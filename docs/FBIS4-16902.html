			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 20 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- Sevastopol should be  the joint base of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy,  Ukrainian Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy said  in a telegram today to the Black Sea Fleet Command. The  ITAR-TASS correspondent learned this at the Black Sea Fleet's  press center.    Russia is known to oppose the idea of a joint base for Black  Sea Fleet vessels and the Ukrainian Navy. In the view of  Russian experts, Sevastopol should remain the main base for the  Black Sea Fleet.    The Black Sea Fleet's press center said that many hopes of  settling the problems of the Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol are  placed on the three-day visit to the main base of the Black Sea  Fleet by Russian Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev,  which begins today.    Immediately after his arrival this evening, Pavel Grachev is  expected to meet with the Fleet Command and the city's  administration. Talks with a Ukrainian military delegation are  to begin Thursday at 1000. The signing of Russian-Ukrainian  documents is expected Friday.</p>

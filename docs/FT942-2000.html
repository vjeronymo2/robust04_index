			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Poles lose enthusiasm for vote Voter turnout for Poland's local government elections on Sunday was between 25 per cent and 30 per cent, the lowest level since the fall of communism. Only hard-core supporters of the political parties bothered to turn out to vote for the 52,173 local government seats. Exit polls mirrored last autumn's parliamentary poll, showing the ruling coalition PSL farmer's party doing well in the countryside. Its former communist partner in government, the SLD, maintained its position in the towns and received around one-third of the vote. The opposition Freedom Union, a centrist group which led the last government also won up to a third of the urban vote leaving the rest to disparate, fervently anti-communist, right-wing groups.</p>

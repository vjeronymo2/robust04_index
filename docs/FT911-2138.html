			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Nalgo rejects change in work at British Gas LEADERS OF white-collar workers at British Gas have rejected a package which would allow the organisation to offer a fuller service to customers outside normal office hours. If accepted by the unions, the management's proposed deal would have led to considerable changes in working practices in exchange for better pay and improved benefits. However, leaders of Nalgo, the public service union, have rejected the proposals on the grounds that the financial incentives were not enough. British Gas was offering to raise basic salaries, ranging from Pounds 7,500 to Pounds 22,000, by 3.25 per cent from next March, and offering a one-off payment of Pounds 450 on September 1. If the plan had been accepted by the unions, customers would have been able to contact white-collar workers, including those who arrange schedules of meter readers and industrial workers, and those who prepare bills, between 8am and 7.30pm on weekdays and between 8am and 6pm on Saturdays. At present British Gas white-collar staff work normal office hours. As part of the deal, the management wanted to make their hours more flexible. It would have asked employees to work four-day weeks, of longer hours, and nine-day fortnights. British Gas also wanted to reorganise the 11 existing grades into six. In return for the changes, the company was offering an improved career structure for staff and help with childcare. Nalgo's gas section leaders say most of the package was 'well balanced' but argue that the payment being offered is insufficient to compensate for the changes that workers are being asked to accept.</p>

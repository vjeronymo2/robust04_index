			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GUNSHOT VICTIM MAKES A FUTILE DRIVE FOR HELP;  </P> <P> CRIME: VAN NUYS MAN, 61, REACHES HOSPITAL BUT DIES AFTER EMERGENCY SURGERY.  POLICE HAVE NO SUSPECT IN SUPERMARKET PARKING LOT SHOOTING.  </P> <P> A 61-year-old Van Nuys man who was shot during a confrontation outside a  supermarket drove 2 1/2 miles to a hospital but died after emergency surgery,  Los Angeles police said Thursday.  </P> <P> There was no suspect or motive in the slaying of Clarage R. Kingsmore, and  investigators said they had found few witnesses who could help piece together  what happened at about 9 p.m. Wednesday outside the Hughes Market in the 14400  block of Burbank Boulevard.  </P> <P> Detective James Vojtecky said Kingsmore, who was to retire in a few months  after 32 years as a manager at a Bendix Corp. office in Sylmar, had gone to the  Hughes Market at about 8:30 p.m.  </P> <P> After buying groceries, the victim walked back to his white 1987 Cadillac  DeVille. Before getting into the car he was shot in the upper body by a gunman  who fired at least twice at him, Vojtecky said.  </P> <P> Kingsmore managed to drive to Valley Presbyterian Hospital where he died at  12:15 a.m. Thursday. The victim apparently didn't ask anyone in the store  parking lot for help, and though some witnesses told officers they heard shots,  the shooting was not reported to police until Kingsmore arrived at the  hospital.  </P> <P> Vojtecky said detectives were unable to talk to Kingsmore before his death. The  victim's wallet was not missing, but police have not ruled out attempted  robbery.  </P> <P> "He was coming out of the store, he had a nice car, it could have been an  attempted robbery," Vojtecky said.  </P> <P> Police believe there were cars and shoppers at the market at the time of the  slaying and asked that anyone who saw or heard anything to contact detectives.  </P></p>

A.: "Siemens Nixdorf Increases Its </F> Productivity"]    [Text] The more you have the more you want, and sometimes  you discover business reengineering during a reorganization, as  Siemens Nixdorf [SNI] just proved. In 1990, the German  manufacturer set out to find remedies to the crisis of its  customer support activity. Actually, the contractual maintenance  volume of SNI IT Service was stagnating, and operating costs  kept rising. This activity could be expected to start losing  money by 1995. In a first stage, Gerhard Radtke, the division  manager, then decided to launch a reorganization designed to  reduce Munich headquarter staff by half. A team of 10 managing  executives--including the data-processing manager--was set up.  Very soon, the group reached the conclusion that the entire  division had to be reorganized. With the help of McKinsey  consultants, the number of support centers in Europe was reduced  from 30 to four, and the hierarchy was simplified. One half of  the headquarter staff--essentially technical specialists--were  sent to regional support centers, and the information flow was  reorganized. As far as hardware is concerned, all field  technicians were given a notebook computer enabling them to  order the parts they needed and to access customers' records.  This organization led SNI IT Service to subcontract the spare  part logistics to an express shipping specialist. "In this  reorganization operation, Udo Franz, the information system  manager, played a major part," Gerhard Radtke noted. An  important place in the set up, which he explains by the career  of this managing executive, who rose from operational  responsibilities in the field to headquarters before becoming  data-processing manager. This business reengineering is not just  a defensive move to face a crisis. It also means to be offensive  since, confident that it is now more competitive, SNI IT Service  decided to launch into the maintenance of other manufacturers'  systems. According to Gerhard Radtke, business reengineering  enabled SNI IT Service to increase productivity per technician  by 40 percent in two years.</p>

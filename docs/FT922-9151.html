			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Interest rates softer INTEREST rates in the sterling money markets softened yesterday as the pound's performance improved on the foreign exchanges. Sterling's rise to DM2.9400 in the same week that the Bank of England had signalled a base rate cut of  1/2 percentage point renewed traders' confidence in the possibility that rates may be shaved again in the not-too-distant future. At the same time, the German Bundesbank's decision not to raise its Lombard rate for emergency funding at its central council meeting yesterday removed lingering fears that Tuesday's cut in sterling base rate would be short-lived. The trade in sterling futures registered greater confidence over the outlook for rates. The June short sterling contract ended at 89.96, just below its high for the day, after a previous close of 89.93. That new level implies that the market believes interest rates in June will be around 10.04 per cent. In the interbank market, interest rates edged slightly lower. The rate for 3-month money, seen as an important indicator of future movements, was at 10 1/8 - 1/16 per cent, down from Wednesday's 10 3/16 . In the discount market, trading was, in the words of one analyst, 'typically Thursdayish', as traders held back paper in the hope of getting better rates on Friday, before the weekend. Discount bankers refrained from selling bills in the morning, even though the Bank of England forecast a large shortage of around Pounds 1.4bn. The Bank purchased Pounds 12m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 8m of Band-3 bills at 9- 21/32 per cent, and Pounds 13m of Band-4 bills at 9 5/8 - 19/32 per cent. Later, it purchased bills totalling Pounds 1.8bn, made up of Pounds 3m of Band-3 treasury bills at 9 21/32 per cent, Pounds 136m of Band-3 bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent, Pounds 3m of Band-4 Treasury bills at 9 19/32 per cent, and Pounds 38m of Band-4 bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 119m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 434m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 337m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 37m of Band-3 bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent, and Pounds 25m of Band-4 bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 285m. As a result of slack trading in the morning, the overnight rate touched 10 3/4 - 1/2 per cent at one stage, and ended at 9 3/4 - 5/8 per cent.</p>

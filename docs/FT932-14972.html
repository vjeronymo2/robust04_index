			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Heads may roll in Spanish companies SPAIN'S conservative opposition party, the Partido Popular, which is believed to be slightly ahead of the ruling Socialist party in opinion polls, is raising doubts about whether the chairmen of some of Spain's largest companies would keep their jobs if the PP won the general election on June 6. The party has said it would leave until after the election any decision on the future shape of the boards of public and semi-public companies. The uncertainty could upset a partial privatisation programme of public companies drawn up by the socialist government. It includes flotations of shares in the Repsol oil and energy group, the sale of up to 24.9 per cent of Argentaria, the state-owned banking group and, possibly, a further reduction of the state's stake in the tobacco monopoly, Tabacalera and Endesa, the electricity utility. In the case of Repsol and Argentaria, institutions leading the flotations have relied heavily on the experience and capabilities of their respective chairmen - Mr Oscar Fanjul and Mr Francisco Luzon, founding chiefs of the companies - to generate interest among foreign investors. Both men are closely identified with the socialist government, particularly the finance ministry. Repsol has just rushed through a flotation of 13 per cent of its stock. The state now owns 41 per cent of Repsol, and all of Argentaria. Argentaria, which has just announced a pricing range for its flotation, could be particularly exposed by the timing of the election. Asked how the boards of public and semi-public companies would be affected by a PP victory in June, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, PP leader said earlier this week that 'it is something I will decide after the election'. It is widely expected in Madrid that the PP would place people of its own choosing at the heads of companies that fall under government control. The socialists did exactly that when they came to power in 1982 under Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez. Controlling these companies - especially those, such as Telefonica, Repsol and Endesa, whose stock trades in markets outside Spain - are regarded as part of the prize of winning an election. Officials at groups such as Repsol and Argentaria, say the loss of their chairmen would not necessarily affect the businesses, since both companies have in place strong management structures that would function whoever was in charge. One leading broker in Madrid said yesterday: 'Luzon is central to Argentaria but the strategy has been laid down and a good replacement would surely continue with the group's growth.'</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / European Elections (June 9 and 12): All Tory seats in danger as voters polarise The comment, voiced after one of the ill-attended press conferences at Central Office, sums it up: 'The Conservatives have won the Euro-campaign but lost the election.' The thrusts by the prime minister on beggars, the national veto and on multi-track Europe - distasteful though they were to many in his own party - have not yet reaped a reward in the opinion polls. Indeed the Conservatives are at their lowest ebb since Dr Gallup's invention came to Britain more than 50 years ago. On Friday the Daily Telegraph showed the Conservatives in third place. Their support at 21 per cent was 33 percentage points behind Labour. On Saturday the Glasgow Herald put them at 10 per cent in Scotland, 43 percentage points behind Labour (in the first Euro-election, in 1979, the Conservatives secured 34 per cent of the Scottish vote, equal with Labour, and won five of the eight Scottish seats). The omens get worse. In the most sophisticated analysis yet offered, John Cartice in the Independent on Sunday suggested that the Conservatives may be heading for only two seats out of 87. He pointed out that, even if the polls were as wrong as they were in 1992, they would indicate only 12 Conservative MEPs. Yet in another analysis, for Kleinwort Benson merchant bank, John Cartice and Peter Spencer show that, if the electorate was reacting as it once did to trends in unemployment and inflation and economic growth, Conservative support should be standing at 42 per cent and not 21 per cent. They say that the abandonment of the European exchange rate mechanism had as devastating and fundamental an effect on government support as the devaluation in 1967 or the IMF crisis of 1976. The Conservatives are in trouble because voters are polarising. The opinion polls point to a great Labour surge which should win them the Tories' residual seats in industrial England and in London. The Liberal Democrat emphasis on tactical voting threatens Conservative strongholds from Land's End to Dover and even the mini-thrust of the UK Independence party endangers the few seats where they have best hopes of clinging on. Labour has only one seat to worry about seriously: can the Scottish National party snatch North East Scotland from it? Anxiety which some express about North Wales and Mid and West Wales is probably misplaced. Regional variation, low turnout and tactical voting make prediction difficult. But every Conservative seat is at risk. The table gives, in rough order, the seats in which the Tories have the best chance of survival and the 10 best bets for the Liberal Democrats.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>   [Text] [Words indistinct] in the direction of the principal  positions occupied by the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] in oil-rich Soyo District, in  northern Zaire Province. As expectable in a climate of war, the  rebel sources have not shown any signs that their forces have  been withdrawing from positions they have held in northern  Angola. Reginaldo Silva, our correspondent in Luanda, reports:    Independent observers in the Angolan capital are  increasingly  convinced that a qualitative change in the correlation of forces  is occurring on the battlefield and that the government forces  are enjoying a clear upper hand. [Words indistinct] confirming  these unofficial reports doing the rounds among Luanda-based  international journalists. The government is said to be placing  the UNITA forces in northern under unprecedented military  pressure and to be making some noteworthy advances concerning  the implementation of its strategy which, curiously, carries the  official name of active defense. Angolan media reports that  last week the UNITA forces in Soyo were reinforced with 2,000  special forces from Zaire, including Zairian and Angolan  soldiers, in addition to other reports, can only confirm that  increasingly fierce clashes are under way between the two sides  and that they are using all available conventional war weapons,  including the navy and the air force.    In fact, various sources in Luanda said today that, when it  comes to the evolution of the military situation in this  country, the great novelty is likely to come precisely from  oil-rich Soyo area. Other reasonably reliable sources have  reported that the government forces are increasing their  military pressure on neighboring Uige Province, notably around  the provincial capital and strategic Negage Air Base, some 30 km  from the city of Uige.    Clashes for the more easterly area of Cafunfo, in  diamond-rich Lunda Norte Province, also seem to providing the  government with successes. However, today we received reports  that UNITA launched a successful counterattack that is said to  have alleviated the intense pressure the government forces had  been applying on the area. However, UNITA official sources have  accused the government of using South African mercenaries in  Lunda Norte Province and other areas. They have already reported  the deaths of more than 12 South African mercenaries, and this  appears to be confirmed by the letter that -- we have learned  from diplomatic sources -- the South African representative in  the Angolan capital has just sent to the Angolan Foreign Affairs  Ministry asking for information concerning the whereabouts of at  least seven South African citizens whose families believe they  are in Angola.    Observers in Luanda believe that fighting in Angola could  reach unprecedented levels now that international attention is  centered on South Africa and its upcoming elections.    Meanwhile, Portugal's LUSA news agency quotes an Angolan  Government source as saying that N'dalatando has been under the  control of government for the last week. It also reports that  clashes in Cuanza Norte Province are now occurring between  Malange and N'dalatando. The government forces are trying to  take Lucala.</p>

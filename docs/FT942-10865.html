			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Yemeni units from north in drive on Aden South Yemeni forces yesterday appeared locked in fierce fighting to repulse northern units attempting a drive towards Aden, the political and economic capital of the south, in what southern officials called the 'decisive' battle of the intensifying war at the southern tip of the Arabian peninsula. Amid claim and counter-claim, the military command in southern Yemen said its troops yesterday regained full control of the capital of the southern province of Abyan but fighting with northern troops was still raging in Lawdar about 60 km from Aden. Military and political officials in the south said earlier that at least three southern 'brigades' - each of up to 2,000 men - had been deployed to counter a push towards Aden by the Amaliqa brigade, the main North Yemen military unit at Zinjibar, 20 km east of the southern port. The reports appear to confirm that Mr Ali al-Beidh, vice- president of unified Yemen and political leader of the south, is fighting for his political life against an outright drive by Mr Ali Abdullah Saleh, unified Yemen's president and leader of the north, to evict him from power and reassert the country's disintegrating four-year-old unity by force. North and South Yemen formally unified in 1990, but relations between the two leaders collapsed last year after the state's first multi-party elections, when Mr al-Beidh claimed southerners were politically marginalised. However, the two armies were never themselves unified, and pockets of fighting in north and south result from symbolic redeployment of northern units in the south and vice versa. Over the weekend, military officials in Sanaa said five Scud missiles had been launched at targets in the north, all apparently landing without causing damage. Evacuees from Aden in Djibouti yesterday confirmed that Northern jets had bombed Aden airport and other installations, but said that damage appeared limited. By yesterday, however, the focus of fighting appeared firmly to the north and east of Aden. Witnesses quoted by the Reuter news agency spoke of 30 southern military aircraft leaving Aden airport apparently heading for bombing raids in the province of Abyan, to the north-east of Aden. Southern officials claimed that North Yemeni units had been defeated in a second push towards Aden from the north, at Lahj and Daleah, along the main routes into the city. 'We are in a defensive position, but the northern army is not making progress,' said a spokesman for the Yemen Socialist Party of Mr al-Beidh in Aden. Mr Robert Pelletreau, US assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs, confirmed yesterday that northern forces made no recent progress in their push towards Aden.</p>

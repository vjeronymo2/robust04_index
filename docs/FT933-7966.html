			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / International Company News: Asset sales help Wharf to 44% rise in profits THE Wharf (Holdings), the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled by the family of the late Sir Y. T. Pao, yesterday announced a 44 per cent increase in net profit to HKDollars 1.38bn (USDollars 178m) for the six months ended June. Operating profit was boosted by a HKDollars 478m pre-tax profit from the sale of the International Bank of Asia building and a portion of Wharf Cable Tower. Wharf has interests in infrastructure, transport and communications, but has recently focused on enhancing returns from its land bank. The company will complete 9m square feet of new property within the next four years, compared with its existing 7m sq ft of investment property. Next month, Wharf's giant Times Square retail and office project will open. Built on top of the group's former tram depot, the company estimates the property will provide a recurrent income stream of HKDollars 700m at current market prices. Wharf yesterday unveiled its plans for the further redevelopment of its Harbour City complex. It will tear down three residential blocks, and replace them with three 33-storey office towers. These will sit above a retail podium. The combined floor area will be 2.5m sq ft. Work will start in 1994. On October 31, it will launch Hong Kong's first cable television network, after receiving a licence five months ago. The group is determined to expand into communications, and has launched a bid for the licence for Hong Kong's second telecommunications network. Group profits for the second half of the year will be boosted by the proceeds of the sale of its Parc Oasis residential development in Singapore. The directors recommended an interim dividend of 19 cents a share, compared with 16.5 cents in 1992. It was announced that Mr Peter Woo would step down as chairman in 1994, and assume the position of honorary chairman, previously held by his late father-in-law, Sir Y. K. Pao. He will be replaced by chief executive Mr Gonzaga Li. Mr Woo will remain chairman of Wharf's parent company World International.</p>

			<p>930526 FT  26 MAY 93 / Work starts on Bangkok link Work started yesterday on a Bt80bn (Dollars 3.2bn) scheme to build a 60km elevated rail and road network through the heart of traffic-clogged Bangkok, writes William Barnes in Bangkok. Bureaucratic and political wrangles have delayed the project, first signed in November 1991 and talked of for at least three decades. The railway, capable of carrying 3m people a day, is scheduled for completion in 1999 after which it will be operated by a private company, Hopewell Holdings of Hong Kong, for 30 years before it is handed over to the government.</p>

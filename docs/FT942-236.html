			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Guinea to send troop contingent to Rwanda The West African state of Guinea yesterday said it would send a contingent of troops to join the UN's humanitarian operations in Rwanda. Reuter reports from Conakry. The Foreign Ministry did not say how many soldiers would go or when. Nor was it clear whether the contingent would join French troops already in Rwanda or wait until a strengthened UN force is deployed. So far only Senegalese soldiers have joined the French force, which has a UN mandate to bring humanitarian aid to survivors of Rwanda's genocide.</p>

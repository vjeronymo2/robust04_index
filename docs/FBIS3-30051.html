			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 25 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] A news report on 24 February sent off shock waves  in Nagata-cho [the political center of Japan, in Tokyo], already  in upheaval over reports of a planned cabinet reshuffle and  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's remarks on forming a unified  parliamentary group for the ruling coalition parties. It was  reported that Hosokawa and former Deputy Prime Minister and  Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe, a Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP] leader, had held a meeting on the evening of 23 February.  Officials of the coalition parties as well as the LDP were sent  rushing off to confirm the report. Could the prime minister  have asked Watanabe to join the cabinet? Various speculations  have made the rounds. Both the prime minister and Watanabe  flatly denied that a meeting had been held, and refused to give  any further comments. The truth about the "Hosokawa-Watanabe  meeting" remains a mystery.</p>

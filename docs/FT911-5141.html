			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: Guinness to build IPounds 60m Gleneagles leisure centre THE GLENEAGLES Group, part of the Guinness conglomerate, is to invest more than IPounds 60m, or Pounds 53.6m sterling, in a leisure complex in the Republic of Ireland. The complex - to be built on an estate demesne at Maynooth, 15 miles from Dublin - will be modelled on the Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire and will include two 18-hole championship golf courses, a 200-room hotel, 119 'golf villas' and 29 'corporate lodges'. The Gleneagles Group plans to operate 10 similar establishments worldwide. Several projects are at present underway in Ireland to develop so-called executive leisure centres. Later this year Straffan House, an international conference centre and country club developed by a consortium headed by Mr Michael Smurfit, of the paper and packaging group, will open near Dublin. International Conference Resort, a private US group, is planning to build an IPounds 40m conference centre near Shannon in the south-west of Ireland.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIFFERING VIEWS OF 'LONER ON THE LEFT'  </P> <P> I want to thank The Times for its article on former Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark.  </P> <P> These days especially, it's rare to find someone with his integrity and  willingness to buck the tide and take on unpopular causes, forgoing the money  to follow his conscience.  </P> <P> In pursuing human rights for all people instead of leaving "blind spots"  (Palestinians, for example), Clark delivers a message to progressives  everywhere: Are you in this thing 100% or not?  </P> <P> Agree with him or not, the point is, he truly believes in those ideals we were  taught America is supposed to uphold.  </P> <P> CASEY KASEM, Los Angeles  </P></p>

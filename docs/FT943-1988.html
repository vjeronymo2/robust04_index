			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent turns lower in wake of US figures After a generally positive morning session bourses turned negative following the release of disappointing US trade figures. The lack of an announcement on German M3 data also left many investors in a holding pattern. The figures are due this week - possibly today. Analysts have been expecting an M3 figure of around 8.8 per cent to 9.0 per cent from 9.8 per cent in July, but there were worries yesterday that the figure could be worse. ZURICH fell in the wake of the US data as the weaker dollar put pressure on dollar earners and index heavyweights. The SMI index finished 28.7, or 1.1 per cent, lower at 2,593.0. Kleinwort Benson, however, has raised its recommendation on the market from underweight to overweight, citing rising expectations of better earnings prospects for the banks and pharmaceutical stocks combined with a more defensive trend in equity investment towards the end of the year. It argued that the save haven qualities and liquidity of the market would outweigh currency concerns through to the end of 1994. CS Holding fell SFr16 to SFr548 after the group said it was making a takeover bid for the Swiss regional Neue Aargauer Bank, which was marked SFr40 lower to SFr1,970. UBS, which has a stake of about 12 per cent in Neue Aargauer, saw its bearers slip SFr7 to SFr1,193. Nestle gave up SFr12 to SFr1,201 on futures related selling. Ciba registered dipped SFr15 lower to SFr761. Registered shares in Swissair fell SFr35 or 4.1 per cent to SFr815 after the company announced a bigger than expected first half net loss of SFr48m. Forecasts had ranged between a loss of SFr25m and a profit of SFr35m. FRANKFURT was pushed and pulled by the bond market, then dragged down further by the US data which hit Ibis trading. The Dax index closed the official session off 17.8 at 2,078.96, falling to 2,059.15 in the afternoon session. Turnover was DM6bn. Holzmann and Hochtief still featured following Monday's stake building by the latter and the publication of some buy recommendations. Holzmann rose DM41 to DM923, while Hochtief gained DM4 to DM1,034 and RWE, the parent company, slipped DM1 to DM458. In late trading Hochtief picked up DM2 to DM1,035 and RWE weakened further to DM455. Car stocks were weaker with Volkswagen off DM8.7 to DM449, drifting to DM446.50 in the post, Daimler DM10 to DM793 and then to DM780,and BMW DM12 lower at DM780. PARIS recovered well from the session low as the CAC-40 index settled off 3.62 at 1,919.25, after seeing 1,891. The day's main news was Michelin, up FFr1.5 at FFr236, just below a session high of FFr237, as the tyre manufacturer announced a healthy first half profit of FFr314m, which was slightly lower than expectations, with some analysts looking at a figure of FFr500m . The company said that cost cutting was now its top priority, with the full effects of such measures likely to come through in 1996. MILAN was easier after a subdued session which took its lead from other bourses and the bond markets as investors awaited the outcome of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's meeting with unions tomorrow aimed at reaching accord on pension cuts. The Comit index fell 1.10 to 673.43. Alleanza, the life insurer controlled by Generali, jumped L302 or 1.9 per cent to 16,582 after reporting a 44.5 per cent rise in first half profit. Other insurers were helped ahead by the news, Generali finishing L33 higher at L39,676, after a low of L39,300, and Fondiaria rising L230 to L11,715, with news of its return to profit coming after the market closed. Telecommunications issues were hurt by rumours that a large investment fund was pulling out of the sector. Stet fell L21 to L4,630 and Telecom Italia was L52 lower at L4,280. MADRID fell as bonds dipped and foreign bourses registered losses. The general index gave up 3.71 or 1.2 per cent to 296.72 in relatively high turnover of Pta24bn as the market looked ahead to today's one year T-bill auction at which yields are expected to rise by between five and 10 basis points. Electrical shares were among the day's biggest losers with Iberdrola down Pta10 or 1.2 per cent at Pta813 and Endesa falling Pta120 or 2.2 per cent to Pta5,400. AMSTERDAM was driven lower by the effects of weakness elsewhere on the continent, leaving the AEX index off 5.54 at 401.55. STOCKHOLM was upset by the same problems besetting the other continental markets, although domestic investors were still taking stock of the weekend's general election. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 10.3 to 1,432.8. In a note on the election James Capel remarked that in the short term volatility was likely, but that calmer conditions were probable by the turn of the year. COPENHAGEN was easier ahead of today's general election, the KFX index losing 0.17 to 96.99. ISTANBUL rebounded 4.9 per cent after the prime minister, Mrs Tansu Ciller, acted to ease political uncertainty by calling a by-election, and remarked that privatisation remained high on her agenda. The composite index, which lost 3.8 per cent on Monday, regained 1,123.26 to 23,908.35 as Mrs Ciller shrugged off rumours of a possible crack in her three-year-old coalition government, adding that the austerity programme would not be replaced by election spending. WARSAW fell 3.4 per cent after the government announced plans to press ahead with long heralded plans for a stock market transaction tax from the beginning of next year. The Wig index lost 322.4 to 9,290.7.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Sep 20                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1348.83      1347.58      1345.13      1345.90 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1396.90      1394.61      1391.99      1392.12  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1346.57      1343.65      1344.57      1342.33 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1392.91      1389.38      1388.80      1386.74  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Sep 19    Sep 16    Sep 15    Sep 14    Sep 13 FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1356.96   1358.91   1368.54   1360.68   1367.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1404.55   1406.26   1415.84   1401.55   1412.44  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100 - 1349.05; 200 - 1397.07 Low/day: 100 - 1340.63 200 - 1384.32  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by John Pitt and Michael Morgan</p>

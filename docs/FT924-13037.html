			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Letter: Rejoining ERM crucial if wage moderation to be sustained Sir, Your editorial ('Time to get tough on pay', October 15) raises some possibilities to address the perennial problem of wage growth outstripping productivity in the British economy. The policy you advocate amounts to a cumbersome replacement of the discipline formerly provided by exchange rate mechanism membership. The success in moderating wage growth in Britain during the 23 months within ERM represents an impressive record. Assisted by the downturn in the economy the reduction of average earnings growth from 10 per cent in the autumn of 1990 to 5.75 per cent today (the lowest level since 1967) represents the fastest quarterly deceleration in wage growth since the second world war. Pay settlements in manufacturing and private services, the most responsive measure of companies' wage awards, fell from respectively 8.8 per cent and 8.9 per cent in the third quarter of 1990 to 4.3 per cent in both sectors today. The impact of this discipline on company wage settlements, given the high and increasing levels of unemployment, is unlikely to be lost immediately. The issue of wage growth has, throughout the last 40 years, restricted Britain's room for manoeuvre throughout the range of economic policy choice. The opportunity provided by the ERM offered the chance to redress this weakness. The evidence of the mechanism's enduring success in moderating earnings growth is apparent from the success of our European partners. On the basis of Britain's recent experience, the appropriate response from policy makers should be to rejoin the ERM at the earliest possibility. Failure to do so would condemn the British economy to an enduring problem which, throughout the 1980s, it was unable to solve.

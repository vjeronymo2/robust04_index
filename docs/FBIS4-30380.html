			<p>BFN     [Text] Johor Baharu, June 27 (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Singapore  Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said ASEAN countries must agree on  a position to try to explain to the United States the East Asian  Economic Caucus (EAEC).    EAEC is a caucus of the Asians within APEC (Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation)...It is not against APEC at all, he told  reporters after visiting the Linggiu Dam managed by Singapore's  Public Utilities Board (PUB) in the southern Johor state Sunday.    Goh said Singapore has always supported the idea of EAEC and  it would continue to do so.    We have been quietly lobbying the others to ask for views  and  it is not in conflict with APEC, he said.    Malaysian Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed has said  Malaysia was disappointed with U.S. opposition to EAEC and hoped  Japan would not be influenced by its decision.    Asked whether there was any chance the EAEC would be  launched  soon, Goh said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations --  comprising Brunei, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore,  Thailand and Malaysia -- had agreed, so it was a question of  getting the proposed members of the EAEC to meet.    He said Malaysia would have to be the primary force of the  EAEC since the idea came from Dr. Mahathir.    We will support. If Malaysia has some plans to ask us to  sell the idea to the others, then Singapore would be very happy  to do so, he said when asked whether Singapore would play a  prominent role in setting up the caucus.    Last week, a KYODO NEWS AGENCY report quoted Japanese and  ASEAN officials as saying the U.S. embassy in Tokyo had conveyed  to the Japanese Government on June 7 Washington's opposition to  the EAEC.    However, Japan said the opposition did not mean Japan would  follow the U.S. stance.</p>

			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Minimum wage a potential 'hot-potato' for Labour Union and Labour party leaders yesterday began the shadow-boxing over a national minimum wage which could turn into more open conflict next year, David Goodhart writes. Although the party and unions are strongly committed to the principle of the minimum wage, Labour leaders refuse to be drawn into supporting any specific amount or formula. The TUC Congress yesterday reaffirmed its support for the formula, also supported by the Labour Party conference, of a national minimum wage to be set at half male median earnings - now just over Pounds 4 an hour. Neither Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, nor Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, were prepared to back that formula yesterday although both said they were committed to the principle. 'There are four or five formulas we are looking at,' said Mr Prescott. 'It is like full employment; we are committed to the principle and now we are starting to look at its application.' Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, expressed doubts about Labour's commitment. 'I do not know what the depth of Tony Blair's commitment is to the national minimum wage,' he said. 'I hope he is sincere.' Mr Jinkinson, moving yesterday's TUC motion, said the number of people with incomes below half the national average almost quadrupled during the 1980s to stand at 11m by 1991. He stressed that there should be 'no shadow of doubt' about Labour's commitment to the level of 50 per cent of median earnings.</p>

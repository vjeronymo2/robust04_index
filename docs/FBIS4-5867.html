			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Michael Vickery: "Phnom Penh power plays"] </F>   [Text] The failure of Funcinpec [National United Front for  an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] to  win a clear majority in last year's election forced the royalist  party to form an uneasy coalition with their former foes, the  Cambodian People's Party [CPP]. While hailed at the time as  symbolic of national reconciliation, the coalition government  has been rent by infighting and an inability to enact  significant legislation. Much of the current stasis afflicting  Phnom Penh has been blamed on CPP hardliners but a closer look  at the power balance suggests that this is not the case.    This coalition was mooted throughout 1992, but during the  run  up to the election collapsed in anti-Funcinpec violence, blamed  at the time on the Chea Sim hardliners Sar Kheng and Sin Song.  Now that recent invitations to the United States have  implicitly exonerated the two, international credence has been  lent to Hun Sen who had always maintained the CPP was not  responsible for the pre-election mayhem.    In preparation for the coalition the CPP made some quick  substitutions among its 51 winners in the National Assembly.  Thirty-three mostly old cadres resigned in favor of younger  technocrats and intellectuals. The Chea Sim faction lost  status, that of Hun Sen gained, and the shifts in CPP personnel  indicate sincerity in playing the parliamentary game.    Eight Chea Sim followers, including Sin Song, resigned,  leaving eight among the CPP deputies, while fifteen of the "Hun  Sen Clan", mostly intellectuals and professionals, remained with  eight dropped. Eleven veteran provincial governors were passed  over, and only five, all but one young men believed close to Hun  Sen, were included. Also excluded were most candidates with a  military or security service background, while those included  were generals Ke Kimyan, age 38, and Chay Sangyun, 40, sometimes  called 'military intellectuals', and the Defence Minister, Tie  Banh, 48.    When the Provisional Government was chosen in July, with 37  of its 65 members from outside the assembly, 15 of the CPP  members were of the 'Hun Sen Clan', while only four were Chea  Sim men; and none was from among the old politicians or Chea  stalwarts in the assembly. The affiliation of the remaining ten  CPP members of the government was uncertain. The only Chea Sim  man in a powerful position was Sin Sen, as a Deputy Minister of  Interior and Public Security, the others being in Tourism,  Transport, and Public Works.    In October 1993 a new Royal Government of Cambodia was  formed, with near equality between the two large parties  maintained. Twenty-nine members of the Provisional Government,  including 12 CPP and 15 Funcinpec, were dropped, and there were  eight new faces, four CPP, three Funcinpec, and one listed  without party affiliation.    The new line-up showed some gain for Chea Sim, who moved up  from Vice-President to President of the National Assembly. Of  the 12 CPP members of the Provisional Government dropped from  the Royal government, three were his men against six from the  Hun Sen group. Sin Sen was removed, but another protege, Sar  Kheng, came into the government as a Deputy Prime Minister and  Minister of the Interior.    Still, of the 24 CPP members of the government 11 are  considered of the Hun Sen group, with only two certain Chea Sim  followers. Most of the rest, because of their relative youth or  intellectual background may also be presumed closer to Hun Sen  than to Chea Sim.    In the provinces the parties share the 20 governorships  equally, with a first deputy from the other party, and the CPP  has shifted much of its personnel. In nine provinces, including  those whose governors entered the National Assembly, the former  governors have been removed. In any case the Funcinpec  personnel may be figureheads, because of long-standing CPP  relationships with subordinate officials and he population. In  general, during 1979-93 the provinces were run by local people,  not just functionnairies sent out from Phnom Penh. This does  not, however, guarantee tight party control, and some provinces  may constitute their own factions.    In the future, equal attention should be given to Funcinpec  factions. Ranariddh has complained that not all members vote  for his proposals, and there is a Funcinpec faction, probably  centered on Sam Rangsi, which is lukewarm towards monarchy,  especially of the Sihanouk variety. Likewise, members of the  KPNLF/BLDP [Khmer People's National Liberation Front/Buddhist  Liberal Democratic Party] of Son Sann, whose organization has  never been royalist, may find more congenial colleagues among  the new CPP elite.    The first sign of realignment may be in the military. Before  the election both the KPNLF and the Sihanoukists suffered  defections of generals to Phnom Penh; and immediately after the  election the commanders of those three armies agreed to unite.  The Phnom Penh army was headed by young generals without a  Vietnam background, probably closer to Hun Sen than to Chea Sim,  and the KPNLF army was run by a faction which formed the Liberal  Democratic Party, a group of non-royalist younger men. Then the  reorganized Cambodian Armed Forces, in a return to the situation  preceding Untac [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia]  intervention, launched a campaign against the Khmer Rouge,  adopting Hun Sen's policy against that of Sihanouk and Ranariddh.    If they succeed, they will have proven that peace in  Cambodia  required no more than international neglect of the Khmer Rouge  and normalization of relations with Phnom Penh, and could have  been achieved years ago.</p>

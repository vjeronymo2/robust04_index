			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Slide in business failures boosts upturn hopes RECOVERY hopes have been buoyed by the biggest yearly drop in business failures since the recession started, figures published today show. Business collapses in England and Wales for the third quarter of this year were a fifth down on the corresponding period last year. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company collating the figures, said they marked a 'turning point' in the economic upturn. The statistics underline how higher demand from consumers and industry in the past six months has reduced the financial strain on many companies. The fall in failures has been most noticeable for big companies, with many small businesses still being forced under by difficulties in raising cash from banks. The latest figures make it unlikely that total collapses for the year will exceed last year's 51,947, which marked a big jump from the 39,827 failures in 1991. Dun &amp; Bradstreet said that 10,320 businesses failed in the third quarter after 12,867 in the same period in 1992 and 13,235 in the second quarter of this year. The number of collapses in the third quarter was the lowest for any quarter in two years. In the first nine months, 36,203 enterprises collapsed, a fall of 6 per cent on the 38,550 failures between January and September last year. Over the same period, liquidations of large registered companies dropped 13 per cent to 14,674 from 16,897. However, small-business bankruptcies dropped to 21,529 from 21,653, a fall of just 0.6 per cent. Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet marketing manager, warned that small-business failures have not necessarily peaked because of their 'lack of financial resource to provide the working capital for growth'. Larger companies generally have relatively solid forms of financial support such as share capital, while smaller groups often rely on bank loans and overdrafts. The biggest drop in business failures over the first nine months was in Wales, which showed a 20 per cent fall on the same period last year. The next biggest decline was in London, with 12 per cent, while the east Midlands and the eastern region saw decreases of 8 per cent and 7 per cent. Third-quarter figures for Scotland were distorted by changes in Scottish bankruptcy laws which meant that third-quarter bankruptcies totalled only 489 after 2,095 in the same quarter last year. This distortion means total failures in the third quarter in Scotland are recorded as just 601 compared with 2,956 in the equivalent period last year and 3,770 between April and June this year. In the first nine months failures in south-east England excluding London declined 4 per cent on the same period last year. The West Midlands and north-west England saw an equivalent decline in failures, while collapses in north-east England fell 2 per cent. Counting England, Wales and Scotland, total business failures for the first nine months of the year came to 43,369 after 46,545 in the same period last year.</p>

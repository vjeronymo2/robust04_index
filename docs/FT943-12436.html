			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up - Jakarta Jarkata's stock market has been a laggard this year with the index dipping 24 per cent in the first six months after climbing over 100 per cent last year, but Indonesia's capital markets are likely to head for a drastic transformation over the next few years, writes Maneula Saragosa in Jakarta. At the sixth annual Pacific Basin capital markets conference, held in Jakarta this month, President Suharto noted that the government needed Dollars 330bn for its current five year development plan, and that some 73 per cent of that had to come from the private sector. The main test of the government's commitment to developing the capital markets hangs on abolishing the 49 per cent ceiling on foreign ownership of listed companies. A similar ceiling for direct foreign investment has already been lifted. Some brokers say the ceiling could be lifted as soon as ministers return from a global roadshow. Others are sceptical. 'I have been here for three years and I have been hearing these promises for three years,' one said. 'In any case, it will end up as a typical Indonesian consensus. The 49 per cent ceiling will be lifted for initial public offerings but will not change in the secondary market.' There are however pressing reasons why the government should lift the ceiling: Indosat, the state-owned telecommunications company, will be privatised later this year and the future of other planned privatisations could depend on its success. Indosat will sell up to Dollars 500m worth of shares on the domestic exchange, and as much as Dollars 1bn worth in New York. 'There is real concern about how Indosat will place this amount on the domestic market,' said a broker. 'If it is not a success the whole privatisation plan could go on the back burner again.'</p>

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Japan's LDP picks reformer as leader JAPAN'S Liberal Democratic party yesterday chose a relatively young, self-proclaimed reformer, Mr Yohei Kono, as its president in an attempt to prove to the public that the scandal-stained party is starting afresh. In the past, the LDP president has automatically become the prime minister, but the fate of Mr Kono, 56, will be determined at a parliamentary session scheduled for next Thursday, for which a coalition of seven opposition parties has secured enough votes to defeat the LDP. Unless the coalition crumbles in the next few days, Mr Kono, the chief cabinet secretary, will find himself the leader of the largest opposition party in the Japanese parliament, though he expressed pride yesterday that he was chosen 'in these diffficult times.' Mr Kono defeated Mr Michio Watanabe, 70, the former foreign minister, in an intra-party election by 208 votes to 159. The appointment of the ailing Mr Watanabe would have been a sign that the LDP had learned little from the events of the past few weeks, highlighted by the loss of its parliamentary majority in a general election. The party presidency was vacant after the resignation of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, 73, who will remain prime minister until the parliamentary vote. There are two candidates for the prime ministership, Mr Kono and Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japan New party leader and the coalition's chosen representative. A stable coalition can expect at least 245 votes in the parliamentary poll, while the LDP is certain of only 225 votes and is relying on a rupture in the coalition to avoid a term in opposition for the first time since 1955. The LDP and Mr Kono are hoping that factional strife in the Social Democratic party, the largest opposition party, may prompt some left-wing members to abstain in protest at the party's joining of hands with conservative groups. Ms Takako Doi, the former SDP leader, said yesterday the party was losing its identity by linking with parties formed by ex-LDP members, but did not say she would abstain. Ms Doi has good reason to support the coalition, as she may receive a senior post in the cabinet or be chosen as lower house speaker if the seven parties form the next governemnt. A member of Mr Miyazawa's faction, Mr Kono's claims as a reformer are based on his own defection from the LDP in the mid-1970s at the time of the Lockheed bribery scandal. He became a member of the New Liberal Club, which was reunited with the LDP in 1986, although the party had done little to end the 'money politics' behind most Japanese scandals. 'It is my responsibility to restore public confidence in the LDP and politics,' Mr Kono said. 'If you look at the coalition and their selection of a leader, you have to say that the choice of Mr Hosokawa was very unclear. Why didn't the SDP, the largest of the parties, provide a leader?'</p>

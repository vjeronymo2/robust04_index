			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BILL BOYARSKY: THE BACK ROOM DRAMA OF REDISTRICTING  </P> <P> Next month, the Legislature begins the messy process of drawing new boundaries  for congressional and legislative districts.  </P> <P> I've always found redistricting, which occurs after every Census, to be one of  politics' most fascinating back room dramas, although it's a tough sell to  readers.  </P> <P> Friends destroy each other for the sake of a favorable district. Old scores are  settled. The Republicans you see cursing Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie  Brown in public make deals with him in private to assure themselves of  districts with boundaries favorable enough to guarantee election.  </P> <P> This, however, is insider stuff. Even legislators admit that they're seen by  many constituents as remote figures who don't particularly affect peoples'  lives. So editors and reporters figure a redistricting story can be counted on  to send readers fleeing to the comics.  </P> <P> But there are a few localities where reapportionment is alive and relevant,  touching deep community feelings.  </P> <P> Such a community is Monterey Park. There, Mayor Judy Chu is leading a fight for  an Assembly district where an Asian-American can be elected. It would be  centered in Monterey Park, where 39% of the voters are Asian.  </P> <P> No telling how much back room bloodletting this proposal might cause. Two other  Democratic legislators have districts in the area, Xavier Bacerra of Monterey  Park and Sally Tanner of El Monte. Latinos won't give up the Bacerra seat. And  Tanner's been loyal to Speaker Brown, who's a power in redistricting. Brown  taking away her district would be a classic example of reapportionment  back-stabbing.  </P> <P> "I don't expect that we will reach an easy resolution," Chu said, "but we do  want to work with people as much as possible."  </P> <P> The fight is more difficult because Asians have lagged behind Latinos in  political organizing. That's not surprising. Discriminatory laws prevented  Asian immigrants from becoming naturalized citizens until 1952.  </P> <P> As a matter of fact, there were relatively few Asian immigrants until President  Lyndon B. Johnson signed the liberal 1965 immigration law. Before that,  immigration from Asian nations had been restricted by a series of laws dating  back to the late 1800s.  </P> <P> The history helps explain Asian political weakness. European immigrants have  been producing political leaders since the 19th Century, and blacks and Latinos  began effective political organization after World War II. Asians didn't begin  this process until the 1970s.  </P> <P> Asian voter participation remains low. The last complete study -- by UCLA  political scientists in 1986 -- showed 43% of the eligible Japanese-Americans  in the county were registered to vote. This compares to a 60% registration rate  county-wide.  </P> <P> I asked Mayor Chu why she and the others were undertaking their fight.  </P> <P> "What does it matter as long as the legislator is a good person?" I said. "What  are the issues where the Asian community hasn't been represented because of the  lack of Asian representatives in Sacramento?"  </P> <P> Asians need someone in Sacramento, she said, to speak against discrimination.  For example, Asians suspect their brightest high school graduates are being  discriminated against in the competition for admission to UC Berkeley and UCLA;  they believe officials fear Asians already are "overrepresented" at the  institutions.  </P> <P> "This would have been more of a public issue earlier," she said, if there had  been an Asian legislator.  </P> <P> UC officials deny there is any discrimination. But the perception remains in  the Asian community, said Chu, sharpened by memories of previous government  discrimination, including the old exclusion laws and the detention, just a  half-century ago, of Japanese-Americans in World War II internment camps.  </P> <P> Personal experiences add to Chu's determination.  </P> <P> Chu is a thoughtful college professor who studied at UC Santa Barbara and UCLA,  and has a doctorate in psychology. She was elected to the Garvey elementary  school district board of education, and then to the Monterey Park City Council.  She's one of the Southland's most prominent and promising Asian politicians.  </P> <P> Yet the success story is colored by discrimination. "I remember things like  when I was young being called a Jap or a Chink all the time and being pushed in  the street," she told me. "It's not something you like to talk about or even  acknowledge."  </P> <P> But it's enough to make her conscious of the constant danger of discrimination.  And enough to propel her into the bloody back rooms of the redistricting fight.  </P></p>

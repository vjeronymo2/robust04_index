			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / International Company News: BZW sets up specialist property unit Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment banking subsidiary of Barclays Bank, has established a new specialist property unit to advise on debt restructuring and equity investments. The establishment of BZW's Property Advisory Group is its first attempt to bring together a team of specialists to advise on property. The bank believes there is now overseas interest in UK property investments. Although Barclays has substantial exposure to property debt because of its lending to property companies such as Imry and Speyhawk, the advisory group will only offer fee-based advice to Barclays on similar terms to other clients. Paul Marcuse, a director, said the outstanding property debt of Pounds 38bn in the UK, as well as the large amount of corporate debt secured on property, meant there was a strong demand for new debt instruments. 'There is clearly a very pressing need to come up with non-bank financing alternatives for property debt,' said Mr Marcuse. He said BZW believed that activity in the property sector would provide demand for fee-based advice. The advisory group will offer advice on financings and refinancings, mergers and acquisitions, and investment advice for overseas Barclays clients interested in UK property.</p>

These nine antiguerrilla police officers are part of an  elite  group with a specific mission: To halt subversive attacks  before and after the elections. Los Granaderos, as they are  called in combat, just completed a quick course at the Gabriel  Gonzalez School in El Espinal, Tolima Department, a few hours  ago.    Los Granaderos simulated a patrol action, and they tested  their reaction in the face of an ambush. These men have a very  clear idea of their mission.    [Begin General Octavio Vargas Silva, National Police  director, recording] The guerrillas should be duly warned we are  aptly prepared and armed to counter any attack. We are going to  do to them what David did to Goliath: wipe them out. [end  recording]    These nine Granaderos are part of a group of 100 men who as  of next week will be posted at strategic points. The police  director announced other measures this morning for guaranteeing  calm during the next elections.    [Begin Vargas Silva recording] All vacations, furloughs, and  permits have been suspended so that as of yesterday and through  13 March most of the police force will be on the streets, in  those places we consider sensitive or vulnerable.

The commission's 11 members represent all parliamentary  groups. It includes Yuriy Vlasov from the Russian Path group and  Stanislav Govorukhin from the Democratic Party group.    Meanwhile, the Liberal Democratic Party group drafted a  resolution entitled "The Political and Economic Amnesty in  Connection with the Adoption of the Constitution of the Russian  Federation," which would quash the prosecution of all those  involved in the attempted coup of August 1991, the Moscow riots  of May 1, 1993, and the conservative revolt of October 3-4,  1993. The draft will be put before the State Duma on Thursday.    The house took no decision on Wednesday on an amnesty  resolution proposed by President Boris Yeltsin.</p>

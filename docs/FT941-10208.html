			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Westland shares up 7.5% on bid rejection Shares in Westland climbed 7.5 per cent yesterday after the Yeovil-based helicopter manufacturer formally rejected the hostile Pounds 496m takeover bid launched by GKN, the engineering and industrial services group, writes Tim Burt. Speculation that GKN would have to improve its offer pushed Westland shares up from 307p to 330p. Shareholders have been offered 290p per ordinary and preferred share, 354.8p for each convertible preferred share and 208.3p for each warrant, all payable in cash with a partial share alternative. Westland said the bid - which GKN plans to fund partly from its own resources and partly from a 1-for-5 rights issue raising Pounds 248m - would be vigorously contested. Mr Alan Jones, chief executive, said: 'The GKN bid brings nothing extra to Westland that it does not already possess. Its offers clearly undervalue the business and appear principally designed to address GKN's tax problems.' Following his statement, the share price climbed to 333p before falling back slightly. It closed at a 14 per cent premium to the 290p offer - already accepted by United Technologies, the US parent of Sikorsky helicopters, which is selling its 18.7 per cent stake to GKN for Pounds 75m. Analysts said demand for Westland shares had been fuelled by expressions of support from leading institutional shareholders. Mr Richard Hughes, director of investment management at M&amp;G - which holds 12 per cent of the company - said although the 290p offer was acceptable to UTC, 'it remains to be seen whether it's good enough for the other shareholders'. The helicopter manufacturer is also understood to have received the backing of Schroders, which holds 13.5 per cent and acts as its financial adviser, and Royal Insurance, which holds 4 per cent. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader whose Yeovil constituency includes the Westland plant, also came out against the GKN bid. 'It fails to give assurances about the future of the workforce and does not promise to maintain the integrity of the Westland product range,' he said. Shares in the engineering group - whose core business involves automotive components, armoured vehicle production and pallet hire - fell 16p to 566p.</p>

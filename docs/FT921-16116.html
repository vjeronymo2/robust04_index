			<p>920106 FT  06 JAN 92 / Even the bad times are good for somebody: Tim Lawrence reports on how industrial auction houses have benefited from the recession WHILE Mr John Major, the prime minister, was saying last week that the economy was showing the first signs of recovery, industrial auctioneers were praying quietly that the bad times were here to stay. Mr Brian Grainger, a professional services consultant at the Incorporated Society of Valuers and Auctioneers, says: 'The recession has given auction houses a new lease of life.' According to Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, the accountancy firm, the number of companies which went into receivership last year is expected to exceed 6,000  - more than four times the 1989 total. That means boom-time for auction houses called in to sell off assets. Auctioneers are moving into bigger premises, profits are up and staff are being recruited. Henry Butcher, the plant and machinery specialist, is a typical beneficiary. In 1989 the company held 57 sale days. There were 92 in 1990 and more than 190 sale days last year. According to Mr John Judson, principal auctioneer at Henry Butcher, the mid 1980s were a buoyant time, with healthy prices and about 60 sale days a year. But there is nothing like a downturn to boost income for auctioneers. 'The past year has been even better than 1982, with more sales at a higher value. Items are not fetching as good a price as in the late 80s, but the increased number of sales has added significantly to our income,' Mr Judson says. Profits are also up at the auction department at Weatherall, Green &amp; Smith, the plant and machinery auctioneer. Stickley &amp; Kent, which handles property repossessions, has tripled its auction staff, and the department is moving to larger offices in central London. The auction department at Edward Rushton, the international valuers and surveyors, says it has never been busier. Different sales attract different people, but they share one trait: the desire to buy cheap. Specialist plant and machinery auctions appeal almost exclusively to dealers and industrialists. Other sales, such as a recent Henry Butcher auction for Prudential at which 1,600 IBM computers were sold for about Pounds 400 each, are more likely to attract the general public. The auctions are often heady affairs. More than 1,000 people attend the big sales and takings can easily exceed Pounds 1m  - from which the auction houses usually take a 10 per cent cut. Auctioneers can also profit from the inexperience of bidders and the excitement of the occasion, which can lead bidders to pay more for a lot than its market price. At a recent Henry Butcher auction for a large property developer, the managing director's Bentley sold for Pounds 33,000, Pounds 6,000 more than its trade value. Mr Judson stops the bidding when it gets ridiculous. 'People often get carried away, especially when a couple of them have got it in for one another, but if they overbid it makes it difficult to collect any payment,' he says. While industrial salerooms thrive during recessions, they are keen to shed their image of being industrial vultures. Auctioneers claim they are contributing to the preservation of Britain's manufacturing base by helping businesses which are strapped for cash to buy quality products at a bargain price. The auctions, they say, are an effective way for receivers to realise capital when assets have to be sold. Environmental arguments are also put forward by the auctioneers, who argue that the sales provide an effective method of recycling equipment, machinery and premises. But the recession has not brought unmitigated prosperity for the sales houses, with the severity of the downturn posing a few problems. In some areas, for example, the market has been flooded  - there are several night-clubs for sale in Oxfordshire at the moment  - which makes it difficult to raise a realistic price. Mr John Liddiment, head of the auction department at Weatherall, Green &amp; Smith, says that customers are less bid-happy than they were in the late 1980s. In 1988 lots were being bid for at an average of 120 per hour at auctions. Last year it was down to 90. Mr Edwin Kirker, head of insolvency at accountants Pannell Kerr Forster, says: 'People are not flocking to auctions with money and it is difficult to make money because there is so much stuff on the market. A buyer can usually turn to at least two or three receivers to get what he wants.' Some auction houses are struggling. Property auctioneers are selling more houses than ever before, but prices have plummeted. At Barnard Marcus, the estate agent and property auctioneer, houses are selling for Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 100,000 rather than up to Pounds 500,000. Overheads have gone up as well as turnover, and overall takings are down by 50 per cent. The art auctions are also struggling. The three big money-spinners  - Impressionist, Modern and American contemporary works  - have all fallen flat. Sotheby's and Christie's have experienced a sharp fall in turnover and profits. Henry Butcher might not like it, but in some quarters at least, a recovery would be good news.</p>

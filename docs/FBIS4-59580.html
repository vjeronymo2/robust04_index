			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 16, IRNA -- A morning daily here Monday  [16 May] said that the peace plan proposed by foreign ministers  of the U.S., Russia and five Western European countries in  Geneva Friday is nothing but a reward for the aggressor.    `TEHRAN TIMES' in its editorial commented on the peace plan  according to which 51 percent of Bosnia-Herzegovina will go to a  Muslim-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Serbs.    The peace plan endorsed by the said countries entails  numerous difficulties wrote the daily, adding that such a  bisection of the country is quite unfair and amounts to nothing  less than presenting the aggressor with an award.    This is not at all surprising since the entire economic  structure in the western world is founded on a few basic  pillars, the daily said.    "One of the most critical of these pillars is the arms  industry which provides, next to the narcotics, the greatest  amount of revenues for the western countries", the paper added.    Naturally an arms industry can thrive only if there are wars  and aggression, the article noted and added that western  countries claim that they intend to punish the aggressor and  bring an end to the war which cannot possibly be true for such a  policy would deprive them of one of their highly lucrative lines  of business.    That is why seven western countries which are among the  greatest exporters of arms have rewarded the aggressor in order  to insure the continued need for their products, wrote the  article.</p>

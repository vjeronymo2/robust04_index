			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Government sources confirmed  Friday that North Korea tested a second antiship cruise missile  over the Sea of Japan this week.    The sources said North Korea apparently test-fired the  second  modified Chinese "Silkworm" missile around Thursday [2 June].  The missile was fired from the North Korean east coast toward  the Sea of Japan.    North Korea launched a similar "Silkworm" missile in the Sea  of Japan on Tuesday.    The sources said the aim of the test was not clear, but  added  that it probably has little political significance since such  tests are often conducted in close succession.    The sources said the government is also closely monitoring  North Korean preparations for medium-range ballistic missile  tests.</p>

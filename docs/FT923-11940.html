			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: WestLB set to take stake in Rheinland-Pfalz bank WESTLB, the acquisitive state bank of North Rhine Westphalia, seems set to take a substantial stake in Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, the state bank of its closest southern neighbour. Formal talks are about to begin following a decision yesterday by the Rhineland Palatinate government to sell a 50 per cent holding in its state bank. Mr Rudolf Scharping, prime minister of the Rhineland Palatinate, said preliminary talks with Dusseldorf-based WestLB, and its collaborator, SudwestLB from Baden-Wurttemberg, suggested 'the goal would be reached'. WestLB, meanwhile, is co-operating with NordLB from Hanover in negotiations for a stake in the Kiel-based state bank of Schleswig Holstein. If successful, the deals would mark substantial progress in the long-awaited restructuring of Germany's regional banking network. WestLB, led by Mr Friedel Neuber, is the biggest German state bank, with operating profits expected to reach DM1bn (Dollars 675.6m) this year. It is also the most adventurous. Overseas ventures include a link in 1989 with Standard Chartered of London designed to build up WestLB's merchant banking side and extend its foreign coverage. Most recently, WestLB took a share in Thomas Cook, the UK travel and travellers' cheques company. LTU, Germany's biggest charter operator, in which WestLB has a 34 per cent stake, bought 90 per cent of the former Midland Bank subsidiary, while the bank took 10 per cent on its own account. Domestic expansion has been less dramatic, however. Even though it has long been agreed that rationalisation of state banking is necessary to compete with the commercial sector, few of the lander banks have been prepared to surrender their independence. The traditional role of the banks is to finance state and local authorities and act as umbrella organisations for regional savings groups.</p>

			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Mexico raises environmentalists' hopes: Extension of reserve in Lacandona rain forest wins go-ahead MEXICO'S decision to enlarge the Montes Azules biological reserve in the Lacandona tropical rain forest has raised environmentalists' hopes for the creation of the long-planned Ruta Maya - an eco-archeological park stretching from Honduras to southern Mexico. The measures will extend the Monte Azules reserve eastward by 55,000 hectares to River Usumancinta, on the Mexican border with Guatemala, and include the Mayan ruins Bonampak and Yaxchilan. The reserve will border a similar ecological zone in Guatemala, that includes the ruins of Piedras Negras, Tikal and El Mirador. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will be visiting his Guatemalan counterpart next week. The establishment of a joint environmental park is likely to be raised in the talks, according to Mr Homero Aridjis, founder of the Group of 100 environmental organisation. The Lacandona is North America's largest tropical rain forest. Since 1970 some 60 per cent of the Lacandona has been destroyed, in part because of previous Mexican policy to populate the sensitive border with Guatemala. The Mexican finance ministry has released another string of favourable economic figures, showing that the government ran a budget surplus last year of 15.5bn pesos (Dollars 5.07bn) or 1.8 per cent of GDP. Excluding revenues from privatisation, the budget was in deficit by 12.99bn pesos, 60 per cent less than the deficit last year. In the third quarter economic growth slowed to an annual rate of 3.1 per cent, bringing growth in the first nine months of last year (again at an annual rate) to 4.1 per cent. The slowdown from second quarter growth of 4.9 per cent reflects the dampening effect of the US recession on the Mexican exports, and capital spending. The government revealed that internal and foreign debt as a percentage of GDP fell to 38.1 per cent last year, from 62.4 per cent in 1988. The cost of servicing the debt fell to 5.8 per cent of GDP from 16 per cent in 1988, mainly thanks to the substantial fall in interest rates over this period.</p>

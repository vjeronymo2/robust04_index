			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Student population reaches 1m Student numbers in UK higher education now exceed 1m for the first time, Mr John Patten, education secretary, announced yesterday. The education department's target for a third of 18 to 19-year-olds to enter higher education by the year 2000 has almost been reached. Using early statistics on the number of students who started degree courses in October this year, Mr Patten said 31 per cent of 18 to 19-year-olds entered higher education. Mr Patten said: 'During this period of recent rapid expansion, the average A-level achievements of new entrants have increased. All the indications are that the quality and standards in higher education have also been enhanced.' The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals welcomed the news, which it said showed that the current level of funding was adequate. However the government should now set a more ambitious target, and a new system of tax-related loans might be needed, said the committee. The Higher Education Funding Council (England) said that full-time students rose by 11 per cent to nearly 700,000, up from 628,000 last year. However former polytechnics, which became universities last year, fared worse than had been expected in their first year of direct competition with 'old' universities. While the established universities took on 7 per cent more full-time students than last year (with a 21 per cent increase in part-time students), there was a fall of 1 per cent in numbers taken on by new universities. However, sharp increases in recruitment over previous years meant that total numbers at new universities were still 11 per cent higher than last year. General higher education colleges in England, many of them now pressing for university status, saw numbers rise by 27 per cent overall, while numbers at specialist colleges (such as teacher-training colleges) rose 19 per cent. In the Commons, Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, welcomed the fact that more young people were staying on in higher education, but said it was a pity that graduates could not get the jobs they were qualified for. Unemployment among recent graduates was at 14 per cent, she said. Miss Ann Widdecombe, junior employment minister, said graduate unemployment overall was 5 per cent, although it was 14 per cent for recent graduates. 'That 14 per cent is a snapshot in time; it doesn't mean that all of them will stay unemployed,' said Miss Widdecombe.</p>

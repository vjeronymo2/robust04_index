			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> NEW WORKS, OLD DIFFICULTIES FOR BALLET PACIFICA  </P> <P> The young man sitting behind me Saturday night at the Ballet Pacifica  performance at Laguna Playhouse was surprised that he could hear the clomp of  toe shoes.  </P> <P> "I guess the dancers just can't control their legs that well," he said in a  puzzled tone. Indeed. It may be a new season for Ballet Pacifica, but their old  problems persist.  </P> <P> The women dance as though they think ballet is about being rigidly dainty:  holding the arms just so, curving the wrists and fingers in a parody of  elegance, keeping the torso ramrod straight and smiling a lot. The legs just  come along for the ride. The men appear to have little notion of body  alignment, precise positions or the need to harmonize their movements with the  other dancers. No one moves with the freedom and fluidity that permits a  personal interpretation of musical phrasing.  </P> <P> Perhaps the best thing that can be said about the two premieres by longtime  company choreographer Kathy Kahn and former Joffrey Ballet dancer Carl Corry is  that they were relatively brief. Kahn's "Rustic Concerto" is a seven-part piece  for 12 dancers in peasant garb that attempts to keep up with several works by  Vivaldi. Larded with pirouettes, effortful lifts and variations that consist of  reversing movements rather than reworking them creatively, the piece is just  hack work. A cutesy pose for four women at the conclusion of the second section  was variety-show material.  </P> <P> Corry's "The Beauty of One Divides" was accompanied by live musicians --  guitarists Gregory Coleman and John Schneiderman, and harpsichordist Martha  Lewis -- playing sacred music by Bach, Mozart, John Hughes, R.H. Prichard and  G. Young. Alas, the dancers looked so rushed and jerky that they might just as  well have been moving to a tape's inflexible tempos.  </P> <P> Garnished with gimmicky mood lighting devised by the choreographer, the piece  is full of insufficiently developed phrases. In the "Deep River" section,  Janine Paulsen and Lee Wigand ever-so-briefly dance cheek-to-cheek in a pool of  light. Before we've fallen under their retro-style romantic spell, he hauls her  up into what becomes an overhead carry, and the spell is broken. (It's also  unclear what this passage has to do with the religious theme of the piece.)  </P> <P> In any case, even so simple a movement as flinging up the arms in exultation  (in the "God of Grace and God of Glory" section) eludes the company, whose lack  of whole-body follow-through makes the gesture look like vapid cheerleading  rather than an expression of fervor.  </P> <P> The program concluded with artistic director Molly Lynch's "Characters" from  1986, a breezy, aerobic piece for a pack of dancers who run and jete and  sometimes pause for bits of would-be whimsical stage business.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Signs of a slight recovery in  the German economy have apparently increased. The economic  report of the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI),  published on Wednesday [20 April], says that in western Germany  the economic situation stabilized further at the beginning of  1994. Despite "positive indicators of an end to the recession"  there are still only limited chances of a powerful recovery.  The signs of improved competitiveness and a strengthening of  export demand cannot "distract from the fundamental problems of  the continuing weakness in domestic demand."    Growth has accelerated in the former East Germany, according  to the BDI. Nevertheless, east German industry can only keep  pace in certain sectors, in spite of considerable progress in  international competition. [passage omitted]    Economic Affairs Minister Guenter Rexrodt and Horst Siebert,  a member of the Council of Experts for the Assessment of Overall  Economic Development, spoke on Wednesday of an economic  recovery. At the same time, speaking in Duesseldorf, Rexrodt  stressed that this "turn for the better" does not mean, however,  that there can be any let-up in striving for more growth and  employment. Siebert said on Saarland Radio that he expects the  GDP to grow by 1 percent in 1994. However, there is no  noticeable revival in private consumption. [passage omitted]</p>

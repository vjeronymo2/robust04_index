His majesty the king had spearheaded a nationwide  fundraising campaign and donated 100,000 dinars to support the  families of the Palestinians killed by the Jewish settler.    The government announced a similar donation in addition to  private donations from cabinet ministers, civil servants,  deputies, and senators.    Three popular fundraising committees reported warm public  response to calls for helping the victims' families. Amman  Mayor Mamduh al-'Abbadi, who heads a popular committee helping  the Palestinians, said it would give 1,000 dinars to each of the  families of Palestinians killed in the mosque and the ensuing  violence. He said the committee would also give 300 dinars to  families of the Palestinians injured in the mosque massacre.    Mr. 'Abbadi told REUTERS that the committee offered to treat  the Palestinian victims at Jordanian hospitals.</p>

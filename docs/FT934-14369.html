			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: More Brits abroad FLAMENCO MUSIC plays as you enter the Arts theatre, and Viva Espana] is the title. But, as the subtitle (The Ibiza Musical) hints, this musical is not about Spain or Spaniards or Spanish culture - it's about Brits (18-30) on holiday abroad, in this case in Spain. Funny: I came to the performance after an arts committee meeting where one bigwig had said 'You must always begin by understanding that the British are (a) philistine and (b) xenophobic. Without mastering these two facts, we can make no progress.' Viva Espana], written and directed by John Burrows and Rick Lloyd, agrees with that all right. Who cares about the Spaniards anyway? We're here for sex, sun, booze, and - er - that's all. One character, already well plastered, actually yells at a local: 'I fought Mrs Fatcher told you lot. If you're joinin' the Common market, you've got to muck in. You're just poncin' about bein' Spanish.' One man, deciding for a change to make it with someone outside his group, dances with a local, only to discover rather late that his partner is a transvestite: 'a spic poof]' Thank God for Wendy and Abby and Angie and Babs and Sarah - you know where you are with them. What makes all this acrid satire palatable is that Viva Espana] is a pop musical with high spirits, generously sung and sharply delivered by the cast of eight. While the words show you how callow and unreflective each of these characters is, the music - in a variety of post-Presley pop styles - catches their energy and freshness. Certain ensembles really capture the tribal, atavistic, drive that young Brits show in large groups; and some solos show the plaintive feelings of individuals at odds with the crowd. In short, the show gets under the skins of its characters while also standing outside them: a rarer and finer achievement in musicals these days than you might suppose. Admittedly, Viva Espana] is not an important show. Its tunes have no particular originality, some of its lyrics are repeated too often, some of its satire could go deeper. But I like its spirit: bright-eyed but double-edged.</p>

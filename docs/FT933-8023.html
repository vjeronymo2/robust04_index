			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Personal View: Good and bad of managed trade There are widespread concerns that managed trade is coming to dominate US - and perhaps global - commercial policy. Some reviewers - including Michael Prowse in the Financial Times on June 25 - have attacked my new book, Reconcilable Differences? United States-Japan Economic Conflict (co-written by Marcus Noland, now senior international economist at the Council of Economic Advisers), as supporting such an approach. Some have similarly attacked Laura Tyson's book, Who's Bashing Whom? Trade Conflict in High-Technology Industries, published by the Institute for International Economics last November*. Neither Mr Noland and I, nor Ms Tyson, chairman of the council, believe that trade policy measures can solve 'the Japan problem'. Japan's huge and growing global current account surplus must be reduced primarily by maintaining a strong yen and by restoring vigorous growth in Japan's domestic demand. The US must correct its budget deficit and adopt domestic measures to strengthen its competitiveness, as the administration of President Bill Clinton is beginning to do. Our writings flatly reject protectionism. We remain devoted to an open and multilateral trading system. We also believe that aggressive efforts to open the Japanese market are essential. However, there is enormous confusion over both the meaning of the term 'managed trade' and its recent history. There are two different types of managed trade. The traditional version, usually implemented via voluntary export restraint agreements (VERs), restricts trade and closes markets. It raises prices, reduces competition and reinforces cartel behaviour. It is the most insidious form of protectionism, creating unholy alliances between shielded import-competing industries, which are guaranteed market share, and exporters, who are suddenly licensed to jack up prices and reap windfall profits. The Reagan administration specialised in this type of managed trade. It negotiated VERs with Japan on cars, steel and machine tools. The then secretary of the Treasury, James Baker, proudly proclaimed that Mr Ronald Reagan had 'granted more import relief to US industry than any of his predecessors in more than half a century'. The Clinton administration has adopted no such arrangements. Mr Noland and I flatly reject them, as does Ms Tyson. The second type of managed trade, sometimes pursued via voluntary import expansion agreements (VIEs), aims to increase the participation of imports in protected foreign markets. It seeks to increase trade and open markets to new competitors. Implemented properly, it reduces prices and enhances competition. The Bush administration employed this type of managed trade in several cases. It extended the Reagan VIE in semiconductors and pushed Japan into new VIEs in cars and car parts. Mr Clinton has negotiated no VIEs but has raised the possibility with Japan. Mr Noland and I espouse the use of such agreements to expand exports in certain carefully circumscribed cir-cumstances, as does Ms Tyson. VIEs may be necessary in markets that deny access to foreigners through a web of opaque exclusionary practices that cannot be addressed by the usual tools of trade policy. Mr Noland and I analysed 12 sectors of the Japanese economy, ranging from agriculture, high-technology and medium-technology manufacturing to financial and other services. We found a pervasive pattern of exclusionary corporate practices coupled with government intervention. Some of those interventions, especially those that curbed imports directly, have disappeared but they have left a profound legacy of market closure. The preferred response to such market closure is to identify and abolish the offending government policy, such as discriminatory public procurement. This can be done through the multilateral procedures of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - antitrust policy is the proper counter to restrictive corporate practices. Unfortunately, tackling restrictive government policy by taking action through the Gatt is often impossible, even when Japanese access limitations can be clearly discerned. VIEs may be the only way to introduce new entrants into some closed sectors in Japan. Even Japan's former prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, publicly solicited foreign pressure to help Japan change. The Reagan-Bush semiconductor VIE illustrates the proper use of managed trade to promote exports. Market access was clearly limited: Japan's import share never rose above 10 per cent-12 per cent, despite the competitive position of non-Japanese companies in other markets and huge changes in all the most important economic variables. At least partly as a result of the VIE, sales to Japan from Europe, Korea, other Asian countries and the US have increased to about 20 per cent of the market. More important, Japanese end-users sought out foreign suppliers for the first time and began to design their chips into the production process. Competition and world economic welfare have improved as a result. Why do some free traders oppose a device that expands trade? Some confuse policy targets and policy instruments. Both VERs and VIEs require government intervention in markets. Hence many observers instinctively denounce VIEs even though they seek, as US undersecretary of the Treasury Lawrence Summers puts it, to unmanage rather than manage trade. There are, however, significant practical problems with VIEs. Any numerical target is bound to be arbitrary; it is far superior to use a range of qualitative and quantitative indicators rather than a single market share. No government can control the outcome; changes in the market, in growth rates or in exchange rates can frustrate even the most faithful com-pliance. A dangerous dynamic is thus set in motion: the US administration will be attacked as soft if it fails to retaliate against an unmet target - even if all parties know that the failure had nothing to do with Japanese effort - but subjects itself to legitimate counter-retaliation if it does so. Moreover, VIEs must be used only for temporary periods. They apply only to intermediate industrial products, not consumer goods bought by millions of individuals. They must be open to all imports, unlike the Bush VIEs on cars and car parts, which are limited to US companies and are a blatant invitation to divert sales from other supplying countries  - an invitation that Mr Clinton has firmly rejected. The problems of applying VIEs are thus formidable. They should be used sparingly and only with the utmost care by the US and Japanese governments as they pursue their forthcoming sectoral nego-tiations. However, it should be clear that there is an enormous difference in principle between the two types of managed trade. It is analytically incorrect to equate both with protectionism. VERs are clearly protectionist and should be resisted. But VIEs expand trade and may be needed on occasion. Their judicious use can help Japanese consumers, foreign producers and the prospects for maintaining an open trading system.

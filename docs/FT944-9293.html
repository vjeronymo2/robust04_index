			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Red meat for the markets The bond and currency markets have been demanding red meat. Yesterday the US Federal Reserve gave it to them. The 75 basis point rise in interest rates may not have been the full one percentage point that many wanted, but it was more than the 50 basis point rise that almost everybody expected. The Fed's action should help slow down the US economy, so minimising the risk of inflation taking off. The size of the increase also means the Fed will probably have a reasonable chance of delaying further rises beyond the end of 1994. The immediate reaction from the markets was positive; the yield on the long Treasury bond ended the day down slightly at 8.047 per cent. Other markets across the globe are likely to take their lead from Treasuries. The dollar's current value should be underpinned and bond yields outside the US fall. Equities should be carried higher too. Still, one wonders whether the positive mood will last. So far this year, the markets have taken the view that the Fed has acted too little too late to combat inflation. Unless they are convinced that the Fed is now 'ahead of the curve', they will be back for more red meat before long.</p>

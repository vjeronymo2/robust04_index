			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES: HOLIDAY MUSIC FROM THE DUKE AND BUCK; 'NEWPORT JAZZ '89' WILL AIR  ON KCET  </P> <P> If you've decided you just have to wait up for Santa on Christmas Eve, we've  got the perfect musical accompaniment for your vigil: seven hours of classic  Duke Ellington music as programmed by John Breckow on his "Smoke Rings" radio  show, beginning at 11 p.m. Sunday on KPFK (90.7 FM).  </P> <P> "I'll be emphasizing the suites, like the 'Degas Suite,' the 'Queen's Suite'  and Ellington's adaptation, with Billy Strayhorn, of Tchaikovsky's  'Nutcracker,' " said Breckow, who has been hosting the Sunday all-nighter for  more than a dozen years. "These longer pieces were more introspective, softer,  prettier, which makes them seem appropriate for the holiday season."  </P> <P> Breckow has another special ready for New Year's Eve, when he will program "A  Tribute to Buck Clayton," the 78-year-old former trumpeter noted for his work  with Count Basie in the '30s and '40s and for his well-crafted, swinging  arrangements for Basie and other bands, including his own.  </P> <P> "Buck, who was the master of the shout chorus, has recently revitalized his  writing career, since he stopped playing some years ago," said Breckow. "He's  writing music for his own big band, and for the Alden-Barrett Quintet. When  playing Buck's originals and arrangements, the latter group (led by guitarist  Howard Alden and trombonist Dan Barrett) sounds like Basie's band at the  Roseland Ballroom in New York in 1938. It's fabulous."  </P> <P> Breckow indicated he would feature Clayton's big band, the Alden-Barrett  quintet, as well as selected recordings from throughout Clayton's career, on  the Dec. 31 broadcast. Information: (818) 980-8745, 985-2711.  </P> <P> If you're looking for a more contemporary mix of jazz, and you want visuals to  boot, check out "Newport Jazz '89," airing at 12:30 a.m. Friday on KCET  (Channel 28). Among the artists featured on the show, which was taped in New  York last summer, will be singers Mel Torme and Diane Reeves, flutist Herbie  Mann, pianist George Shearing and trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. The numbers range  from Mann's "Memphis Underground" to Marsalis' version of Charlie Parker's  "Chasin' the Bird."  </P> <P> Marsalis returns later with strictly seasonal songs on "A Classical/Jazz  Christmas with Wynton Marsalis," airing at 9 p.m. Friday, also on KCET. On the  program, the crafty trumpeter leads his current sextet in holiday favorites  from a live concert at New York's Lincoln Center. The selections -- "Little  Drummer Boy," " 'Twas the Night Before Christmas" and "Let It Snow, Let It  Snow, Let It Snow" among them -- will be drawn from Marsalis' recent new  holiday album, "Crescent City Christmas Card" (CBS).  </P> <P> Swing's the thing, and may it remain so. At least that's the way Chuck Foster  feels. The bandleader recently celebrated not only his 50th year in show  business, but also his 25th year of big band sessions at Myron's Ballroom in  downtown Los Angeles, where he plays for listeners and dancers from 4-10 p.m.  Sundays. "I went down to hear him at the Biltmore Bowl years ago and thought he  was great," said Myrna Myron, who has operated Myron's since 1946, and owned  the building since 1982. "So you know how happy I am to have him playing for  us." Information: (213) 748-3054.  </P> <P> **** "The Place to Be" (Steeplechase) is somewhat of a return for the solid  mainstream tenor saxophonist Junior Cook, who, while remaining active in  Manhattan, has not been heard from on record in some time. Working here with  pianist Mickey Tucker, bassist Wayne Dockery and drummer Leroy Williams --  veteran colleagues all -- Cook, a former star with Horace Silver's quintet in  the '60s, shows that he is as potent as ever. He offers driving, resplendent  lines on the faster tunes like Parker's "She Rote," crackles on the medium  tempo swingers like Benny Golson's "Are You Real" and Tadd Dameron's enchanting  "Gnid" and is in with singing, provocative statements on Tucker's bluesy  ballad, "I Should Have Known." The pianist has plenty of good things to say and  Williams and Dockery are there with just-so support throughout.  </P> <P>  Records are rated from one to five stars. ***** means a swinging must-have for  the jazz lover; * means save your pennies, Benny.  </P> <P> </P></p>

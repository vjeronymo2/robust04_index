			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by TRUD political commentator Vitaliy Golovachev: </F> "Our Debts Are Heavy: Wages Have Been Cut, but This Is Not the  Problem"]    [Text] After the explosive increase in average wages in  Russia in December of last year (from 101,000 rubles [R] to  R141,000), in January, they not only did not rise further, as  expected, but, on the contrary, they were cut by R7,000. A  similar scene also occurred in January of last year. The  reasons, on the whole, are understandable. Each December,  enterprises and organizations try, by hook or by crook, to make  maximum payments to their own workers (every possible kind of  bonus for the quarter and for the year, material assistance,  wages for a thirteenth month and so on), in order to compensate  somewhat for having wages lag behind price increases over the  course of the year. And so, in January, there is no longer any  money.    But, even taking into account the small January "recoil,"  all  the same, the increase in wages over the 2 months (December and  January), on the whole, corresponded to the rate of price  increases over this same period. That is, wages rose to the same  extent as prices. So that there would have been nothing unusual  in this temporary January decrease, if all the credited money  had gone to those for whom it was intended. However, the main  problem is the fact that, at many enterprises, people are not  receiving their wages at all for 1, 2 or even 3 months or are  receiving only part of them. Under these conditions, although  the wages credited on paper and recorded by the statistics make  it possible to make a judgment about trends, they do not give an  accurate idea about actual payments.    But in general, in and of themselves, wages still do not  give  a clear idea about the standard of living, because it is  necessary to take not only them, but all monetary incomes  calculated on a per capita basis and to correlate them with  prices. So, if a judgment is to be made based on the level of  actual incomes (adjusted based on the consumer price index),  then, in 12 territories, life over the past year on the whole  has deteriorated noticeably. Here, the actual January incomes in  1994 amounted to less than 70 percent of the incomes in January  of 1993. These are the republics of Karachayevo-Cherkessia and  Tuva, Stavropol Kray and Kursk, Samara, Novosibirsk, Omsk,  Tomsk, Tyumen, Chita, Kamchatka and Magadan oblasts.    But where, all the same, have actual incomes increased? They  are supposed to increase by 10-20 percent (if all debts are  paid) in Karelia, Khakasia, Pskov Oblast, Kostroma Oblast, Tver  Oblast and a number of other oblasts. The increase is supposed  to be even larger in Kabardino-Balkaria, St. Petersburg, Moscow  and Leningrad and Moscow oblasts.  <H5>  Millionaires and Beggars </H5>   The statistical data testify to the fact that the  stratification into the rich and the poor is continuing. It has  already been reported that the monetary incomes of the 10  percent of the most well-off Russian citizens are higher than  the incomes of the 10 percent of the least well-off citizens by  a factor of 11. In point of fact, the disparity is apparently  much greater, because our millionaires and billionaires do not  advertise the lion's share of their incomes and these funds  "escape" the attention of the statisticians. On the other hand,  among the indigent, there are, for example, no bums or beggars.  So the disparity in incomes between the rich and the poor  possibly amounts to factors of 30, 35 or even 40. Incidentally,  the officially recorded disparity in the wages of the 10 percent  of the rich and the poor has already exceeded a factor of 27.    However, we can currently also report new indicators which  characterize the stratification in Russian society. In January  of 1994, 20 percent of the very well-off section of the populace  had almost half (42 percent) of all the monetary incomes in the  country, while 20 percent of the poor had only 7 percent of the  incomes. The so-called Dzhin factor gives an even clearer  picture. It shows how the concentration of incomes among the  populace is proceeding. If all the people's incomes were equal,  then the Dzhin factor would be equal to zero. But, on the other  hand, if all the incomes turned out to be (theoretically) in the  hands of a single superbillionaire, then the factor would be 1.  Now let us see how this indicator changed in Russia. At the  end of 1991, the Dzhin factor amounted to 0.256, to 0.327 at the  end of 1992, to 0.346 at the end of 1993 and to 0.352 in January  of 1994. That is, the factor is shifting from zero to one. It is  clear even to a non-specialist that the stratification in  society is not only continuing, but is even proceeding faster  and faster.    And the disparity in wages is just one more confirmation of  this. In January, as always, however, the sphere of science and  scientific services was in last place with respect to the level  of wages -- R95,000 on average. The level of wages in instrument  building is much lower --R71,000. In the past an elite  subsector, determining to a great extent the rate of technical  progress, it is currently, just like science and many other  spheres, leading a miserable existence.    At the other extreme are the workers of the fuel and raw  materials sectors. The gas workers of Tyumen, for example, have  credited wages of more than a million rubles on average. But  even here there are problems -- the notorious nonpayment of  wages, which we have already mentioned.    Yet, all the same, the most irritating factor are the insane  wages of many enterprise managers, including those of state  enterprises. There is no control over them and the managers,  "intoxicated by freedom," are setting for themselves, without  advertising it, such sums as are shameful to talk about in our  impoverished country. For many of them, the wages range from R5  million to R10 million. At the same time, the incomes of 18.4  million people amounted in January to from R10,000 to R30,000  or, less by hundreds of factors.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Average January Wages in Various Sectors and Regions of the Country:         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |For the National Economy as a Whole   |R134,200                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |All of Industry                       |R138,600                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Gas Industry                          |R780,000                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Including:                            |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |In Tyumen Oblast                      |R1,223,487                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Oil-Production Industry               |R361,700                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Including:                            |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |In Tyumen Oblast                      |R531,700                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Coal Industry                         |R324,300                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Light Industry                        |R80,600                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Instrument Building                   |R71,000                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agriculture                           |R58,100                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transportation                        |R224,000                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Construction                          |R171,400                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Health Care, Physical Exercise and So-|R122,500                              |  |cial Security                         |                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Public Education                      |R113,600                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Culture and Art                       |R101,100                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Science and Scientific Services       |R94,700                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Credit and Insurance                  |R326,200                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |System of Administrative Organs       |R165,600                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Of course, it would be ludicrous and foolish to fight for  the  populist wage-leveling which contradicts both common sense and  economic laws. But the excessive disparity in wages and incomes,  especially the uncontrolled and intensifying disparity, is  leading to mounting social tension in the country. This process  has been aggravated sharply because of the chronic nonpayments  (including those for which the state is at fault) of already  credited wages. Whether or not the Ministry of Labor and the  current government will be able to correct the situation and  whether or not they have the skills needed to overcome the  negative trends and to carry out an effective income policy --  this is the question.  <H5>  A Thousandfold Price Increase and This Is Not the Limit </H5>   The government proudly reported that the rate of price  increases was reduced sharply in February. Viktor Chernomyrdin  stated at the expanded meeting of the government in the Kremlin  on March 4th that prices in February increased by 13-15 percent.  In actuality, according to the preliminary data of Russia's  Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics], the increase in the  cost of living was even less -- 10 percent. This is a record low  inflation level for the last year and a half. But, is this  something to be proud of? Is this not too high a price for  reducing the increase in prices?    What has played a role here, first and foremost, are the  enormous arrears with respect to the payment of wages. It is  understandable: the less cash in hand -- the less the demand --  and the lower the prices. But such an artificial reduction of  inflation causes more harm than good. It is often said that it  is not a matter of the wage arrears, but rather, the fact that  our prices have almost reached the level of world prices and  this is why, supposedly, their rise has slowed down. It should  be stated that this is not so. A simple analysis shows that, at  the beginning of March, for example, butter was cheaper in our  country than in Washington by a factor of 1.5 (taking into  account the official ruble-to-dollar exchange rate), milk was  cheaper by a factor of 3.5, cheese by a factor of 2, wheat bread  by a factor of 3, sugar by a factor of 2, potatoes by a factor  of 4, and so on.    So that here, we still have "room," alas, for price  increases  (although they have already increased on average a thousandfold  over the last 3 and a half years). Thus, it is precisely the  non-payments which have, to a great extent, had an influence on  the reduction in the inflation rate. But the debts will have to  be taken care of -- prices will go up again and such "twists and  turns" will produce nothing but broad public dissatisfaction. Is  it really worthwhile to proceed further in this fashion?    No, there is only one way out of the dead-end -- a real  structural reorganization, the attracting of private capital, a  well thought-out social policy (including an income policy), the  improvement of the tax system, and support of small business.  The prime minister has talked about all of these things  repeatedly. This would be a good time to get down to brass tacks.    But, for now, the situation is continuing to deteriorate.  The  pace of the drop in production in February did not decrease, as  the government experts expected, but rather, it remained very  high. Here is the latest report from Russia's State Committee  for Statistics: the physical volume of production in January and  February of 1994 decreased in comparison with January and  February of 1993 by 23.6 percent (including 23.1 percent in  January and 24.1 percent in February). For example, only half as  many shoes were produced in February than were produced a year  ago, a fourth fewer knitted goods and a third less butter....  Where are we going?</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian private sector steps up Eurobond issues / Finding increasing international acceptance of paper issued from the country Brazilian private-sector companies are increasingly looking to the Eurobond market to raise money for capital investment, taking advantage of the growing international acceptance of Brazilian paper. Eurobond issues are also becoming more diverse. For example, Minas Gerais, part of the country's industrialised south-east region, is preparing Brazil's first Eurobond issue by a state, which will be sold with an equity warrant allowing investors to buy shares in its electricity company. The corporate sector will issue around Dollars 1bn in the second half of 1993, more than double the first-half figure and total Eurobond issues are expected to be more than Dollars 5.5bn this year. Private companies will account for about 30 per cent of the market volume in the second half of this year, twice the share for last year. Private companies are finding it easier because investors are becoming increasingly used to Brazilian paper through bonds issued by the banks and large government-controlled companies. This followed a virtual stagnation in the second half of 1992, caused by corruption allegations against former President Fernando Collor. A higher proportion of the money is being spent on capital investment, although companies are still putting part of the funds into the high-yielding local money markets. 'We're seeing more corporate issues, rather than issues by banks, and a lot of the money is going on plant and equipment,' says Mr Charles Spragins, corporate affairs director at Citibank Brasil. Despite inflation of nearly 2,000 per cent a year and an economy lacking the structural reforms carried out in Mexico, Chile and Argentina, many Brazilian companies are planning investments after restructuring and reducing costs, particularly in the capital intensive steel and pulp industries. Investors are willing to take on the 'Brazil risk', thanks to the country's Dollars 27bn international reserves which make central bank restrictions on repayments highly unlikely. Ironically, Brazil's economic problems have been the key to attracting investors because companies have to pay some of the world's highest interest rate spreads. Although spreads have fallen some 200 basis points this year, as Brazilian paper has become more acceptable, they are still about 100 points above Argentina and 200 points above Mexico. Yet even at these rates it is still attractive for companies to issue Eurobonds. For a five-year bond, issuers are paying 400-500 basis points above US Treasury notes, of about 5 per cent, compared to inflation plus 16-18 percentage points in the domestic bond market. Issuers have raised more than Dollars 5bn this year and there are still several hundred million dollars of Brazilian issues planned by Christmas. But with an uncertain world bond market, mainly due to higher US interest rates, some companies will have to pay higher spreads, says Mr Vincent Parkin, Brazilian representative for CS First Boston. He adds, however, that after a hiatus there could be a large number of issues in the new year. Bankers expect more equity-linked issues from companies and institutions like the National Development Bank, which has stock in more than a hundred Brazilian companies. The Minas Gerais bond with warrant issue, to be lead managed by French-owned Banque Indosuez, is expected by the end of this year or early next year and will be for up to Dollars 200m. To pay a lower spread, the state will offer investors the option to buy shares in its electricity company Cemig at a predetermined price. This follows Brazil's first equity warrant issue in August when Bombril, a household cleaning products manufacturer, placed Dollars 150m of paper. Among private-sector companies going to the Euromarkets for investment funds is Metalurgica Gerdau, a family-owned steel company, which raised Dollars 100m in early November. The eight-year bond, with two put options at three and five years, paid a spread above the relevant US Treasury note, of 450-500 basis points. It was lead managed by Citibank. Suzano de Papel e Celulose, a pulp company with interests in the petrochemical sector, raised Dollars 80m in October, paying a spread of 522 basis points. Bankers say the bond market may be influenced by next year's presidential elections. They also stress the importance of progress on the Brady Plan foreign debt agreement. 'The Brady Plan could be the stepping stone needed for institutions to enter the corporate market in a big way, like they did with Mexico a couple of years ago,' says Mr Parkin.</p>

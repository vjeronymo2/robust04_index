			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [De Azua report: "People's Party Says Gonzalez Statement a </F> Farce and Accuse Him of Entrenchment"]    [Text] Madrid -- "Farce," "joke," and "leg-pull." The  People's Party spokesmen spared no adjectives on the telephone  after 1215 GMT when [Prime Minister] Felipe Gonzalez's news  conference ended. Since the middle of the morning, [People's  Party leader] Jose Maria Aznar had canceled his planned  appearances in Pamplona and Valladolid yesterday and today so  that he could closely follow the development of the political  crisis. During the evening he gave his reaction and called a  press conference for today.    Aznar, and the People's Party's leaders who followed the  conference closely, concluded that Gonzalez was deceiving  popular opinion because he had not taken a single initiative to  stop the political crisis or to attack its causes, the growing  climate of corruption. Sources close to the People's Party  leader said: "He limited himself to accepting the avalanche of  resignations, plugging the gaps, and carrying on as if nothing  will happen."    The party's general secretary, Francisco Alvarez Cascos,  then  stated that Aznar's demand that Gonzalez resign two weeks ago  and give up the prime ministership to another socialist capable  of clearing up the situation "is now more even justified than  then, because things have become worse, Roldan has escaped,  Albero has resigned, Rubio and De la Concha are in jail, and two  other ministers have had to give up their seats."    He added: "Nobody knows to what new scandal we will be  sitting down to tonight or waking up to tomorrow morning, while  Gonzalez can only offer continuity and entrenchment in La  Moncloa [the prime minister's residence). He is insisting on  defending the Maginot line while the Germans have long been  occupying Paris."    For the People's Party leadership, the Catalan nationalists  of the Convergence and Union party [CiU] have made themselves  equally responsible by helping to keep Gonzalez in power.  Alvarez Cascos stated: "They are not supporting stability but  supporting maximum instability and ensuring the continued  presence of the main obstacle to political stability in Spain --  keeping Gonzalez in power for personal reasons."    The People's Party are moreover rejecting the dialogue  proposed yesterday by the prime minister, which they consider a  "an offering to the sun." According to Alvarez Cascos, Aznar  will not fall into the trap when it has been clear that the last  meetings, which led to the "democratic stimulus" conversations,  "were frustrated by socialist intransigence" and by the attempt  to impose conditions on the investigating committees that would  have prevented them from unmasking the former director of the  Guardia Civil, Luis Roldan.</p>

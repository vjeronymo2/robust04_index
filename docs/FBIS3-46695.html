			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Dec. 31 KYODO -- Eleven major Japanese  commercial banks, known as city banks, plan to eliminate a total  10,000 jobs over three years from fiscal 1993 as part of  streamlining efforts, the NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN reported Friday.    As part of the project, the banks will close more than 100  branches and smaller outlets throughout the country during  fiscal 1994, the leading business daily said.    The job reduction will be implemented mainly through a curb  on employment of new graduates and transfer of employees to  affiliates, it said.    Some of the 11 banks are considering paying extra retirement  allowances to induce employees to quit, according to the  newspaper.    The rationalization of bank operations has been prompted in  large part by swollen bad assets due to the collapse of the  bubble economy, it said.    The 11 major commercial banks are forecast to liquidate more  than 2 trillion yen worth of such assets in the current fiscal  year, ending next March 31.</p>

As earlier  reported, the committee's first meeting was held in Istanbul  last November. It decided to include the question of the  convention's ratification in the agenda of its second meeting.    Kovalev said that Russia was already taking concrete steps  to  implement the provisions of this document. A special  organisation -- the Russian centre for cultural relations with  countries of the Black Sea region -- has already been set up. A  festival of arts of the Black Sea basin countries will be held  in Sochi this October. Eleven of these countries, including  Russia, are members of the parliamentary assembly on the Black  Sea economic cooperation.</p>

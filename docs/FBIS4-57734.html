Cavallo referred to the controversial topic of the so-called  super secretariat at the end of a ceremony in which agreements  were signed for supplying drinking water to several provincial  localities with financing from international organizations.    "President Carlos Menem has given a lot of importance to the  topic and it is he who will finally decide it," the minister  said.</p>

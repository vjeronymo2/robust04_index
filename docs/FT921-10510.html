			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Olivetti chief warns on diversity THE European Community should follow Japan's example and draw up a co-ordinated strategy to make its industry internationally competitive, a leading European industrialist said yesterday, Reuter reports from Davos, Switzerland. Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman and chief executive of Olivetti, the Italian computer company, said the EC had to choose in which sectors it wanted to be leader or play a global role. 'I think that due to the fact that in future years financial resources will be scarce, you have to make a strategic choice on where you want to allocate the resources,' he told a news conference during the annual World Economic Forum. The industrialist earlier told business and political leaders attending the conference that the move by the EC towards monetary union and political integration was not enough. He said Europe's industrial base was slowly deteriorating and each EC government had its own approach to tackling the problem - ranging from the interventionism of the French to the 'laissez-faire' polices of the Germans and British. 'This diversity is a sign of a weak Europe.' He called for big infrastructural projects on a pan-European basis, programmes for joint research and innovation and incentives for alliances among European companies.</p>

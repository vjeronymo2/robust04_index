			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Obituary - Magda Hamsher Magda Hamsher, editorial office manager for the FT in Paris for almost 20 years until last July, died suddenly but peacefully at her home on November 15. She was born in Moravia and studied English and French literature at the Charles University in Prague. In 1948, she married an English journalist, Bill Hamsher, who was reporting the Communist takeover. After a brief stay in London, they were posted by the Daily Express to Berlin (where their three children were born) and then to Bonn, before settling in Paris. After Bill's death, Magda was recruited by Bob Mauthner, then FT bureau chief in Paris, to run the office administration and build up the filing system. She was unfailingly cheerful, and always delighted when a useful source document could be swiftly traced, in spite of the reluctance of journalists to put anything back in its place. She was even more pleased when, with a diffident confidence, she was able to educate one of her colleagues on some point of French history or politics without reference to any source material. The Velvet Revolution in Prague in 1989 thrilled her. It also brought to Paris a childhood friend, Hugo Mensdorff-Pouilly, who brought a charming romance to the last five years of her life. She is survived by Hugo and her three children.</p>

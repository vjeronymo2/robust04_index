			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Observer: Casing the joint The jockeying for power at Newspaper Publishing, owner of the Independent, continues apace. Sergio Cellini, 38, who looks after corporate strategy for L'Espresso, the Indy's Italian shareholder, has been appointed an executive director of Newspaper Publishing. Since virtually everybody else on the board is non-executive, Cellini will be in a powerful position in a company which doesn't have a chief executive. He will be responsible for managing those activities not contracted out to the Mirror Group Newspapers, such as printing and marketing. One school of thought suggests that he has been imported to keep an eye on Cornel Riklin, 38, the Swiss whiz kid put on the Newspaper Publishing board by MGN's David Montgomery. Both went to US business schools and are ex-management consultants. However, a more likely suggestion is that Cellini has been brought in to keep an eye on Andreas Whittam Smith, the founder, editor-in-chief and chairman of Newspaper Publishing.</p>

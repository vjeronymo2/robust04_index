			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Home starts at highest since 1989 Builders started work last year on the largest number of new homes since 1989, figures published yesterday by the Department of the Environment show. The statistics confirm that the faltering recovery which began at the start of last year has been sustained, with building activity rising sharply during the final three months of last year. Sir George Young, housing minister, said that the strong increase in private-sector starts 'looked set to continue into 1994'. The environment department said builders started work on 186,400 homes in 1993, a rise of 19.1 per cent on the previous year. It was the highest number of starts since 1989's 201,100. By 1992 this figure had slipped to 156,500. Starts during the final three months of last year after allowing for seasonal adjustments were 7.7 per cent higher than during the previous three months, and 29.5 per cent higher than during the corresponding period in 1992. The figures received a cautious welcome from the building industry, which remained concerned that tax increases due to take effect in April might inhibit potential home buyers. Mr Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of Bryant Group, the Midlands-based housebuilder which yesterday announced a 95 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 14.6m for the six months to the end of November, said the company had made an encouraging start to this year. Net reservations in January were about 15 per cent higher than during the corresponding month last year. Housing starts are regarded as one of the best guides to sales by the industry, which takes about 12 weeks on average to construct a home. According to the environment department, private-sector starts rose by 19.1 per cent last year and 39.6 per cent compared with the final three months of 1992. Housing association starts on the same basis rose by 22.2 per cent and 11.7 per cent respectively. Sir George said: 'Market conditions remain favourable, with mortgage interest rates at their lowest for 25 years, unemployment falling and houses more affordable than they have been for many years.'</p>

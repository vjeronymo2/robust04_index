They discussed the current  problems facing the country. After recalling the government's  determination to initiate dialogue with its social partners,  Prime Minister Yhombi-Opango asked the trade unionists to  observe a social truce, stating that they have all the time to  think about it. More details with General Yhombi-Opango:    [Begin Yhombi-Opango recording] We should all understand  that when a country is conducting negotiations with  international financial institutions, each citizen is compelled  to adopt responsible behavior, so that all phases of the  negotiations are completed. Any other attitude will, according  to us, be irresponsible and suicidal for everyone. That is why  we are appealing to the workers and to you as union leaders. Do  not emulate those union leaders who, very often, have seen their  companies facing difficulties, and despite this fact, have  demanded salary increases. That is suicidal for the comapnies.  It is important to know that foreign investors are interested  in what Congolese are capable of, their capacity to be at peace  with one another. Each of us should bear in mind that [words  indistinct].    It is therefore essential for us to understand that, after  having destroyed our economy, we should now, together and  collectively, commit ourselves to revamping this economy. We  are in a period of exorcism and we need social peace. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PERRIER WATER SCARE GOES FLAT IN SOUTHLAND  </P> <P> Life proceeded quite nicely in Southern California on Sunday in the wake of the  recall of Perrier water due to a chemical contamination scare.  </P> <P> In fact, it seems that Perrier -- once so popular as a symbol of health in the  trendy Southland -- has become downright passe in some local watering holes,  grocery stores and exercise salons.  </P> <P> "We use Calistoga," Rose Cafe manager Cheron Vekavat said above the  brunch-crowd din in Venice. "It tastes better."  </P> <P> "Perrier today is a shadow of its former self," said Carl Lundgren, general  manager of Vicente Foods, a Brentwood market popular with the movie crowd.  Non-carbonated distilled water, like Evian, is what's in these days, he said.  </P> <P> "There are so many new source waters around," said Robert Schwan, general  manager of 72 Market St., a restaurant in Venice. "There's no reason to use  Perrier. It's a little pricey."  </P> <P> Even at two well-known West Side health clubs -- the Sports Connection in West  Hollywood and actress Jane Fonda's Workout Center in Beverly Hills -- the  recall was a non-event. Both clubs said they serve Evian.  </P> <P> Surely, the recall had an impact at (ixi:z), a men's clothing store on Rodeo  Drive that has the nation's only water bar??? No. The bar, opened amid some  fanfare in late 1986, closed about a year ago, a store spokesman said.  </P> <P> The recall did send tremors through luxury hotels owned by Severyn Ashkenazy --  like L'Ermitage in Beverly Hills and Le Bel Age in West Hollwyood -- because  each room had two bottles of Perrier in their refrigerators. The bottles, about  2,400 in all, had to be seized from the rooms, Ashkenazy said.  </P> <P> Perrier's misfortune, though, was a boon for sales of bottled seltzer water.  "They doubled in one evening," Ashkenazy said.  </P> <P> Not everyone had heard about the recall Sunday.  </P> <P> At the El Gaucho Liquor Market in Santa Ana, night manager Bryan Lee said he  was totally unaware that there was any problem with Perrier.  </P> <P> "I never knew a thing about it until some news reporter came in here (Sunday  night)," Lee said. He added that he would talk to the market's owner today to  see what she wants to do about it.  </P> <P> Chuck Jackson, assistant manager at the Original Irvine Ranch Market in Costa  Mesa, said he had heard "not a word" about the recall from anyone.  </P> <P> "I don't think people care anymore," he said. "No matter what you eat or drink,  you're going to die anyway."  </P> <P> At the Tustin Yacht Club in Tustin, which specializes in steak and seafood,  owner Jack Morrell said he hasn't heard much about the problem.  </P> <P> "I'm sitting here looking at about five cases of it," he said. "I guess I'll  sell it if people want it."  </P> <P> And at the fashionable Pirets restaurant at South Coast Plaze, the Perrier  scare was not a problem at all -- more than a year ago its managers switched to  its own personal brand of mineral water.  </P> <P> The Perrier scare began late Friday when officials of the French-based firm  began the recall of as many as 72 million bottles nationwide. Some bottles had  been found to be contaminated with benzene, a colorless chemical used in the  manufacture of such products as paint and detergents.  </P> <P> North Carolina health officials made the discovery during routine testing, and  while U.S. health officials played down the immediate danger to consumers,  Perrier took no chances and ordered the recall.  </P> <P> "There is no reason at all it should be in our product," a Perrier spokesman  said. "We don't understand it."  </P> <P> Though Perrier has many challengers today, it remains the nation's most popular  carbonated water, with about $160 million in annual sales. Perrier officials  say they will stop sales for up to three months, which could cost them $40  million in lost sales.  </P> <P> One of Perrier's competitors LaCroix Sparkling Water in LaCrosse, Wis., said  Sunday that it planned to increase its output by 50%.  </P> <P> "We see a chance . . . to jump in and fill the void," a LaCroix spokesman said.  </P></p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Growth forecast in airport retailing Retail sales at UK airports are expected to total Pounds 600m this year  - 50 per cent more than in 1990 - making airports one of the fastest-growing retailing sectors, says a report by Corporate Intelligence, the retail research group, Neil Buckley writes. The report says that airport retailing has grown at three times the rate of high-street sales. Seven airports owned by BAA, the privatised airport authority, account for 80 per cent of the total, and BAA makes more from retailing than from aircraft landing charges. However, 60 other UK airports have scheduled services, indicating the huge growth potential for airport retailing. The report says that the large number of passengers passing through airports, who are 'captive' and often in holiday mood, means shops at Heathrow and Gatwick enjoy annual average sales densities of more than Pounds 1,500 per sq ft - three or four times the average for high-street shops. Several retailers, including Bally and Laura Ashley, enjoy their highest sales per square foot of any UK outlets in their airport stores. The report says that well-known names such as Harrods and Hamleys have opened airport outlets, while many niche retailers are basing their expansion strategies around airports.

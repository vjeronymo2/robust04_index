			<p>BFN     [Text] Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa returned to  Santiago this afternoon from an important visit to Buenos Aires,  where he discussed significant economic issues. The following  is a report from the international airport in Pudahuel by Arturo  Harlem:    [Begin recording] [Harlem] Good afternoon. Chilean Foreign  Minister Figueroa stated that Chile has not set any deadlines  for joining Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. He added,  however, that Chile is very interested in achieving an agreement  in this regard.    Upon his arrival from Brazil and Argentina, Foreign Minister  Carlos Figueroa stressed that Chile's entrance to Mercosur will  have a great impact at the regional level:    [Figueroa] As the foreign ministers have already stated, our  entrance in Mercosur will have a great political and economic  impact. If the negotiations are successful, it will result in  important commercial benefits in the short term for all those  countries encompassed in this agreement.    [Harlem] Figueroa also stated that the Chilean proposal had  been warmly accepted by Mercosur countries. According to this  proposal, Chile will be a Mercosur partner, and not a full  member, because Chilean customs tariffs are substantially lower  than those enforced in Mercosur countries.    Commenting on other issues, Foreign Minister Figueroa  reasserted that the Chilean Government has no plans to discuss  the landlocked issue with Bolivia. [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: AMBASSADOR FROM TURKEY FETED  </P> <P> There wasn't a spot of garden space vacant at the fete honoring the Ambassador  of the Republic of Turkey to the United States, Nuzhet Kandemir, and his wife,  Sadiye. Turkish Consul General Mehmet Emre and his wife, Sema, were exuding  smiles and directing the crowd to the cerkez tavuk (chicken with walnuts),  doner (beef on a spit), patlican kizartma (eggplant with green chiles), borrek  (fried pastry) and rice pilav.  </P> <P> Prominent were Mission Viejo real estate broker Vasif Canli, Los Angeles  developer T.K. Kutay, civil engineer Nezih M. Gunal, Chasen's assistant manager  Orhan Arli and Turan and Judy Kahraman.  </P> <P> Why the visit? Explained the ambassador: "To explain the business opportunities  that exist in Turkey." J. Jamison Moore, who owns Atlantis Inc., already knows.  He and his wife, Mara, have sold their house and will live abroad for the next  five years to oversee his $552-million resort development near Izmir. Yachting  was on the minds of Bud and Virginia Carpenter. He's in charge of the Los  Angeles Yacht Club plans for 75 Southland sailors to sail on seas off the coves  of Turkey next year.  </P> <P> BOUQUETS: The Friends of Robinson Gardens garden tour has become one of the  can't-miss events of spring. This year the gardens of Irene Kassorla and Norman  Friedmann, Stephanie and Louis Snyder, Otis and Dody Booth, Don and Kathleen  Spiegelman, plus the Virginia Robinson Gardens, were picked by benefit  co-chairs Carol Mancino and Donna Kamin and co-presidents Donna Wolff and  Bridget Martens. They also chose famous gardener Georgie Van de Kamp (mother of  gubernatorial candidate John Van de Kamp) for honorary chair.  </P> <P> WOW! It helps to have former President Ronald Reagan joining entertainers Jose  Feliciano and Maureen McGovern for fund raising. The folks in the background  also deserve applause for raising more than $450,000 at the fourth annual "A  Night Under the Stars" gala to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy Assn.  </P> <P> At the party Mr. Reagan presented August Busch III, chairman of the board and  president of Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc., with the Dennis Day Memorial Award  for the $4.7 million he's raised.

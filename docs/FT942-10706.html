			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / UK Company News: BPC joins market with Pounds 250m tag British Printing Company, the UK's largest commercial printer, confirmed yesterday that it planned to come to market via a placing and public offer this summer, which is expected to value the group at Pounds 250m. BPC, known as BPCC before its January 1989 management buy-out from the late Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire, claims a 20 per cent share of the UK magazine printing market. It prints more than 1bn magazines each year including eight out of the top 10 weekly magazines. Among its titles are the Radio Times, TV Times, Bella and Woman's Own. The group operates three main printing businesses, magazines and catalogues, cartons and labels, and books and journals. It produced operating profits of Pounds 19m last year on turnover of Pounds 317.6m. Commenting on the flotation plans, Mr John Holloran, the chief executive who led the management buy-out, said now was the right time to come to the market because of the recovery in the printing market. He said a listing would enable the group to take full advantage of improving economic conditions and reinforce the group's reputation in the markets it serves. Since the buy-out the management has restructured the group which now operates from 25 main locations and has a workforce of 5,100. A Pounds 110m capital investment programme has been undertaken.</p>

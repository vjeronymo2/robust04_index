			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 26 (AFP) [dateline as received] -- The  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is  considering moving its headquarters from Vienna to Geneva, an  OPEC source said Sunday [27 March].    The source, seeking to clarify conflicting reports in the  Swiss and Austrian press, said rumours arose because "we want to  have our own headquarters" after 29 years in rented premises in  Vienna.    As a result of the rumours, Geneva authorities contacted  OPEC  with an offer to provide a site for 90 years and help finance  construction of a headquarters near the United Nations  institutions here, the source explained.    OPEC's secretariat was initially based in Geneva, but was  moved to Vienna in 1965 because the Canton of Geneva refused to  grant it diplomatic privileges in line with those of UN  facilities here.    Qatar meanwhile also said it would offer "everything you  want" if the headquarters was moved to the tiny Gulf state, the  source said.    The source said Austria, which draws economic benefits of an  estimated 50 million dollars a year from OPEC's presence in  Vienna, in turn reacted by offering OPEC new terms.    "The situation is still fluid," the source added, saying a  written proposal from the Austrians was expected to be discussed  by OPEC ministers at their summer conference in Vienna around  mid-June.</p>

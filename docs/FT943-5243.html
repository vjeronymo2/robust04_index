			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / International Company News: Offer for Texaco Canada rejected Texaco, the big US oil group, has rejected an offer worth CDollars 200m (USDollars 146m) for its Canadian subsidiary, Texaco Canada Petroleum. The US company says Texaco Canada is an important part of group strategy for North America. Texaco holds 78 per cent of Texaco Canada, an Alberta oil and gas producer and developer. The bid is from Canadian 88 Energy, a small western Canada oil and gas company, which is offering CDollars 1.60 a share for Texaco Canada's 124m shares after Texaco itself offered to buy the minority-held shares at CDollars 1.40 a share. Dissident Texaco Canada shareholders had complained that Texaco's offer grossly undervalued Texaco Canada's assets. Canadian 88 insisted its bid was 'very serious' and not aimed at forcing Texaco to raise its offer for the minority shares. It owns almost 10 per cent of Texaco Canada.</p>

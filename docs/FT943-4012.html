			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Sport: Grand carnage - Tennis Tomorrow's men's singles final of the 114th US Championships at the National Tennis Centre, Flushing Meadow, will produce a new champion. That much, at least, is certain at the end of a fortnight when upsets have abounded. Who we shall be hailing as he holds aloft the famous silver cup and pockets a cheque worth Dollars 550,000 is difficult to predict. In today's semi-finals, the 1991 Wimbledon champion, Michael Stich of Germany, seeded No 4, will play unseeded Karel Novacek of the Czech Republic, ranked 56, in the top half. In the lower half, Andre Agassi, unseeded for the first time since 1987, will play fellow American Todd Martin, seeded No 9. When Jaime Yzaga beat Pete Sampras, the defending champion, on Tuesday it meant that for the first time since tennis went open in 1968, only three of the seeds had reached the quarter-finals: Stich, Martin, and the left-handed Austrian, Thomas Muster (13). Once again, the growing depth in the men's game was apparent. The carnage had begun early. Wimbledon finalist Goran Ivanisevic (2) fell at the first hurdle to the German giant Markus Zoecke whose serve is nearly as big as his own. 'Maybe it's a brain injury. As soon as I come here it is finished. It's not a problem with New York, it's a problem with me,' said Ivanisevic. Boris Becker (7), also lost in the first round, beaten by America's Richey Reneberg. The 1989 champion was disappointed. 'I thought I had a good chance,' said Becker. 'But it was extremely slow this year - both the court and the heavier, softer balls.' Almost as slow as Becker himself, one might have added. Another former US Open winner, fifth seeded Stefan Edberg (1991, 1992), fell in the third round to fellow Swede and frequent practice partner, Jonas Bjorkman. The match was played at night in the same cold, windy conditions that had prevailed when Edberg lost to Aaron Krickstein in 1988. Thus, for the first year since 1986, Edberg has failed to reach a Grand Slam final. He was the victim of his own frailty on serve and an inspired piece of attacking play from Bjorkman who had given notice of his advance by beating French Open champion Sergi Bruguera two weeks ago in Schenectady. Bruguera had performed well at Flushing Meadow until he was hammered into submission by Muster in the fourth round. Michael Chang, the sixth seed, believes that he is at his best on the surface. He proved it, too, in one of the best matches of the tournament when he faced Agassi in the fourth round. It was a full-blooded contest. The quality of shot-making from both men was remarkable, the result a tonic for a sport that badly needs the survival of characters like Agassi. If, at times, Agassi's sinister black cap, black, white and blue striped shirt, plus black socks and shoes, makes him look more like Darth Vader than a tennis player as he darts about firing bullets from his light-sabre of a racket, one can still admire his astonishing timing and his courage in going for his shots. Whether Martin will be cast in the role of Luke Skywalker this afternoon remains to be seen. Certainly the tall, upright, all-American boy has done well to survive after saving three match points against Guillaume Raoux of France in the first round. He is carrying a groin injury that inhibits his movement and is playing well below the form that took him to the final of the Australian Open in January and the semi-finals at Wimbledon. Yet he will start as favourite. Martin has won three of his five matches against Agassi. At a time when the age eligibility rules for women are being redefined to protect the young from burn out and exploitation, Steffi Graf, herself an infant prodigy when she began, will be defending her title today against the 22-year-old from Spain, Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario. The great rivalry that is developing between these two - Graf leads 24-7 but has lost two of their last three meetings after holding match points in both - is about the only thing that is holding the women's game together. Already, the shortage of quality performers has brought a restlessness among the tournament promoters and some of the leading players. Together with the International Management Group they are proposing a revamped circuit with fewer tournaments.</p>

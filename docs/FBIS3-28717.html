			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "Article": "The First Step Toward National </F> Unification"]    [Text] The recent capture of the Anlung Veng base by the  Khmer Royal Armed Forces of the Kingdom of Cambodia was a great  victory for the entire nation. This victory means the beginning  of efforts to flush out the radical Khmer Rouge from the seceded  area in one part of the country which the Khmer Rouge have  claimed as their stronghold. While the Khmer Rouge have not  been able to defend their high command, this is a good sign in  the future for the royal government because the latter has  decided not to fight on the negotiating table anymore but  instead do the fighting on the battlefield.    This issue is clear when the Khmer Rouge started to make  (?insistent) and unreasonable demands which the royal government  cannot accept in its role as leader of the nation and of the  country. In its role as the leader, the current government  cannot bow to the stubborn outcast group. The royal government  has to carry out its duty to safeguard the nation and the  country's interest.    It is about time to start using strong measures. This time  around the royal government has performed well right from the  beginning. This is praiseworthy. The royal government has not  only captured and controlled Anlung Veng but has also made plans  to seize other areas controlled by the Khmer Rouge. The capture  of Anlung Veng is serious pressure on the Khmer Rouge who have  been affirming that they have sufficient forces and weapons to  defend their strongholds in the country. This is also proof  confirming the royal government's capability to run the country.    With efforts of the army to unite the nation, the situation  is developing well and clearly for the future. The vigorous and  energetic step and the preparations made with high technical  standards could be the turning point for the resumption of talks  between the Khmer Rouge and the royal government. Anlung Veng  no longer has any leverage in talks to force the Khmer Rouge to  comply with the royal government's conditions.    Because of this occasion, long-awaited by everyone, one  should be glad with all national leaders who have adopted such  active and firm actions.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Gerber forecasts lower earnings as price war bites GERBER Products, the US baby food manufacturer, yesterday warned that 'unprecedented competitive activity' meant it was lowering earnings estimates and expected a fall in sales volumes this year. Gerber shares plunged Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 30 1/4 before the close. The company, which has about 70 per cent of the US market, said that until late-November - halfway through its third quarter - it had been expecting volume growth of between 1 and 3 per cent, and earnings in the year to end-March of Dollars 2.05 to Dollars 2.10 a share. Since then, the group said there had been 'a dramatic change in the competitive situation and the resulting order rate'. Gerber tried to push up prices in October, and this, coupled with a subsequent price-war, left its products looking expensive. 'In one key market, our products were priced at more than twice that of our closest competitor,' the company complained. Gerber said it would probably show a fall in volumes during the year of around 3 to 4 per cent, while earnings per share are expected to dip to Dollars 1.80 to Dollars 1.90, from Dollars 1.93 in 1991-92. Gerber's two main competitors US are Ralston Purina, via its Beech-Nut subsidiary, and HJ Heinz.</p>

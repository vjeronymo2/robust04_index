			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Balkan oil pipeline will be boost for Russians - The project will provide an alternative to shipping Moscow's crude through the Bosporus An agreement between the Greek and Bulgarian governments approving the construction of a Dollars 700m pipeline to ship oil from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean should open up a new outlet for Russian oil exports by the end of the 1990s. The protocol signed in Thessaloniki earlier this month gives the go-ahead for TransBalkan Pipeline, a Greek-Russian consortium, to build a 350km pipeline to carry crude oil from Burgas in Bulgaria to Alexandroupolis in north-eastern Greece. The project, proposed early this year by two private Greek enterprises, the Latsis shipping and oil refining group, and the Copelouzos construction group, has been received with enthusiasm both in Athens and Moscow, where a Greek-Russian accord giving political backing for the pipeline was signed earlier this month. The pipeline, with capacity to carry 35m-40m tonnes of oil yearly, would provide an alternative to shipping Russian oil through the Bosporus. The Turkish government in July imposed restrictions on the passage of supertankers, citing the need to improve safety and environmental controls following the disastrous collision of two Greek-owned tankers in the straits in March. Moreover, the participation in TransBalkan Pipeline of Gazprom, the Russian state-controlled energy supplier, with an equity stake of up to 50 per cent, will ensure that the Russians maintain their grip on oil export routes from the former Soviet Union. Gazprom is expected to invite several Russian oil companies to take up part of its holding. Latsis and Copelouzos will be the other main participants in the consortium, together with Prometheus, a joint venture between Gazprom and the Copelouzos group which was set up to carry out energy projects in Greece. Gazprom is already involved in the construction of a 600km pipeline, due to be completed next year, and bringing natural gas to Greece from Bulgaria. The Bulgarian and Greek state oil companies will each be offered a small equity stake in TransBalkan. For Bulgaria, which at present attracts little international investment, the project also opens up broader long-term opportunities. Copelouzos, the group's chairman, said: 'Not only will the Bulgarians benefit from pipeline tariffs, they would also be in a position to extend the pipeline north and west, to the former Yugoslavia and perhaps Hungary, at a later date.' Moreover, there appear to be fewer political risks associated with the project. Greece and Bulgaria have managed to avoid the kind of disputes over minority issues that are poisoning Greek relations with both Albania and Macedonia. The Greek government welcomes the project for its potential contribution to development in Thrace, one of the poorest regions in the European Union. The pipeline will also go some way towards reducing the fears of Greek and Cypriot shipowners, who are important carriers of Russian oil, that the new Bosporus regulations will prove costly for their tanker operations. The project calls for a chain of tankers to ship crude from the Russian port of Novorossysk across the Black Sea for offloading at storage facilities in Burgas. At the other end, oil from a tank farm at Alexandroupolis, with capacity of some 700,000 tonnes, is to be shipped through an undersea pipe for loading at a mooring station situated several kilometres offshore. However, given the political tensions between Greece and Turkey, officials involved with the project are careful to stress that the pipeline project is not intended to replace the Bosporus route, or conflict with plans to ship oil from the former Soviet republics by pipeline through Turkey to the Mediterranean. 'It's not a question of wanting to monopolise Russian oil exports,' one official said. 'With some 35m tonnes of oil moving through every year, the Bosporus is already close to capacity. When oil exports start from Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan new routes will be needed.' A pre-feasibility study proposes two alternative routes for the Bulgarian sector of the pipeline, running south-west from Burgas through the Rodopi mountains to Thrace. Construction is expected to start in late 1995 and would take about three years to complete. As the first important cross-border construction project in the Balkans, the consortium partners sound confident that financing will not be difficult. According to one estimate, up to 35 per cent of the cost could be covered through EU grants, while the project would also qualify for soft loans from the European Investment Bank. In addition, the London-based Latsis group has ready access to financing through its network of private banks in western Europe with equity capital that totals more than Dollars 500m.</p>

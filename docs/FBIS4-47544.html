Vesicular membranes were obtained  by extracting phospholipids from chicken egg yolks and exposing  the suspension to ultrasound. The ferrihemoglobin was obtained  by oxidizing human oxyhemoglobin with potassium ferricyanide and  then gel-filtrating it on a G-25 molselect. The ferrihemoglobin  and the ferricytochrome C were bound to the liposomes using a  buffer and gel-filtrated on a G-200 sephadex. Protein  concentration was registered on a SF-46 spectrophotometer at 750  nm. The concentration of peroxidation products was found from  their reaction with 2-thiobarbituric acid and expressed in terms  of MDA (malonic dialdehyde) concentration per 1 mg of membrane  lipid. Irradiation was performed on a linear accelerator with an  electron energy of 5 MeV at doses of 10, 50, 100, 1000, 5,000,  and 10,000 gR. The data obtained were processed using Student's  t-statistic and the correlation coefficient, r, on an  Iskra-1030 computer. It was found that the irradiation reduced  Soret band intensity, a finding that is consistent with previous  data, and induced structural changes in the proteins.  Calculations performed for the binding constant, binding  locations, and change in free energy revealed that the  irradiation induced peroxidation of the lipids in the liposomes  and altered the structure of the ferrihemoglobin, causing  instability in the protein-lipid interactions. It was theorized  that the lipid component plays a key role in this instability.  Figures 2, tables 1; references 22: 17 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

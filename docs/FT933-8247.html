			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Public smoking epidemic keeps US visitors away from Europe Sir, Your article on the decline of US visitor numbers ('Cheap money is no bargain', August 7/8) misses an important reason for the current reluctance of Americans to visit Europe. On October 14 1777, Mozart wrote from Augsburg in Germany about his visit to a coffee-house. 'When I entered I thought that I should drop down, overcome by the stink and fumes of tobacco. But with God's help I had to stand it for an hour; and I pretended to enjoy it all, though to me it seemed as if we were in Turkey.' An epidemic of public smoking has spread through mainland Europe. From railway station waiting rooms to restaurants, from theatre foyers to taxis, from hotels to hospitals, the visitor is condemned to the situation endured by Mozart. The UK is better, but not by much. How charming the intimate little restaurants are - if you do not mind a sore throat, streaming eyes, and all your clothes needing cleaning. Complaints are met by amused shrugs at the fussiness of Americans. The trouble for the European tourist industry is that those fussy people go back home and pass on the word to all their fussy friends. Most Americans do not smoke, and do not like smoke. The Americans with most money to spend are those who dislike smoke the most. European restaurateurs, publicans, and others who earn much of their living from the tourist trade, may not be aware of the full cost of that smoking habit. Mozart stayed two more weeks in Augsburg, but he did not return to the coffee-house - nor to Augsburg. M Singer, 414 Sea Sage Drive, Apartment 12, Delray Beach, Florida 33483</p>

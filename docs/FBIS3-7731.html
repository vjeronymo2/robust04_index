			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, February 27 (TANJUG) -- Radmilo  Bogdanovic, the president of the Serbian Assembly Committee for  Relations with Serbs outside Serbia, said on Saturday that the  model of a Moslem-Croat alliance which was being negotiated in  Washington was not in the spirit of a peaceful solution for the  former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    That is why such a plan is not encouraging, he said. If it  is realized, the position of Serbs will become unfavourable,  Bogdanovic told the local radio station in Jagodina, central  Serbia.    "Taking into consideration the United States support,  Moslems  might get even greater appetites for new territorial  concessions, and Croatia might try to realize through war that  which the West has allegedly promised it -- a quick solution to  the problem of the Croatian territory under Serb control," he  warned.    "This would lead to a new aggravation of the conflict, which  we are absolutely against," Bogdanovic underscored. The people  and the leaderships of the Bosnian Serb Republic and the  Republic of Serb Krajina "certainly cannot accept that,"  Bogdanovic said.    The Republic of Serb Krajina was proclaimed by Serbs in 1991  in parts of the territory of Croatia where they are the majority  population in answer to Croatia's forcible secession from the  former Yugoslav Federation. In early 1992, Krajina was  proclaimed a United Nations Protected Area.    "It is our stand that weapons should be laid down wherever  there is bloodshed, and that a solution which is just and equal  for all and not detrimental to any of the warring sides should  be embraced," Bogdanovic said.    Tri-partite talks between Croatia, Bosnian Croats and  Bosnian  Moslems, with the mediation of the United States, on a joint  Croat-Moslem state in Bosnia-Herzegovina began in Washington on  Saturday. Under the Washington plan, Moslems and Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina would form a joint state entity. Such a  community would then enter into a confederation with  neighbouring Croatia, to which Croatian President Franjo Tudjman  already agreed in principle on Thursday.</p>

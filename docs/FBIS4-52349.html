			<p>BFN     [Text] Darwin, Australia, May 3 (AFP) -- United States air  force pilots, on air exercises over here, were acting like  cowboys and should be stopped, a local political leader said  Tuesday.    Recent manoeuvres involving US marines from the Japan-based  Marine Group 12 have angered residents in this northern  Australian city complaining about the noise and frequency of  flights.    "If we cannot control these people, if we can't tell them  they've got to abide by the rules that we set... if they won't  do that, then they've got to stop coming," the Northern  Territory's Labor opposition leader Brian Ede told national  radio.    "We cannot allow people to decide that they're going to  treat  the Northern Territory (and) Darwin as though it is some place  where they're going to have a bit of a jaunt."    Australia's Defence Minister Robert Ray has announced two  separate studies into the noise effects of air exercises over  Darwin, and the regional government also has instituted its own  investigation.    Ede said some US pilots had left their flight paths and made  flyovers across Darwin suburbs.    "We want an immediate ban on those cowboys," Ede said.    Ede's comments drew an angry reaction from the adjutant of  Marine Group 12, Captain Iric Bressler.    "That's totally false," he said. "Our pilots have strict  regulations. They fly off strict flight plans, and they go  exactly where they're supposed to go and come back... I'm kind  of irritated about it."    Earlier this month, it was revealed that, in March, two  FA-18  Hornet aircraft flown by the marines mistakenly dropped dummy  bombs as close as 100 metres to a hut containing Americans and  Australians.    A subsequent report into the incident at Delamere bombing  range, about 350 kilometres (215 miles) south of here, blamed  pilot error.    The US marines are due to leave here next week after three  months of training.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Banks urged to drop job cut plans Bifu, the banking union, has called on banks and other financial institutions to abandon further planned job cuts next year now that they are returning to profitability. The union estimates that 100,000 jobs have been lost in the finance sector over the past four years and that thousands more are at risk in 1994. The TSB bank has announced closure of 110 branches next year and National Westminster plans to shut 500 by 1996.</p>

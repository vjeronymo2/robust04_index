			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 1989 RETAIL SALES UP 5%, SMALLEST GAIN IN 7 YEARS  </P> <P> Retail sales, reflecting a sluggish economy, rose just 5% in 1989, the smallest  gain in seven years, the government said today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said sales for all of 1989 totaled $1.71 trillion, down  from 1988's 7.1% gain. It was the smallest advance since a 2.9% increase in  1982.  </P> <P> The economy was pinched through much of last year by high interest rates caused  by the Federal Reserve's tight credit policies designed to contain inflation.  </P> <P> Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity and  thus are one barometer of the extent to which the Fed's anti-inflation policies  have slowed the economy.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.2% in December to a seasonally  adjusted $144.4 billion after rising 0.5% in November.  </P> <P> Part of the November increase was attributed by analysts to the early start of  Christmas shopping during the weekend after Thanksgiving and raised  expectations of many merchants and analysts.  </P> <P> But the December sales turned out to be modest, and the Department of Commerce  said spending during the November-December period rose only 3.8% over the same  period in 1988, when sales were up 6.6% over the previous two-month period. It  was the lowest November-December gain since sales rose 2.9% in 1985.  </P> <P> Half or more of retail profits come from business done between Thanksgiving and  Christmas.  </P> <P> Sales of durable goods -- big-ticket items such as cars and household  appliances expected to last more than three years -- fell 0.6% after edging up  0.1% in November.  </P> <P> Durable goods, which often are financed by loans and thus are susceptible to  interest rates, have been hit hardest by Fed policies.  </P> <P> Auto sales, which have been in the doldrums, fell 0.7% in December after a 0.4%  decline in November. Auto sales finished the year up just 2.2% contrasted with  a 10.3% gain in 1988. It was the lowest since sales declined 8.1% in 1980.  </P> <P> Excluding autos, overall sales in December were up 0.4%.  </P> <P> Among other durable sales, building materials rose 0.1% on top of a 0.7% rise  in November, while furniture and other home furnishings declined 1% after a  0.7% increase a month earlier.  </P> <P> Sales of non-durable goods rose 0.6% after gaining 0.8% in November.  </P> <P> Gains were posted in grocery stores, up 0.6%, and gasoline stations, up 1.3%,  due in part to higher prices. Apparel sales advanced 0.1%.  </P> <P> Declines were posted in department store sales, down 0.4%; restaurants and  bars, down 0.9%, and drug stores, down 1%.  </P> <P> For the three months from October through December, overall retail sales were  up 3.6%.  </P></p>

The sources said that the brigade's commander, Colonel  'Abdallah 'Ali Shulayl, had left the camp to finalize some  matters. In his absence a decision was issued, appointing  Colonel Taymas as his replacement. It is worth mentioning that  both officers come from Abyan Governorate (in the south). The  5th Brigade is also one of the military units belonging to  former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, whose elements emigrated  to the north in the wake of the 13 January 1986 incidents.    The sources said that Col. 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander  of  the 1st tank Division and the Yemeni president's half brother,  is behind the replacement process, because of his fear of  possible contacts between the brigade and Socialist Party  leaders, while northern units (loyal to the General People's  Congress) see 'Ali Nasir's forces as "friendly units."    Observers believe that the decision to replace the 5th  Brigade's commander is an attempt to foment sedition among the  sons of Abyan Governorate, to which President 'Ali Nasir belong.  But it has resulted in nothing except skirmishes between the  brigade's personnel and the tank battalion belonging to the 1st  Division, which is stationed in the same camp. As a result, one  of the brigade's soldiers was wounded.    AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that a military committee  comprised of Col. 'Abdallah 'Ali 'Ulaywah, Col. 'Abd-Rabbuh  Mansur, and Commander Muzahim went to Sanaa to the 5th Brigade's  command to discuss the issue. They discovered that another  military delegation had arrived from Aden. An argument took  place between the "committee" and the "delegation." It ended up  with an agreement to freeze the situation and keep Col. Sulayl  in his position, after the brigade's personnel warned against  replacing their commander "covertly." They stressed that any  decision in this connection should come from Yemeni Defense  Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir.    Tribal sources in the 'Umran area have said that the people  of the area sympathize with the 5th Brigade's personnel and  command, because they are performing their duty in an area  deprived of services, even though they are exposed to an  undeclared blockade from the military supply organ. Some people  describe them as "third-rate military men" -- which has caused  them to support Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Haytham and consider  him their leader in the circumstances of the blockade they are  experiencing.    In another development, officials in Sanaa have confirmed  the  occurrence of a clash between a group of tribesmen who wanted to  seize a convoy of [cooking] gas tankers that were heading for  the capital and the police forces guarding them. Despite the  intensity of the exchange of fire, the authorities have not  revealed the number of victims.</p>

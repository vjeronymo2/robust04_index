			<p>BFN     [Text] Sanaa, 1 Jun (INA) -- An official Yemeni source has  told INA correspondent in Sanaa that the legitimate Yemeni  forces have seized 80 tanks which were sent from Saudi Arabia to  the secessionists in Aden.    The source said that Saudi Arabia moved these tanks via the  al-'Abr border area into Hadhramaut Governotate three days ago.    The source added that Yemeni tribes in Shabwah Governorate  and Hadhramaut Governorate seized the tanks when those who were  transporting them hinted that they were representatives of 'Ali  Salim al-Bid.    The source explained that as a result, Yemeni President  Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih contacted Saudi King  Fahd by telephone and informed him that he had received the  consignment of tanks sent to the secessionists.</p>

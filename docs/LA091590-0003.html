			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SEWAGE SPILL CLOSES 2 MILES OF BEACHES  </P> <P> A 2-mile stretch of beach from Ocean Beach to Mission Beach was closed Friday  and could be shut down for most of the weekend because a corroded pipe burst,  sending 50,000 gallons of sewage sludge into the ocean.  </P> <P> The beaches affected are between Del Monte Avenue in Ocean Beach and Ventura  Place in Mission Beach, right near the Giant Dipper roller coaster, said Lt.  Charles Wright, a San Diego city lifeguard.  </P> <P> The beach area in Ocean Beach is scheduled to be closed until Monday, but  Mission Beach could reopen as early as this afternoon, Wright said.  </P> <P> A hole, 3 inches wide and 8 inches long, sent the treated sewage into the San  Diego River flood channel, where it flowed into the ocean, said Dan Child, a  waste-water treatment superintendent with the city's Water Utilities  Department.  </P> <P> The section of pipe that broke was on Sea World Drive on the north side of the  flood channel.  </P> <P> It is part of an 8-mile-long pipe that carries 800,000 gallons of sewage daily  from the city's sewage-treatment plant on Point Loma to sludge-drying basins on  Fiesta Island, Child said.  </P> <P> The first report of the break came in about 8:45 a.m. Pumps were shut down,  stopping the rush of sewage in about an hour, Child said.  </P> <P> The beaches were closed because the bacteria in the sewage contaminated the  water, Wright said.  </P> <P> "There's no real way to clean it up," Wright said. "It becomes diluted over  time in the ocean and the bacteria counts are reduced to the point of not being  dangerous anymore."  </P> <P> Signs are posted on the beaches warning people to stay out of the water.  </P> <P> In addition to becoming sick, people who ignore the signs could be arrested,  Wright said.  </P></p>

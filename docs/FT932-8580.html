			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Market makers cut service to other dealers TWO leading players in the LDC debt market have stopped making a market to other market makers, citing excessive inter-dealer activity in the sector by comparison with other markets. Merrill Lynch and ING New York both said they would continue making markets to clients. 'We did not feel it was a necessary function any more,' said Mr Scott Gordon, chief trader at ING in New York. Instead, the New York office will concentrate on managing its own portfolio and trading with investors. The London office will continue a full market-making service. Merrill said it would continue making a market to a narrow selection of other market makers, but would 'focus more on customer flows'. The decision affects trading in London and New York. According to traders, there are about 10 market makers in the sector.</p>

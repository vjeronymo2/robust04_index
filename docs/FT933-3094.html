			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Bonds: Italy to tap into well of demand for high-yield bonds THE Republic of Italy is expected to give a greater weighting to the 30-year than to the 10-year tranche of its Dollars 5bn global offering, which is due to be launched today, in order to tap the well of demand for high-yielding bonds. Now that yields on US Treasuries have fallen to a 25-year low, investors need to look much further along the yield curve in order to secure higher returns. However, there has been a shortage of paper ever since the US Treasury decided to auction fewer 30-year bonds. Italy is expected to raise at least Dollars 3bn through the 30-year tranche and the remainder through the 10-year tranche, which had been the borrower's preferred maturity at the start of the roadshow. Investors expect the 30-year bonds to carry a generous yield of between 80-85 basis points over comparable US Treasuries. This compares with a yield spread of 60-65 basis points for the 10-year bonds. Issuance in the international bond market remained slow yesterday ahead of Italy's first global offering. In the D-Mark sector, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW), the German government agency for re-development, raised DM1.5bn through an offering of 10-year Eurobonds. Syndicate managers said the narrow yield spread of 14 basis points reflected the borrower's triple-A rating. However, some said that the yield appeared meagre to investors who have turned bearish following the Bundesbank's easing last week, believing that there is little room for further interest rate cuts in Germany Meanwhile, the World Bank has awarded the mandate for its first D-Mark global bond offering to Deutsche Bank and Salomon Brothers. The market expects the offering to be launched early next month, with a maturity of more than seven years and a size of at least DM5bn. Syndicate managers also expect a handful of Eurobond offerings from Latin American borrowers. Banobras, one of the Mexican government's primary vehicles for financing economic development, is about to launch a Dollars 100m five-year offering via CSFB. Argentina and Venezuela are likely to tap the D-Mark sector in the coming weeks. Among other issues yesterday, Credit Foncier de France injected liquidity into the long end of the French franc sector with its FFr3bn offering of 15-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which were priced to yield 20 basis points over the yield on the French government's 8 1/2 per cent OAT due 2008, offered a marginal pick-up over the borrower's 14-year Eurobond issue, which was increased by FFr500m to FFr3.5bn last week. Credit Local de France was encouraged to tap the Ecu sector in the light of the strong demand on Monday for the Council of Europe's eight-year Ecu150m Eurobond issue. The French bank raised Ecu175m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds which were re-offered at 100 1/8 . Lead manager Goldman Sachs said the bonds held their re-offer price in spite of weakness in the underlying Ecu market.</p>

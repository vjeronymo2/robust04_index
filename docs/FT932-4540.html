			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Clinton poised to simplify energy tax: Senator's dogged opposition may force change PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is on the verge of abandoning his plan to tax the thermal content of fuels, and is instead negotiating for a simpler energy tax calculated on price. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, has been put in charge of squeezing the budget package past his former colleagues in the Senate, and is now negotiating a compromise bill that would reduce the impact of the proposed energy tax by about a third and make offsetting cuts in spending, principally on medical benefits for the elderly. Although the White House insists Mr Clinton still wants 'a broad-based energy tax, one that is fair and one that encourages conservation,' he appears to have given up his plan to tax most fuels at 26.8 cents per million British thermal units, with an additional 34.2 cents per million BTUs levied on oil products. Faced by the dogged opposition of Senator David Boren, from the oil-producing state of Oklahoma, to the BTU tax the administration is now considering an ad valorem tax. This would simplify collection but would emasculate the intended environmental benefits of the energy tax which, as originally designed, would have favoured cleaner fuels such as natural gas over dirtier coal or petroleum products. However, the BTU tax had already been so extensively remodelled by concessions to farm and industry lobbies that its environmental benefits would have been muted. The administration has been working with Senate Democratic leaders on plans to cut about Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.9bn) from the Dollars 72bn it originally expected to collect over five years through the energy tax. Senators also want to postpone implementation of the higher income tax rates to be applied to upper-income taxpayers from January 1 to July 1, at a revenue cost of about Dollars 9bn. To offset this the administration and Senate Democratic leaders are considering reducing the earned income tax credit proposed for low-income working families, which was partly intended to compensate for the impact of the energy tax, and cuts in health benefits under the Medicare programme for the elderly. White House officials had been counting on Medicare savings to pay for some of the expected cost of their healthcare reform plan. It is possible, however, that Senator Patrick Moynihan, Senate finance committee chairman, may have deliberately exaggerated the size of likely Medicare cuts to excite the powerful pensioners' lobby and step up pressure on rebellious Democrats like Mr Boren, who is the key swing vote on the committee where Democrats hold an 11:9 majority. Mr Clinton has limited leeway in his search for a compromise: nothing he offers will gain a single Republican vote in the Senate, while concessions to win over one or two right-wing Democrats could cost him votes among disgruntled left wingers in the House.</p>

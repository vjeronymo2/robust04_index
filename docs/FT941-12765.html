			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / Observer: Spies right The refusenicks at GCHQ - the UK government's intelligence monitoring station at Cheltenham, where trade unions were banned 10 years ago - were startled to hear Rupert Allason, Conservative MP for Torbay, explain in a parliamentary debate why the union ban was imposed. Allason blamed it on lack of cover in December 1981. When martial law was imposed by General Wojciech Jaruzelski across Poland, the UK was 'blind' in intelligence terms, according to Allason. But John Cook, one of 14 trade unionists who lost their jobs for refusing to accept the ban, thinks Allason, who doubles as the thriller writer Nigel West, has been listening to too many spy stories. Cook believes there was no industrial action at GCHQ at the time. He has a point. A colleague was working in Warsaw then, and during martial law was asked by the British embassy's defence attache to observe 'casually' Polish military movements - a remarkable scraping of the barrel in spying terms.</p>

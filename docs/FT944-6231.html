			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Comment): A shield to fend off the knives In the real world it would be classed as a sound Budget with exciting political potential. It does nobody any harm, and it might do some important groups of voters, including pensioners and the long-term unemployed, a modicum of good. It contains no controversial new decisions, yet it shows courage by confirming an important old one - to increase VAT on domestic fuel by the full 17.5 per cent. Best of all, it puts the chancellor in a position to announce cuts in personal taxation next November, or the one after that, or indeed in both years; anyhow in time for the next election. Preparations for the mother of all bribes are well in hand. Unfortunately for the government its supporters have long since floated off the world as we know it. We saw them, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, in battle on Monday afternoon. They were squabbling about an extra Pounds 75m contribution to the European Union's budget. Their unearthly shrieking shattered the party. The chancellor snarled over his shoulder at his opponents, all at that time recognised by the whips as Conservatives. He stood like Darth Vader, battling for the galaxy. Improbable life-forms zoomed around his head. About seven or eight of them were banished by the Tory whips. The question was not whether the Conservatives would win again in 1996 or 1997, but whether they could remain in office that long. Yesterday we saw a quite different chancellor. Back in humanoid form Mr Clarke droned for Britain, solid, dependable, wise, Captain Kirk. He had nothing to say, but he said it very well. His perception, that the government is in a deep hole, is matched by his strategy, which is that the only route to salvation is a period of good, solid, uneventful administration. So he began his speech by describing the Conservative Wirtschaftswunder. Familiar it may be, but it still sounds miraculous. The economy is growing at 4 per cent a year, fastest in Europe. Registered unemployment is falling; the number of people in jobs is rising. Exports are up; balance of payments trends are positive; inflation is lower than it has been within the living memory of two-thirds of the population. Stick with the government for just a few more years and the budget will be back in balance, the huge borrowing requirement wiped out. In the real world any chancellor describing such a golden set of numbers would simper as he did it. The benches behind him would cheer, wave their order papers, or at least rumble 'hear hear'. Even yesterday afternoon, the House of Commons could not be described as the real world. Mr Clarke exchanged defensive and unscripted banter with the benches opposite, while behind him his colleagues sat stony faced. As time went by, some of them fell into the arms of Morpheus. They should have sat up and paid attention. The other side did. Both the Labour and Liberal benches were bemused, as they saw one stratagem of theirs after another emerge from the chancellor's box, now to be used as a shield to protect the government and the prime minister from the knives aimed at their backs. It is an intricate device. Some of its components have been borrowed from the opposition. What Mr Clarke called a 'set of effective policies to tackle the big problem of structural unemployment which faces the whole western world' sounded not unlike the welfare-to-work proposals borrowed by Labour's advisers from President Bill Clinton's coterie. The details may not match, but the broad methodology is similar: adjust social security where it acts as a disincentive to take a job and subsidise employment where that might help. Another notion - for a landfill tax - elicited smiles of recognition from the Liberals. The patent for Mr Clarke's schemes to attract private-sector capital in support of public ventures was claimed, vociferously, by Mr John Prescott. Yesterday's closure of 'tax loopholes' was recognisably lifted from Labour. None of this is quite fair: the government, through the chancellor, has put in a lot of work in these areas. Some of Mr Peter Lilley's ideas on social payments contain elements of originality. But the same can be said of some Labour and Liberal proposals. Even so, Mr Clarke is a star, and not only by the dismal standards of those around him. His speech yesterday was dull and long, yet, as during Monday afternoon's scrap, his delivery showed that he is afraid of no one, that his self-confidence knows no bounds. The contrast with the demeanour of the prime minister, who sat slumped beside him, was painful to behold. The chancellor's career has not been without blemish. Some say he left a trail of destruction or unfinished business at the departments he ran, not least at health and the Home Office. It may be that he reached the Treasury at just the right time, that he is supremely fortunate. Those of us who would not hesitate to castigate him had he suffered bad luck must give him credit for his handling of the blessings of fate. He has stuck to the prime minister's counter-inflation policy, reinforcing it by allying himself with the Bank of England. He has resisted calls to reduce taxes as if there was to be an election tomorrow, knowing well enough that this is a mid-term, not end-of-term, financial statement. At a time when the government seems to wake up every morning not knowing whether it will live out the day, he has persisted in playing it long. We may therefore look with understanding upon his sprinkling of coins in the direction of this or that clutch of voters. His programmes to promote employment seem to come from the heart; in a hard-nosed world he remains a one-nation Tory. Savers who harbour Tessas and Peps in their portfolios may thank him for the extension of these tax-free opportunities. Cutting overall expenditure while allowing real-terms increases for health, education and the police is political common sense, an answer to some of the points made by the Conservative party's Mr John Maples in his celebrated, leaked memorandum. To recall Mr Maples and his document is to fall back into the irrational universe, the one that now surrounds the administration. Last week was one the Conservatives will want to forget; there is no need to rehearse all its events now. Monday's parliamentary mess was a spillover. We need not describe each humiliation. The government is visibly falling to pieces, partly over its divided attitude to the EU, and partly as a result of its small majority. The prime minister cannot be confident that there will be no challenge to his leadership. If this was a normal government, operating in the mode usually adopted in mid-term, we could be certain that Mr Clarke's Budget was a likely winner. In these surreal times, that may be too much to ask.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Wellcome begins campaign on Aids WELLCOME, the UK pharmaceutical group, yesterday launched a wide-ranging charitable programme called Positive Action 'to help meet the global challenge of HIV and Aids'. The programme's start-up costs will be about Pounds 1m, but Mr James Cochrane, Wellcome's European operations director, said the company's commitment was open-ended. Total spending on Positive Action by Wellcome's businesses around the world might run into tens of millions of pounds. Sales of the company's best-selling Aids drug Retrovir (AZT) are expected to exceed Pounds 200m this year. Positive Action has four main initiatives: support for Aids education and care in the community; action to prevent HIV infection and care for Aids patients in developing countries; improved services for children affected by Aids; and developing policies concerning the disease in the workplace. Wherever possible, Wellcome will join forces with existing organisations. For example, its partner in the developing countries initiative is the Population Council, based in New York, which has considerable experience of community-based health work in Africa. 'We are firmly committed to a response to HIV and Aids which goes beyond producing effective medicines,' Mr Cochrane said. 'Positive Action brings together the crucial elements of education, care and community support which need to be combined on a global basis if we are to minimise the potentially devastating consequences of the pandemic.' Wellcome executives concede that the company's critics, who have attacked it for making excessive profits from Aids, might see Positive Action as a grandiose public-relations initiative. 'But it's not,' insisted one. 'To the cynics I would say: 'Wait and see. Maybe we will convince you over time'.' The Terrence Higgins Trust, a leading Aids support group, welcomed the announcement. Mr Nick Partridge, chief executive, said: 'It will go a long way to reversing the very severe criticism Wellcome has come up against in the past.' The company said the announcement was unconnected with next month's planned share offer. Share issue, Page 21</p>

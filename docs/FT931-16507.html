			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / International Company News: Contest opens for control of Ebro THE SALE by two institutions of stock in Ebro, the big Spanish sugar and rice producer, has opened the contest for control of what is considered the pearl of the Kuwait Investment Office's investments in Spain. The stock was held as collateral for loans to Ebro's main shareholder, Grupo Torras, the KIO's troubled Barcelona-based holding company. Torras, which went into receivership last month after the KIO claimed it had sustained losses of Dollars 4bn, owns 36 per cent of Ebro, a company which closed its financial year in September with estimated net profits of Dollars 54m and a Dollars 96m positive cash-flow. Nearly all of Torras' shareholding in Ebro is, however, pledged to creditor banks. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, which has outstanding loans of Dollars 22m to Torras guaranteed by some 5 per cent of Ebro's equity, has emerged as an early player in the contest for the food company by acquiring O8 per cent of its stock which was held as a collateral by Italy's Banco di Roma. A second minor Torras creditor, the savings bank Caja del Penedes, has sold just under 1 per cent of Ebro's equity in order to recover its loans. Brokers said the Penedes-held shares were widely spread, although the BBV securities house is understood to have been an active buyer. As well as from the BBV, Torras also borrowed substantially against Ebro from Bank of America, Sumitomo and Chase Manhattan. Bank of America's Ebro-pledged loans to Torras are believed to be in excess of Dollars 86m. The initial interest shown by BBV in Ebro stock has fuelled speculation that the bank could be acting in partnership with the Ferruzzi group for the Italian agribusiness giant has in the past joined forces with the BBV to acquire major stakes in Spain's edible oils sector.</p>

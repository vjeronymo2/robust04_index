			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Mandela urges British business to invest in South Africa Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress, pictured yesterday, urged British business to invest in South Africa 'as soon as the date for elections is announced' and promised an early return to Commonwealth membership, writes Michael Holman. Mr Mandela, on a two-day visit to London, is due to hold talks today with Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, and address members of both houses of parliament. The ANC expects the constitutional negotiations under way in South Africa will soon set a date for the country's first all-race elections, paving the way to a government of national unity. The election itself would follow within a year. Mr Mandela told a press conference that the ANC had 'issued an investment code which provides that there will be no expropriation of property of investors. They will be allowed to repatriate their dividends and profits, and we think that will go a long way to reassuring investors to invest in our country'. The ANC leader once again appealed to whites to stay in South Africa: 'They have the knowledge, the skills . . . without them it is going to be difficult to address many of the socio-economic problems facing the country.' An early foreign policy decision of a new government would be to rejoin the Commonwealth, Mr Mandela said later at a lunch in his honour hosted by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Commonwealth secretary-general.</p>

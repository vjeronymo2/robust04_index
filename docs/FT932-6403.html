			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / New partner at the last chance saloon: John Major has been forced to promote to chancellor the man who may ultimately threaten his leadership It is John Major's last throw. The cabinet that takes office today has not been shaped in a moment of political calm, following a period of quiet deliberation, as the prime minister liked to pretend that it would be. It is much the same as yesterday's cabinet, save for a few repairs and renovations designed to camouflage the involuntary resignation of Mr Norman Lamont. The other changes, those among junior ministers, have a logic of their own, founded on the happy departure of a cheerful Mr Tristan Garel-Jones from the Foreign Office, his Maastricht work done. The purpose of the curious reshuffle at the top is not to 'refresh' the administration, as Downing Street put it, but to refresh the prime minister's hold on office. He was forced to dismiss his chancellor by the voters of Newbury, at a moment chosen by a rising chorus of would-be executioners - 'assassins', he called them in an interview with the FT this week - in parliament and the press. In spite of such imperatives, Mr Major evidently had to screw up his courage before he could dismiss the man who, in November 1990, managed his campaign to become party leader. This is hardly surprising. In matters of economic management Mr Lamont was the prime minister's alter ego. If the chancellor was responsible for the depth and persistence of the recession, so was the first lord of the Treasury. If Tweedledee's authority was destroyed by the expulsion of Britain from the exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday, so was Tweedledum's. The least popular prime minister since polling began could hardly afford to remove his unpopular chancellor; it might leave his own position exposed. In the event, Mr Major could hold out no longer than this week. His resolution was strengthened when it became clear that the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty would pass, Mr Garel-Jones would take his leave, and there would at least be a technical explanation for his actions. His hand was steadied by Sir Norman Fowler, the chairman of the Conservative party. His heart was given courage by intimations of his own political mortality. If fate is kind, the consequent rearrangement of chairs may come to be seen as the beginning of the prime minister's recovery, the day on which his erstwhile partner began a long political exile while he, Stan Laurel, began the long march to triumph at the next general election. It is, however, a pretty rum rearrangement. With the single exception of Mr John Redwood, there is no addition to the cabinet; excepting Mr Lamont, there is no subtraction. Mr Redwood, whose task is presumably to privatise Wales, is a highly intelligent, right-wing, newcomer. Mr Lamont had similar credentials. It is hardly a fresh beginning for a revitalised government. Perhaps it was too much to expect anything more. For we have to face an awful truth: there is no A-team. There is no pool of obviously superlative talent from which an energetic new Conservative administration might have been constructed. Mr Major has merely altered the job descriptions of a few of the members of his perpetual B-team. This could be fatal. Another year of parliamentary humiliation, recalled policies, by-election losses, and uncertain economic recovery could be the end of our hapless prime minister. Thanks to the Labour party's everlasting deficiencies the general election victory might still be delivered, but not by Mr Major. A new Conservative leader, possibly Mr Kenneth Clarke, would stand on the balcony, taking the cheers from the crowds. There is a puzzle here. The prime minister knows what Mr Clarke's game is. The new chancellor has never hidden it. It is to become prime minister himself. When - if - he does he will be seen grinning hugely, beer mug in one hand, fat cigar in the other. This is not to say that he will be disloyal to Mr Major. That would be out of character. He can, however, have it both ways. He can adopt the costume and manner of a chancellor with as much panache as his considerable brain and engaging personality enable him to do, while yet telling his mirror that if the prime minister is by some mischance toppled, then he, Kenneth, will be available. There would be no hope for him if, in the meantime, he made a mess of his new job. On this we must hold our breath. For all his political skills, when it comes to management of the economy, Mr Clarke is an innocent. He will be sandwiched between a prime minister who never forgets his own chancellorship and a Treasury mandarinate that is accustomed to educating new bosses. He is perhaps the only Conservative politician in play who has the self-confidence necessary to bluster his way through such obstacles. The last one, who was possessed of both the strong character and a knowledge of how the economy works, was Nigel Lawson. Mr Clarke's advantage is that he is admired for the rumbustious manner in which he has beaten up public sector unions, from the British Medical Association, through the Royal College of Nursing to the many combinations of teachers. He was just squaring up to the police and the prison officers when he was whisked out of the Home Office. These brawls have the merit of destroying the power of vested interests; Mr Clarke's handling of them has the demerit of leaving nothing behind that quite works. He is good at communicating with the voters, and possesses a strong broad-brush sense of mission. He may be better qualified to be prime minister than head of any single department. If he is too successful as chancellor he may never get his chance; Mr Major will reap the benefit. Mr Clarke's aim as chancellor will nevertheless be to make sound political judgments, as Sir Norman wants him to, and win votes for the Tories by establishing a rapport with a disenchanted electorate, as the party needs him to. His well-known disadvantage in this regard is that Tory Euro-sceptics mistrust him, which they well might, since on matters European he is the nearest thing in the cabinet to Mr Paddy Ashdown, the leader of the federalist Liberal Democrats. Perhaps I am a trifle unfair. Mr John Gummer, the new environment secretary, is more Euro-centric than Mr Clarke; he confesses to regretting the passage of the Holy Roman Empire. What is remarkable is the continuing strength of the pro-Europeans in Mr Major's cabinet. With the foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, heading the field, they dominate the top echelons of the government. This is to the prime minister's credit. He has not sold out to the Euro-sceptics, as he might have done had he made Mr Michael Howard chancellor rather than home secretary. The latter appointment should, however, placate the Tory right. Moving Mrs Gillian Shephard from employment to agriculture might be said to be a step in the sceptical direction, but then Mrs Shephard has yet to demonstrate that she can make an impact on any department. Mr David Hunt, her successor as employment secretary, has a good reputation as an individual of quality, although you have to discount for the context in which this assessment is made. He has managed Wales in more or less the Peter Walker left-of-centre tradition. Last night Mr Redwood was at pains to reassure his new subjects; he would be no hatchet-man, he intimated. In short, it is hard to see what will have changed, beyond the career prospects of a few politicians. Mr Major is still Mr Major, with the same virtues and faults he had 24 hours ago. The government's majority is still 18. A forthcoming by-election may reduce it further. The public sector borrowing requirement is still expected to rise to Pounds 50bn. Proposals for spending cuts will still run into backbench opposition, suggestions that there should be tax increases quickly shot down. Just as President Clinton is wrestling with his own party in Congress, so the phenomenon known as 'gridlock', formerly confined to Washington, may be spreading to Mr Major's government in Britain. He knows what must be done to burst out of it. He needs: a period free of political pratfalls, a run of months of accident-free government, a strong economic recovery and a chancellor well able to spread the good news, a sign of the green shoots of Conservative electoral recovery, and a huge amount of good luck. Without all of that, he is done for.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Cha Man-sun from Vienna] </F>   [Text] Last night, North Korea sent an urgent message to  the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], warning that it  would have no choice but to turn its peaceful nuclear activities  to the next stage if the IAEA refers its nuclear issue to the UN  Security Council or continues to apply pressure.    (Pak Yong-nam), director of North Korea's Atomic Energy  General Department, sent a message to IAEA Director General Hans  Blix last night in which he said it was an unjust act to North  Korea for the IAEA to reach the hasty conclusion that it would  be impossible to analyze samples from nuclear fuel rods because  it was still possible.    It is analyzed that North Korea sent such a message as a  part  of its diplomatic strategy aimed at lessening the pressure on  it. In the event that the IAEA Board of Governors takes a  hard-line measure against North Korea, it seems possible that  North Korea will take some tough measures, including its  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    The IAEA Board of Governors will map out countermeasures  tomorrow afternoon after discussing the issue of North Korea's  violation of the nuclear agreement as an isolated agenda item.</p>

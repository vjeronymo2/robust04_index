			<p>BFN     [Text] A Hizballah information source has said that the  incident that occurred with the UN Interim Force in Lebanon  [UNIFIL] Fijian contingent in the al-Qulaylah area this morning  came about because that contingent fired at a resistance group  without warning. The incident left two resistance men injured,  one of them seriously, and he died soon afterwards.    The source said that it was surprising that the UNIFIL force  in the area was placed on alert afterwards and set up  checkpoints and ambushes in a provocative way. They also fired  at a Hizballah envoy who was going to the UNIFIL checkpoint in  al-Tayyibah to discuss outstanding incidents. He was hit in the  foot and received shrapnel wounds in his face.    Active contacts are under way to address the incident and  its  repercussions.</p>

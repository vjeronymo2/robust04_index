			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: ABB acquires 51% stake in Polish concern ASEA Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swiss-Swedish engineering group, has acquired a 51 per cent stake in Elta, the Polish power transmission company, for Dollars 10.4m. Elta, one of the first companies in Poland's power generation sector to be privatised, manufactures transformers, static converters and electrical equipment for trains. ABB signalled its interest in Elta about two years ago. The Swiss-Swedish group has steadily built up its presence in the Polish market. It has two joint ventures - ABB-Dolmel, in the power generator business, and ABB-Zamech, which makes turbines. ABB's other operations in Poland produce signal equipment, desulphurisation equipment and telecommunications parts. ABB said it would take responsibility for the management of the Elta, which would be consolidated in the ABB group. It plans to modernise the existing production of transformers.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Managua LA PRENSA in Spanish of 23  January 1994 on page 3 reports that leaders of the Independent  Liberal Party for National Unity (PLIUN), the Central American  Unionist Party (PUCA), and the National Justice Party (PJN) held  a press conference on 18 January in order to announce that they  are "joining forces." The parties' communique stated that they  "...seek alternative viable solutions with a view toward  Nicaraguans working together to implement these solutions."  Party leaders invited Nicaraguans to participate in a project  called "Unity for Change" which offers a "credible and  trustworthy" program to create "a new political culture." Party  leaders explained that the country suffers from "a lack of moral  values, discredited political leaders, and the absence of  concrete programs to solve its problems."</p>

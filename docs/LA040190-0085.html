			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SCENE: 'POWER CENTERS' MUSCLE WAY INTO SALES VOLUME;  </P> <P> RETAIL: NEW TYPE OF SHOPPING CENTERS OUTPERFORM SALES OF RETAIL MALLS. THEY ARE  CROPPING UP WHEREVER LAND IS RELATIVELY CHEAP.  </P> <P> We've all heard of power windows, power tools and power lunches. Now, yet  another new concept is about to make its way into our language -- "power  centers."  </P> <P> We're talking about giant "concrete boxes," as their developers call them,  clustered together to create a new type of shopping center -- the power center  -- which rings up four times the sales volume of comparably sized regional  malls.  </P> <P> These new centers have as anchors tenants so-called "category killers" --  national retailers that have emerged to capture a sizable chunk of sales in a  particular category of merchandising.  </P> <P> HomeClub, Home Depot, Costco, Price Club, Circuit City, Toys R Us and  OfficeClub are just a few examples of category killers.  </P> <P> What's more, one of the biggest category killers, Wal-Mart, is about to open  its first California store this summer at the Valley Central power center in  Lancaster. And Wal-Mart plans another 200 stores in California as it embarks on  what competitors say is an invasion of the West Coast.  </P> <P> Power centers are bringing millions of dollars in sales tax revenue to  communities such as Puente Hills, Lancaster, Oxnard and Victorville. Several  others have been proposed in the Inland Empire, Carmel Ranch near San Diego and  south Orange County.  </P> <P> "The power centers are stealing retail business from everyone else," said  developer Malcolm Riley. "Their sales volume is gigantic."  </P> <P> His Brentwood-based company, Riley/Pearlman Co., is completing Valley Central  -- a 75-acre power center anchored by HomeClub and Costco.  </P> <P> While these retailers and their mega-stores may seem less than glamorous, they  cost less to build than a department store, take up less space and they  generate more sales per square foot than just about any traditional May Co.,  Broadway, Bullock's or even Nordstrom store. How do they do it? Discount prices  and volume shoppers.  </P> <P> "They've really revolutionized value buying for the consumer," said development  consultant Larry Kosmont.  </P> <P> Many of these big-box tenants, he reports, generate $300 to $500 a square foot  in annual sales. Some even ring up as much as $1,000 a square foot in sales.  Compare that to department stores in an enclosed mall where $200 a square foot  in annual sales is relatively common.  </P> <P> Category killers are destination tenants with "premeditated customers," said  retail developer and consultant Steven Soboroff of Soboroff/Moskowitz Co. in  Santa Monica.  </P> <P> While the malls continue to draw recreational shoppers, it's the power centers  that attract customers who know what they want, want it fast, and want it  cheap, Soboroff said.  </P> <P> "Category killers are the guys making the loot in retail," he said.  </P> <P> The ingredients to power center success, he added, are lots of outdoor parking,  big signs, freeway access, a good mix of discount retailers and, of course,  cheap land to accommodate these industrial-like centers with tilt-up concrete  structures.  </P> <P> Another important element to success is persuading buyers that they're getting  a bargain.  </P> <P> "So much of retail is psychological -- where you think you're saving money,"  said Thomas R. Ryan, president of Ryan/Kalof Commercial Real Estate Inc. in  Westwood.  </P> <P> And, he warned, "I don't know whether five years from now people will still get  their kick out of shopping at a power center." Novelty and caprice also created  the now-maligned mini-mall, noted Ryan, and as far as power centers are  concerned, "the jury is still out."  </P> <P> "I think they're going to have a tough time," predicted Jack Kyser, chief  economist for the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. "It's my feeling that  these centers may be more hype than reality."  </P> <P> "They're all singing a pretty little song," said Kyser of power center  developers. They still need, however, to prove that they can keep the cash  registers ringing over the long-term, he said.  </P> <P> "There's a myth that regional malls with department store tenants are dead,"  said Kyser.  </P> <P> Yet while retailers suffer through a shakeout typified by the bankruptcy filing  of Campeau Corp., Southern California's regional malls are performing quite  well.  </P> <P> Expansions are planned at malls in Riverside, West Los Angeles and Glendale.  New regional malls are on the drawing boards for Culver City, Fairfax, Porter  Ranch, Rancho Cucamonga, Santa Clarita, Burbank, Santa Barbara, Oxnard and the  Moreno Valley.  </P> <P> Then too, Broadway is expanding into Santa Barbara while May Co. stretches into  Santa Maria and Bakersfield.  </P> <P> All this activity, Kyser said, suggests that traditional retailers plan to give  power tenants and their developers a run for their money.  </P> <P> What many retail merchants and developers have forgotten, said Soboroff, is  that you don't have to be big to be powerful. Small centers too can attract a  national "power tenant." and create a small-scale power center, he said.  </P> <P> Even in these tough times for retailers, Soboroff said, "anybody can create a  powerful shopping center with the right tenant mix." The trouble is, he said,  "most people just don't take the time."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Developments  </P> <P> SDC Development of Newport Beach started construction at Inland Distribution  Center, a 42-acre industrial project in Fontana. The $40-million project  includes five manufacturing/distribution buildings at the southeast corner of  Slover and Etiwanda avenues.  </P> <P> Santa Fe Pacific Realty started construction on the $18-million, two-building  first phase of its new 47-acre industrial park in Fullerton. The distribution  and manufacturing facilities are being built on 13 acres adjacent to Fullerton  Municipal Airport.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Leases  </P> <P> Law firm Cadwalader, Wickersham &amp; Taft signed a $23-million, 15-year lease  with Ahmanson Commercial Development Co. for three floors in the Home Savings  of America Tower at the northeast corner of 7th and Figueroa streets in  downtown Los Angeles. The firm plans to move its Los Angeles office from  California Plaza in September. The firm was represented in lease negotiations  by Reliance Development Group Inc. and Cushman Realty Crop. Ahmanson  represented itself.  </P> <P> Logicon Inc. signed a 12 1/2-year lease for 74,000 square feet at Plaza La  Reina near Los Angeles International Airport for more than $14 million. Julien  J. Studley Inc. represented owners Borstein Enterprises and Metropolitan Life  Insurance in lease transactions. Cushman Realty Corp. and Commercial Industrial  Associates represented Logicon.  </P> <P> Chadbourne &amp; Parke plans to relocate its law offices from 444 S. Flower St.  to the soon-to-be-completed Figueroa at Wilshire building as part of a 10-year  lease for 30,000 square feet, valued at about $10 million. The firm will  initially occupy 20,000 square feet on the 16th floor, with a later expansion  onto the 17th floor scheduled. Owner Mitsui Fudosan (U.S.A.)

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raimundo Lopez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 1 Apr (PL) -- This May, following the  conclusion of a unique process of consultations with the rank  and file of the workers unions, the Cuban parliament will begin  working on solutions to one of the most delicate problems facing  the nation's economy: cleaning up the domestic financial  situation.    The debates will begin on the first of next month, which is  International Labor Day, according to a summons published today  calling for a special session. The Council of State, led by  Cuban President Fidel Castro, issued the summons.    The National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] made  the decision to hold such a meeting at the end of last December,  during its second ordinary session of the year in which the  financial issue was a leading topic.    According to statements by Jose Luis Rodriguez, chairman of  the state committee on financial matters, the country has a  currency surplus of more than 10 billion pesos, equal to the  same amount in dollars, according to the official exchange rate.    The fiscal deficit has reached 4.2 billion pesos while  subsidies for production losses in the agricultural and sugar  sector alone are more than 7 billion pesos.    Rodriguez explained that such a financial imbalance  seriously  hampers the flow of Cuba's economy, which has been severely  battered by the loss of its commercial partners and the  heightened U.S. trade embargo.    Cuban President Fidel Castro and other officials have said  the situation will never be resolved by neoliberal methods,  which have had dramatic social consequences in other nations.    Osvaldo Martinez, chairman of the legislative commission on  economic matters, said the members of his commission are working  with the state financial committee to assess the situation and  compile proposals to solve the complex problems plaguing the  economy.    Martinez told the local media the commission will evaluate  the possible decisions and draft recommendations from there,  which could be used during the debates at the ANPP.    He said the basic criteria used in the analysis begins with  the need to reduce the internal financial imbalance,  specifically the problems of surplus cash and budget deficit.    He added the purpose is to reorganize the domestic economy  in  order to encourage the production of goods and services, recover  salary values, rescue labor discipline, and gradually regain the  purchasing power of the national currency.    Controlling the internal financial imbalance is like  performing vital surgery on a sick patient, our economy, and the  people understand this, he affirmed.    Martinez said the general understanding of the measures  needed to resolve the current financial situation became evident  during the so-called workers parliament, a series of meetings  held by the workers unions from January to March.    During these assemblies, attended by more than 3 million  people, methods of achieving economic efficiency at each center  as well as other general measures were studied.    The leaders of the Central Organization of Cuban Workers  Federation (CTC), along with President Fidel Castro, examined a  summary of the proposals made at these meetings.    Pedro Ross, secretary general of the organization, has said  none of the suggestions will be left unconsidered.</p>

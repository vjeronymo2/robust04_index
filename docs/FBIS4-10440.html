			<p>BFN     [Text] Politburo member Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada,  president of the National Assembly of the People's Government  [ANPP], gave the heroic deed banner to sugar workers of the  Sierra de Cubitas Agroindustrial Complex in Ciego de Avila  Province in recognition of their outstanding work. The sugar  mill was ready to begin operations in just eight days after  intense 18-hour work shifts. The repairs will allow the plant to  overcome the delays of the present harvest.    Alarcon de Quesada also participated in the provincial  analysis of the potato harvest, which will be completed within  hours with the harvest of more than 150,000 quintals of tubers,  despite plant disease infestations.    Ricardo Alarcon and Politburo member Julian Rizo Alvarez,  first secretary of the party in Camaguey, praised combatants of  the 1390 military unit, which became the most productive force  in the current campaign with the collection of 40,000 quintals  of potatoes.    [Begin Alarcon recording] In accomplishing this, you have  carried out one of the orders of the commander in chief and the  minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, which at the moment  is a very important mission for all revolutionary combatants. In  addition, you were able to lead our people because you have  demonstrated the historic (?courage) of our glorious  Revolutionary Armed Forces. [end recording]</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Class I engines are overwhelmingly found in lawnmowers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Class II engines primarily include engines used in generator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sets, garden tractors, and commercial lawn and garden equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only engines used in equipment defined as handheld would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed to meet Class III, IV, or V emission standards. Class  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III includes engines used in consumer handheld products, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small string trimmers, edgers, and brush cutters. Class IV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encompasses engines used in both residential and commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> settings and includes large trimmers, edgers, blowers, and chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saws. Class V includes a majority of engines utilized in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial chain saws.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing five separate engine classes based on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of factors. First, some types of equipment are currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powered exclusively by 2-stroke engines. EPA estimates that as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> much as 90 percent of 2-stroke engines are utilized in handheld  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. These current handheld 2-stroke engines incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a technology which is inherently more polluting than current 4-stroke engine technology and which results in 2-stroke engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiencing a higher concentration of hydrocarbons in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust. EPA's view is that it is not technologically feasible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to apply the nonhandheld Class I and II engine standards to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handheld engines in this Phase 1 rule; therefore the need arises  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Class III, IV, and V handheld engine standards. Differences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in stringency between classes III, IV, and V are due to the fact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that energy-specific emissions generally increase as engine size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decreases. This principle is also true in the case of engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used in nonhandheld applications and meeting emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of either classes I or II. See discussion in the draft RSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the engine classification approach for Phase 1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harmonizes federal small engine regulations with California's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lawn and garden regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, it is EPA's view that the emission standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed today for handheld and nonhandheld engines and reflected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the five engine class categories represent the greatest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction achievable for this Phase 1 rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Handheld Engine Qualifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To qualify as a handheld engine under this proposal, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small SI engine would be required to meet at least one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following three requirements:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carried by the operator throughout the performance of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended function(s). This is meant to encompass such equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as lightweight leafblowers, trimmers (both string and hedge), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must operate multipositionally, such as upside down and sideways,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to complete its intended function(s). EPA intends this category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to include all types of chain saws as well as items already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed in the first requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The engine must be used in a piece of equipment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the combined engine and equipment dry weight is under 14  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kilograms, no more than two wheels are present, and at least one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the following attributes is also present:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The operator must alternately provide support or carry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the equipment throughout the performance of its intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> function(s). This allows lightweight snowblowers that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carried up stairs, or edgers which are picked up and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supported during operation to qualify for handheld status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The operator must provide support or attitudinal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control for the equipment throughout the performance of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended function(s). This attribute will allow equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as lightweight tillers, augers, cutoff/concrete saws,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and edgers to qualify for handheld status.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The engine is used exclusively in a hand-portable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generator or pump.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of this section ``support'' would mean that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator holds the equipment in position so as to prevent it from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falling, slipping, or sinking. It would not be necessary for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entire weight of the equipment to be borne by the operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Attitudinal control'' would mean that the operator regulates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the horizontal or vertical position of the equipment, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both. ``Carry'' would mean that the operator completely bears the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight of the equipment, including the engine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section ``V.G. Definition of Handheld Engines'' provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional discussion on this issue. EPA believes that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed handheld definition adequately covers those categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of engines which should be allowed to meet the less stringent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handheld engine standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests information regarding specific engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applications which are not clearly identifiable as handheld or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonhandheld under the proposed definition. EPA also requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative language which could be incorporated in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition to clarify the distinction between handheld and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonhandheld. EPA is particularly concerned that manufacturers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2-stroke lawnmowers may attempt to qualify for handheld status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilizing the second requirement_multiposition operation. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not EPA's intent that pushing a lawnmower up and down hills would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify as multiposition operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Standards for Classes I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to adopt one of two options under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration for setting standards applicable to Class I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines. EPA requests comments on each of these options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Option 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Phase 1 would adopt a combined HC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for engine classes I and II. While engines in classes I and II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have high HC emission rates, most currently produce extremely low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Due to technological constraints of all small SI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines, HC reductions would generally come at the expense of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . See ``VII. Technology Assessment'' for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion of this phenomenon. However, the resultant overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission inventories would be slight relative to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  produced by sources such as nonroad large CI engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sensitivity of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions to HC control varies greatly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between engine designs. EPA believes that a Phase 1 approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which allows incremental tradeoffs between HC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through a combined standard would be consistent with EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statutory mandate that nonroad engine emission standards reflect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the greatest emission reductions achievable. See ``VII.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technology Assessment'' for further discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To meet the combined standard, a manufacturer would add its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HC emission test result to the NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  test result. This combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number would then be submitted to EPA. Individual levels of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these pollutants would not be established. The manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would also be required to meet this combined level during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator testing and the SEA enforcement program. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that this approach would be workable for a Phase 1 rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Setting separate standards for HC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  would be addressed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's Phase 2 regulatory negotiations. For further discussion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this issue, see ``V. M. HC + NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Standard for Class I, II  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Engines.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

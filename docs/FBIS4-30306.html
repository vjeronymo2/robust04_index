			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- Letters were sent from  Mozambique and Malaysia to the director general of the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] over Japan's  concealment of plutonium.    The Mozambican committee for friendship with the people of  the DPRK in its letter said: "The IAEA is continuously making a  fuss about the `nuclear issue' of Korea while keeping mum about  Japan's concealment of plutonium. This is aimed at stifling  socialist Korea at any cost."    "To destroy socialist Korea where the leader, the party and  the masses are united in one mind is no more than a foolish  dream," said the letter, urging the IAEA to make an issue of  Japan's concealment of plutonium and probe its truth.    The Malaysian action front in its letter said the IAEA  should  strongly urge the U.N. Security Council to take sanctions  against Japan which is continuously stockpiling plutonium in  defiance of world opinion and concern.</p>

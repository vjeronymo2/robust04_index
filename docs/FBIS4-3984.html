			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dispatch by reporter Tseng Hui-yen (2582 1979 3601): "Wang </F> Jiaqi Arrives in New York Smoothly"]    [Text] This newspaper has learned that mainland dissident  Wang Jiaqi, who was helped by a Hong Kong underground rescue  organization called "yellow bird operation" in his flight from  China, has already been granted political asylum by the United  States. After spending some time in London, Wang Jiaji arrived  in New York smoothly on 25 April, as arranged by a human rights  organization, and has since begun a new life.    Wang Jiaqi, 34, was a graduate student of law at Beijing  University before fleeing China. He had worked in Hubei  Province's Tangshan City Public Security Bureau for 11 years,  taking charge of a large quantity of "state secrets." His  escape has allegedly caused a great shock in internal circles on  the mainland, and the Ministry of State Security has already  received an order to investigate the incident and determine the  responsibility of the relevant persons.    On 27 January 1994, Wang Jiaqi joined hands with Yuan  Honghing, a law teacher at Beijing University, and Zhou  Guoqiang, a trade unionist, in releasing an appeal letter signed  by various circles regarding the incident of police beating up  Yan Zhengxue, a deputy to the Jiaojiang City People's Congress  in Zhejiang Province; the letter asked the public security  organs to stop infringements of citizens' rights. A total of  350 persons signed the appeal, including scholars, artists,  reporters, lawyers, workers, cadres, and standing committee  members of a certain provincial people's congress, as well as  pro-democracy activists such as Wang Dan, Liu Xiaobo, and Liu  Nianchun.    In early March, the mainland authorities arrested a number  of  active pro-democracy activists in Beijing and Shanghai, and Wang  Jiaqi was also detained by Beijing; thereafter, he escaped while  being escorted from Beijing to Tangshan, the place of his  registered household.    Hong Kong has often played the role of a refuge when  communist China persecuted dissidents. Particularly at this  sensitive time -- when Sino-British relations have deteriorated  -- Wang Jiaqi's trip to Hong Kong and his travel to the United  States via London will make the already sour bilateral relations  even worse.</p>

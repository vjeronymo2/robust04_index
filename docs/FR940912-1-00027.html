			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Provisions of 40 CFR part 60 require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner or operator to submit certain notifications and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports to the Administrator. Section 60.7(a)(1) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> General Provisions requires a notification of the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction or reconstruction of an affected facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenced; the proposed rule requires that certain general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information regarding the wastewater generated by the source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be submitted with this notification. Section 60.7(a)(3) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the General Provisions requires a notification of the actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date of initial startup of an affected facility; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule requires that the owner or operator provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this notification more detailed information and data on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wastewater streams generated by the affected process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit. This information includes a determination of whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the stream is an affected wastewater stream, the compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach utilized if the stream is being controlled in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the requirements of &sect;60.109(b) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, the identification of the waste management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units receiving or managing each affected wastewater stream,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and certain information on the treatment processes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control devices used to comply with the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 60.7(c) of the General Provisions requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each owner or operator required to install a continuous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring system (CMS) or monitoring device submit an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excess emissions and monitoring systems performance report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and/or a summary report to the Administrator on a quarterly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis when the CMS data are to be used directly for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance determination, as is the case for control devices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this proposed rule. In order to be consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements of the HON, which also regulates this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry, the EPA is exempting the owner or operator from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the quarterly reporting requirement and is requiring only a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> semiannual report in the proposed rule. The semiannual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report will contain information on the excursions or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceedances as determined by the CMS data, performance test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results, and other information on treatment processes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control devices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Impacts of the Proposed NSPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To estimate the impacts of the proposed regulation, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA estimates the quantity of VOC that the affected industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would emit to the atmosphere in the absence of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This estimated quantity serves as a baseline from which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of the rule are measured. Following estimation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the baseline level of emissions, the Agency estimates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction that would occur as a result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternatives for the rule. Studies are then made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to estimate the impacts of the rule on the environment, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economics of the industry and the nation, and on energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption. Collectively, these estimates represent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of the standard. Estimated impacts include emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions, costs, impacts on non-air environmental media,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and energy usage. The impacts presented here are those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to occur in the fifth year after promulgation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the impacts are calculated as an increment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relative to the impacts of the wastewater rules included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HON. Additional details of the impacts analysis can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found in the BID and from documentation developed in support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the HON.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Environmental Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed NSPS, it is estimated that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 68 percent of all new SOCMI chemical production process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units would have wastewater streams that require control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the NSPS but do not require control under the HON. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is further estimated that the total annual emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction achieved by the NSPS in the fifth year would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately 16,200 megagrams per year (Mg/yr) of VOC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the NSPS requires the treatment of wastewater prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to discharge, there would be no negative impacts on water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality. In fact, the impacts of the rule on water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be positive. Impacts of the rule on solid waste are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to be negligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other environmental impacts of the rule are estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be small. Due to the increased energy requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control, emissions of carbon monoxide are estimated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase by about 4 Mg/yr and emissions of nitrogen oxides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are estimated to increase by about 35 Mg/yr. Energy impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed rule include the combustion of fossil fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to generate steam for steam stripping systems. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts are partially offset by the recovery of organics  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the treatment system. Estimated energy impacts of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule in the fifth year consist of an increase of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.6 million kilowatt hours per year (Kw-hr/yr) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electricity usage, an increase in natural gas consumption of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 133 million British thermal units per year (Btu/yr), and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in steam usage of 133 billion Btu/yr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Both prime ministers told President Tudjman about their  impressions after their short visit to Sarajevo and stressed the  need to establish peace as soon as possible as well as mutual  trust between the Croats and the Bosnian Muslims in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Turkey and Pakistan will do their utmost for  this to be achieved.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto particularly stressed that  international borders are inviolable, ethnic cleansing  impermissible, and that the situation must be reestablished as  it was before the war.    Pakistan upholds Croatia's justified demand to have the [UN]  protected zones reintegrated into its state and legal system.  She also said that Bosnia-Herzegovina must preserve its  multicultural and multiethnic character and that the fighting  between the Croats and Bosnian Muslims should end, as she had  also told [Bosnian] Prime Minister Silajdzic during their brief  talks.    Turkish Prime Minister Ciller said Turkey is pressing for  the  urgent establishment of peace in the area, but that only a just  solution can be accepted. Continued hostilities will mean that  the longer they go on the more difficult it will be to reach a  political agreement, and the foundations for the communal life  of Bosnian Muslims and Croats will be seriously threatened.    At the end of their talks President Tudjman said that the  Croats and Bosnian Muslims must reach agreement and he proposed  that both [the Pakistani and the Turkish] prime ministers press  for a summit of all interested countries with the aim of  establishing peace, which Benazir Bhutto and Tansu Ciller  accepted. Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said her country  is ready to host such talks, because the establishment of peace  would be in the interest of the whole of Europe and the world.

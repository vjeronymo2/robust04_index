			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> UP THE COAST;  </P> <P> DANCING;  </P> <P> 'NOVEL' TOLD WITH DANCE TO OPEN  </P> <P> Director/Choreographer Susan Marshall, for whom the Susan Marshall Dance  Company is appropriately named, left the palm trees in New York. Can you  believe it? She actually left the palm trees in New York.  </P> <P> So when she brings her company to UC Santa Barbara next week she will have to  improvise a little.  </P> <P> One of the three works the group will be performing, "Articles of Faith,"  debuted at the World Financial Center in New York a while back, where the  setting is a little different from the one at UCSB's Campbell Hall.  </P> <P> "The stage had 40-foot palm trees coming out of the floor," said Marshall. "So  the work has gone through some changes as we've been on the road without the  palm trees. This is almost like a premiere."  </P> <P> Even without the trees, "Articles of Faith," like all of Marshall's work, is  like a novel told through dance.  </P> <P> "It tells of a community of people, a group that keeps returning to where they  used to be, and there's something evil there," she said. "But there are no  specific characters, not even a plot like in my other works. It's much more  episodic."  </P> <P> The other two works the eight-person company will perform go back to Marshall's  usual format. "Arms" is a duet performed by a man and a woman who move only  their upper bodies and their arms. And an excerpt from "Interior with Seven  Figures" revolves around a mother, a father and two sons and focuses on the  family as a whole, said Marshall. "Our older works have been quite humorous and  light, but this is quite a serious type of program," she said. "It's hard to  find something naturally humorous in dance without forcing it. It has to be  funny without being cartoony or campy."  </P> <P> It's Marshall's way of telling a story that has earned her acclaim over the  past five years. In 1985, the company's first year on tour, the 30-year-old  Marshall was awarded the New York Dance and Performance Award for Outstanding  Choreographic Achievement, and in 1987 she received the American Choreographer  Award. Last year she won the Brandeis University Creative Arts Citation in  Dance.  </P> <P> "In some ways the recognition makes it easier to work," she said. "It's a  safety net. People will put up with you longer, even if you're not doing  something they like. You're not going to lose all your funding and bookings in  one year. Although we don't live in luxury by any means, we are getting  funding."  </P> <P> While Marshall and Company is more used to performing at international  festivals, the visit to UCSB is just one stop in what Marshall says is the  group's longest campus tour to date.  </P> <P> So far, she said, audience reaction has been great. Maybe that's because her  work can be enjoyed by the dance aficionado and novice alike.  </P> <P> "We use a lot of gestures, everyday movement with dramatic qualities," she  said. "Some of the audience who understand our work most simply and directly  are elementary school students. Hopefully there's a level of our work that's  accessible."  </P> <P>  Marshall and Company will perform April 17 at 8 p.m. Tickets are $15, $13 and  $11 (general admission) and $13, $11, $9 (students). Marshall will be on campus  a day earlier to give a free public lecture-demonstration at 4 p.m. in Campbell  Hall.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BIG BIRTHDAY PLANS  </P> <P> The city of Santa Barbara will be 208 years old April 21, and residents are  marking the occasion in a really big way beginning April 18:  </P> <P> * For starters, the third annual Presidio Days will kick off with arts and  crafts demonstrations -- from candle-making to leather tanning to wool dyeing  to metalworking -- from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. April 18, continuing through April  22. There will also be multicultural dance and music performances throughout  the five-day celebration.  </P> <P> * The city's official birthday party, complete with birthday cake, will be held  April 21 at noon. The Spanish Naval Band will attend. All events will take  place in and around El Presidio de Santa Barbara State Historic Park, 123 Canon  Perdido Place. For information on events and times, call 965-0093.  </P> <P> * A concert by Bo Diddley on April 19 will highlight the second annual Santa  Barbara Fair and Expo sponsored by the 19th District Agricultural Assn. It will  run April 18 to 22. Diddley may know how to play guitar, but he's leaving the  drums to the Trinidad Calypso Steel Drum Band, one of the musical acts that  will perform at the fair. For added entertainment, Butler Amusements will again  provide a carnival midway.  </P> <P> There will be a gaggle of commercial and competitive exhibits in livestock,  poultry, floriculture and horticulture, in addition to arts and crafts,  photography and fine arts. A Junior Livestock Auction will be held April 22  beginning at 1 p.m. All animals are raised by 4-H and Future Farmers of America  members.  </P> <P> Oh, and keep an eye out for those swift swine, Hedrick's Racing Pigs from  Kansas.  </P> <P> "The pigs are dressed in different-colored satins and they race down a track,"  said fair publicist Linda Mears. "They race for Fig Newtons, and people stand  around and cheer. They're billed as the fastest pigs in North America."  </P> <P> Admission is $3 adults, $2 seniors citizens, $1 children 6 to 12). Children 5  and younger are admitted free. For information, call 687-0766.  </P></p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Ombudsman faces battle DISCORD between the insurance companies and Dr Julian Farrand, the ombudsman they sponsor - voluntarily - is expected to increase on Tuesday when he releases his latest annual report. For the first time in the 12 years of the scheme, the report has not been submitted for comment, and possible amendment, to the board of insurance company delegates which determines financing of the ombudsman's bureau. Farrand said this week he had dispensed with this consultation, and had also given the council of consumer representatives less time to mull over the draft, so that publication could be brought forward by about a month. He declined to discuss the contents but the publication notice from the bureau sets out particular issues examined, with 'Questions over his Jurisdiction' heading the list. Almost certainly, this relates partly to a dispute over Farrand's authority to handle complaints about home income plans. Last year, bureau spokesman Peter Tyldesley revealed that one insurance company had rejected Farrand's matter-of-form request for permission to review a home income plan case. Tyldesley said at the time that this would not stop the ombudsman dealing with it. Since the new year, however, lawyers engaged on home income plan cases say a company has sought counsel's opinion on whether the ombudsman has the power to deal with these. The company is now believed to be thinking of sueing him, having apparently received backing from counsel for its view that the ombudsman has no jurisdiction over mortgages and, therefore, none over the mortgage/investment bond package making up a home income plan. While the ombudsman is on record as conceding that he has no jurisdiction over mortgages, he has always maintained that if the tied agent of an insurance company is selling an investment closely wrapped up with a mortgage, the company should be responsible for all of it. This is not the first time Farrand has clashed with companies. In an article written last year for the insurance trade publication Post Magazine, he quoted extracts from letters written by sore losers. One unnamed company accused him repeatedly of unfairness, writing: 'I have received your letter of . . . I will not thank you for this as it merely reinforces my view that you seem determined to treat us unfairly on this case . . .' Coinciding with this latest probable conflict between Farrand and at least one member company is a change in the chairmanship of the board of insurance company delegates. Tom Roberts, who retired from General Accident at the end of 1992, will continue as chairman until June. But the person originally identified as his successor has withdrawn, according to board secretary Michael Briggs. Briggs said that the candidate's withdrawal was due to an unexpectedly heavy workload, and stressed there was no question of any potential conflict with the ombudsman. He added that possible disputes between a company and the ombudsman would not affect considerations on who should become chairman. 'It would be the person who would be nominated, not the company,' he said.</p>

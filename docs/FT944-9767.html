			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Markets: Confusion lies with statistics - Economics Notebook Globalisation is one of the buzzwords of the 1990s. But although it is bringing profound changes to national economies, the way companies conduct their business and the world of work, nobody seems to know how to measure it. What constitutes globalisation is fairly clear. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says it is a widening and deepening of companies' operations across borders to produce and sell goods and services in more markets. Globalisation's most dynamic element since the mid-1980s has been foreign investment, although it can also take the form of trade and collaboration for purposes such as product development, production and sourcing. However, the way these activities translate into pounds and pence or dollars and cents is unclear, largely because of gaps in the statistics. Among the problems: recorded flows fail to include direct investment financed through capital markets in the host country or from other sources that do not pass through the country of the original investor; not all countries have adopted OECD guidelines setting 10 per cent ownership as the minimum for an investment to be counted as foreign direct investment as opposed to portfolio investment; less than transparent ownership structures mean some companies which are foreign controlled may be categorised as domestic owned; once past the flows, there are difficulties with data on stocks of foreign investment because these are usually based on the historical value of an investment and not updated at market prices. This list implies that the total value of foreign direct investment and hence the scale of globalisation has been underestimated. Current statistical methods almost certainly fail to reflect how globalisation is changing the nature of the world economy. Foreign affiliates are frequently, if not always, established to preserve or expand exports. They therefore boost the parent company's and country's international competitiveness. For this reason, Ms DeAnne Julius, chief economist at British Airways, has suggested that their activities should be taken into account with more traditional trade figures. The US is about the only country to have suitable statistics with which to begin this exercise. But the accompanying table, based on a US Commerce Department study, suggests that it is fraught with difficulty. The traditional balance of payments-based measure of US cross-border trade in goods and services showed a deficit of Dollars 28bn in 1991. Although this was smaller than many recent deficits, it was still redolent of relative economic decline. The picture changes significantly, however, if sales of US affiliates in their country of location are included. All alternative measures produce surpluses, suggesting that the US is a rather more potent contributor to world trade than statistics say. But the table also shows how the estimates vary greatly: net US surpluses range from Dollars 24bn to Dollars 164bn while the numbers for sales and purchases differ even more. Clearly, there is no neat statistical way of pinning down globalisation. The OECD has a small team under Mr Thomas Hatzichronoglou of its science, technology and industry directorate which is trying to make sense of such confusion. Its recent first study* of foreign affiliates in 15 OECD countries focused on the effect of foreign investment on employment, productivity, research, technology and trade in host countries. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the team's findings were overwhelmingly positive. The survey found that overall the foreign affiliates added to employment and paid higher wages than domestic companies. Although research and development as a share of turnover and production tended to be lower than in home grown companies, it was growing. Moreover, foreign investors frequently introduced 'best practices' in terms of industrial skills, management methods and new technologies that spread rapidly through the host economy. Potentially more controversial is the impact of foreign investment on the country where the investment originates. The table below suggests that the country of origin may gain in terms of the competitiveness of its companies. However, this must be weighed against the likely impact on employment of locating production abroad and the political storms and protectionist pressures that such investments can unleash. The OECD has only three people working in this area and their next survey, which will probably be on the effect of globalisation on investing economies, could take two years to appear. Globalisation is therefore an area in which the OECD could usefully consider investing some resources of its own - if it can take its mind off the still unresolved issue of who should have the organisation's top job. *The performance of Foreign Affiliates in OECD Countries, OECD Publications, 2 rue Andre-Pascal, 75775 Paris Cedex 16.

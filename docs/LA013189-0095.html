			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMPLOYERS' COST FOR HEALTH-CARE PLANS RISES SHARPLY  </P> <P> The cost of employer-sponsored health-care plans leaped 18.6% per worker last  year after two years of single-digit increases, according to a survey released  Monday.  </P> <P> Employers ran out of fresh ways to keep a lid on health costs after managing to  limit their rise to 7.7% in 1986 and 7.9% in 1987, according to A. Foster  Higgins &amp; Co., which conducted the survey.  </P> <P> "The providers of care have gotten wise to some of the tricks and are  compensating for it," John Erb, the managing consultant who conducted the  survey for the New York-based benefits consulting firm, said in an interview.  </P> <P> The average cost per employee of health care plans was $2,354 in 1988, up from  $1,985 in 1987, according to the survey of more than 1,600 employers, whose  plans cover 10 million workers and dependents.  </P> <P> The figures include the cost of plans to both employers and employees.  </P> <P> The medical-care component of the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index rose  6.9% last year, making it the fastest-growing part of the inflation measure.  But the cost of services is only part of the problem for employers and  employees, Erb said.  </P> <P> According to Erb, these were some of the factors in last year's big jump:  </P> <P> * Doctors are getting around controls on their hospital fees by shifting more  work to an outpatient basis, where there are no restrictions on the fees they  can charge.  </P> <P> * Doctors are requiring more follow-up visits, some of which may not be  medically necessary.  </P> <P> * Expensive medical services such as heart and liver transplants are becoming  more widely available, so more people are using them.  </P> <P> * The federal and state governments, strapped for money, are holding down how  much they pay health-care providers for Medicare and Medicaid patients. That  forces the providers to raise their prices to other customers.  </P> <P> "Not only is double-digit inflation back in health plans, there doesn't appear  to be much relief in sight," Erb said in a written statement.  </P> <P> John J. Ring, chairman of the American Medical Assn., said in response that he  did not see any evidence that doctors were reaping big fee increases from the  shift to outpatient care.  </P> <P> Ring, a family physician in Mundelein, Ill., also said he would like to see  statistics backing up Erb's claim that doctors were requiring medically  unnecessary follow-up visits. Erb said he did not have such statistics.  </P> <P> The 1988 increase was smallest, 15.6%, for companies with fewer than 1,000  employees, which usually pay for their plans through insurers.  </P></p>

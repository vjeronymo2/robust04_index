			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Poland's premier presented Parliament with a bill that would normalize  relations between the Communist state and the Roman Catholic Church and  guarantee the church autonomy. Proclaiming the start of a "new era," Premier  Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski introduced the measure in a speech to the 460-member  Parliament. The legislation was agreed to by church negotiators earlier this  month. Passage, expected next month, will clear the way to establishing  diplomatic relations between the Polish government and the Vatican. The Vatican  has for years refused to grant relations until the local church's status is  resolved.  </P></p>

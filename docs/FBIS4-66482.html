Confidence that Near Field Is Adequate </H5>   In a document entitled ``state of progress on HLW geologic  disposal R&amp;D,'' which was issued in July 1993, JAEC judged  that  R&amp;D had proceeded appropriately and steadily and was  adequate at  this stage, and listed the following as future topics for  geologic disposal R&amp;D:  <H5>  (1) Investigative Research on Geological Environment </H5> Conditions    a. From the viewpoint of geologic disposal, give further  emphasis to geological environment conditions which are  important in ensuring long-term safety; and provide more highly  reliable data concerning the deep underground region and improve  and develop investigative technology and equipment to accomplish  this.    b. Further investigate and evaluate the effects of natural  phenomena on the multiple barrier system. c. Develop  evaluation methods and technology for region-specific natural  phenomena. d. Study the effects on the geological  environment of large-scale human activities.  <H5>  (2) Disposal Technology R&amp;D </H5>   a. Put emphasis on developing a more reliable artificial  barrier.b. Study new materials for overpacking and  buffer.c. Carry out large-scale testing of execution  methods.d. Improve technologies for comprehensive analysis,  investigation and execution of design, construction and  operation of the disposal site.e. Conduct tests based on  hypothesized situations that are even greater threats to safety  and study long-term safety of mine passageways and other  cavities.  <H5>  (3) Performance Evaluation Research </H5>   a. Improve near field performance evaluation and multiple  barrier system reliability.b. Improve and develop analytical  models and methods and confirm their adequacy; and ensure  reliability of data.c. Expand the database.d. Carry out  natural analog research.  <H5>  (4) Common Research Topics and Future Procedures </H5>   a. To achieve more reliable research results, enhance  research facilities and equipment and train personnel.b. The  deep strata research facility is an important and useful  facility that will serve as a common research base.c. Conduct  an evaluative study of research policies through the national  assessment of PNC's second compilation of research results.d.  Activate relevant private sector technological capability and  cooperation from various institutions and universities.e.  Efficiently promote international cooperation.    Future R&amp;D will develop in accordance with the above  listed  topics and philosophy set forth by JAEC.    PNC plans to issue the second compilation before the year  2000. It is to cover crystalline rock and sedimentary rock  without specifying regions or rock varieties, with the goal of  quantifying near field functions (including quantification of  the artificial barrier) and a summary evaluation of far field  functions.    This is because, as stated in an earlier section, it is  clearly important that substantial prevention of movement of  nuclides can be expected in the natural barrier that surrounds  and is a short distance (several tens of meters) from the  artificial barrier.    Functions of the near field can be clarified further through  the results of laboratory tests and on-site tests. The next  section summarizes the tests that will be carried out as part of  this.  <H5>  2. Research Provides Scientific Verification </H5>   A new research facility for further advancement of geologic  disposal R&amp;D has been built at PNC's Tokai Works. This is the  ``geologic disposal basic research facility,'' an above-ground  facility where research will be conducted on the technological  base of geologic disposal, which includes consolidation of the  results achieved through PNC's geologic disposal R&amp;D.    The following is a summary of the research plan.  <H5>  (1) Research Facility Goals and Features </H5>   The goal of research at this facility is to focus on the  ground water influencing process, one of the variety of  hypothetical influencing processes in geologic disposal, and to  analyze and evaluate the behavior of the multiple barrier system  vis-a-vis ground water. (Photograph 3 [omitted] shows the  building exterior.)    The facility's features are as follows:a. It is a cold  facility that does not use radioactive substances.b. It has  atmosphere control equipment.c. Tests ranging from basic  tests to large-scale tests can be conducted.d. Various types  of phenomena can be simulated.  <H5>  (2) Research Facility Outline </H5>   The facility is composed of a research building with four  floors above ground and a test building with one floor above  ground. The research building is equipped with analytical  research equipment for computer simulations, etc., and equipment  for quantitative analyses. The equipment in the test building  can be divided into two main categories. The first can be called  equipment to test changes in the near field chemical  environment. It is composed of two testing devices that collect  data on chemical action in the ground water and artificial  barrier under conditions in the deep underground environment.  The other can be called equipment to test near field composite  phenomena. It is composed of four testing devices that are used  to conduct research on ground water flow under conditions in the  deep underground environment and research on composite phenomena  of simultaneous action of ground pressure and heat from the  waste. (Photograph 4 [omitted] and Table 9 are summaries of the  test equipment.)

The following is an outline of the facility's composition  and  specifications:    (a) Research Building     -  Structure: ferro-concrete    -  Floors: four above ground    -  Building Area: about 1,350 square meters    -  Total Floor Area: about 4,500 square meters    -  Structure by Floor:First Floor: quantitative analysis  areaSecond Floor: basic properties assessment/researchers  areaThird Floor: computers, data area;researchers  areaFourth Floor: simulation area     (b) Test Building     -  Structure: steel frame    -  Floors: one above ground    -  Building Area: about 1,500 square meters     The research facility was completed in August 1993, and  full-scale research activity began in October. As the central  facility for strata R&amp;D in the future, substantial results  are  expected.  <H5>  3. Accumulation of Deep Strata Data </H5>   PNC is conducting a variety of tests, using existing  cavities, to accumulate data on deep strata. The following are  the primary goals:a. Acquire data concerning the geological  characteristics of the deep underground region.b. Gain  understanding of deep underground region phenomena and establish  methods for creating models for these phenomena.c. Improve  and establish survey testing technology (survey testing methods,  survey measuring equipment, etc.).    At this point, we will introduce the content of the strata  scientific research being conducted by PNC at a mine in Kamaishi  and the Chubu Works.  <H5>  3.1 On-Site Testing at Kamaishi Mine </H5>   On-site testing at the mine in Kamaishi is being conducted  on  the Kurihashi granodiorite fissured base rock, mainly using a  250 m level passageway (600 m below ground level), to gain an  understanding of geological features and depth dependency of  phenomena, to get a detailed grasp of the characteristics and  mechanism of formation of the so-called slack zone around the  passageway, and to confirm the appropriateness of existing  survey technology. With the above as the focus, the research is  being carried out on the five items described below.  <H5>  (1) Understanding Dynamic, Hydraulic, Geochemical Features </H5> and Geological Structure of Base Rock in Deep Region    Gain an understanding of deep region geological features in  crystalline rock and acquire the following basic information  concerning the conditions of the test site that are required in  order to analyze the results from carrying out (2) through (5)  below:    (a) geological structure surrounding the on-site testing  location (Photograph 5 [omitted]);    (b) by-depth dynamic characteristics of deep region base  rock;    (c) by-depth hydraulic characteristics and geochemical  characteristics of deep region base rock, and changes in these  characteristics over time.  <H5>  (2) Evaluation of Region Affected by Excavation in Deep </H5> Region Base Rock    Create a model of the excavation effect mechanism and gain  an  understanding of the three-dimensional distribution of the  region affected by boring a new passageway and measuring and  assessing its effect (slack zone) on the base rock.  <H5>  (3) Research Concerning Hydraulic/Substance Movement in </H5> Single Fracture in Crystalline Rock    Proceed with research on the following items to understand  the retardation of substance movement in a single fracture, the  basic unit of the movement path. This is the first thing that  needs to be understood to evaluate substance movement in  crystalline rock.     -  Establish geological and geochemical investigative methods  to understand substance movement in fractures.    -  Understand substance movement retardation in fractures  through  laboratory and on-site testing.    -  Confirm adequacy of existing models as regards substance  movement in fractures.     To evaluate substance movement by ground water in  crystalline  rock, it is also important to understand substance movement  characteristics that prescribe dispersion and transport by  water, such as fissure structure and porosity of the fissured  medium. Conducting hydraulic tests and non-adsorptiveness tracer  tests on a rock formation of a fixed scale at the Kamaishi  on-site test location will provide an understanding of substance  movement characteristics, such as fissure structure and porosity  of the fissured medium, of the site of the substance movement by  ground water.  <H5>  (4) Artificial Barrier Testing </H5>   a. Testing of application of grouting technology on the  fracture zone:    To contribute to the assessment of stability and  waterproofing effect of clay-based grout, clarify the long-term  stability of grout and the relationship between width and other  characteristics of fissure shape and processing conditions  (injection pressure, viscosity) on the one hand and grout  stability, waterproofing effect and depth of grout immersion on  the other.    b. Testing of clay filling in base rock:    Gain knowledge on the following items to contribute to  understanding bentonite swelling, change in water content and  heterogeneity due to penetration by ground water through  fractures in the on-site base rock:     -  Heat conductivity of clay and base rock.    -  Effect of pressure from clay swelling on surrounding base  rock.   <H5>  (5) Earthquake Testing and Research </H5>   Observe earthquake motion in the Kamaishi mine to accumulate  knowledge concerning diminution of earthquake motion  underground, and along with this, develop methods to create a  model to simulate earthquake motion. Through model analysis,  predict the behavior of underground cavities during earthquakes  and assess their aseismatic capacity. Monitor hydraulic  characteristics and changes in water quality during earthquakes  and apply this to prediction of changes in hydraulic conditions  and geochemical environment. The four items below are the  specific goals:    a. Generalize and create formulas for rate of diminution  underground of earthquake motionb. Build optimum model that  simulates earthquake motion in deep underground regionsc.  Confirm through simulation the stability of underground cavities  during earthquakesd. Confirm whether earthquakes cause  changes in underground water pressure, quality or amount of  gushing, and study the change mechanisms.  <H5>  3.2 Chubu Works </H5>   Investigative testing and research at the Chubu Works is  being conducted in the Tono uranium mine and the surrounding  region. This region is composed of sedimentary rock covering  granite rock. Research on the four items given below will be  conducted in two phases (first phase: through FY96; second  phase: FY97-2003).  <H5>  (1) Base Rock Dynamic, Heat Characteristics Research </H5>   The goal of this research is to study heterogeneous  sedimentary base rock and grasp the dynamic characteristics of  this base rock between the surface and the deep regions, and to  establish methods to quantify and evaluate the effects of  excavation and long-term reaction to it.    The first phase will consist of the following:    (a) Using a survey passageway in the Tono mine, study  mechanical and smooth blasting excavation methods and the  difference in their effects.    (b) In the survey passageway, conduct tests on the effects  of  excavation, consisting of excavating a passage that intersects a  fault, and study the effects of a large-scale, non-continuous  surface.    (c) Develop survey methods that can quantify the physical  properties of base rock within a slack zone.    (d) Observe long-term displacement in base rock and acquire  data necessary to grasp long-term base rock behavior.    (e) Study the applicability of existing analytical methods.    The second phase will consist of the following:    (a) Based on the measurements acquired in the first phase,  conduct base rock behavior analysis and create a model; and  modify and improve analytical methods.    (b) Validate these modeling and analytical methods by  application to different base rock conditions.    (c) Based on long-term observation data accumulated in the  first phase, modify models for long-term behavior prediction.  <H5>  (2) Research on Flow of Ground Water in Deep Underground </H5> Region    The goal of this research is to develop rational  investigative technologies and evaluation methods to apply to  the hydraulic environment between the surface and the deep  underground region of a given location.    In the area surrounding the Tono mine, the following will be  carried out:    (a) Conduct hydraulic surveys in surface strata, mid-strata  (sedimentary rock) and deep strata (granite bedrock); and ground  water flow analysis based on the results of these surveys.    (b) Verify ground water flow model for this region.    (c) Develop ground water survey equipment usable at a depth  of 1,000 meters, which is needed to investigate the  characteristics of deep region ground water (Photograph 6  [omitted]).    (d) Optimize the hydraulic survey and analysis system and  define the scope of evaluation.    (e) Establish technology for rational investigation of  hydraulic characteristics between the ground surface and deep  regions, over a broad area.  <H5>  (3) Research on Geochemical Characteristics of Ground Water </H5> in Deep Region    The goal of this research is to grasp the geochemical  characteristics of ground water in the deep region and water  formation mechanisms, and to establish geochemical models for  prediction and evaluation of future changes.    In the first phase, a 8km x 7km area will be used to (a)  grasp the geochemical characteristics of ground water and  analyze its formation mechanism; and (b) develop investigative  technologies and equipment for geochemical model building and  establish evaluation methods.  <H5>  (4) Research on Substance Movement and Settlement in </H5> Geological Environment    The goal of this research is to grasp the mechanisms of  substance movement and settlement in the geological environment,  establish substance movement models for grasping future changes,  and establish technologies for rational investigation of  substance movement and settlement in the geological environment.    In the first phase, laboratory and on-site testing will be  used to grasp the characteristics of the microscopic (mineral  scale to outcrop scale) geological medium (path of movement)  that regulate substance movement and the mechanism and process  of substance settlement.    Investigation of geological medium characteristics (movement  path) will include (a) extraction of composition and structure  of rock that could be the movement path in sedimentary rock; (b)  building of conceptual model for movement path in the  microscopic scale; and (c) grasping of matrix diffusion and  other mechanisms of movement and settlement, or settlement  alone. To accomplish this, substance movement testing under  atmospheric control will be conducted to (a) grasp the behavior  of substances at the border between solid and liquid, (b) reveal  substance sorption and settlement mechanisms, and (c) carry out  sorption/desorption tests using natural rack and ground water.    Based on results from these tests, (a) a model of the  structure of the movement path and a model of chemical reactions  on the path will be built and (b) to validate these models, the  distribution of uranium and uranium series nuclides in the  geological environment will be inspected and analyzed.    In the second phase, the following will be carried out: (a)  Comprehensive evaluation of the mechanisms of substance movement  and settlement in the macroscopic (ore deposit scale) geological  environment; and (b) provision and analysis of historical data  (concerning geographical and hydraulic changes in the past) and  ore deposit science data in order to verify macroscopic  substance movement and settlement mechanisms.  <H5>  4. International Cooperation </H5>   Various forms of research have been conducted in other  countries concerning the effectiveness of the multiple barrier  system in geologic disposal, and they include some in which  Japan has participated as joint international undertakings.    International cooperation is important for (a) sharing of  the  principle of safety, (b) improving the reliability of technology  and evaluation methods, and (c) efficient use of facilities and  increasing of data.    Here we will present a summary of the contents of  international co-research concerning HLW geologic disposal and  underground strata science and technology, which PNC is carrying  out at present.  <H5>  (1) United States </H5>   From 1993 to 1996, under a technical cooperation agreement  with the Department of Energy (DOE), PNC and the Lawrence  Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) are developing a model for substance  movement in heterogeneous media that takes into consideration  effect of scale and fault structure, with the goal of a  composite revelation of radionuclide movement in underground  strata.  <H5>  (2) Canada </H5>   Since 1986, at the Whiteshell [phonetic spelling]  underground  research facility of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL), PNC  has been conducting on-site tracer tests using multiple sample  gimlet holes, with the goal of developing and establishing  methods for investigation and analysis of hydraulic and nuclide  movement characteristics covering the shatter zone in  crystalline rock.  <H5>  (3) Switzerland </H5>   Since 1989, joint on-site testing is being carried out at  the  Grimzel [phonetic spelling] base rock research center of the  radioactive waste disposal national cooperative (NAGRA) with the  goal of revealing the hydraulics of ground water in a single  fissure in crystalline rock, and developing methods for  evaluation of radionuclide movement and developing a nuclide  movement model. The results of this research will be reflected  in verification of the Japanese model and on-site testing of  crystalline rock in Japan.    Also, in view of the geologic disposal concept shared by  Japan and Switzerland, the two countries are exchanging  information and are evaluating each other's research.  <H5>  (4) Sweden </H5>   From 1991 to 1994, PNC is participating in a project at the  underground research facility (HRL) of Sweden's nuclear fuel  waste control company (SKB), and has carried out a variety of  on-site testing of crystalline rock. The goal of the project is  to develop technology to grasp with precision the geologic  environment of the deep underground region, which will be the  geologic disposal site, and develop methods to predict changes  to the geological environment caused by excavation.    Along with construction of the underground research  facility,  whose main feature is a slanting shaft extending from the  surface to 500 meters underground, the on-site testing will be  carried out in stages in each area --geological, ground water  hydraulic and ground water geochemical tests -- with the goal of  developing and establishing methods to grasp (predict) the  geological environment through a repetition of the process of:  Prediction -assessment of predicted results - method  modification.  <H5>  (5) France </H5>   Since 1991, PNC has been participating in information  exchange and joint research, mainly on the theme of the  geochemistry of radionuclides, at the Fontenay-au-Rose [phonetic  spelling] research institute of the Atomic Energy Agency of  France (CEA).  <H5>  (6) Great Britain </H5>   Since 1993, PNC has been conducting joint research with AEA  Technology (AEA), focusing on development and modification of a  database on thermodynamics and acquisition of data concerning  adsorption mechanisms at the Harwell [phonetic spelling]  Research Institute, and information exchange.  <H5>  (7) OECD/NEA and Other Joint International Projects </H5>   Thus far, PNC has participated in a project at Sweden's  Stripa [phonetic spelling] mine with the goal of developing  geological environment evaluation technology and methods,  verifying the applicability of ground water flowpath hermetic  sealing technology and other disposal technologies, and  conducting comparative studies of ground water flow assessment  models; and in the alligator river analog project, which was  implemented in Australia's Kungalaulan [phonetic spelling] ore  deposit with the goal of elucidating the mechanisms of nuclide  behavior in a geological environment. PNC also is participating  in INTRAVAL, with the goal of validating nuclide movement  models, and in DECOVALEX (secretariat run by SKI of Sweden),  with the goal of developing and validating a heat-water-stress  compound model.    Hereafter, for the reasons given earlier, it will become  increasingly important for Japan to take a leadership role in  international cooperation projects.

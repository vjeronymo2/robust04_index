"I am not ambitious to serve as president for life," the  president said in a dialog with members of National Youth  Committee (KNPI). He said that the People's Consultative  Assembly (MPR) must be able to find a new president.    During the dialogue, a KNPI member requested that the head  of  state be ready to serve another five year term after his current  presidential tenure expires in 1998. In response to the  proposal, the president said: "Please count how old I am at that  time (he was born in 1921 ed.) this must be taken into account."  He said that the law of the nature must be considered, referring  to the decreasing ability of a person due to old age. "God will  provide guidance. Moreover, children today are clever," the  head of state said.    When another KNPI member suggested that the president  prepare  a "crown" in order to keep the state policies unchanged even if  there is a change in the state leadership, Suharto said that it  would not happen as long as the MPR decrees are implemented well.    On the occasion the president reiterated that he would not  step down before the completion of his constitutional tenure in  1998.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Prodi may stay on as interim Iri chairman The resignation of Mr Romano Prodi as chairman of Iri, the Italian state holding company, has given the Berlusconi government a free hand to reshape and accelerate privatisation policy. Mr Prodi resigned on Tuesday after the Iri board had approved 1993 results which showed losses had more than doubled to L10,230bn (Dollars 6.4bn). Yesterday the four other members of the board announced their resignations. The government has yet to accept the resignations. Mr Prodi indicated yesterday he would not change his mind. Iri has debts of L75,000bn, almost 5 per cent of GDP. 'I returned to Iri to deal with its finances and impose a restructuring plan with a view to privatisation. Now it is the time, after the presentation of the annual accounts, to hand over matters to the new government,' Mr Prodi said yesterday. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, commenting on the resignation yesterday said: 'This is a problem which we still have to work on.' This suggests that Mr Prodi will stay on in an interim capacity until the June 30 shareholders meeting before formally stepping down. This would enable him to approve the privatisation of Ilva's special steel operations. Iri became a public company with the treasury as the single shareholder in August 1992. At present the government appears inclined to appoint a new chairman whose basic task will be to act as a kind of 'liquidator'. The chairman would sell off or re-distribute all worthwhile assets while the remainder would be gradually liquidated. The procedure could be similar to that applied to Efim, the industrial holding company placed in liquidation in July 1992. However, government officials insist if such a procedure were adopted, they would seek to avoid the mistakes of Efim - in particular antagonising foreign creditors.</p>

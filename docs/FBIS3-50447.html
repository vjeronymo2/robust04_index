			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Crowning months of secret negotiations  and reciprocal visits, in early December Brazil and Russia  signed a broad trade agreement designed to boost their annual  trade from $200 million to $2 billion within a five-year period.  The agreement includes cooperation in aerospace research, mutual  technology transfer of military materiel, joint ventures in oil  production and construction, and other transactions.    Brazil and Russia signed a trade agreement on 3 December to  increase their annual trade from $200 million to $2 billion over  the next five years, military correspondent William Waack  reported in the 4 December conservative daily O ESTADO DE SAO  PAULO. During his official visit to Russia from 1 to 3 December,  Brazilian Minister of Industry, Commerce, and Tourism Jose  Eduardo de Andrade Vieira and Russian Foreign Economic Relations  Minister Oleg Davydov discussed the possibilities of space  research, transfer of supersonic airplane technology, and  exports of Brazilian foodstuffs. Waack noted, however, that  everything still hinges on an interbanking agreement that has  not even been initiated.    During his Moscow trip, Waack continued, Vieira also visited  the Moscow Space Center and was again told by the Russians that  they would like to use the Alcantara launch site in Maranhao  State for the international Iridium project. Vieira spoke  favorably of the project, which envisages placing roughly 60  communication satellites in orbit within the next two years, and  said that he would present it to Brazilian President Franco.  Moscow's independent, business-oriented KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4  December, however, said that plans for Russian participation in  the project were being developed "at Brazil's suggestion." The  Moscow state-run news agency ITAR- TASS on 3 December also  quoted Vieira as saying that he had met earlier in the day with  Russian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin to discuss  Brazil's participation in the international Iridium space  communications project involving the use of Russian Proton  booster rockets. Brazil's O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO of 4 December  cited diplomats familiar with this issue saying that "the main  obstacle" to this project would soon be removed: The Brazilian  government is now "willing" to join the Missile Technology  Control Regime soon, accepting "an international code of conduct  that does not allow the transfer of the technology for building  and operating missiles to third parties."  <H5>  Arms and Aerospace </H5>   KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 December noted that "Russia has long  been mulling over plans for an outlet to the Latin American arms  market. Brazil may become a good springboard for the products of  the Russian aerospace complex. In Moscow, the Brazilian side  once again expressed interest in joint development of inertial  guidance systems for space-launch vehicles."    O ESTADO of 4 December reported that the Monteiro Aranha  Group has been negotiating for 18 months with the Russians to  purchase defense materiel to assemble Russian MiG-29 supersonic  fighters at the Brazilian Aeronautics Company (Embraer)  facilities, as well as to buy ships and helicopters. The source  quoted one of Vieira's advisers to the effect that the Monteiro  Aranha Group "sought a fait accompli so the Armed Forces would  have to approve these deals." Moscow's ITAR-TASS and official  military newspaper KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, as well as various Brazilian  dailies, speculated extensively during September on the ongoing  negotiations between the two countries over possible swaps of  Russian war materiel for Brazilian foodstuffs. Rio de Janeiro  daily JORNAL DO BRASIL on 1 December, however, noted that  Frederico Robalinho, trade policy secretary of the Brazilian  Ministry of Industry and Commerce, has denied knowing anything  about reported Brazilian government purchases of Russian arms.  According to JORNAL, reports of possible exchanges of Russian  arms for Brazilian food products began circulating in September  when Brazilian Army Minister Zenildo Zoroastro de Lucena visited  Russia. Robalinho, however, commented only that Brazil is  interested in the purchase of helicopters such as the MI-26,  spare parts and maintenance of military equipment, as well as a  nonmilitary ship to replace the "Barao de Tefe" in the  Antarctic. Robalinho, JORNAL added, described this negotiation  as "historic" because Brazil and Russia are for the first time  carrying out an accord that will develop all possible trade  opportunities.    In a related press report, the weekly Sao Paulo news  magazine  ISTOE reported on 24 November that the Brazilian Army will  receive Russian surface-to-air missiles that will be distributed  to various infantry headquarters. The delivery of the missiles,  according to ISTOE, will begin early in 1994. In an earlier  "exclusive" report (ISTOE, 18 November) regarding the  negotiations between Brazil and Russia, Army Minister General  Zoroastro lauded the "great efficiency of light arms,  particularly grenade launchers, manufactured by the Russian  defense industry. General Zoroastro also announced that talks  between Brazil and Russia to designate a Brazilian Armed Forces  attache to Moscow have been concluded; likewise, Russia would  have an Army attache assigned to Brasilia.  <H5>  Background of the Accord </H5>   On 18 November, leading Sao Paulo business daily GAZETA  MERCANTIL provided considerable detail on the scope and  background of the then upcoming Russia-Brazil trade accord.  GAZETA commented that the governments of Brazil and Russia had  concluded their largest ever economic agreement, the result of  "authentic diplomatic engineering spanning five years of secret  negotiations" and the "final intermediation, in the Brazilian  private sector, by the two Rio entrepreneurial groups, Monteiro  Aranha and its associate, ITS Participacoes." The accord  provides for bilateral trade increasing to $5 billion in the  next five years, with financing from the two governments. The  annual volume of trade anticipated is almost six times greater  than the $172 million projected for 1993, GAZETA added.    During this period, GAZETA continued, Brazil is committing  itself to purchasing various Russian arms and ammunition,  rockets, large military helicopters for use in the Amazon  Region, special fishing boats and icebreakers, hydraulic and  thermal turbines and generators, petroleum and its by-products,  gas, chemical-pharmaceutical products, fertilizers, nonferrous  metals, primarily aluminum and its by-products, and Portland  cement. Russia, in turn, will buy from Brazil the following:  designs for hydroelectric and thermoelectric plants;  agricultural equipment; beef and pork; soybeans and derivatives;  sugar, cocoa, and coffee; textiles; and finished and  semifinished shoes.    Two lines of credit have been specially established in the  "store account" system, GAZETA continued. In sales of raw  materials and commodities" to Russia, the term of payment will  be one year and at London Inter-Bank Overnight Rate (LIBOR)  rates. In exports of equipment, machines, and manufactured  products, the term will be five years, also at LIBOR rates.  Banks and firms directly involved are Bank of Brazil, Sao Paulo  State Bank, Monteiro Aranha, Andrade Gutierrez, Embraer,  Brazilian Petroleum Corporation (Petrobras), Ceval, Vinicola  Aurora, Tramontina, Iochpe-Maxion, Grendene, Portobello,  Olvebra, Artex, and Neiva.    KOMMERSANT-DAILY of 4 December said that lines of credit  from  the Russian side will probably be provided by Mosbiznesbank,  Mezhkombank, Imperial Bank, and the Export-Import Bank.    The accord also provides for the establishment of "joint  ventures" including the following enterprises:    * Andrade Gutierrez and Monteiro Aranha, in association with  Agrarian Technologies of Russia, Neftkom, MID-Continent of the  United States and John Brown of Great Britain, to design and  build a refinery in Krasnodar;    * Brazilian firms and Anglo Resources Ltd. in oil  exploration  in the Stavropol Basin;    * Monteiro Aranha and Anglo Siberian Oil Ltd. in developing  the design and construction of a refinery in Krasnoyarsk, as  well as participating in the consortium to build a bridge over  the Yenisey River in the same area.    Providing an historical perspective to the agreement, GAZETA  went on to say that from the diplomatic standpoint, this accord  with Russia has a very special strategic dimension,"  particularly concerning cooperation in "sensitive" technologies  that will be started with "very small-scale transactions." Such,  it went on to say, is the case of the association of Embraer  with the Russian aeronautical and space conglomerate, Aviaprom,  together with Mashinoeksport, the sectoral foreign "trading"  company. The two Russian firms presented a formal proposal to  Embraer to form a multinational group, in which Argentine and  South African state firms would participate to develop the  CBA-123, a civilian aircraft that has been gradually developed  by Embraer. Aviaprom and Mashinoeksport subsequently invited  Embraer to examine their "Delfine" and "Be-30" models with  Russian TVD-1500 and TVD-20 turbines of similar performance to  the U.S. Garrett TRF351-20 that would be used in the CBA-123.  The three firms then began the technical discussion involving  the "plan, production, and sales" of a line of agricultural  planes with two basic models having a capacity of up to 0.6 and  2.5 tons respectively.    The technical discussions, GAZETA continued, were followed  by  a letter from Aviaprom President A. Gereshchenko to Embraer  President Ozires Silva in October 1993 noting that "we have a  good basis for cooperation." There followed a written invitation  from Gereshchenko and Mashinoeksport Vice President I. Latin for  Embraer to participate in "the creation and operation" of the  Burlak aerospace complex. Both Gereshchenko and Latin had been  in Brazil in February 1993 in a secret visit to the Alcantara  launch site in Maranhao, GAZETA pointed out, and then noted that  10 weeks later, Embraer, Neiva, Aviaprom, and the Myaslshchev  Design Bureau signed a protocol to launch communication  satellites from Alcantara. There was, according to GAZETA, a  parallel accord between the Monteiro Aranha group and Khrunichev  Enterprise to use Russian rockets as launchers. The Monteiro  Aranha group also signed an agreement with Rostvertol in Rostov  to sell large Russian helicopters of the Mil line in Brazil.    GAZETA further noted that in September 1993, Army Minister  General Zoroastro headed a military delegation to Russia to  study military equipment and missile technologies available to  Brazil, and added that the Brazilian Government has been trying  to attract partners to its space program by offering the use of  the Alcantara site, where satellite launches cost an average 20  percent less than from any other launch site in the world. In  addition to Russia, Brazil is engaged in negotiations with  China, which Strategic Affairs Secretariat Minister-Chief Mario  Cesar Flores has often called "the partner of the future,"  GAZETA concluded.</p>

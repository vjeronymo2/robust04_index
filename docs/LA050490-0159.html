			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> MALATHION INJURY BILL FAILS  </P> <P> The state Senate defeated an Assembly-passed bill that would give people whose  health was damaged by malathion spraying a clear path to sue governmental  entities and the makers and suppliers of the controversial pesticide.  </P> <P> The bill by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles) failed on an 18-13 vote,  three short of the 21 necessary for approval. Senators from agricultural  districts teamed to block its passage. The bill would have given injured  citizens the right to sue the manufacturer and supplier of malathion and the  government entities which authorized the spraying up to a year after discovery  of the alleged injury.  </P></p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Observer: Riposte Vociferous Labour MP Dennis Skinner's non-stop heckling was neatly staunched by social security secretary Peter Lilley during the Commons debate on the Maxwell pensions scandal. If the left-winger went on interrupting his speech, he said, Hansard's report of the debate would keep printing their two names one after the other. Wouldn't the repetitions of Lilley and Skinner give the Labour MP's fellow socialists the idea he was part of a capitalist partnership? For a moment, at least, the heckler fell silent.</p>

C.G.M.  </P> <P> DEAR MRS. C.G.M.: Commander's Palace complied when asked for this recipe. The  classic remoulade goes over cold seafood, so you're just in good time to add it  to the menu as a dip for New Year's appetizers, such as shrimp, crab legs,  lobster pieces or even vegetables.  </P> <P> COMMANDER'S SHRIMP REMOULADE  </P> <P> 1/4 cup Creole mustard  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons paprika  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/2 cup white vinegar  </P> <P> 1 cup finely chopped green onions  </P> <P> Dash hot pepper sauce  </P> <P> 1/2 cup finely chopped celery  </P> <P> 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley  </P> <P> 1/2 cup catsup  </P> <P> 1/2 cup prepared yellow mustard  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic, minced  </P> <P> 3 eggs, at room temperature  </P> <P> Juice of 1 lemon  </P> <P> 1 1/3 cups oil  </P> <P> 2 1/2 pounds (about 80) medium shrimp, peeled and deveined  </P> <P> Combine creole mustard, paprika, cayenne, salt, vinegar, green onions, hot  pepper sauce, celery, parsley, catsup, yellow mustard, garlic, eggs and lemon  juice in blender container. Blend at high speed until smooth. Remove cover and  gradually add oil in steady stream. Sauce will thicken to mayonnaise  consistency. Chill.  </P> <P> Serve with boiled or sauteed shrimp that has been cooled to room temperature or  chilled. Makes 2 1/2 cups.  </P> <P> Note: Crab or lobster may be substituted for shrimp.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: Please print the recipe for Kansas City Vanilla Ice Cream. It's  missing from my files! Thanks. -- JEROME  </P> <P> DEAR JEROME: This is one recipe we would not like to find missing in our files,  either. It's one of the best ice cream recipes of all time.  </P> <P> KANSAS CITY VANILLA ICE CREAM  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons cornstarch  </P> <P> 6 cups milk  </P> <P> 2 2/3 cups sugar  </P> <P> 4 large or 5 small eggs  </P> <P> 3/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 (13-ounce) can evaporated milk  </P> <P> 1 pint whipping cream  </P> <P> 3 1/2 tablespoons vanilla  </P> <P> 25 pounds crushed ice  </P> <P> Ice cream salt  </P> <P> Mix cornstarch with 1/2 cup milk until smooth. Add additional 1 1/2 cups milk  and cook in top of double boiler until thick and smooth, beating constantly to  avoid lumps.  </P> <P> Blend sugar, eggs, salt and evaporated milk in electric mixer.

Use 1 tablespoon vanilla and add  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon.  </P> <P> Coffee Ice Cream: Dissolve 3 tablespoons instant coffee in 1 cup water. Use 2  tablespoons vanilla.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I am requesting your assistance in obtaining a recipe for Steak  Diane, as it is prepared at many fine restaurants. -- JOE  </P> <P> DEAR JOE: Steak Diane was -- and is -- in the repertory of classic dishes  prepared table side at fine restaurants. It's a wonderful dish with which to  show off at your dinner table for two, (a New Year's tete-a-tete, perhaps?).  </P> <P> If you are squeamish about flaming a dish at the table, prepare and dish it up  it in the kitchen. The effect will not be the same, however.  </P> <P> STEAK DIANE  </P> <P> 1/4 cup butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1/4 cup minced shallots or green onions  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  </P> <P> 1/4 cup beef bouillon  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 2 (6-ounce) New York-cut steaks, 12-inch thick  </P> <P> 1/4 cup brandy  </P> <P> Melt butter, then add shallots and cook until tender, but not browned. Add  Worcestershire, bouillon, salt and pepper. Bring to boil, and cook until liquid  is reduced by about half.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, pan broil steaks until rare or done as desired. Transfer meat  drippings to chafing dish or leave in skillet. If using chafing dish, add  steaks to drippings and turn to coat well.  </P> <P> Warm brandy. Pour over steaks, heat sauce and ignite. Let flames die down and  serve at once. Makes 2 servings.  </P></p>

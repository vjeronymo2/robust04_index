As provided in the Anti Car Theft Act of 1992, these data were used to determine the theft rates for existing passenger motor vehicle lines manufactured in model years 1990 and 1991 and to determine the median theft rate for all those lines. Vehicle lines with theft rates exceeding the median theft rate of 3.5866 per thousand vehicles produced, are subject to selection for coverage under the Theft Prevention Standard. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Ms. Barbara A.

Pursuant to title VI, NHTSA promulgated 49 CFR part 541, Federal Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Standard. Part 541 establishes performance requirements for inscribing or affixing vehicle identification numbers (VINs) onto certain major original equipment and replacement parts of high theft lines of passenger motor vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 603 of the Cost Savings Act, as originally enacted, specified three categories of car lines that were high theft lines within the meaning of title VI. These three types were: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Existing lines that had a theft rate exceeding the median theft rate for calendar years (CYs) 1983&hyph;1984 (section 603(a)(1)(A)); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New lines that were likely to have a theft rate exceeding that median theft rate (section 603(a)(1)(B)); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lines with theft rates below the median theft rate, but which had a majority of major parts interchangeable with lines whose theft rate exceeded or was likely to exceed the median theft rate (section 603(a)(1)(C)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 603(b) of the Cost Savings Act provided that the median theft rate was the combined rate determined for CYs 1983&hyph;1984. Section 603(b) also set forth the equation NHTSA must use to determine the theft rates for each of the vehicle lines. After applying this equation to each existing line, NHTSA was directed by section 603(b) to rank the lines by theft rates to calculate the median theft rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document of November 12, 1985 (50 FR 46666), NHTSA published the final theft data reflecting passenger motor vehicle thefts in CYs 1983&hyph;1984. In that document, NHTSA also explained how it decided on the data source to be used and how it calculated the final theft rates. Based on its calculations, NHTSA determined that the median theft rate for CYs 1983 and 1984 was 3.2712 thefts per thousand vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments Concerning New Median Theft Rate (1990&hyph;1991 Median Theft Rate) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Anti Car Theft Act of 1992 (ACTA), which became law on October 25, 1992, amended title VI, Theft Prevention, of the Cost Savings Act. Title VI was amended to require the agency to calculate theft rates for passenger motor vehicle lines for the CY 1990&hyph;1991 period and then to establish a new median theft rate, based on that same period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title VI was also amended to redefine ``passenger motor vehicle'' to include ``any multipurpose passenger vehicle and light-duty truck that is rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight or less.'' See Section 601(1) of title VI. Before title VI was amended, ``passenger motor vehicle'' was defined for title VI purposes to include passenger cars only. Given the new definition of ``passenger motor vehicle,'' NHTSA must calculate the CY 1990 and 1991 theft rates not only for passenger cars, but also for multipurpose passenger vehicle (MPV) and light-duty truck (LDT) lines that are rated at 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating or less. Depending on their theft rates, certain MPV and LDT lines may be determined to be likely high theft lines, and thus may be subject to the parts marking requirements of the Theft Prevention Standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Preliminary Theft Rates of Vehicle Lines and Median Theft Rate <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 5, 1993, NHTSA published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 41834), for review and comment, a document setting forth data on passenger motor vehicle thefts that occurred in CYs 1990&hyph;91, including preliminary theft rates of vehicle lines and the preliminary median theft rate for all lines. In calculating the preliminary CY 1990&hyph;1991 theft rates, NHTSA followed the same procedures it used in calculating the 1983&hyph;1984 theft rates, with minor exceptions. The calculation procedure, based on National Crime Information Center data and the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) of each stolen vehicle, was described in the August 1993 document. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Guinness Guinness, as they say, is good for you. But not quite as good as before yesterday's interim figures. A rise of only 1 per cent in pre-tax profits suggests the market was right in worrying about whether Guinness could continue to outperform. There can be no definitive answer till after the recession. Some of Guinness' problems are clearly a reflection of the cycle. In Japan, for example, sliding demand for premium spirits has been compounded by de-stocking in the distribution chain. The first half saw a higher interest charge. That should be offset in the second half by profits from recent acquisitions which are skewed towards the end of the year. Still, the easy growth in spirits is probably over, and margins are virtually flat at 31 per cent. The US reorganisation following the Glenmore acquisition will take time to bear fruit. Similarly, though margins are growing in beer, the work of absorbing Union Cervecera is not complete and demand in the Spanish market remains weak. Given the company's own caution, it is hard to see why it should trade on a signficantly higher multiple than Grand Metropolitan or Allied-Lyons, though it has scope to continue raising dividends faster than earnings.</p>

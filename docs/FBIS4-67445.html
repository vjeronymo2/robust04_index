In order to prevent yet more radioactive dumping  in the Far Eastern seas, the document suggests that radioactive  waste processing units be urgently manufactured and delivered to  the Far East. It is suggested that 5 billion rubles from the  government's reserve fund be set aside to support these and  other urgent measures.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / The mending of India's backbone: Private investors are flocking in, as the government opens infrastructure projects to them It takes four days to drive 1,500km from Delhi to Bombay, three months to get electricity connected in Madras, and up to five years to obtain a telephone line in Calcutta. Such poor infrastructure is acting as a drag on the Indian economy, and threatens to undermine the market-oriented reforms launched three years ago by Mr PV Narasimha Rao, Indian prime minister. Out of necessity, rather than ideological conviction, Mr Rao has been forced to open telecommunications, power and basic services to private investors, in an effort to raise the billions of dollars needed to build the backbone of a modern economy. In electricity, government planners estimated in the early 1990s that the country would need to expand its generating capacity of 70,000MW by 48,000MW in 1992-97 to meet forecast increases in demand. In fact, less than 20,000MW will be built, because of the squeeze in public spending. Simply making up the shortfall would require about Dollars 28bn of private investment. As for telecommunications, India has one of the world's least developed networks, with just eight telephones per thousand people compared with 14 in China and 130 in Malaysia. The government estimates that clearing the existing waiting lists would require Rs230bn of private investment - on top of Rs330bn earmarked from public funds for 1992-97, the period of the current five-year plan. And in transport, the ministry has listed construction schemes worth Dollars 6bn, including motorways, roads and bridges for private companies to build, own and operate by charging tolls. Officials are also seeking investment in shipping and ports, including a Dollars 500m scheme for a new terminal at Bombay. With only China and Indonesia offering opportunities on this scale, companies have flocked to India. The power ministry boasts of proposals from more than 100 consortia, including international companies such as General Electric and Bechtel of the US, National Power of the UK and ABB, the European combine. No fewer than 84 companies bid for contracts to provide telecoms paging services. And 42 companies have asked for detailed project information on roads. As Mr Rajeev Talwar, a senior transport ministry official, says: 'The amounts of money we need to invest are immense. But we have had an overwhelming response from private industry.' However, there have been few actual commitments. Investors are still unsure that India represents a good long-term bet, and there have been delays on the Indian side. Time and again, the government has raised expectations with sweeping policy announcements, but dragged its feet in deciding important details. Mostly, this is because few countries have any experience of private investment in infrastructure on such a large scale. Mr John Mail, project director for National Power, which is developing a Dollars 1.8bn power station scheme in the central state of Andhra Pradesh in partnership with the Hindujas, a London-based business family, says: 'Nowhere in the world has a project of this size been done.' The delays have also been caused by the complexities of Indian decision-making. Both the ruling Congress (I) party and the bureaucracy have long been wedded to socialist traditions. Genuine converts to free-market capitalism are few, and decisions are taken cautiously. Often officials have deliberately kept rules governing private sector investment vague, to maintain their discretionary powers - and opportunities for demanding bribes. As Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, recently said: 'There are complaints that the opening up process is not transparent. I think there is merit in these complaints and we have to attend to improving the system.' In addition, power is shared in India by many institutions, both central and local, including the state administrations. The world's largest democracy dislikes government by fiat. Legal challenges are frequent: for example, the award of licences for cellular telephone operators was delayed for more than 18 months by court action. Nevertheless, progress is being made, notably in power, where the government is encouraging up to six fast-track schemes, which it hopes will be finalised next year. The framework for private power operations has been worked out in negotiations with the would-be investors, notably Enron, the US energy group, which is planning a 695MW plant in the western state of Maharashtra in partnership with General Electric and Bechtel. The investors' main concern was ensuring payment from the loss-making state electricity boards, which dominate power distribution and are politically controlled. The boards are required to supply low-cost or even free power to favoured customers such as farmers. After negotiations, it was agreed that state administrations would guarantee the boards' payments, and Delhi would counter-guarantee the states, at least for the first few projects. This has been criticised in India for relieving investors of some of their commercial risk and allowing politicians to postpone the reform of electricity distribution. However, such guarantees should see construction begin on the first new private schemes late next year and, by 1998, India's first new private generating stations should be in place. The 3,000MW of power that the first private projects are set to produce will represent only a fraction of the extra electricity that India needs, however, with the state remaining the country's main source of power. Of crucial importance will be the efforts to increase and improve public capacity - possibly with the help of private companies, such as Rolls-Royce of the UK, which have offered to manage renovation schemes. There has been less progress so far in telecommunications, where the government has run into a series of political, bureaucratic and legal tangles. For example, licences for operating cellular telephones in the four biggest cities of Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta and Madras were originally granted two years ago. But losing companies challenged the awards and it was not until this autumn that new licences were handed out. Even now, the companies are not free to launch services, with important operating conditions still to be settled. The government an-nounced in principle only in May this year that private operations were to be allowed in basic telephone services. Now officials are working out guidelines and plan to float tenders in January. But for foreign companies one important rule is in place - for both cellular and basic services the maximum level of foreign ownership is to be 49 per cent. As pent-up demand is released, executives believe the investments could flow fast. At least 100,000 mobile phones, and up to 300,000 or 400,000 according to some estimates, could be sold in the first year of operation. The total investment in two years could reach Dollars 200m-Dollars 500m. In basic services, it could be Dollars 10bn in five years, say industry executives. An official of Alcatel, the telecommunications equipment maker, says: 'We believe India is the next China. The growth rate in telecoms will be the same.' Private investment in roads is a more remote prospect. India has attracted some extravagant proposals, including one from Renong, Malaysia's biggest group, to build 12,000km of motorway for Dollars 25bn. But there are serious doubts about whether toll roads can be successfully run, given the widespread reluctance in India to pay commercial rates for public services. Nevertheless, building companies, like their counterparts in power and telecommunications, are swarming into India. As Mr Amit Sharma, director for central and south Asia at Motorola, the US electronics group, says: 'Everybody wants to be in Asia, especially China and India. Today they want to be in India even more than in China. But lots of patience is required.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                  INDIA'S INFRASTRUCTURE: POWERLESS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- POWER  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Current capacity                                               76,700MW Likely capacity addition by March 1997                         19,800MW Current shortage (Percent)                              10 (16 at peak) Likely shortage by March 1997 (Percent)          14.5 (over 20 at peak) Theft and transmission losses (Percent)                            21.8  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TELECOMMUNICATIONS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Lines                                                                8m Target for March 1997                                             15.8m Target for March 2000                                               20m Telephones per 1,000 people                                           8 Target of lines per 1,000 people                                  60-70  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ROADS                                     1951                     1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Vehicles                               300,000                      25m Paved roads                              4m km                   20m km National highways                     20,955km                 34,058km  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Ministries of power, telecommunications and surface transport  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (7): New Delhi has score to settle - Co-operation with India OPERATIVES of New Delhi's secret service Special Investigation Team (SIT) set up to track down the killers of Mr Rajiv Gandhi, the former Indian prime minister, are now regular visitors to Colombo, writes Mervyn de Silva and Richard Cowper. SIT is working closely with Sri Lanka's police and intelligence services and its mission is clear: seize or kill Velupillai Prabhakaran founder and commander of the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and the man they are convinced master-minded the assassination of the Indian prime minister. Mr Gandhi was killed in May 1991 by a young female Tamil suicide bomber from Sri Lanka at an election rally in the southern Indian city of Madras. The modus operandi was very similar to that used by the LTTE to murder Sri Lanka's President Premadasa at an election rally in Colombo in May this year. The co-operation between New Delhi and Colombo in this and other security areas is a far cry from the last decade when India operated a policy aimed at destabilising her tiny southern neighbour. Today, New Delhi no longer supports and arms Tamil Tiger guerrillas. It fears that it might end up with its own rebel movement in the fractious southern Tamil state of Tamil Nadu and is taking a tough line against LTTE arms smuggling. Earlier this year, the Indian navy captured and destroyed a trawler in the Palk Straits, a 20-mile strip of water that separates Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka's Jaffna peninsula. As well as arms and explosives, on board was Prabhakaran's right-hand man, known as Kittu. He and a number of other senior LTTE commanders died in the incident in circumstances that have never been fully explained. The loss of Kittu is said to have been a heavy blow to the rebel leader. Prabhakaran is said to have placed great reliance on Kittu as one of the few commanders he could trust. So deep is his fear of New Delhi that he recently placed Mahattya, his deputy, under house arrest in Jaffna as a suspected 'Indian agent.' All this seems an age from the early 1980s when Rajiv's mother, Mrs Indira Gandhi, ordered RAW - India's equivalent of the CIA - to arm and train cadres of a tiny Tamil rebel movement in secret Indian camps. The close relationship began to break down when Rajiv - who succeeded his mother as prime minister after she was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguard - signed an Indo-Sri Lankan peace accord in 1987. An Indian peacekeeping force was despatched to Jaffna to force a settlement on the Tamil Tigers. India and Mr Gandhi were to pay dearly for this change in policy. With just a few thousand guerrillas, Prabhakaran engaged and drove out an Indian army of 120,000 men. At least 7,000 Indian soldiers died and many more were wounded before the pullout came in 1990. In parts of Tamil Nadu - the traditional Dravidian enemy of the Buddhist Singhalese - the Tamil Tigers are still seen as heroes. But New Delhi has a new foreign policy of regional co-operation and a very deep personal score to settle with the man who brought to a premature end the reign of India's most famous political dynasty.</p>

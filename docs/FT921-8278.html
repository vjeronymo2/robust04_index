			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Dalgety ahead 4 per cent as market share increases DALGETY, the foods and agri-business company, raised pre-tax profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 53.8m in the six months to December 31, following increases in its share of the snacks and pet-foods markets and gains from corporate rationalisation. Sir Peter Carey, chairman, said the result, compared with Pounds 51.7m last time, was encouraging in the present economic climate. He forecast continued growth in consumer foods and ingredients. However, Mr Maurice Warren, chief executive, said he expected little change in economic conditions before the middle of the year. 'The upturn we were all hoping for in late autumn has not followed through. We are conditioning our manufacturing units to the idea that recovery will be very flat,' he said. Mr Warren ruled out bidding for British Petroleum's nutrition businesses or for Unilever's agribusiness operations recently put up for sale. Though Dalgety regarded agribusiness as a core activity, it saw foods as the main focus of future growth. Trading profit on consumer foods rose to Pounds 27.8m compared with Pounds 23.7m a year earlier on the strength of a strong performance by the Golden Wonder snacks business, which increased its share of a flat UK crisps market. Spillers pet foods increased volumes by 7 per cent in spite of a decrease in the overall market. Margins on baking mixes improved, because of rationalisation following the acquisition of Greens. Homepride benefited from the strength of the cooking sauces market, which grew by 22 per cent in value and 8 per cent in volume. Trading profit on food ingredients of Pounds 11.8m, against Pounds 11.6m the previous year, was held back by difficult conditions in milling and baking and by the weakness of catering. Martin-Brower, the US food distribution company, increased profit to Pounds 6.8m, compared with Pounds 6.6m, helped by favourable exchange rates, but tough trading conditions cut agribusiness profits to Pounds 11.9m from Pounds 12.2m. Total turnover increased to Pounds 2.01bn from Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 1.84bn when adjusted for disposals). Earnings per share rose 7 per cent to 18p as against 16.9p, aided by a reduced tax rate, while net borrowings fell to Pounds 79m from Pounds 125m. The interim dividend is raised to 7.5p from 7.15p.

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BRAY FINDS IT'S EASIER SECOND TIME AROUND  </P> <P> John Bray had done it before, so he figured he could do it again.  </P> <P> He was right.  </P> <P> A few months ago, while training for a U.S.-Soviet Union boxing series, Bray  dropped Eugene Gill with a left hook and a quick right during a sparring match.  </P> <P> In the semifinals of the 201-pound division at the U.S. Olympic Festival  Saturday at Myriad Exhibit Hall, Bray got the same result.  </P> <P> Only this time he used only one hand -- a straight right that sent Gill  sprawling to the canvas 45 seconds into the second round and prompted referee  Gene Reese to stop the fight.  </P> <P> "I figured that if I could drop him in the gym, I could drop him in the fight,"  said Bray, who trains in Van Nuys. "He figured he was going to get back at me .  . . I guess the best man stood."  </P> <P> Bray will meet Javier Alvarez of San Antonio, Tex., for the gold medal on  Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Alvarez, who defeated Bray by decision on his way to winning the U.S. amateur  championship earlier this year, decisioned Rodney Price of Elizabeth, N.J., in  the other semifinal.  </P> <P> "I totally underestimated Alvarez in the nationals," Bray said. "I was favored  to win and with that attitude I went in a little too big-headed and he  surprised me . . . I only make a mistake once."  </P> <P> Alvarez's handlers seemingly expected to meet Gill in the final. As the Flint,  Mich., native made his way to the ring, one shouted, "You'd better be there,  Gill. We don't want no substitutes."  </P> <P> Bray quickly made it apparent that they would get one. He decked Gill for the  first time with a right to the head with less than a minute left in the first  round and forced another standing-8 count with a furious combination shortly  before the bell.  </P> <P> "In the first round after I dropped him I said, 'This is it,' " Bray said.  "He's a game fighter. Most guys would feel those right hands and just stay  down, but he kept fighting."  </P> <P> The victory improved Bray's record to 75-8 with 50 knockouts. He had been stuck  at 49 knockouts since March.  </P> <P> "I wanted to break that 50 mark," he said. "It was sitting on 49 too long."  </P> <P> BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Don MacLean was one of five West players to score in double figures, but the  South won in overtime, 98-94.  </P> <P> MacLean, a former Simi Valley High standout who started at forward last season  as a freshman for UCLA, made only two of six field-goal attempts, but was six  of six from the free-throw line.  </P> <P> Mitchell Butler, a former standout at Oakwood School who will attend UCLA in  the fall, scored nine points for the West. Adonis Jordan, a Kansas freshman out  of Cleveland High, missed all three of his shooting attempts.  </P> <P> CYCLING  </P> <P> Shawn Cronkhite of Quartz Hill checked into the Festival Village early to scout  the competition venues and it paid off. He won a gold medal in the men's  20-kilometer time trial in 25:26.48 -- more than 10 seconds better than the  second-place finisher.  </P> <P> "This was the fastest time trial course that I have ever been on," he said. "It  really helped me to come on Wednesday to relax and train. Most of the time we  are hurried from event to event and don't have time to concentrate."  </P> <P> Katie Beck of Simi Valley was eighth in the women's time trial in 30:11.31.  </P> <P> FIGURE SKATING  </P> <P> Sharon Carz of North Hollywood and partner Doug Williams of Playa del Rey are  second in pairs skating after the completion of the original program.  </P> <P> Tisha Walker of Thousand Oaks is in fifth place after the women's original  program. Tamara Kuchiki of Canoga Park is in 12th place. The leader is Kristi  Yamaguchi of Fremont, Calif.  </P> <P> SLOW-PITCH SOFTBALL  </P> <P> Pitcher Ron Whittleton of Sepulveda and infielder Manny Maldonado of North  Hollywood played sparingly for the South as slow-pitch made its Festival debut.  </P> <P> The East had 34 hits, including 12 home runs, in a 33-12 rout of the South.  </P> <P> KAYAKING  </P> <P> Susan Bragg of Newbury Park finished fifth in the women's 500-meter event with  a time of 2:10.05.  </P> <P> TEAM HANDBALL  </P> <P> Three players from the Ventura Condors combined for 12 goals as the West  defeated the North, 17-16.  </P> <P> Denny Fercho of Camarillo scored five times for the West, while club teammates  Mike Hurdle (four goals)and Jeff Fruin (three goals), both of Reseda, helped  out.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'NO QUICK FIX' SEEN IN BATTLING GROWING SWARMS OF ASH WHITEFLIES  </P> <P> Agriculture officials and entomologists said Friday that there is "no quick  fix" to countering the growing swarms of ash whiteflies in Orange County and  other parts of Southern California, but the pesky insects could eventually be  controlled through predators and parasites.  </P> <P> During a meeting of the California Agricultural Commissioners and Sealers Assn.  subcommittee on the ash whitefly in Anaheim, Orange County Agricultural  Commissioner James D. Harnett urged tormented homeowners not to spray  pesticides in an attempt to kill the flies that have recently infested their  trees.  </P> <P> "It doesn't work very well and it's not a good idea," Harnett told reporters  after the meeting Friday. "There is no quick fix. It is a matter of controlling  the flies, not eradication."  </P> <P> Harnett said he understands why residents in Southern California are upset with  the infestation of the flying insect, which is about the size of the head of a  pin. The flies are so numerous in places that people can no longer hold  gatherings in their back yards, Harnett said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reduction Expected  </P> <P> But, he added, the ash whitefly will never be eradicated completely, and  residents should get used to it. Harnett said that when control programs are  under way the number of the flies will be reduced considerably.  </P> <P> The fly hangs on the underside of the leaves of ash trees and ornamental pear  trees. There it eats the leaves and lays its eggs. Although the insect was  spotted for the first time only last year, Harnett said September and October  seem to be the worst months for the ash whitefly.  </P> <P> Thomas Bellows, UC Riverside associate professor of entomology, said officials  are studying predators and parasites that are successfully used in Europe and  Israel to control the ash whitefly.  </P> <P> One of the predators, similar to the orange lady bug but small and bronze  colored, eats the ash whitefly.  </P> <P> By the middle of next year, Bellows said he hoped to be ready to release  whatever predators or parasites that will control the pest and yet not pose a  danger to the environment.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Bellows advised residents to keep the trees that the whiteflies  infest well watered and be prepared for the leaves to drop off a little sooner  than usual.  </P></p>

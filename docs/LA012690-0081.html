			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: HOW EXPERTS PINPOINT PRODUCTIVITY PROBLEMS  </P> <P> When things began to bog down for patients and doctors at the Chico Medical  Group, the 28 physicians who own the corporation hired a productivity  consultant to help them figure out ways to work smarter. Sharon Stone, medical  group administrator, said the doctors called in the consultants because they  wanted to improve patient service while keeping labor costs down.  </P> <P> "A productivity consultant gives you some statistics to make sound business  judgments," said Stone. "They don't give you a magical cure for all your ills."  </P> <P> For four months, an analyst from Western Productivity Group in Palo Alto spent  about eight hours a day observing every aspect of life at the Chico Medical  Group. Before improvements could be made, the analyst had to figure out how  patients moved through the system, how they paid for their care and how the  doctors and other health-care providers communicated with staff members.  </P> <P> "She asked lots of questions," said Stone. "She and the others who worked with  us explained that they were here to help us work smarter, not faster."  </P> <P> Based on the $60,000 study, the medical group implemented several of the  consultants' suggestions, including improvements in the patient check-in area,  billing department, medical transcription department and data processing. The  consultants even recommended a change in the type of note pads used for  telephone messages to ensure their getting to the right people.  </P> <P> Productivity consultants offer various services to small-business owners. Some  firms specialize in analyzing specific tasks, such as how long it takes a  secretary to type a report. Others take a bigger picture approach, studying how  systems work.  </P> <P> Most consultants charge about $120 an hour, but the fees can be as low as $50  or $60 an hour. Ray Dillard, president of Western Productivity Group in Palo  Alto, said the Chico Medical Group could save between $250,000 and $300,000 by  implementing his recommendations.  </P> <P> For manufacturers, a productivity consultant can figure out how long it takes  employees to do a certain task. Then the measurements are used to develop  standards and to figure out how many people to hire.  </P> <P> "Because not every person can meet the standards, we try to look at the group  doing the task and not the individual," said Joe Lima, director of instrument  operations at Lifescan, which makes blood glucose monitors in Milpitas, Calif.  </P> <P> Lima, who has worked with several productivity consultants through the years,  said it is important for the consultant to work with employees to present  possible solutions to management.  </P> <P> "The best consultants walk away with everyone thinking the consultant didn't do  anything," said Lima.  </P> <P> Lima said small-business owners should choose a productivity consultant  carefully.  </P> <P> "Be sure to ask exactly what will be delivered under the contract," said Lima.  "Ask if the consultant will supply the standards and train a trainer to teach  employees."  </P> <P> When interviewing productivity consultants, small-business owners should check  references and call other clients for information. Then be sure to meet with  the person who will be doing the actual work, rather than just the president or  marketing director for the consulting firm. Dwight Shackelford, president of  Shackelford and Warner Associates in Beverly Hills, is a "white-collar"  productivity consultant who helps businesses solve their paper work problems.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of things that can be done to help small-business owners,"  said Shackelford. He said owners can respond quickly to productivity problems  if they watch for the symptoms. "Extensive overtime means something is wrong,"  he said. "Other signs would be if paper flow is backing up and if workers are  missing deadlines."  </P> <P> Shackelford said owners should watch whether workers are walking around the  office more than necessary. "If they are moving, they aren't working," said  Shackelford.  </P> <P> Dillard said small-business owners can help boost productivity themselves by  keeping a close watch on the company's operations to spot trouble before it  gets out of hand.  </P> <P> "You need to continually adjust your costs as your sales change," advises  Dillard. "Don't wait until the end of the month for results; you need to have  this kind of information at your fingertips."  </P> <P> Dillard said a savvy small-business owner will listen carefully to what his or  her salespeople are saying and then factor that into all decisions.  </P> <P> No matter how small your business is, you should keep close track of direct  labor costs, indirect labor costs, fixed and variable overhead costs and  general and administrative costs. According to Dillard, direct labor costs --  the cost of keeping your employees -- should represent 10% to 11% of total  sales.  </P> <P> "If sales drop and you don't respond, this percentage could creep up as high as  20%," said Dillard.  </P> <P> If sales drop and laying off workers seems too drastic, Dillard suggests asking  your employees to work a shortened work week until sales pick up again. "A  quick response to problems is the key to managing a small business," said  Dillard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poll Finds CPAs Bullish on State's Economic Outlook  </P> <P> Business conditions look good for 1990, according to results of a survey  released by the California Society of Certified Public Accountants.  </P> <P> Fifty-six percent of the 600 members interviewed said they felt business  conditions were good, and 81% predicted that the climate would stay the same or  improve in the next six months.  </P> <P> "California has a strong, broad-based economy," said Stu Kart, a Sherman Oaks  accountant who serves as president of the 29,000-member society . "I think  California is where it's at in the 1990s. We have a great deal of money coming  in from the Pacific Rim and the general outlook is quite good."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Salah al-Mukhtar] </F>   [Text] Last night, the whole world saw and watched hour by  hour the progress of a big political and diplomatic defeat for  the United States and Britain in the Security Council. After an  (American honeymoon) that lasted about three years, an American  (troublesome era) has started; troubles and crises keep popping  up, here and there.    During the last three lean years, through tremendous power,  America succeeded in forcing the Security Council  members--including the permanent ones--to support her!  Accordingly, at the expiration of the two-month period, with  just a hand signal, the American Ambassador to the United  Nations could issue a declaration for an extension!    Currently, however, three out of the five permanent members  of the UNSC--China, Russia, and France--have indicated that the  positive stand of Iraq should be appreciated; both the United  States and Britain have refused to appreciate that stand!  Moreover, eight nonpermanent UNSC members are willing to deal  positively with Iraq, while only Argentina has supported the  American stand!    This openly stated change implies a few important facts.  First is the fact that the United States has lost its ability to  either have declarations easily issued or to forcibly subject  the UNSC members to her will. The second fact is that America  realizes the far reaching and dramatic impact of this change.  This change denotes that the battle for lifting the embargo has  entered its most dramatic turn in its three years of existence  because America's rationale no longer holds and is no longer  influential even inside the American Congress. This indicates  that the power-and-pressure weapon has become weaker and does  not have full impact on the majority of nations.    The third fact is that to keep on extending the embargo  every  two months is no longer a one-handed decision by America; the  wishes and interests of other nations are now taken into  consideration with regards to the extension because the embargo  no longer harms the Iraqi people alone, but is harmful to the  international community as well. For this reason, the rationale  of those countries that support lifting the embargo will, as  time goes on, be stronger and more effective; eventually it will  become an established legal and interest-oriented decision. When  this situation occurs, the difference of opinion that became  apparent lately will develop into a crisis that would--every two  months--aggravate and give rise to conflict and arguments and  perhaps even lead to a dangerous dilemma that would last until  the embargo is ended!    Iraqis who have persevered, suffered, and have been deprived  of medicine and many of life's necessities can breath a sigh of  relief today as the beam of hope has turned to a burning flame  that is not liable for extinction. This flame will attract more  of those people who have been trapped inside the venues of  American vice and lead them to both truth and rationality.    The great sacrifices of our people have born fruit and have  changed the embargo from an Iraqi issue to one for humanity as a  whole. Currently, the human race is preparing--albeit slowly--to  enter the political battle for lifting the embargo.    However, despite this positive change, the spirit of  perseverance and the everlasting clinging to President Saddam  Husayn's perception and leadership remains the main guarantee  for putting an end to and shortening the duration of the battle  to lift the embargo and also for sparing us more pain.</p>

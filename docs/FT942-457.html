			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Spending by credit card up sharply in all sectors Further signs of the strength of high-street spending emerged yesterday after the Credit Card Research Group reported that expenditure on credit and debit cards rose sharply in all sectors last month. The group, which conducts research on behalf of the industry, said that total spending on cards in the three months to May was Pounds 14.05bn, 17 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Spending on credit and debit cards in May itself was Pounds 5.07bn. This was slightly better than in April, and markedly up on the level in March. In contrast to other pick-ups earlier this year, the rise in credit-card spending was now spread across all high-street sectors, the group said. Food and drink accounted for the largest part of the total credit-card and debit-card spending, with Pounds 1.037bn spent in this category last month. Measured on a quarterly basis, food and drink expenditure was Pounds 2.93bn, 22 per cent up on a year ago. Credit-card and debit-card spending in department stores and on mail order was 14 per cent higher, while clothing was 16 per cent up compared with the same quarter last year. The group welcomed the figures as evidence that the tax rises had not yet dented consumer spending. However, it added that the growth may also have reflected consumers' growing use of credit cards in place of cash or cheques.</p>

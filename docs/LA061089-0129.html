			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ALTERNATIVE THEATRE  </P> <P> I am writing to commend Jan Herman on his coverage of the financial  difficulties that the Alternative Repertory Theatre of Santa Ana is having.  </P> <P> Having seen every production that ART has mounted, I know what a cultural  resource this theater company is becoming. Orange County needs this company's  survival. It is gratifying to see The Times be so supportive of ART's  endeavors.  </P> <P> I would encourage all of your readers to come and see what is happening at this  intimate theater in Santa Ana. It is well worth the time and effort.  </P> <P> LORETTA BEAUMONT  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

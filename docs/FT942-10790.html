			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Dollar policy still lacks consistency 'My administration is setting a medium-term goal of stable prices - zero inflation. We believe a further reduction in inflation is the best way to secure higher living standards and a sustained reduction in unemployment. To this end, we would welcome an appreciation of the dollar. We are 100 per cent behind the Federal Reserve in its efforts to prevent the economy overheating and protect the currency. We accept that a substantial further rise in short-term interest rates may be required.' This imaginary statement is the kind of signal that President Bill Clinton needs to send if financial markets are fully to regain confidence in the conduct of US economic policy. To have maximum effect it would need to be swiftly followed by a half or - better still - a full percentage point increase in short-term interest rates. Markets might then believe that the Clinton administration puts the same priority on price and exchange rate stability as most other governments. Needless to say, no such statement was forthcoming from the Oval Office last week. But the US Treasury did offer markets half a loaf. When the Fed and 16 other central banks joined forces to support the dollar last Wednesday, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, issued a statement sharply different in tone from previous pronouncements. He said the administration saw 'no advantage in an undervalued currency,' signalling for the first time a concern about the level of the dollar rather than its rate of change. By contrast, the previous Friday, he had stuck to the old formula that intervention was needed to counter 'disorderly markets' - a code meaning the Treasury wanted calmer trading conditions but was not trying to alter the direction of currency movements. As such it was an invitation to markets to renew their attack on the dollar. Mr Bentsen's recantation - orchestrated by Mr Larry Summers, the Treasury undersecretary - is regarded within the US Treasury as a bold departure from previous policy. By explicitly saying he did not want an undervalued currency, Mr Bentsen was attempting to put a floor under the dollar. Yet it makes little sense to take a strong position on the dollar without also adopting a consistent line on interest rates. Intervention is rarely successful unless backed by more fundamental policy shifts. One of the principal reasons why the dollar has been weak recently is that financial markets regard US monetary policy as significantly looser than that in Europe and Japan, once allowance is made for countries' different positions in the economic cycle. The US has entered its fourth year of expansion and is rapidly approaching capacity limits; elsewhere output is far below potential because other countries are still struggling to emerge from recession. Yet real interest rates are lower in the US than in either Germany or Japan. The administration was annoyed in early February when the Fed signalled the first increase in short-term interest rates in five years. It did not think a tightening of policy was then required and it only grudgingly accepted subsequent rate increases. The White House blamed the Fed for soaring bond yields and turmoil in the markets. Belatedly, administration officials are now perhaps beginning to grasp the political advantages of slowing growth this year so as to prolong the economic expansion until election day in 1996. But having ridiculed the notion that inflation might rise they will have to work hard to convince markets that their attitude has really changed. In the meantime, the degree of market volatility will depend on the Fed's willingness to put teeth into Mr Bentsen's dollar policy. After Friday's very strong employment report, there is no longer any doubt that it needs to tighten monetary policy again. Since January the economy has generated 1m new jobs, a marked acceleration in the pace of job creation from the second half of last year when economic growth averaged nearly 5 per cent at an annual rate. Other data last week signalled that the economy is rebounding strongly from a first quarter weakened by bad weather and other distortions. The Purchasing Managers' Index - a guide to the health of manufacturing - rose more sharply than expected. And the Fed released a notably bullish Beige Book assessment of regional trends. Highlights included double-digit annual increases in retail sales in many areas, brisk housing markets and 'near capacity' production of cars, vehicle parts, steel and building materials. Ominously, there were reports of significant upward pressure on raw materials prices. The economy may now well be growing at an annual rate of 4-5 per cent in real terms - far above its long-run potential. Some analysts expect annualised growth this quarter of 6 per cent. With the dollar weak and credit growing briskly, the case for a decisive tightening of monetary policy could hardly be stronger. Wall Street is looking for an increase in short-term rates of half a percentage point, preferably this week but no later than the Fed's May 17 policy meeting. If the Fed delivers, it may buy temporary calm in foreign exchange markets. Ultimately, however, markets want to be reassured that Mr Clinton understands the economic facts of life. The president needs to declare his personal commitment to low inflation, sound money and a strong dollar - and then encourage Mr Greenspan to play tough.</p>

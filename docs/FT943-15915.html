			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Council reforms clear last hurdle The bill to reform local government in Wales - replacing the eight county councils and 37 district councils with 22 unitary authorities - has received royal assent. Under the Local Government (Wales) Act, shadow elections to the single-tier councils will be held next May and the new bodies will take over on April 1 1996, a year later than envisaged by a white paper published in March 1993. The only substantial changes made to the bill during its passage through parliament were an increase in the number of unitary councils from 21 to 22, and a government amendment to allow decentralised area committees in geographically-large authorities such as Powys.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview given to the French daily  AUJOURD'HUI, on the day before the assassination of two French  nationals, Algerian Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi has launched an  appeal to France. It is in France's interests to help Algeria,  he says, for if Algeria were to experience serious long-term  difficulties, this would have an impact on the Maghreb and on  France. Everything which affects Algeria affects France too, he  added, stressing also that relations between the two countries  are now without difficulties.</p>

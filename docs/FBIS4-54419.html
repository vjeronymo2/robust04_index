			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- Outraged Hungarian  Prime Minister Peter Boross on Thursday [28 April] told  journalists the emerging organization of the Hungarist (fascist)  Movement reminded everyone how Hungary was twice this century  betrayed, by the Hungarian Arrow Cross-Hungarist Movement in  1944, and by the Communists in 1945. Both times, the country  was handed over to alien powers.    Organizations that caused national tragedies have no place  in  Hungarian public life, he went on. Although outrage was  considerable, this should not mean over-evaluating the  organization's political weight.    Unless the organization commits a specific crime then Boross  saw it as a Public Prosecutor's Office matter. He said both the  extreme right and the extreme left should be seen as equally  dangerous.    Discussing the chances of the left-wing at the elections,  Boross said victory by the Socialists would imply trouble: "We  have already experienced their professionalism and  decision-making ability."    Boross said governing in a transition period implies  unpopular measures. Restructuring comes with sacrifice and  loss, and many people have become disillusioned, even with a  government which has, uniquely in the region, served all four  years in office. But, the Hungarian election system  disadvantages non-left-wing parties, as the center and  center-right are sharply divided.</p>

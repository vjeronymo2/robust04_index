			<p>BFN     [Text] London: Quds Press--The Islamic Resistance  Movement, Hamas, has stated that it does not recognize any  agreements the PLO concludes with Israel. The movement, opposed  to the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles agreement,  says it will continue to work to scuttle the accord. The  statements were made by Hamas' spokesman Muhammad Nazal in a  telephone interview. He told Quds Press "this and previous  agreements are not binding on the Palestinian people, and  represent only their signers." These agreements, in our eyes,  renounce our people's and nation's rights to the land and  sanctitities, as he put it.    Nazzal stressed that his movement will resist this agreement  with the same intensity it did before it was signed. Hamas will  enhance coordination with other opposition Palestinian forces to  cope with the challenges associated with the agreement. His  movement, he said, will revitalize the alliance opposed to the  negotiations with Israel that was instituted months back.</p>

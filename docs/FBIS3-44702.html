An executive of the Tunghsing Development Zone said the fair  is sponsored by the management commission of the zone, the  Guangxi Academy of Social Sciences and Vietnam's Mong Cai County.    During the fair, 20 to 30 experts, scholars and professional  executives from both sides will exchange economic reform  experiences and discuss the prospects for bilateral economic and  technical cooperation as well as the prospects for regional  economic development in the border areas of the two countries.    Business communities of the two countries will hold talks on  economic and technical cooperation. More than 280 Vietnamese  firms have expressed their readiness to cooperate with Chinese  counterparts. Some 500 Chinese companies, mainly from China's  relatively developed areas, will attend the fair.    Business people from around the world are expected to  conduct  talks on investment projects in the region.    The fair will also organize commodity exhibitions. Both  China and Vietnam will organize groups to exchange visits.    According to latest official statistics, the border trade  volume in the Tunghsing Development Zone exceeded 200 million  yuan (about 23 million U.S. dollars) in 1993.</p>

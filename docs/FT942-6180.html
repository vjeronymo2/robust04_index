			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Annual growth rate of M0 jumps to 7.1% The annual growth rate of M0, the government's narrow measure of money supply, jumped to 7.1 per cent in May from 6.2 per cent in April, according to figures released by the Bank of England yesterday. The rapid growth in this money supply measure, which is one of the inflationary indicators monitored by the government, was seen by analysts yesterday as making a further base rate cut even less likely. Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), said: 'There is no justification for a base rate cut on the basis of these figures.' Ms Ruth Lea, chief UK economist at Lehman Brothers, said: 'These are exceptionally strong figures which show that the economy is not slowing down.' The government's monitoring range for M0 annual growth is zero to 4 per cent. In the Bank of England's last inflation report, the acceleration in M0 growth was attributed to low interest rates, which have reduced the effective cost to consumers of holding cash. But the Bank warned that 'the longer M0 grows at well above its monitoring range, the greater the concerns about the implications for future inflation'. The Bank said yesterday that it would be concerned if M0 growth failed to slow by the end of the year. M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent between April and May, but because a negative number in May 1993 dropped out of the comparison, the annual rate accelerated sharply. Recent growth in M0 has been particularly strong, with the indicator rising by 1.9 per cent between March and April. On an annualised basis, growth over the past three months has been 10 per cent. The amount of notes and coins, the core component of M0, rose by 0.5 per cent over the month, and by 7.0 per cent over the year. M0 is seen as having a close relationship with retail sales and yesterday's figures were thought to show that consumers were weathering the recent tax rises. 'Growth in M0 is signalling a relatively strong consumer sector,' said Mr Richardson. Figures for growth in M4, the broad measure of the money supply, yesterday confirmed earlier estimates of a 5.7 per cent rise in the 12 months to April.</p>

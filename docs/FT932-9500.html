			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / International Company News: Kodak's predictions fail to stem protest vote MR Kay Whitmore, chairman of troubled Eastman Kodak, yesterday promised investors a sharply improved performance and forecast record 1994 earnings per share, yet was met with a substantial protest vote by dissatisfied shareholders at the annual meeting. The meeting was held against a background of rising concern by some of Kodak's largest institutional investors over its lacklustre financial performance. This anxiety was reinforced late last month when Kodak's share price fell sharply after Mr Christopher Steffen, the company's new chief financial officer, quit after only 11 weeks, because of differences with Mr Whitmore over the best way to restructure the business. Three Kodak directors up for re-election yesterday won overwhelming support from shareholders, getting 96.2 per cent of votes cast, but investors sent a strong message of dissatisfaction by casting 42 per cent of ballots in favour of a proposal to make the entire board stand for re-election every year. The College Retirement Equities Fund (Cref), the single largest managed equity fund in the US, announced it had withheld support for the three directors because of its conviction that 'Kodak has continued to delay restructuring and effective management decisions'. It distrusted the company's willingness to make 'long overdue changes'. Mr Whitmore, trying to convince shareholders the company had changed its spots, told the meeting in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, that Kodak would generate substantially more cash flow between now and 1995 than the previously stated target of Dollars 1bn, which was now only 'a fraction of what we intend'. He repeated that he expected a solid increase in 1993 earnings, compared to 1992, and predicted record earnings per share in 1994.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Gillette increases to record Dollars 171m Strong sales growth in most worldwide markets helped Gillette, the US shaving and consumer products group, increase third quarter net income by 19 per cent to a record Dollars 171m after preferred stock dividends, the company reported yesterday. Sales for the three months to September rose 12 per cent to Dollars 1.5bn, operating profits were ahead 12 per cent at Dollars 297.7m, and earnings per share - diluted slightly by an increase in issued equity - were ahead 18 per cent at 77 cents. Mr Alfred Zeien, chairman and chief executive, said the results reflected good performances in Gillette's core businesses in most areas of the world. In Europe, Mr Zeien said, demand was increasing mainly because of new products, though improving economic conditions had helped in some markets. The US continued to show substantial sales growth, and sales in developing markets were more than meeting expectations. Earlier this month Gillette announced that it was launching its new Sensor Excel razor in the US market, backed with an Dollars 80m marketing campaign. In Europe, where the product was launched last year, it has taken nearly 9 per cent of the wet-shave razor market.</p>

			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Fishermen stage protest FISHERMEN marched through Edinburgh yesterday to demonstrate their anger at the EC common fisheries policy and at the UK government's policy towards the fishing industry. Fishermen say quotas imposed under the common fisheries policy are too tight and deprive fishermen of income, or 'criminalise' them by obliging them to sell illegally caught fish on the black market. In recent weeks Scottish boats have had to tie up in port after exhausting their quotas of haddock, while French and Spanish boats have landed legitimately caught fish in Scottish ports. The fishermen are also angry at the government's Seafish Conservation Bill, which was approved by the House of Commons this week. They believe the Pounds 25m it provides for decommissioning surplus boats is too little and the tie-up provisions are too draconian. Mr Elliot Morley, MP, Labour's fisheries spokesman, said the government's measures were 'too little, too late'. Instead of sensible and effective conservation measures, 'what we are getting is an inappropriate market approach that results in decommissioning by bankruptcy.' He said: 'The one thing this government has done for the fishing industry is to unite it.' Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party, warned the government that the campaign against its fisheries policy would continue 'until justice is achieved for fishing communities. 'People are rallying behind our fishermen in the same way they rallied behind the mining communities. We have the initiative and there is no mood to let it slip.' Police said about 3,500 fishermen took part in the march, which began within sight of Holyrood Palace, where the EC heads of government were meeting, and ended with a rally. Organisers called it the biggest ever protest by British fishermen. Meanwhile 1,200 ex-servicemen, clan chieftains and politicians demonstrated at Edinburgh Castle in protest at government plans to merge four Scottish regiments into two. The Keep our Scottish Battalions Campaign argues that the regimental cuts are excessive and are inappropriate for Scotland, which is one of the army's best recruiting areas.</p>

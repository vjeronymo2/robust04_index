			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] His Excellency [H.E.] Tie Banh, co-minister of  national defense of the Kingdom of Cambodia, separately met with  the Malaysian ambassador to Cambodia and a U.S. congressional  delegation at the Army Foreign Relations Department on 10  January.    After discussing with Malaysian Ambassador H.E. Deva Mohamed  Ridzam cooperation in the aviation sector, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh  briefed his guest on some events concerning the security problem  in the Kingdom of Cambodia. He said that tranquility is  prevailing across the country, except in some remote areas along  the northern border where the Khmer Rouge continue to conduct  their military activities and cause insecurity among the people.    H.E. Deva Mohamed Ridzam said from 1957 until it recovered  full independence and peace, Malaysia, like the Kingdom of  Cambodia, encountered the same security problem. The Malaysian  Government, however, adopted stringent measures against border  bandits until the country achieved genuine peace.    H.E. Gen. Tie Banh underlined that the insecurity problem in  the Kingdom of Cambodia is insignificant and that many countries  in Asia have also encountered this kind of problem. He said he  hoped that this problem would be settled in the near future.    Later, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh received Mr. Staffdel Wilson, vice  chairman of the U.S. Congressional Foreign Relations Committee.  [name and title as heard]    H.E. Charles Twining, U.S. ambassador to Cambodia, was also  present at the audience.    H.E. Gen. Tie Banh answered many questions posed by Mr.  Wilson, who wanted to become acquainted with the situation in  Cambodia. He particularly wanted to know about the outcome of  the process of merging the armed forces and about the Khmer  Rouge problem.    H.E. Gen. Tie Banh underlined that the Khmer Royal Armed  Forces, which is the merger of the troops of the three former  Cambodian parties, are continuing to carry out their tasks.  This constitutes a result that we have received with pride and  national reconciliation spirit. Soon, the Royal Government of  Cambodia [RGC] will arrange for some uniforms and settle the  remaining problems once and for all.    With regard to the Khmer Rouge issue, H.E. Gen. Tie Banh  pointed out that the RGC will allow them to join the government  if they correctly implement the three points requested by the  government.    Mr. Wilson thanked H.E. Gen. Tie Banh for his briefing and  expressed his pleasure with the political stability and security  in the Kingdom of Cambodia.    As for Ambassador Twining, he said that with the consent of  the U.S. Congress, the United States will give some materials to  the RGC; the latter will then give them to the groups of Khmer  Rouge which have returned to the national community and have  respected the Kingdom of Cambodia's Constitution. The United  States will also help restore some damaged roads. Mr. Twining  promised that he would continue to envision and provide aid  needed by the Kingdom of Cambodia.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: BERLIN;  </P> <P> A DOUBLE ANNIVERSARY  </P> <P> A series of official functions, including a plenary session in the old  Reichstag building of the German Parliament's upper house, will mark Friday's  first anniversary of the collapse of the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> In the 12 months since the announcement echoed around the world, much of the  wall has been completely removed, and within months the remnants are expected  to disappear.  </P> <P> Friday is also the anniversary of Crystal Night -- the 1938 attacks by Nazis  and their sympathizers on Jews and Jewish property that were an ominous hint of  the Holocaust to come.  </P></p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A claim that looks a loser Four years ago I made a substantial, unsecured, interest-free loan to a small private company in the UK of which I am a non-executive director but not a shareholder. The company has now gone into creditors' liquidation and there appears to be no likelihood of the loan being repaid to me. Would I succeed in claiming the amount of this loan as a deduction against my taxable income, which consists solely of earned income (ie, salary and bonus)? On these brief facts, we think you would not succeed. But you should consult your accountant for specific guidance. (Answer by Murray Johnstone Personal Management Ltd.)

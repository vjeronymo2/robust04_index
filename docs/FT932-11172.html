			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (9): Software medallist seeks IBM deal UNTIL now, the Bulgarian computer industry has been known in the west for its export of sophisticated computer viruses like the Dark Avenger. But now the Cold War is over, some of the country's talented computer hacks, trained in the years when Bulgaria was the main computer software and electronics producer within Comecon and the Warsaw Pact, are putting their skills to more profitable use, writes Virginia Marsh. Mr Todor Todorov is one such specialist turned entrepreneur. In March, SynthesisSoft, the company he set up with a friend in 1990, won a silver medal at CeBit, Europe's largest software exhibition, for its AlphaWin program which adds Cyrillic and other eastern European languages to Windows, the word processing and desk-top publishing program. 'The exhibition opened up many contacts for a small firm from a small country. We are now discussing joint development with a number of western companies.' says Mr Todorov, a modest 40-year-old who worked until 1990 in the computer department of the Bulgarian Sports Union. In particular, he is hoping the company will become an IBM developer. 'This would give us quick access to IBM databases and software tools, increasing our chances of coming up with good programs. Money isn't as much as a problem as lack of information - Bulgarian firms need access to the latest developments.' SynthesisSoft has already shown that much can be achieved on a shoestring budget. For the first two years, the company, working out of a small flat in Sofia's suburbs, raised capital by assembling computers for the home market from Taiwanese components. 'We always wanted to develop software but we had no money. A loan was too expensive - the lending rate is more than 60 per cent - and too risky in an industry like this where two years of research might have produced nothing.' Using profit gleaned from turnover of about Dollars 35,000 in 1990 and 1991, the company last year turned to developing and selling software. With the success of AlphaWin and of English-Russian and Bulgarian computer dictionaries, turnover jumped to Dollars 100,000 last year. Mr Todorov expects to double sales in 1993. In spite of the success at CeBit, Mr Todorov is looking for partnership only with western firms. 'We don't want to be bought out by one of the large computer companies - yet. We have many more ideas which we would prefer to work on first as a small unit.' Unlike many new entrepreneurs, he takes a long-term view. 'Many private firms are making money in trade and spending it on fast cars. We're trying to increase our scope by reinvesting our profits in more powerful computers.'</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON'S BILL FOR BONDHOLDERS  </P> <P> Your editorial represents the typical reaction of those untouched by this  affair. It drags out the old caveat emptor defense in the name of saving the  taxpayers for state and federal official errors and misdeeds.  </P> <P> At the time (while these bonds were being sold) almost everyone was fooled by  the fast-buck artistry of Keating and his cronies. Except for two or three  underling regulators, all the principals were fooled -- Alan Greenspan, our Fed  chairman, five or more senators and countless government agency heads. They  rushed to help Keating target a select group of savings and loan customers for  a neat sales scheme. This target of mostly naive elderly were fleeced of their  life savings by as clever a bait-and-switch operation as I have ever seen. And  it all happened inside the doors of a supposedly rock-solid, well-regulated  savings and loan office.  </P> <P> Your editorial puts you in bed with the principals in this case, who looked  around after it was disclosed and piously said "it wasn't my fault" or "they  were greedy." Let's face it, we were all fooled and you do a great disservice  by equating these bondholders with those who buy and sell bonds on the open  market. Only the small print buried inside the prospectus hints that these  bonds could never reach the open market and were forever locked inside Lincoln  Savings. There are too many dirty hands here for a caveat emptor defense.  Cranston is rightly trying to settle now, instead of later, a case that may  make the legal profession more wealthy at taxpayers' expense.  </P> <P> WILLIAM LUEDEKING  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

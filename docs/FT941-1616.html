			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Britannic Assurance rises 13.6% to Pounds 27.9m Britannic Assurance, the life assurance company, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 13.6 per cent to Pounds 27.9m in the year to December 31. Earnings per share rose 14 per cent to 14.4p, against 12.64p in 1992 after an adjustment for a capitalisation issue. Mr Brian Shaw, general manager and actuary, said: 'We think it was a further steady, sound year for Britannic. We were regarded as rather conservative a few years ago for sticking to our core business. That is now regarded as a rather sensible strategy.' The company said it had made a provision within its reserves to cover any compensation that might arise as a result of the Securities and Investments Board's review of the sale of personal pensions. Mr Shaw said the sum was not going to be material to profits or shareholders. Net premium income was Pounds 468m (Pounds 417m), including Pounds 126m (Pounds 123m) contributed by the company's industrial branch. General branch premium income rose to Pounds 34.8m (Pounds 30.5m). Life annual premiums were Pounds 58.4m (Pounds 53.8m) and single premiums were Pounds 51m (Pounds 32.7m). Pensions annual premiums were Pounds 37.6m (Pounds 33.4m), single premiums Pounds 76.6m (Pounds 73.3m) and contracted out rebates Pounds 83.6m (Pounds 70.6m). General branch pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.1m last year, compared with a loss of Pounds 414,000 in 1992. The underwriting division reported losses of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 3.7m deficit). This included a loss of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 2.8m loss) from property, of Pounds 615,000 (Pounds 1.1m loss) from motor, and a loss of Pounds 245,000 (Pounds 227,000 profit) from liability policies. Mr Shaw said that Britannic withdrew about 18 months ago from commercial insurance. The net dividend was up nearly 13 per cent to 12.6p. The tax charge fell 12 per cent to Pounds 774,000. The company made a Pounds 500,000 transfer to its claims equalisation provision. The shares fell 5p to 455p.</p>

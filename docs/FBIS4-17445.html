			<p>BFN     [Text] A Russian parliamentary delegation visiting Armenia  was due to visit on Sunday the front line in the republic's  current war with Armenia and Azerbaijan's districts along the  Armenian border, the Azerbaijani parliamentary press service  said.    It said the delegation, headed by Sergey Baburin, leader of  the Russian Pan-National Union, planned to make a report on the  situation in the war zone to the Russian parliament.    Baburin said in Baku on Saturday that he did not support  Russia's official position on the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict.  He said the aggressor was easy to identify, "must be curbed"  and leave the occupied lands. "The side which has seized the  lands is the aggressor," he said, meaning Armenia, at a meeting  with representatives of Azerbaijan's Russian-speaking community,  who said both the Azerbaijani government and the country's  society at large were friendly towards them. But they accused  Moscow of pursuing a pro-Armenian policy, which, they  complained, cast a shadow on that friendliness.    Baburin plans to return to Moscow on Monday.</p>

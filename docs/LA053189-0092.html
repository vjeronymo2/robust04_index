			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: IBM HONORS KUEHLER BY GIVING HIM TITLE OF PRESIDENT  </P> <P> International Business Machines gave its No. 2 executive, Jack D. Kuehler, the  title of president Tuesday in a move designed to recognize the one-time  engineer's long service to the huge computer company.  </P> <P> The switch, company officials said, is not expected to change either IBM's  daily operations or the long-range strategy.  </P> <P> Kuehler, who holds degrees in electrical and mechanical engineering, rose  through the company's technical ranks and joined the board in January, 1986. He  has served as IBM's vice chairman since January, 1988, and has been responsible  for overseeing IBM's sprawling U.S. operations. As president, his duties will  be little changed.  </P> <P> IBM Chairman and Chief Executive John F. Akers, 54, was the last IBM executive  to hold the presidency, but of late, the post has been vacant.  </P> <P> Although Kuehler's new title recognizes his individual achievement, it does not  settle the issue of who will replace Akers upon his retirement. IBM does not  have a mandatory retirement age, but top executives have traditionally given up  their jobs at age 60. A company spokesman said Kuehler, who turns 57 in August,  is expected to remain with the company about three more years, while Akers  could serve as chairman another six years.  </P> <P> "This is not a succession-oriented announcement; it is a recognition-oriented  announcement," the spokesman said. "This is flattering, positive recognition  for Jack Kuehler and his 31-year career at IBM. . . . Jack has been in the No.  2 position and he will continue to be."  </P> <P> An IBM spokesman said the plan to name Kuehler president came from Akers, who  wanted to give Kuehler a title that reflected a "more active" involvement in  the day-to-day operations of the company than vice chairman. The position of  vice chairman will be left vacant.  </P> <P> Kuehler is known within IBM as a technology expert in contrast to Akers, whose  main strength is in marketing. Educated at Santa Clara University, Kuehler  began with the company as an associate engineer at the San Jose Research  Laboratory in 1958. He was elected to the board in 1986 and appointed executive  vice president in March, 1987, before becoming vice chairman last year.  </P></p>

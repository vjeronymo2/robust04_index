			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRIAL ORDERED FOR 3 HELD IN 'NIGHTMARE' DOUBLE SLAYING, FIRE;  </P> <P> DRUGS: SURVIVOR DESCRIBES THE ATTACK. HEARING PROVIDES A GLIMPSE OF THE  MIDDLE-CLASS DRUG TRADE IN L.A.  </P> <P> Three men were ordered to stand trial Monday in a brutal, cocaine-related  double-murder case dubbed "Nightmare on Orange Grove."  </P> <P> Los Angeles Municipal Judge David M. Horwitz ordered that the three be held to  answer on seven counts -- including murder, attempted murder, burglary and  arson -- after a preliminary hearing that has been in progress sporadically  since April. The three will be arraigned in Superior Court on Nov. 28.  </P> <P> In an emotional finale to the proceedings, a victim who survived despite burns  over 80% of her body testified -- her head and hands still swathed in bandages.  </P> <P> She said that she and two other people were bound with electrical cords and  stuffed into a closet with pillowcases over their heads, then doused with  gasoline and set afire last Jan. 30 during the course of a robbery.  </P> <P> The 33-year-old survivor -- who described herself as a former secretary who  became a $400-a-week drug messenger for one of the victims -- testified that  she was also raped and shot but managed to flee the fire-engulfed building.  </P> <P> The charred remains of Lee Gottstein, 57, and his wife, Sylvia Carruth, 45,  were found by firefighters in an upstairs closet in their Spanish Colonial  fourplex on South Orange Grove Avenue in the Mid-City area. Authorities said  they died of asphyxiation.  </P> <P> The three suspects -- Lonnie Lewis, 29; his brother, Jerome Martin, 22, and  Derek Bloodworth, 26 -- could receive the death penalty if convicted in the  special-circumstances case. Martin was also ordered to stand trial on a rape  charge.  </P> <P> The proceedings offered a glimpse of the middle-class drug trade in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> Gottstein apparently oversaw a flourishing rock cocaine business from the  Orange Grove address and a second apartment on Crescent Heights Boulevard,  where the drugs were stored, according to testimony from his surviving  employee.  </P> <P> She said she delivered small rocks in plastic bags to addresses all over town,  collecting $50 for each. She also smoked cocaine, she admitted, "but never  during working hours."  </P> <P> Under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia Wilkinson, the survivor --  whose name is not being published because she is an alleged rape victim --  described the events leading up to the robbery and murders, breaking down in  sobs as she told of lapsing into unconsciousness and waking up at County-USC  Medical Center.  </P> <P> The woman said she had known "Lee and Sylvia" for several months before "the  accident." They had gone to a play and dinner on Jan. 30, then returned to the  Orange Grove apartment, where she and Sylvia did "just a little" drugs and were  feeling mellow and talkative. They were listening to the stereo in an upstairs  guest den when, the witness said, Gottstein received a call and then a visit  from a man she knew only as "Lonnie," who was accompanied by his brother.  </P> <P> After hearing "a thumping noise like someone being thrown against a wall," the  women were called downstairs, where they were forced at gunpoint to lie down on  the floor, she said.  </P> <P> "They kept telling us not to say a word; that if we did, they'd blow our heads  off," the woman testified.  </P> <P> After more than an hour, during which she was raped, the woman said the three  victims were marched upstairs, where the bedroom had been ransacked. The  brothers tied their hands behind their backs, put pillow cases over their heads  and ordered them into a walk-in closet.  </P> <P> "Lee was begging and pleading with them not to do it that way . . . that it  didn't have to be that way," the woman said. "Sylvia was crying.  </P> <P> "They poured gasoline in the closet, then I could hear something being pushed  up against the door and they lit the match. I could hear screaming."  </P> <P> After pushing her way out of the closet, the woman said she tried to hide under  the bed but was shot in the arm and buttocks and left for dead by a man wearing  red and white Nike shoes and gray jeans, the clothes she remembered Lewis  wearing.  </P> <P> She waited a few minutes, then fled the burning house, doused her burns with  water and lay on the lawn until paramedics arrived. She said she was  hospitalized for six months.  </P> <P> Police reported finding Bloodworth sleeping in a garage two blocks away with  stolen jewelry belonging to the Gottsteins in his possession. Lewis was  arrested a few days later in Green River, Utah, Martin in Denver. All three are  being held without bail.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Joel Isaacson, who represents Lewis, said the defense will  attempt to show at the trial that the prosecution's star witness was so "based  out" on cocaine on the murder night that she was unable to perceive and recall  accurately, or perhaps that she was herself involved in a plan that went awry  and purposely "fingered" the wrong suspects.  </P></p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: Property losses hit results at Bouygues Bouygues, France's largest construction group, yesterday announced a sharp fall in estimated net profits for last year, to FFr450m (Dollars 76m) from FFr685m, as a result of losses in its property division. The company said the expected 34 per cent decline in profits, which was larger than most analysts had forecast, was caused by property losses of FFr150m. Its other activities, in construction, media and engineering, had resisted the effects of recession, increasing net profits slightly to FFr600m. The dividend was maintained at FFr16 per share. The decline in property activities, which were profitable in 1992, was blamed on what the company described as the worst downturn the market had experienced. Bouygues' strong presence in the Parisian property market, one of the areas most seriously affected by the downturn, compounded the impact. The weak state of the property market was also reflected in the level of sales in the division, which totalled FFr4.3bn last year, a fall of more than one-fifth from 1992. Bouygues said it saw little immediate prospect of a recovery in the property market and forecast another steep decline in sales this year, to FFr3.3bn. Group sales fell to FFr59.7bn from FFr62.7bn. For 1994, Bouygues forecast turnover of just under FFr59bn, reflecting the decline in property sales. Bouygues is seeking to expand its activities in telecommunications. In particular, the group intends to bid for a third mobile telephone licence to be awarded by the French government later this year.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alejandra Costamagna] </F>   [Text] When all the negotiating juggling tricks seemed  exhausted, patience took a back seat to reason and the  longed-for statement was spoken by Finance Minister Alejandro  Foxley: "There is agreement on the subordinated debt."    After several days of adroit maneuvering, the principal  negotiators met yesterday, 14 January, on the subject that had  delayed the approval of the project to modernize banks and to  propose a new solution to the problem of the subordinated debt.    Sebastian Pinera, Jaime Orpis, Andres Zaldivar, Jaime  Gazmuri, Jaime Estevez, Jose Florencio Guzman (superintendent of  banks and financial institutions), Patricio Arrau (advisor to  the Ministry of Finance), Jorge Marshall (vice president of the  Central Bank), Camilo Carrasco (director of financial policy at  the Central Bank) and Minister Foxley took six hours to work out  the final details of the accord.    The document establishes a minimum term of 40 years and a  schedule of payments on the subordinated debt ($3.8 billion)  that 10 banks have pending with the Central Bank since the  financial crisis of 1982. The institutions concerned must make  their annual payments with the percentage of their surpluses  which currently are due to the Central Bank and, if this is  insufficient, they must make payment through increases in their  capital or with bonds convertible into shares.    The most controversial subject until yesterday had been the  determination of the value of those bonds. While the government  maintained that the value should be responsive to determination  by the market, the opposition argued that the value should be a  nominal figure. Foxley explained that the matter was resolved by  establishing an average market price "plus a surcharge that  would reflect their increased value anticipated at auction."  Although this amount was not specified, it was estimated that it  could vary between 10 and 15 percent, so that it would not  represent a loss for the Central Bank.    The text made clear that preferred stockholders would have  the first option to subscribe to these bonds convertible into  shares.    Amid smiles that combined satisfaction with fatigue, the  expectation for the vote on Tuesday, 18 January, is one of  complete optimism, because the agreement rules out the awful  possibility that the Concertation might vote against the idea of  legislating, which would have meant the postponement of the  matter for a year.    A decision regarding treatment of portfolio bills of sale  [letra por venta de cartera] is still pending. But among  congressmen there was agreement in their disagreement. Although  this may seem paradoxical, it means that they will make every  effort to reach agreement by Tuesday. If no agreement is  reached, the matter will be resolved in the legislative process.  "This is not going to be an obstacle to the proposal's  approval," was stated more than once.    What remains to be done before Tuesday (which ceased to be  "D-Day" to become a kind of confirmatory day) is the meeting  that the protagonists will hold to ratify these agreements and  formalize them in a document.  <H5>  [Box, p 16] </H5> <H5>  The Four Points of the Agreement </H5>   The agreement that emerged after six hours of discussion in  Minister Foxley's office can be summarized in four points:    1. Establish a minimum term and a schedule of payments on  the  subordinated debt so that the debt will no longer have an  indefinite term.    2. Banks with subordinated debt must make their annual  payments with the percentage of their surpluses that currently  are due to the Central Bank. If this is insufficient, they must  make payment through increases in their capital or with bonds  convertible into shares, according to the circumstances.    3. The value of these bonds will be determined by the  average  market price, plus a surcharge that reflects their increased  value anticipated at auction.    4. Preferred stockholders will always have the first option  to subscribe to these bonds convertible into shares.  <H5>  Pending </H5>   * A decision regarding the treatment of portfolio bills of  sale is still pending. If agreement is not reached, the matter  will be resolved in the legislative process.</p>

Biggar,  who had a master's degree in dairy farming and economics from South Dakota  State University, used that background to develop weather and farm market  reports for his rural audiences.  </P> <P> At WLW in Cincinnati, he started several on-site farm broadcasts, including a  program from the station's own 137-acre farm.  </P> <P> Biggar later was considered an authority on folk, country and Western music  because of his years as a program director and general manager at various  stations in Indiana and Iowa.  </P> <P> He moved from Orange County to West Covina and then to North Dakota in 1983.  </P> <P> Biggar, a widower, is survived by daughter Elizabeth Hare, sons George C.

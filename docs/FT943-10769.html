			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: The price of delay The City has been spared a rate rise this week, but the Bank of England's inflation report leaves little doubt that it is looking for one in the not too distant future. The longer term aim is to have underlying inflation in the lower half of its target range by the end of the current parliament. Since changes in monetary policy take about two years to have the desired impact, action needs to be taken soon if that aim is to be achieved. The difficulty lies in choosing the moment, however. If it acts too soon and the recovery falters, the Bank will suffer as much damage to its credibility as it would by dithering. The new report may have made its task harder. Though output is growing faster than the Bank assumed in May, its expectations of inflation have been trimmed back with a neat downward tick in 1996 as the impact of higher VAT on fuel drops out of the equation. But if the outlook really is that benign, it is hard to see how the Bank will justify rate rises to a reluctant government. Yesterday financial markets seemed inclined to believe its projections. Both gilts and equities are cheap if they are right. Gilts were factoring in excessive inflationary expectations, while equities could sustain higher ratings if price rises are contained. But the excitement may be premature. The Bank appears to be waiting for clear signs of short-run inflationary pressures to push through a rate rise. By the time these appear it may be too late to achieve its medium-term objective.</p>

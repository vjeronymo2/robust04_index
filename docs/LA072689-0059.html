			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA  </P> <P> A Chula Vista insurance broker charged with faking a death to collect on a life  insurance policy pleaded guilty to federal mail-fraud charges Tuesday before  the scheduled start of his trial.  </P> <P> Prosecutors had accused Arsenio Albert Ainza of submitting a fraudulent  $200,000 life insurance claim on behalf of an accomplice, complete with  cremated human remains purported to be those of the deceased, according to  Assistant U.S. Atty. Carol C. Lam. After the Transamerica Occidental Life  Insurance Co. paid the claim, its investigators found the "dead" policyholder  living in Ensenada, Mexico, Lam said.  </P> <P> Ainza, whose trial was to begin Tuesday before U. S. District Judge J. Lawrence  Irving, pleaded guilty after working out an agreement with prosecutors,  according to Lam. In exchange for his plea, no charges will be filed against  him in a similar case involving the Sovereign Life Insurance Co., Lam said.  </P> <P> Ainza's wife, Anna S. Ainza, pleaded guilty Monday to obstructing the mails in  the Sovereign Life case. Lam said she will recommend probation for Anna Ainza.  Arsenio Ainza faces a maximum sentence of five years, she said. Both remain  free on a $50,000 bond, pending sentencing Oct. 16.  </P></p>

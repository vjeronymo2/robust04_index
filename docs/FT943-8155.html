			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Western Mining studies plan for big expansion at Olympic Dam Western Mining Corporation, one of Australia's biggest mining groups, is to begin a feasibility study into a major expansion of its copper, gold and uranium mine at Olympic Dam in South Australia. The company has been upgrading the mine operations during the past two years, but the longer term plan is to double the size of the project. In 1993-94, Olympic Dam produced 56,684 tonnes of refined copper, 1,289 tonnes of uranium oxide, 25,968 troy ounces of gold and 423,374 ounces of silver. Current upgrading programmes costing the company ADollars 88m are expected to increase production in 1995 to 84,000 tonnes of copper and 1,500 tonnes of uranium oxide. The South Australian government, which announced the feasibility study, is holding discussions with the federal government to help ensure that the expansion project goes ahead. The South Australian economy stands to gain from the project as it is expected that 50 per cent of the spending on supplies and manpower will be in the state. One issue that needs to be resolved is a proposed World Heritage listing of the Lake Eyre region of South Australia. The Olympic Dam operations draw water from borefields near the lake.</p>

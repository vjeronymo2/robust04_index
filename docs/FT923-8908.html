			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Henlys in export deal with Volvo Bus HENLYS GROUP, the motor trader, bus and coach body builder and distributor, has agreed an export and technical deal with Volvo Bus, the bus manufacturer. Yesterday was the second closing date of a Pounds 22.9m hostile bid for Henlys from T Cowie, a rival motor trader with bus and coach activities. The offer was extended to August 14. Cowie's 1-for-2 share offer is worth 60 1/2 p per Henlys share. Cowie's shares closed yesterday at 121p, down 3p, and Henlys' at 69p, down 1p. The export agreement involves Volvo Bus acting as distributor for Henlys' Plaxton coaches in Europe and around the world, with a target of 200 coaches a year, worth Pounds 15m. This is to run for five years from October 1. Henlys currently only supplies the UK market for coaches, but has been looking to build up exports. There is also a technical co-operation agreement, under which Volvo will provide two production managers for Plaxton's plant in Scarborough.</p>

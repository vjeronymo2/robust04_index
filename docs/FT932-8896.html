			<p>930517 FT  17 MAY 93 / Danish Referendum: UK minister reveals vote desperation A SENIOR British minister yesterday underlined how desperate the government is for a favourable outcome in tomorrow's Danish referendum on Maastricht by warning that a No vote would have 'a fairly devastating effect'. On the BBC's Breakfast with Frost programme, Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said a No would 'send shocks through western Europe'. He added it would dent his personal optimism that a 'fairly dreadful' year was improving. The referendum comes as British Prime Minister John Major attempts to reassert his authority after this month's Conservative party election disasters. He began this process last week with a determined speech to the Scottish Conservative Conference. A Danish No would deal a telling blow to the rehabilitation process, however. Separately, Sir Edward Heath, the former Conservative prime minister, launched a devastating attack on the Tory Euro-sceptics, saying they would be hated for the rest of their political lives. On BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Sir Edward said people were 'furious at this small band of sceptics holding everything up month after month after month - absolutely furious.' He added: 'These people are going to be hated for all time. Think what they have done to our party.' Mr Clarke said a No vote would result in 'a period of difficult rethinking' on Europe which 'may well not emerge with solutions which the Euro-sceptics would like at all'. Member states 'would have to consider how to continue to develop the EC despite the Danish rejection'. He indicated Britain would be reluctant to press on without Denmark. Mr Clarke was also at pains to reassure those who have expressed concern about the consequences of the Maastricht treaty's ratification that a Yes vote tomorrow would not encourage the government to just charge on with the European agenda. 'I do think it is extremely important. . . that we pro-Europeans remember the experience of Maastricht,' he said. 'We went absolutely to the limits of keeping public opinion with us in the UK, in Denmark, France and elsewhere. We have to put in place the bits of Maastricht that reassured people.'</p>

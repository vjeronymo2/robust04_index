			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Compare  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section 110(a)(2)(A) and (C) with section 161. In light of this ambiguity in the use of the term ``measure,'' the USEPA believes that the term ``measure'' as used in section 175A(d) may be interpreted so as not to include NSR permitting programs. That this is an appropriate interpretation is further supported by USEPA's historical practice dating back even before the 1990 CAA, of not requiring redesignating areas to demonstrate through modeling or otherwise a justification for replacing the nonattainment NSR program with the PSD program once an area was redesignated. Rather the USEPA has historically allowed the NSR program to be automatically replaced by the PSD program upon redesignation. Michigan has presented an adequate demonstration that the State has met all the requirements applicable to the area under section 110 and part D. The final approval of this redesignation request is contingent on the final approval of the SIP submittals as noted above. These requirements, their applicability and status are discussed in more detail in the USEPA's Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Fully Approved SIP Under Section 110(k) of the Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In other sections of this action, USEPA is proposing approval of the 1990 base year emission inventory and basic I/M (meeting the criteria of the June 28, 1994 proposed I/M Redesignation Rule). The SIP submittals for satisfying the requirements for VOC RACT catch-ups, and fix-ups are being acted upon in a separate action. The 182(f) NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption petition also is being acted upon in a separate action. Once USEPA fully approves these submittals, the State will have a fully approved SIP under section 110(k), which also meets the applicable requirements of section 110 and part D as discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Improvement in Air Quality Due to Permanent and Enforceable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the pre-amended Act, USEPA approved the Michigan SIP control strategy for the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment area, satisfied that the rules and the emission reductions achieved as a result of those rules were enforceable. Furthermore, numerous Federal measures apply to the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. The State provided a detailed discussion of the development of the emission reductions of ozone precursors (VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) from 1988&hyph;1993. The State attributed the improvement in air quality that led to attainment of the ozone NAAQS to the federally enforceable Federal Motor Vehicle Control Program (FMVCP) and lower Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  control measures. The emission reductions achieved from 1988 through 1993 are 226 tons VOC (21 percent) and 45 tons of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (3.4 percent) per day. In association with its emission inventory discussed below, the State demonstrated that point source VOC emissions were not artificially low due to local economic downturn. This was accomplished by setting all growth factors at a minimum value of 1.0 for 1990 and beyond. The USEPA finds that the combination of existing USEPA-approved SIP and Federal measures contribute to the permanence and enforceability of reduction in ambient ozone levels that have allowed the area to attain the NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> VOC emission reductions, in part, resulted from RVP reductions from 11.0 psi in 1988 to 9.0 psi in 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Fully Approved Maintenance Plan Under Section 175A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 175A of the Act sets forth the elements of a maintenance plan for areas seeking redesignation from nonattainment to attainment. The plan must demonstrate continued attainment of the applicable NAAQS for at least 10 years after the Administrator approves a redesignation to attainment. Eight years after the redesignation, the State must submit a revised maintenance plan which demonstrates attainment for the 10 years following the initial 10-year period. To provide for the possibility of future NAAQS violations, the maintenance plan must contain contingency measures, with a schedule for implementation, adequate to assure prompt correction of any air quality problems. Section 175A(d) requires that the contingency provisions include a requirement that the State will implement all control measures that were contained in the SIP prior to redesignation as an attainment area. In this action, USEPA is proposing approval of the State of Michigan's maintenance plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area because USEPA finds that Michigan's submittal meets the requirements of section 175A provided that the State's contingency measures that were required as SIP revisions prior to the submission of the redesignation request are fully approved. If USEPA determines after notice and comment that it should give final approval to the maintenance plan, the Detroit-Ann Arbor nonattainment area will have a fully approved maintenance plan in accordance with section 175A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

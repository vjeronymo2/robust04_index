			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Management: Flexibility is all in a year's work / A look at one company's experience of introducing an annualised hours system Joe Pluck cannot call his free time his own. 'Whatever you are doing, however special the occasion, they can ask you to come in and work. It really is selling your soul to the company,' he says. In January 1990, his employer, Van den Berghs &amp; Jergens, a margarine-making subsidiary of Unilever, switched from calculating his hours per week to hours per year. His total of 2,061 hours includes 282 which the company does not timetable. Pluck is paid whether he works the hours or not but he may have to work them at very short notice as stand-by for unexpected absence or surges in demand. Pluck, a shop steward, recommended the annualised hours system and measures to aid flexible working to the 750-strong workforce. Since then, he has had some second thoughts, especially about being on stand-by, but both he and most employees broadly support the new system. Van den Berghs &amp; Jergens is typical of employers which introduce annualised hours. The transformation of working practices has been self-financing while the workforce has declined to 680. The company moved from five- to seven-day working, increased productivity and output while at the same time, it abolished the paid overtime which had added as much as 100 per cent to the basic pay of some employees. The annualised hours system is spreading and now covers 6 per cent of British employees, according to the Department of Employment. The system was first introduced by continuous process manufacturers in paper and board, glass, cement and chemicals. Now, white-collar employers such as the Bristol and West Building Society and various media organisations are adopting it. Andy Speak, personnel manager at Van den Berghs &amp; Jergens, says: 'We no longer have overtime working and we are using our assets to expand the factory.' However a 1991 study by the Incomes Data Services research group found employee reaction to annualised hours was more mixed in spite of the advantages of a shorter working week and more predictable earnings. At the margarine plant, the transformation has certainly been radical. In the first eight months of 1989, average overtime per head was between 48 and 66 hours a month. In the same period in 1990, the average number of stand-by hours, a form of pre-paid overtime, was 0.7 and 2.4 hours per person per month. The unions estimate that about 40 per cent of employees, mainly those who did a lot of overtime, saw their earnings decrease - by between Pounds 200 and Pounds 3,000 a year. They were generally prepared to exchange cash for leisure time and the security of a regular monthly pay check. Pluck, whose own earnings dropped by about Pounds 5,000 a year to Pounds 20,500, says: 'We may have had high earnings before but it was no quality of life having to work all the time to maintain that income'. Most early glitches in the scheme were associated with the unpopular stand-by system. Attempts by management to call in people to cover for people on training courses, when the company began a total quality management course, were met with fury. Originally employees rostered on stand-by were required to stay by their telephones. Many found good reasons why this was impossible. Eventually the company introduced a freefone and employees on stand-by are now required to telephone the plant regularly. As Danny Pyman, also a shop steward, says: 'It is very difficult to make it clear to people that they have already been paid for the extra 12-hour shift they were called in for at very short notice and which has ruined their plans for a family barbecue.' IDS says workers at some companies have complained that annualised hours discriminates against part-time workers with family responsibilities, but nobody believes this has been a problem at Van den Berghs and Jergens. However, groups of specialist employees have found the stand-by system particularly onerous. A more fundamental problem, but not one specific to annualised hours agreements, has been new managers appointed with little understanding of the spirit of the original agreement, say the unions. Pyman, who was involved in negotiating the original deal, speaks of the atmosphere at the time with a nostalgic reverence: 'It was a whole new way of life. They would trust us and we would trust them. For most of the 28 years I have worked for this company, I completely distrusted management and they completely distrusted me. But we were committed to a new start.' Pyman says the pioneering ethos led him to agree to the management's request that there should be some slack in the contract. 'The personnel manager said to us that he didn't want everything written in tablets of stone and we agreed.' It is a decision he now regrets saying that newly-appointed managers are sticking to the letter and not the spirit of the agreement. Some older workers left because they were unable to cope with the weekend working and their pensions were pegged to the higher basic wages they were paid when overtime ended. Similarly, employees who fall ill no longer face a dramatic drop in income because sick pay reflects earnings more accurately. Pyman is clear that he began negotiations because he feared the consequences of outright rejection and hoped to minimise job losses. Today he is facing early retirement which the company says is voluntary. He says the contraction in the workforce following increased efficiency from the new package has given the management the grounds to argue that the plant no longer needs full-time union officials: 'We sold the damn deal to a sceptical membership, loyalty is poorly rewarded,' he says.</p>

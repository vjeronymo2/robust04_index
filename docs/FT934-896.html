Unilever leapfrogs arch-rival Nestle to become market leader, while BSN picks up a frozen foods business. Only 18 months ago, Riboud was using his famed political and business connections to help Nestle outsmart his old buddy, Gianni Agnelli, for control of the Perrier mineral water business. But while Riboud may pose as power-broker at home, his manoeuvrings are starting to look increasingly like attempts by a second-rank food multinational to snatch crumbs from the big boys' table. How much longer will they keep throwing him scraps?</p>

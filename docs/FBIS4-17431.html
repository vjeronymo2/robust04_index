			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Menzere Sadikova from National Assembly session </F> held in Baku on 22 April--recorded]    [Text] [Begin Sadikova recording] Chairman of the  Parliament Rasul Guliyev informed the deputies during the  morning session of the National Assembly that an Azerbaijani  parliamentary delegation headed by him will visit Moscow on 25  April for talks with the Russian leaders, who want to act as a  mediator in a peaceful settlement of the Azerbaijani-Armenian  conflict. Talks will also be held at the Russian Duma during  the four-day visit. Therefore, he said, it would be appropriate  if the assembly first debated the relevant draft document  presented at the latest meeting of the CIS heads of state in  Moscow.    The speaker's proposal was accepted. Before discussing the  agenda, the deputies heard a report from the republic's defense  minister on the situation at the front during the past 10 days.    Afterwards, the session approved the agenda, which included  the bills on [words indistinct] and the draft agreement  submitted by Moscow on ending the armed conflict and eliminating  its consequences.    Speaking at the parliament, Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov  explained in detail the draft agreement on ending the armed  conflict and eliminating its consequences, noted those  provisions in this document unfavorable for Azerbaijan, and  stated the position of our Foreign Ministry. Although a number  of deputies firmly opposed the discussion of this draft at the  parliament because many provisions in the proposed document are  discordant with the Azerbaijani Republic's Constitution and laws  and with the interests of the state and people, the majority  supported its discussion. A proposal was made to draw up a new  alternative document that would be in line with our Constitution  and national interest.    During the afternoon session, the members of the parliament  had a serious discussion of the draft agreement on ending the  war and eliminating its consequences, which was proposed by  Moscow and which the Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan was  ready to sign, and expressed their assessment and views. The  general opinion was that holding peace talks is imperative and  the necessary documents should be prepared and submitted to the  mediating states. Our Foreign Ministry was asked to work on the  discussed draft and bring it in line with Azerbaijan's national  interests and Constitution.    Later, the National Assembly started debating the other  issues on the agenda. [end recording]</p>

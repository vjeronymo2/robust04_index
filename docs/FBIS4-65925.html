			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Slow Growth for Netherlands </F> Economy"]    [Text] The growth of the Netherlands economy in the next  few years looks set to be just above the European average, while  Europe as a whole is going to lag behind Japan and the United  States. These forecasts are made in the report entitled "Europe  in 1998," published today by the Netherlands Economic Institute  in Rotterdam.    The Netherlands economy will grow by 1.9 percent until 1998,  while the European Union (EU) average will grow by 1.8 percent,  the institute predicts. The recovery of the European economy  thus looks set to be far from vigorous and will certainly not be  enough to solve the unemployment problem. After 1996, growth is  even set to fall off again, according to the institute's  computing models. During the period 1992-1998, the United States  and Japan should experience a 2.6 percent growth.    Europe must come to terms with the fact that most growth is  going to come from Asia and the developing countries, the  researchers write. These countries are set to experience growth  of 6.9 percent and 4 percent, respectively, over the same  period. The report states that it will not be enough to count  on technological innovation alone. New products must also be  linked to new forms of services, and at low prices. Europe must  develop new mass consumer goods. Education, technology and,  most importantly, the transfer of technical know-how must all be  stimulated. As in the NAFTA countries (United States, Canada  and the developing country Mexico), benefit must be drawn from  the low labor costs in East Europe by closely involving the East  European countries in the EU.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour attacks Tory hopes for tax reductions - Economy LABOUR yesterday sought to keep the political spotlight on the Tories' hopes for tax cuts in the Budget by reaffirming its determination that any extra borrowing should be for investment. Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said a Labour government would split Britain's national accounts into current and capital components. This would make clear how borrowings were being used. Mr Kenneth Baker, home secretary, reinforced the conviction of most MPs that April 9 has been set as the general election date. He said on BBC television: 'There is a great deal of electioneering going on and I expect the country wants to bring it to a head.' Although Mrs Beckett did not say how borrowing would increase or fall under Labour, she said that to allow the public sector borrowing requirement as a share of gross domestic product to rise as high as 5 per cent 'would be very much pushing our luck'. She condemned as 'extra-ordinarily irresponsible' suggestions by some Tories that it would be prudent to increase the PSBR to pay for tax cuts in the March 10 Budget. Such a move would be 'political chicanery of a high order'. Her comments underlined Labour determination at least to match the Tories' claims to financial caution and to respect rules on financial deficits - agreed at the European Community summit in Maastricht - while accepting that higher borrowing is inevitable in a recession. Meanwhile, following attacks over the weekend by Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, Downing Street redefined a claim by Mr John Major last week that the British economy had grown faster than that of any other European country between 1981 and 1991. A senior official said that, according to OECD figures, the UK's growth rate had been higher than that of other 'major' EC countries, except Spain, from 1980 to 1990. However, smaller EC countries with a higher growth rate over the same period were Portugal, Ireland and Luxembourg. Mrs Beckett warned that Tories may be 'massaging expectations' about the Budget so that a PSBR forecast of below Pounds 30bn would be regarded as cautious. Under Labour's plans for the national accounts it would be clear whether increases in PSBR were used for capital expenditure. Excess spending over revenue on the current account would be corrected over the economic cycle. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's employment spokesman, launched a further attack at a Westminster press conference on the government's unemployment record. A Labour adaption of the 1979 Conservative jobless queue poster 'Labour isn't working' read 'Majorism isn't working'. Mr Blair said comparative figures showed that the south-east of England had the fastest rising unemployment of any region of Europe and that the UK had suffered 'far and away the sharpest fall' in employment of any EC country. A Labour study, based on job losses reported in newspapers, suggested that UK job losses have exceeded 56,000 since the beginning of the year.</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Lib Dems scorn idea of deals with Tories: Move to drop 'equidistance' from rivals brings angry response from leader as party gathers in Brighton The Liberal Democrats yesterday abandoned their neutrality between the Conservatives and Labour as a raft of senior figures insisted there were no circumstances in which the party could help keep the present government in office after the next general election. But the decision by leading Liberal Democrats to drop publicly the stance of 'equidistance' adopted since the 1992 general election brought an angry response from Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader. In spite of an oblique admission in a speech last night that he accepted the present stance was unsustainable, Mr Ashdown said colleagues indulging in public debate on the issue were 'wasting very important time'. Mr Ashdown said at the start of the Liberal Democrat conference in Brighton that the party's main task was to entrench its own distinctive and independent identity as a powerful third force in British politics. His comments followed public statements by Lord Jenkins, the leader of the party in the Lords, Baroness Williams and Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment spokesmen in the Commons. They welcomed the election of Mr Tony Blair as the leader of the Labour party. Lord Jenkins and Lady Williams, both founder members of the defunct SDP, said there could be no question of the Liberal Democrats helping the Conservatives remain in office for a fifth term. Mr Simon Hughes, an influential figure from the old Liberal rather than the SDP wing of the party, took up a similar theme. He rejected any notion of pre-election pacts with Labour but told journalists in Brighton: 'The one thing in my view that is ruled out is we and the Tories doing a deal.' In his speech at a pre-conference rally Mr Ashdown said: 'I do not rule out co-operation for the common good if we find there are others of like mind.' But he added: 'We are the enemies of old-style Labourism quite as much as of new-style doctrinaire Conservatism.' He made clear that he wanted to wait and see the extent to which Mr Blair reformed the Labour party before joining his colleagues in publicly rejecting neutrality. Labour similarly dismissed any talk of pacts. Mr John Prescott, the deputy leader, said: 'They are not acceptable. We don't need them and the country wants a distinct alternative.'</p>

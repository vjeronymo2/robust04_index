			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / How investment authority will police financial services The publication yesterday of the two papers - the prospectus for the Personal Investment Authority and the more detailed approach to regulation - will have companies and individuals in the financial services industry poring over the small print in the days ahead. While there have been criticisms and concerns about what the proposed new regulator will do and how it will work, the industry has consistently said that it is the prospectus that will determine whether there is a queue to join the regulator or a further attempt to find another solution. How the PIA will operate: It will have a board of 21 members, made up of 10 active practitioners, 10 public-interest directors including the chairman, and the chief executive. The board can be smaller, but must include equal numbers of practitioners and public-interest directors. It will have an audit committee to oversee its budget, and a nominations committee to advise on board composition. The membership committee, which will decide all matters relating to admissions, and the disciplinary committee, may both include non-board members. The PIA will hold a range of working groups and task forces to advise on specific issues, as a way of bringing in practitioner input while maintaining a 'lean and flexible' committee structure. It will also establish a small business practitioner panel to review the regulatory proposals and practices to assess 'the most effective ways in which PIA can ensure that its standards are being delivered by its smaller members'. Costs, fees and compensation: Costs for the first full year, from mid-July when the PIA expects to become operational, are Pounds 29.5m. This includes a Pounds 5.5m levy to the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, and Pounds 1m to cover the costs of an ombudsman scheme and arbitration. To raise revenue, fees to individuals and companies that are members of existing regulators are to rise by 18 per cent, in a flat increase across all members of the new regulator. This structure of determining fees will operate for at least the first two years. The basis for membership subscriptions cannot be changed without the support of at least four-fifths of the board. Firms applying to be members of the PIA will be charged Pounds 1,500, except for those seeking to transfer from an existing regulator before the PIA itself becomes operational. On compensation, the PIA has to work within SIB plans to put a limit on the investors' compensation scheme of Pounds 100m in any one year with no scope for cross-subsidy. The PIA will seek to limit members' liability to Pounds 50m in any year by borrowing or getting insurance cover for the second Pounds 50m of the scheme. Independent practitioners will meet the first Pounds 5m of any compensation claims, but the system for splitting costs above that with life companies should make the maximum exposure for independent practitioners in any year Pounds 9.5m. Compensation liabilities arising from pension-transfer business, which is the subject of a separate inquiry by SIB, will not come under these arrangements but the aim is that there should be 'the same level of investor protection as in other cases of default'. Joining the PIA: The admissions process is intended to establish members' honesty and reputation; solvency and financial standing; and competence and organisation. Questions will include: Are any benefits given which might give rise to mis-selling? Has the member made any claims on its professional indemnity insurance policy since 1991? Has the member satisfactory systems to monitor the quality of advice? No firm will be admitted without the PIA reviewing its standards, but maximum use will be made of information already available to regulators. Information will also come from other sources, including prudential regulators such as the Bank of England and the Department of Trade and Industry. Applicants will be accepted unconditionally, rejected, or accepted subject to certain conditions that must be met within a few months. Conditional acceptance might involve a restriction on the range of business a member could conduct, or require it to make improvements in, say, training within a certain time. The 70 staff assessing membership applications will be drawn from existing regulators but will be trained to the PIA's own standards. No member will be allowed to handle clients' money unless at least two independent individuals are involved in the day-to-day conduct of its investment business. The design and delivery of the admissions process for transferring firms will be audited by a team of senior regulators, which will report directly to the PIA chief executive. Application forms should be returned by April 5. Requirements of membership: Initially, members should comply with the training and competence arrangements laid down by their existing regulator. The PIA intends to introduce its own scheme during 1995. Members will have to maintain a minimum of Pounds 10,000 capital in their 'own funds'. Larger members will face higher requirements, as will those that handle clients' money. Some classes of members must maintain suitable professional indemnity insurance, and ensure that their appointed representatives have suitable cover. The PIA will categorise all its members as either high-, medium- or low-risk, depending on the type of business carried out and the nature of the firm. The categorisations will be kept secret within the PIA. Every high-risk member will be visited at least once every 12 months, every medium-risk member at least once every 24 months, and every low-risk member at least once every 30 months. At least 5 per cent of PIA members every year will get a surprise inspection visit. There will be a three-tier discipline scheme, made up of the disciplinary committee, the membership and disciplinary tribunal, and an appeal commissioner. Sanctions will range from public or private reprimands, through fines, restrictions and remedial action, to expulsion. PIA's service to investors: A consumer panel of 10 to 15 members will be set up to advise the PIA board on the concerns of private investors. It will make an annual report on the PIA's effectiveness and be consulted on proposals which affect investor protection. If a complaint to a member is not settled within two months, then the customer must be told of the right to refer the matter to the PIA ombudsman. The ombudsman may make awards of up to Pounds 50,000 and can recommend more than this. Members can also choose to be subject to the ombudsman for business outside the PIA's scope, with a limit on awards in this area at Pounds 100 000. The PIA will have a complaints commissioner who will look at the way it deals with complaints against itself.</p>

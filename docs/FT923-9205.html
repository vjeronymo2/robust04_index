			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Malaysia stays closure of plant said to be emitting radioactive gas THE Malaysian Supreme Court has ruled that a Japanese-controlled company allegedly emitting quantities of radioactive gas can continue operations, pending an appeal against an earlier shut-down order. The Asian Rare Earth company, 35 per cent owned by the Mitsubishi Kasei group, Japan's largest chemical company, produces minerals used mostly in the manufacture of electronic components. Its factory is near the town of Ipoh, in northern Malaysia. Last month the Ipoh High Court ordered the factory to stop operations within 14 days, citing evidence showing that the health of local residents had been threatened by emissions from the plant. Supreme Court judge Mohamed Yusof Mohamad said it was impossible to switch off the entire manufacturing process at the plant in the time imposed by the original court order. 'The mandatory injunction to remove toxic waste and radioactive waste within a period of 14 days is not adequate, as this removal involves scrapping of the plant which has been in operation for more than 12 years,' the judge said. 'These factors alone would cause harm to the appellant and hardship to its 183 employees if injunctions were allowed to operate before the appeal is heard and disposed of.' Local residents who have fought for the plant's closure for several years were upset by the verdict. They were particularly angry that the judge had criticised a member of the local residents' committee for trying to dissuade Mitsubishi from taking part in a court appeal. The original Ipoh High Court judgment had accepted evidence of a growing number of cases of leukaemia, infant deaths and congenital disease in the vicinity of the factory. Lawyers for Asian Rare Earth say they will make a full appeal to the Supreme Court seeking to overturn the Ipoh court ruling. Mitsubishi Kasei said in Tokyo that the company did not want the plant to operate until local objections had been resolved. However, it had only a one-third stake in Asian Rare Earth, and the six Malaysian shareholders would have a strong role in making any such decision. An official acknowledged that the negative publicity - and a threatened boycott of all Mitsubishi group products in Malaysia - had hurt the Japanese company's image. But he insisted it had behaved correctly and disputed the evidence of contamination. The Japanese government, embarrassed by the affair, has been seeking to project a tougher attitude over the country's multinationals which, environmental groups argue, are exporting dirty industries to countries with less stringent regulations. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) unveiled this week a draft 'green code' for Japanese businesses operating abroad, seeking their compliance in adopting environmental protection measures of a higher standard than local law might require. The code, if approved, could be backed by aid and tax incentives but would carry no sanctions for offenders.</p>

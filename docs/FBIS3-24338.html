The people of Russia, who in 1991 elected a president in  a nationwide election and then reaffirmed their confidence in  his course in the April referendum, in October 1993 once again  rejected the reactionary alternative for our country's  development. They expressed their support for Russia's  transformation into a law-governed state and for making  democracy and peaceful aspirations the basis for our country's  domestic and foreign policy here on the eve of the 21st century.  Only affirmation of a democratic state can provide a reliable  guarantee for citizens' rights and the dynamic social and  economic development of society. Only by this means is it  possible to affirm that our country is a normal great power and  to realize its interests not through confrontation but instead  through cooperation in the West, East and South.    From the very start, the new Russia's diplomats have turned  sharply away from service to the totalitarian system and  attempts to restructure it, going instead in the direction of  aiding the radical transformation of society and protection of  our state's national interests and human rights and liberties,  especially those of our countrymen.    This change has taken place under difficult circumstances.  These included not only the understandable difficulties of  carrying out economic and political reforms in a gigantic  country with a multiethnic population and serious regional  differences. We also faced the task of coping with major foreign  policy tasks: to eliminate in actuality and not just in words  the heavy burden of the Cold War, which divided humanity into  opposing blocs; to ensure foreign political and economic support  for Russian reforms; and to surround Russia with a zone of  good-neighborliness and cooperation. And all this had to be done  in extremely short order. This was dictated by the logic of  struggle against the forces of the past. It was essential that  reforms be quickly carried through to the point at which a  return to the old system would become impossible. The dynamic  nature of events and the element of spontaneity in their  development necessitated a constant readiness to engage in  tactical maneuvers which by their very nature assume not only  gains, but also the possibility of losses, even including the  loss of former allies in the struggle for reform. However, the  most important things are confidence in the correctness of the  chosen path and a strategic course toward consistent  transformation of society and entry on that basis into the  community of the most developed democratic states -- all that  remains unchanged.    The first three years of the new Russia's foreign policy  have  been a major historical period that combines its stages with the  specific objectives and tactics inherent in each of them.    The chronology begins with B. N. Yeltsin's election as RSFSR  Supreme Soviet chairman on 28 May 1990. The main thrust of  political and diplomatic activity by Russia's leaders at that  stage was the struggle to achieve state sovereignty and  independence for the Russian Federation. It was necessary to  create a new state based not on the monopolistic dominance of  any one ideology, but rather on the supremacy of the values of  democracy and law. Russia's declaration of state sovereignty on  12 June 1990 falls within this period.    I clearly recall numerous discussions at the time about a  concept of Russia's national and state interests and about the  orientation of its foreign policy. The discussion stage passed  quickly. By approximately October 1990 Russia's leaders had set  a course toward ensuring Russia's independent entry into the  international arena, something that proclamation of our  country's sovereignty was intended to reinforce.    The foundation chosen for the concept of Russia's security  and foreign policy was the goal of reviving our country as a  great power by overcoming the dominance of the  imperial-totalitarian system and creating a law-governed,  democratic and federative state. In the process we assumed that  the vital interests of Russia's people include, firstly,  development of friendly relations with the people of the other  republics in the renewed Union and, secondly, accession to a  proper place in the community of civilized peoples in Eurasia  and America.    One distinctive feature of Russian foreign policy was to be  a  common sense-dictated renunciation of ideological schemes and  messianic ambitions on a global scale in favor of realism in the  assessment of Russia's needs and in favor of specific  appropriate actions. The support for this would come not only  from our country's own strength, but also from its commonality  of interests with the interests of the other republics which at  the time comprised the USSR.    It was precisely these objectives that determined the nature  of the first foreign policy steps taken by Russia in 1990. On 19  November the RSFSR signed a treaty with Ukraine, on 21 November  with Kazakhstan, and on 18 December with Belarus. The  signatories to those treaties recognized each other as sovereign  states and stated their intention to develop their interstate  relations based on the principles of equality, noninterference  in each other's internal affairs, renunciation of the use of  force, and other commonly accepted standards of international  law. The signatories also agreed to exchange diplomatic  delegations.    Even at this stage in the emergence of relations with the  future members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Russia  strove to orient its treaty relations with them toward  comprehensive development, not toward disintegration of ties  within the boundaries of the then-existing USSR. This was  expressed in treaty stipulations concerning the importance of a  collective security system, interaction and coordination on  foreign policy, creation of a common economic space, and close  cooperation in the fields of transportation, communications,  migration policy, the environment and anti-crime efforts.    At that time revival of the Russian State was envisioned  within the framework of a renewed Union of Sovereign States.  Therefore there is no way that it can be claimed that by Russia  seeking its own voice in the area of foreign policy it radically  departed from the international course of the then-existing  USSR, with perhaps the exception of the area of human rights. On  the contrary, that search was actually aimed at preserving unity  of interests among the republics of the USSR. Renewal of the  Union, we sincerely believed at the time, could be made to fit  quite well within the framework of the Novoogarev process.  Russian leaders' approach during that period was notable for its  great flexibility and a willingness to tolerate even a lack of  complete internal sovereignty for Russia, even though by that  time its sovereignty in international affairs in no way differed  from the sovereignty of the central USSR government.    Russia played a constructive role in maintaining common  ground between the independent states that subsequently  established the Commonwealth. This active binding role on the  part of Russia during the emergence of the CIS appears even more  obvious as that turbulent period in history recedes into the  past. But even then the idea that Russia could and to all  appearances would become the successor to the USSR gradually  came to have practical meaning for our foreign partners.  Meetings and talks with the heads of the world's leading  countries at their initiative during visits to Moscow began to  occupy a large part of B. N. Yeltsin's work schedule.    The theme of a majority of these talks was acknowledgement  of  the efforts made by Russia to achieve understanding of the  realities of a nuclear world on the part of the union republics  with weapons of mass destruction deployed in their territory.  The importance of those efforts increased against the backdrop  of the then-unclear effects of the Union's likely  disintegration. The counterparts also approved of Russia's  willingness to assume the role of the only state to have nuclear  weapons deployed within its territory in the event that the USSR  collapsed.    This upsurge in the Russian leadership's foreign policy  activism helped improve its international standing. This  prompted the increasing displeasure of and then resistance from  the central USSR government. In addition, more and more open  resistance began to be offered by reactionary forces in the  state apparatus. Even at that stage the Russian leadership was  very concerned over the emergence, with the active assistance of  those forces, of conflict situations in various regions of the  USSR, in particular in the Baltic region, South Ossetia,  Azerbaijan and Armenia. Statements and decrees by the highest  governmental bodies in the RSFSR concerning the situation in the  Baltic region (12 January 1991), the situation in South Ossetia  (31 March 1991) and the situation in Azerbaijan and Armenia are  evidence of the Russian leadership's efforts to resolve those  situations by legal, democratic means.    The conflict between the forces of democracy and  totalitarianism increased sharply in the summer of 1991. B. N.  Yeltsin's election by a nationwide vote on 12 June 1991 to serve  as president of a sovereign and independent Russia was perceived  by those supporting a return to the old order as an alarm signal.    At this stage the primary orientation of the Russian  leadership's foreign policy course was protection of Russia's  international standing and its ties with foreign states against  attacks on them by domestic political opponents. It was  important to neutralize the threat of Russia's isolation in the  event of an attempt to set up a dictatorship and to prevent an  eruption of international confrontation, which could well have  happened as a result of the bitter clashes between the forces of  democracy and totalitarianism in the USSR. These objectives also  determined the orientation of the tactical course in Russia's  foreign policy up to the time of the coup.    Critics then and now of the new Russia's foreign policy  course have accused the RSFSR Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  seeking to "break up the Union." Such claims could not be any  farther from the truth. Russia's leaders were actively involved  in the drafting of the "Treaty on a Union of Sovereign  Republics." However, the negotiation process leading to  establishment of a union of independent, democratic states was  interrupted by the coup of August 1991. The forces of the past  sought to halt democratic reforms, take the country back to Cold  War-era confrontation and essentially place it in a position of  international isolation.    Those alarming days in August clearly demonstrated the  resolve and energy of Russia's first president, who organized  and headed democratic forces' repulse of the coup plotters'  actions. Around the world the symbols of those events were B. N.  Yeltsin's appeal to the people of Moscow from atop a tank in  front of the White House and the president's meetings with  foreign politicians and diplomats seeking to demonstrate the  democratic world's solidarity with the people of Russia.    The situation became so difficult that by the end of the day  on 19 August the decision had been made to dispatch the RSFSR  minister of foreign affairs to France with instructions to form  a "government in exile" if necessary. Fortunately the crisis  ended in the complete defeat of the coup plotters and  reinforcement of the democratic trend in our country's political  life. In international terms the most notable fact was that  during the coup virtually all the developed countries supported  Russia.    In the period immediately following the coup the primary  objective of Russian diplomacy was to win broad international  support for the actions of the Russian Federation's leaders, who  found themselves virtually the only real power in the country. A  clear trend toward disintegration of the Union appeared. The  reason for this was the collapse of its old structure and the  weakness of the new, democratic institutions that were still  just emerging. Under these conditions only Russia could prevent  the uncontrolled collapse of ties between the republics that  comprised the USSR.    Until the last possible moment Russia's leaders fought for a  union treaty and attempted to keep the Novoogarev process going.  Those who blame Russia for the "collapse" of the USSR are  blaming the wrong people. The end of the old Union was brought  about solely by those who organized a coup to "protect" it: the  party nomenklatura, which rallied around the State Committee for  the State of Emergency.    With the end of the USSR's existence began a new stage of  affirmation of Russian foreign policy as the policy of a  sovereign great power, the legal successor to the USSR. As of  January 1992 Russia had been recognized by 131 states. The  country's leaders assigned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the  task of drafting and implementing a new course in the  international arena. In a speech to a session of the MFA Board  on 27 October 1992 B. N. Yeltsin defined the principal  objectives of Russian diplomacy thus: to ensure favorable  external conditions for the political and economic reforms that  had been begun, elimination of the legacy of the Cold War, and  complete dismantling of confrontational structures left over  from the past.    The top priority in Russia's foreign policy was the creation  of the Commonwealth of Independent States, a new form of  voluntary and equal cooperation between the republics of the  former USSR. On 8 December 1991 an agreement establishing the  CIS was signed in Minsk. The original members were the RSFSR,  Ukraine and Belarus, which were later joined by Kazakhstan and a  number of other republics. Russia's position of active support  for the Commonwealth immediately gave the CIS a firm foundation.    Of fundamental importance was the signing on 21 December  1991  of an agreement between the RSFSR, Ukraine, Belarus and  Kazakhstan concerning measures to deal with the nuclear weapons  deployed in their territory. In accordance with that document  the right to use nuclear weapons was turned over to the  president of Russia. That step helped maintain strategic  stability in the world and strengthened the confidence of the  international partners of Russia and the other CIS states in the  course set by Commonwealth members in international affairs.    Despite the difficult and contradictory nature of its  origin,  the CIS has become a political and economic reality of the  modern world. A solid foundation of treaty law has been created  for the CIS. At a meeting of heads of CIS states in Minsk in  January 1993 the Commonwealth Charter was approved. The  significance of that document lies primarily in the fact that it  opens up the possibility of deeper cooperation for those CIS  countries that genuinely strive for that. But neither does it  exclude from the Commonwealth those who are still wavering,  permitting them to participate in cooperation in forms and  degrees which they find acceptable. Thus the idea of a  "variable-speed," multi-option Commonwealth put forward by B. N.  Yeltsin found not only support but also legal expression in  Minsk.    The standing executive body of the CIS -- the Coordinating  and Consultative Committee -- began functioning. More than 30  interstate, intergovernmental and interagency bodies were  established to coordinate the activities of Commonwealth members  in a broad range of fields ranging from foreign policy to  environmental protection. Meetings between CIS heads of state  and heads of government are becoming increasingly businesslike.  Russia's partners are ridding themselves, though not without  difficulty, of the euphoria that accompanied their first months  of independence and are demonstrating a growing understanding of  the importance of maintaining and developing integrating ties  within the CIS. Stronger reintegration trends allowed a number  of Commonwealth members to establish the Economic Union in 1993  and begin creating a new type of ruble zone. Of course, these  processes are not without difficulty. However, Russia's leaders  are working patiently to coordinate economic and financial  interests within the framework of the CIS. Adherence to the  principles of equal rights and mutual benefit will allow members  of the Commonwealth to create a solid foundation for integration.    The emergence of independent states in place of the former  USSR has raised the issue of their admission to the Council on  Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). Russian diplomats  have actively supported that option. There have also been some  skeptics among the participants in the European process, and we  have had to change the minds of these. Admission of the Central  Asian and Transcaucasus republics to the CSCE was a step of  strategic significance both to those countries and in terms of  the development of the European process. The new CSCE members  have accepted moral and political obligations to pursue a policy  in keeping with high international standards in the area of  protection for human rights. This is a powerful additional  incentive that will help the values of democracy take root in  the post-Soviet space.    One important aspect of Russia's policy in the "near abroad"  is protection for the rights of the Russian-speaking population  living there. Our long-term goal is creation within the CIS of a  unified legal space that will encourage compliance with  internationally recognized rights and liberties for individuals  and ethnic, religious and other minorities. At the initiative of  Russian diplomats the decision was made to establish a Human  Rights Commission within the Commonwealth. Russia favors  adoption of a "Declaration of Human Rights in the CIS States."    In bilateral relations with its CIS partners the primary  goal  of Russian diplomacy has been to conclude treaties regarding  mutual protection for the interests of citizens in the  signatories' territory, the right to freely choose citizenship,  the rights of ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious  minorities, and the terms of citizens' emigration to other  states.    One focus of particular alarm and concern among the leaders  of Russia and the Russian Federation MFA has been the status of  our fellow citizens and countrymen in the Baltic countries,  particularly Estonia and Latvia. Russia's democrats, who during  the period of CPSU rule staunchly defended the right of the  Baltic peoples to reestablish historical justice, now on the  very same grounds favor a civilized, just approach to the rights  of those countries' Russian-speaking population. The issue of  protection for human rights is on the agenda of our talks with  representatives of the Baltic countries at all levels, including  the highest level. Russian diplomacy is also mobilizing  international organizations and institutions -- the U.N., the  CSCE and the Council of Europe -- in support of human rights in  the Baltic countries. A certain positive effect on the  situation, particularly in Estonia, has resulted from the  efforts of the CSCE Supreme Commissar for Ethnic Minority  Affairs.    Liberating the peoples of the former USSR from the  totalitarian past has been a difficult and at times painful  process, one accompanied in many regions by outbreaks of  aggressive nationalism. The result has been the emergence of a  number of conflict situations which directly threaten Russia's  national security interests. As of the end of 1993 approximately  two million refugees had entered our country, in particular from  regions where interethnic clashes are occurring. Aiding these  people would be a difficult economic burden for any state and in  particular for Russia, which is currently going through a  transition period. It is not only those directly involved that  are the victims of ethnic conflicts, but also ethnic minorities,  including the Russian-speaking minority, which has become an  object of persecution and sometimes of outright ethnic purges.  Local conflicts have become the suppliers of organized crime in  Russia. No civilized state can tolerate an increase in such  threats literally on its own doorstep.    The nationalist patriots, particularly those among the  members of the Supreme Soviet, have persistently demanded that  Russia's leaders solve the problem of conflicts along Russia's  perimeter using old imperial methods, i.e. military force and  dictates to sovereign states. That course, which threatens to  bring on the collapse of the Commonwealth and the emergence of a  ring of hostile states around Russia, has been firmly rejected  by our country's leaders. Instead, emphasis has been placed on a  policy of active peacemaking that includes preventive diplomacy  to avoid conflicts, arbitration and the conducting of  peacekeeping operations.    Our country's president has been an active participant in  the  pursuit of Russia's peacekeeping course in the post-Soviet  space. In particular, widespread acclaim and approval by the  international community greeted B. N. Yeltsin's initiatives to  settle the Karabakh conflict. The Russian leadership is urging  the parties to the conflict to cease military clashes  immediately, withdraw all military units to the positions held  by them prior to violation of the ceasefire, and come to Moscow  to sign an agreement on complete and comprehensive cessation of  military operations.    Russian diplomats are actively involved in peacekeeping  efforts. The minister of foreign affairs has already made  several trips to "hot spots" from Abkhazia to Tajikistan.  Special Russian presidential representatives are working to  bring about a solution to conflicts in the Transcaucasus region.  It was mainly at our initiative that the CIS began to reorient  itself toward more active peacekeeping efforts. Specifically,  the decision was made to create collective CIS peacekeeping  forces in Tajikistan. However, thus far the main burden of  peacekeeping efforts in the former USSR has been borne by  Russia. There are 20,000 Russian military personnel taking part  in peacekeeping operations in three republics: Moldova, Georgia  and Tajikistan. Not everything has gone smoothly by any means,  but the only alternative to Russian peacekeeping would be the  loss of Russian ties and influence in the "near abroad" that  have come into being over centuries. That means there is only  one solution: qualitative improvement of our forces protecting  the peace in "hot spots."    The peacekeeping operations currently being conducted by  Russia are in keeping with the objectives and principles of  peacekeeping as set forth in the U.N. Charter. Russian  peacekeeping forces are present in all areas at the request of  legitimate governments and with the consent of all parties to  the conflict. Yes, we do have to resort to peacekeeping methods  that are not traditional for the U.N. That includes  participation in peacekeeping operations by forces from  neighboring states (mainly Russia itself) and even by the  parties to the conflict. But this practice has proven its  effectiveness in the Dniester region and in South Ossetia, where  no blood has been shed in over a year. It would be simply  unreasonable to reject this as "incorrect." Therefore at the  48th session of the U.N. General Assembly Russian diplomats  urged the international community to provide active support for  our peacekeeping efforts. Specifically, we expressed support for  the creation of a voluntary fund to aid peacekeeping efforts in  the former USSR.    The Russian leadership has subordinated its approach to  democratic states in West and East to the goal of establishing  partnership relations with them, and over the long term alliance  relationships. That guideline has from the very first days after  the USSR ceased to exist helped prompt the democratic world to  undertake active efforts in support of the reform process in  Russia and the other CIS countries. In late January 1992  Washington was the scene of a coordinating conference on  assistance to the newly independent states that had emerged out  of the former Soviet Union. There were 47 states and seven  leading international economic organizations participating. In  his message to those attending the conference, B. N. Yeltsin  expressed Russia's desire to achieve genuine economic and social  revitalization through stimulation of broad business cooperation  with all interested partners.    The course toward the building of new relations with the  outside world was also reflected in Russian diplomats' first  steps at the highest level. In this context the most major  events were participation by Russia's president in a U.N.  Security Council session in January 1992 and his visits to  England, the United States and Canada.    From the U.N. podium Russia's leader declared that Russia  was  joining the world community as a firm and consistent supporter  of freedom, democracy and humanism. B. N. Yeltsin expressed  support for a decisive reduction in strategic offensive weapons  and tactical nuclear weapons, a complete ban on nuclear testing,  substantial reductions in conventional weapons, a ban on  chemical and bacteriological weapons and creations of a  Europe-wide collective security system. In London, at Camp David  and in Ottawa declarations were signed on the prospects for  partnership between Russia and England, the United States and  Canada. Those documents set forth for the first time the  fundamentally new foundations, free of ideological  confrontation, of our relations with states that were counted by  the Soviet leadership among "potential opponents."    The key stages in the further complete dismantling of the  Cold War legacy were the signing of the Russian-American Charter  of Partnership and Friendship (June 1992), which stated that  "increases in the wealth, prosperity and security of a  democratic Russian Federation and the United States of America  are vitally interconnected," and conclusion of the SALT II  Treaty (December 1992). The Russian-American summit meeting in  Vancouver (April 1993) focused, for the first time in the  history of relations between Moscow and Washington, not on ways  of overcoming confrontation, but instead on ways of laying the  groundwork for economic interaction.    A similar breakthrough was also achieved in Russia's  relations with the other leading developed states of the world  -- France, England, Germany and Italy. Patient work began on  genuine normalization of relations with Japan based on the  principles of law and justice.    On the basis of political partnership it became possible to  shift Russia's relations with those states to a frank and  intensive dialogue on financial and economic issues. The  previous topic of how to eliminate the threat of global war was  replaced as central issue by problems pertaining to Russia's  access to markets, including markets in high-tech products,  nuclear materials and space services.    Russian diplomats were among the initiators of a decisive  reinforcement of the CSCE, a unique tool for strengthening peace  and preventing conflicts in the North Atlantic region. The  foundations of this approach to the European process were laid  out by B. N. Yeltsin during a meeting of heads of state and  heads of government from the CSCE member countries in Helsinki  on 9-10 July 1992. Concretizing that approach, Russian diplomats  put forward at the Rome session of the CSCE Council of Ministers  of Foreign Affairs (November 1993) extensive proposals aimed at  increasing the effectiveness of CSCE organs, stepping up the  Conference's peacekeeping functions and more closely  coordinating efforts in the field of protection for human rights  and the rights of ethnic minorities, with preventive CSCE  diplomacy in Europe's conflicts zones.    One important aspect of Russia's European policy has been  active participation in new regional associations such as the  Council on Barents-Eurarctic Cooperation, the Council of Baltic  Sea States and Black Sea Economic Cooperation. In this area as  well our goal is to utilize the opportunities offered by those  organizations to create a zone of good-neighborliness around  Russia.    It has proven possible to achieve a genuine breakthrough in  Russia's relations with the countries of Eastern Europe. Visits  by Russia's president to Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and  Slovakia have made it possible not only to clear away old --  sometimes prewar -- debris from our bilateral relations, but  also, and most importantly, to lay down a fundamentally new  foundation for our relations with the new democracies. Yet there  also remains much to be done in that area, particularly in terms  of developing trade and economic ties with the region. Generally  speaking, in contrast to many other powers, particularly the  West, in its present circumstances Russia does not rely so much  on economic ties and leverage in its foreign policy as it uses  policy to compensate for its foreign economic weakness.    Russian diplomacy, guided by the ideas of peacemaking, has  been actively involved in international efforts to resolve the  conflict in former Yugoslavia. Our actions, undertaken in close  coordination with other parties to a resolution of the  Yugoslavian situation, are aimed at establishing peace as  quickly as possible in Bosnia-Herzegovina and normalizing  relations between the republics of the former SFRY [Socialist  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia].    The dynamic creation of new relations with the states of the  West has by no means caused a "pro-Western slant" in Russian  diplomacy, a charge often levelled by national-patriotic  politicians. Entry into partnership relations with the United  States and the countries of Western Europe is occurring in  parallel with greater Russian attention to the East.    One landmark on that path was a visit by Russia's president  to China. In a joint declaration adopted by the two countries,  Russia and China recognized each other as friendly states. A  mutual interest was expressed in the equal and ongoing nature of  bilateral relations, without any geopolitical alliance but also  without relapses into confrontation. The visit laid down a solid  foundation for development of relations in trade, science,  technology, personnel training and military affairs. Talks have  been stepped up regarding reduction of armed forces along the  border and clearer definition of the border's location. This has  helped further strengthen the spirit of mutual trust and  businesslike partnership in Russian-Chinese relations.    Russia's relations with another great Asian country, India,  have gotten off to a new start. The treaty of friendship and  cooperation signed during highest-level Russian-Indian talks in  New Delhi in January 1993, while retaining all the positive  things that existed in relations between the USSR and India,  also puts those relations on a basis of mutual benefit and frees  them of the logic of geopolitical alliances pitting some  countries against others, as had previously been imposed by  Moscow.    Russian diplomats have also succeeded in "opening up" the  ASEAN countries, the Persian Gulf and the Republic of South  Africa for business cooperation and new partnerships.    The emergence of the foreign policy of Russia as an  independent state has required major organizational and  personnel reinforcement of the Russian diplomatic service. An  important step in this regard was the creation of an updated  Russian diplomatic service in October 1990, as well as the  introduction of the institution of Russian representation in the  USSR's foreign institutions and delegations in the spring of  1991.    The staff of the former USSR MFA, like all of Soviet  society,  was excessively ideologically oriented. For many decades Soviet  diplomacy was in effect a part of the CPSU Central Committee's  International Department. Consistent efforts to get rid of the  burden of old stereotypes and stagnant mindsets began after the  merger of the RSFSR MFA apparatus with the USSR MFA in late  1991. That process was made easier by the fact that the Russian  MFA had already removed all party structures in August 1991.  Simultaneously with this reorganization of the diplomatic  service a course was set toward increasing its professionalism.  The ministry's apparatus was reoriented toward protecting  Russia's national and state interests as Russia underwent a time  of revolutionary changes.    An exceptionally important role was played by the fact that  as of February 1992 the Russian Federation MFA and a number of  other key ministries have been administered directly by our  country's president in order to ensure more timely solutions to  foreign policy issues. This practice has won Russia's foreign  policy broad recognition and respect abroad. By the spring of  1992 the reorganization of the diplomatic apparatus on the basis  of the Russian MFA was complete. This made it possible to create  an integrated foreign policy mechanism and bring new, democratic  blood into the diplomatic service.    The Russian MFA has always striven for cooperation with the  Supreme Soviet, providing it with all possible support in the  development of interparliamentary relations. Within the  ministry's structure a special administration has been  established to handle relations with the Supreme Soviet and with  political and public organizations. However, over time the  Supreme Soviet came to be dominated by openly anti-reform  forces. They focused their efforts on confrontation with the  executive branch and resistance to the reform policy. The  situation was further exacerbated by the efforts of certain  individuals in the Supreme Soviet leadership to conduct  "personal" foreign policy. This threatened to have severe  effects on our relations with Ukraine and a number of other CIS  states, threatened Russia's ability to function as a partner in  disarmament negotiations such as SALT II, and disturbed Russia's  relations with the countries of Eastern Europe.    The explosive nature of the situation in Russia was clearly  evident to those attending a session of the CSCE's Council of  Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Stockholm in December 1992. The  dramatic reaction abroad to my presentation of a number of  points from the platforms of what were by no means the most  extreme right-wing movements and forces in Russia gave food for  thought about the profound isolation -- probably like in 1917 --  in which our country would find itself should they come to  power. Stockholm also demonstrated the effective absence of any  non-imperialist, neo-Atlantic alternative as has been  speculatively put forward by politicians of a "moderate"  orientation.    Additional organizational measures undertaken at the  president's initiative have strengthened the ministry's position  in its area of jurisdiction within the system of federal  executive bodies. Specifically, in November 1992 a presidential  directive assigned to the MFA coordination of a unified foreign  policy course, though that goal is still far from realization --  differences among the approaches of various ministries and  agencies, and in some cases "ministerial politicians,"  particularly in "hot spots," are seriously undermining Russia's  strategic positions.    Everything that has been achieved in the field of foreign  policy (plus some losses and some tactical failures) are the  result of the Russian leadership's pursuit of Russia's national  and state interests. The events of October 1993 graphically  demonstrated the efforts of those who oppose reforms to slow  their steady progress. The decisive position taken at that time  by Russia's president received broad international support. The  adoption of the Constitution and creation of the Federal  Assembly should provide a new impetus for the implementation of  full-scale reforms and take the country to new heights in  international politics.</p>

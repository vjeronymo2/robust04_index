At its federal delegates' conference in Mannheim the  party adopted an election program -- with only one vote against  -- with which an "ecological and social change in course" in  Germany is to be introduced.    There was a heated quarrel between the realpolitik wing and  the leftists about the future foreign policy course. Finally,  the majority affirmed the party's basic pacifist attitude. The  delegates approved a motion by the Federal Executive Committee,  which came out in favor of a gradual dissolution of the  Bundeswehr and of NATO as well as against any German  participation in blue- helmet missions. A moderate  countermotion by Krista Sager was clearly rejected. As a  result, Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], accused the Greens in an  interview of letting the fundamentalists continue to have the  say in the party.    A focal issue of the party congress was the economic and  social policy. The delegates came out in favor of new  ecological taxes, a drastic reduction of work time, and basic  care for all needy people. In compensation for the ecological  taxes, companies should get subsidies for environmentally  friendly investments. With higher taxes on large assets an  equalization of burdens, in particular for the benefit of the  east, is intended. Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer  warned in vain against the demand of getting out of nuclear  energy within two years. In practical government work this  "immediatism" just leads to disappointed hopes, Fischer said.    In asylum policy the motion by representatives of the party  leftists, which demanded the retraction of the asylum laws,  failed. Lower Saxony's Federal Council Minister Juergen Trittin  harshly attacked Wolfgang Schaeuble. Trittin accused the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union group chairman  in the Bundestag of having overtaken Republikaner Chairman Franz  Schoenhuber on the right. At the same time, he accused the SPD  in Lower Saxony, where elections will be held on 13 March, of  pursuing an election campaign against its own election program:  "Anyone who wants to replace Kohl must prevent Schroeder from  becoming an absolute ruler in Lower Saxony," Trittin said.    At the party congress there was unanimous agreement on  striving for a change of power in the coalition with the SPD.  The preamble of the program says: "We are ready to contribute  ourselves with all our strength to a government coalition, if  this promises a serious reform policy. However, there will not  be a coalition at any cost," Executive Committee spokesman  Ludger Volmer said. On Sunday the delegates recognized the  "Green Alternative Youth Alliance," which was founded in  January, as the party's youth organization.</p>

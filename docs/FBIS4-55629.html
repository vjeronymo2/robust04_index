			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by James Hider: "Bond Issue Bodes Well for Economy </F> and Bears Out Government Optimism"]    [Text] The city of Prague made $25 million in one hour  April 14 after Finance Minister Ivan Kocarnik floated a huge  issue of city bonds on the international capital market through  the Japanese bank Nomura. The positive response to the bond  issue would seem to bear out last week's announcement by an  ever-confident Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus that the Czech  economy is on a steady course to post-transformation stability.    International credit rating institutions have been singing  the same tune for over a year now. Standard and Poor's  assessment for the second half of 1993 put the Czech Republic on  the same level as Turkey and Israel, a full three points above  European Union member Greece. Last year, Moody's awarded the  Czech Republic a higher credit rating than any other  post-communist state.    And now the results of a poll last week of the 100 foremost  international banks published by the American finance magazine  INTERNATIONAL INVESTOR placed the Czech Republic 40th out of 100  states on the world scale of credit stability. Hungary, which,  until the split of Czechoslovakia, ranked at the head of the  post-communist countries, wound up in the 43rd position in the  magazine's tables. Slovakia came in 59th place.    But while the numbers are revealing, they don't quite tell  all, according to some observers. "There's no real value in  comparing Eastern European countries' credit ratings," said  Richard Kriz of the Delegation of German Business in Prague.  "It's more a matter of an overall regional growth."    Most Czech financiers were guardedly optimistic about the  results of the international poll and of the ratings garnered by  another magazine, EUROMONEY. The publication also placed the  Czech Republic in 40th place out of 100, this time relating to  investment risk.    Martin Svehla of the Czech National Bank (CNB) cited  macroeconomic influences as the main reason for the credit boom.  Specifically, he mentioned a low but stable exchange rate  supporting exports, the low rate of inflation and the  bottoming-out of performance decline. All have made the Czech  Republic a honey pot for international investors, as have low  production costs and a skilled work force, he said.    Josef Dufil, Client Service Department manager at  Czechinvest, said the main areas of foreign investment are at  present car parts manufacturing, light industry,  electrotechnology and, in particular, mechanical tool  production. In that field, foreign participation jumped from 4  percent in 1992 to 10 percent last year. "These areas all take  precedence over consumer goods production at present," said  Dufil.    The glowing results and even rosier forecasts do not mean  that all will be easy sailing in the future, warned the CNB's  Svehla. "I think the hardest times may still be ahead of us," he  said. This pessimistic view reflects the fact that the Czech  Republic is in many ways more liberal than the Western European  economic models it aspires to emulate. As Klaus continues to  boast about the country's macroeconomic performance, public  attention is turning to non-economic matters, such as the  environment and the standard of living.    "Mr. Klaus says we must earn environmental improvements,"  said Dufil. "This will be very expensive, and with elections  approaching there will be increasing pressure on the government  to do more about it." Svehla agreed that the environment will  prove a costly thorn in the government's side, especially when  other key economic factors must inevitably change in the future.    "Exchange rates and costs cannot remain as low as they are  indefinitely, especially as the active role of government is  being reduced through privatization," he said.    The reduction of the government role in industry will take  longer than the mere completion of the second wave of  privatization that commenced two weeks ago. "That is only part  of it," said Svehla. "Once legally privatized, it still takes  time for large structures to restructure themselves and become  truly private enterprises. I hope we are powerful enough to cope  in the future."</p>

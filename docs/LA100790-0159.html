			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SLIMMED-DOWN NATO TAKING SHAPE;  </P> <P> MILITARY: GEN. GALVIN SAYS IT IS TIME TO DISCARD ALLIANCE'S OLDEST AND MOST  HALLOWED CONCEPTS.  </P> <P> While European leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization grope for a  new strategy in the post-Cold War period, the alliance's military commander,  Gen. John R. Galvin, is providing some guidelines for such a doctrine.  </P> <P> At a recent seminar of diplomats, soldiers and academics at the Konrad Adenauer  Foundation in this Bonn suburb, Galvin spelled out his vision of a new,  slimmed-down NATO force for the years to come.  </P> <P> The white-haired, four-star U.S. general indicated that some of NATO's oldest  and most hallowed concepts, having served their purpose, are on the way out.  </P> <P> These include "flexible response," which envisioned possible early use of  tactical nuclear weapons, if needed, against a Soviet mass attack; and "forward  defense," which called for positioning troops as far east as possible in what  used to be West Germany.  </P> <P> Galvin said he believes that NATO's nuclear deterrent will suffice with a  "greatly reduced stockpile" because there will be a much longer "nuclear  threshold," particularly after new conventional arms cuts in Europe.  </P> <P> And "forward defense," previously insisted upon by West Germans because of  domestic political considerations, will no longer be needed because of the  buffer zone created by changing political conditions in Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> While the new doctrine has not yet been agreed upon by NATO's 16 member nations  or even formulated by its planners, Galvin suggested that an educated guess  indicates much of what the new strategy will be. The main changes include:  </P> <P> * Greatly reducing troop strength in Europe among all allies, particularly  those stationed in Germany, possibly cutting U.S. forces in Germany to a single  corps of ground troops, with backup logistic and air support.  </P> <P> * Developing a more mobile force among the thinned-out units in order to cover  the same area. This would mean troops would not be stationed right up against  the German-Polish border but in a more central location.  </P> <P> * Reducing the number of headquarters units, though Galvin said such command  and control elements are an essential component of the integrated military  structure of NATO.  </P> <P> * Placing only limited reliance on short-range, battlefield nuclear weapons,  possibly phasing them out almost entirely eventually.  </P> <P> * Bringing in chemical weapons only in case of an emergency buildup by a  potential enemy force.  </P> <P> * Cutting large-scale maneuvers and low-flying training missions by jet  fighters to a minimum in order to spare the citizenry.  </P> <P> * Forming more multinational units, even though, because of differing languages  and equipment, their value remains to be tested.  </P> <P> * Emphasizing further arms cuts that could be negotiated between NATO and the  Soviet Union, with NATO continually adapting its tactics to such reductions.  </P> <P> However, Galvin, who has held his post for more than three years, emphasized to  questioning Germans that this is no time to consider dismantling NATO, which,  he said, has served its members well for more than 40 years.  </P> <P> "There is no substitute for NATO's integrated military structure," he said,  indicating that such a system is unique in the post-World War II world.  </P> <P> But he acknowledged that the current crisis in the Persian Gulf has focused  military and public attention, particularly in the United States, outside the  borders of NATO members.  </P> <P> In the United States, he noted, some critics have said that NATO members should  have provided more forces for service in the gulf region. Galvin said that  after the crisis is over, NATO members will discuss whether the alliance should  consider out-of-area action when the vital interests of its members are  involved.  </P></p>

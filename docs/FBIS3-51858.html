Unfortunately they appear to have hit one  another and at some point, blinded by anger, he killed his wife.

He read a brief  communique:    [Begin recording] There has been a tragedy involving my  father, who killed his wife, Teodosia Alarcon de Cardenas. As a  son I feel a great pain. This is a tragedy for both the  Cardenas and Alarcon families. Along with my brothers and  sisters, deeply grieved, I pray the Lord for the soul of my  stepmother. Above my condition as son there is my duty as a  citizen and official who respects the law and seeks justice. I  leave in the hands of the appropriate officials the  clarification of this event and the determination of the  appropriate responsibilities, being aware that in my position as  an official I will never allow this position of authority to  prevail over or interfere with in the strict fulfillment of the  law.

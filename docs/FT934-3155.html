			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Police ordered into KwaZulu South Africa's two-day-old Transitional Executive Council tested the limits of black political power yesterday, with far-reaching orders to the police and the KwaZulu black homeland, Reuter reports from Cape Town. The multi-party council adopted proposals initiated by Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and the Communist Party. It instructed police to move into northern Natal, including parts of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's largely autonomous KwaZulu homeland, to deal with unrest there. The UN yesterday agreed to unrestricted resumption of shipments of oil and petroleum products to South Africa, ending a 16-year embargo that was widely observed but not mandatory.</p>

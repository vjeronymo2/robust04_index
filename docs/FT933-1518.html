			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Food ingredients prove the key to healthy growth - Kerry, the Irish food company, looks set to expand into an international force THE DISTINCTIVE country smells of silage-making and muck-spreading fill one's nostrils on stepping off the commuter aircraft at Kerry airport in the west of Ireland at this time of year. A patchwork of green fields, lush with tender grass, spreads for miles in every direction. Just up the road, lies Tralee, whose main claim to fame was as a former garrison town for British troops, and where the girlfriend of a lovesick Irishman was to become immortalised in the ballad, 'The Rose of Tralee'. Over the past 20 years though, one of Ireland's largest food companies has emerged from this agricultural backwater. It is largely the result of the commitment of 5,000 small dairy farmers and the acumen of its executives who have transformed a small dairy co-operative with turnover of IPounds 1m in 1974 into an international food business with an annual turnover now exceeding IPounds 800m (Pounds 755m). The group has emerged as the leader among the quoted Irish food stocks, and the one considered by market analysts most likely to achieve the scale and financial muscle necessary to compete in the international food industry by the end of the decade. At its annual meeting earlier this year, Mr Denis Brosnan, the managing director, said that the company's five-year plan envisaged it achieving turnover of IPounds 1.5bn and profits of about IPounds 50m. This would continue the group's now-established trend of doubling turnover and profits every five years. 'Kerry is a steady, consistent company. They lay out their development strategy for a five-year period ahead and then set about achieving it exactly as planned,' said Mr Joe Gill, food sector analyst with Riada, the Dublin stockbrokers. Pre-tax profits for the current year are forecast by Mr Gill to reach some IPounds 34.3m following an interim result last month of IPounds 13.6m, a 28 per cent increase. He expects earnings per share to reach 20p by 1994, up from 15.8p last year and a forecast 17.8p for 1993. Key to Kerry's growth and success has been its diversification out of dairy processing into meat processing, and more important, into the food ingredients industry. Mr Brosnan said that in the early 1980s, the group lost 20 per cent of its milk volume because of a brucellosis eradication programme in the company's milk catchment area in Kerry. 'At that point we decided to diversify,' he said. An aggressive acquisition programme followed, financed by share issues, borrowings and cash. Milk now forms just 25 per cent of the group's business. Food ingredients accounted for almost 40 per cent of turnover in the first half of 1993, and is the highest margin and fastest-growing part of the business. Kerry's main acquisition in this sector took place in 1988 with the purchase of Beatreme in the US, which Mr Brosnan said 'produced a major change in our organisation'. Concentrating first in dairy-based food ingredients - large quantities of casein, a by-product of milk processing, are shipped to the US from Kerry's Irish plants - the group has since expanded into other niches of the market to the point where it is now a leading supplier of specialised food ingredients in the US. And following recent acquisitions in Europe, it is positioning itself well in the EC food ingredients market. Spending some IPounds 4m annually in research and development, Kerry has established itself as a principal supplier to some of the leading convenience and snack-food producers in the US, which have preferred to source from specialist suppliers such as Kerry and cut back their own research and development expenditures on ingredients. Mr Gill said that 'the European snack food market is rapidly consolidating with a small number of (US) companies emerging to dominate the sector . . . this trend suggests the EC market will evolve to resemble that of the US, where Kerry is already a leading supplier of ingredients to the industry'. Mr Brosnan said he anticipated the group would eventually become a worldwide manufacturer of food ingredients. In the immediate future the company plans expansion in the US, Latin America and the EC, and possibly the Far East, but will it have the financial wherewithal to maintain the momentum of its exponential growth rate and achieve its next five-year target? One restraining factor is the group's hybrid co-operative-plc structure. Some 55 per cent of the group's shares are held by Kerry Co-op, the company's founder, which in turn is held by 5,000 farmer-shareholders. These have loyally supported the group through three rights issues, but there is a market perception that the group needs to further diversify its shareholder base if it is to continue its expansion. Rights issues and placements have raised a total of IPounds 60m since flotation, and the co-op shareholding has been gradually diluted from 83 per cent to 55 per cent today. Mr Brosnan says there are no plans for the time being to reduce the co-op holding below 51 per cent, although it is widely believed that Kerry will be the first of all the Irish co-op-plc hybrids to do so. Last month, the co-operative's 90m B shares were converted pari passu to ordinary A shares. Five per cent of the farmers' 8m shares in the co-operative were simultaneously converted on an 11-to-1 basis into A shares in Kerry Group, giving the farmer-members their first freely-tradeable shares as individual shareholders, rather than holding all their stake through the co-operative. Each share in the co-operative is thus now worth IPounds 30.8 at the current A share price of IPounds 2.80. Put another way, an individual Kerry farmer having invested IPounds 1,000 in the co-op in 1974 and followed the subsequent rights issues, would today have an investment worth IPounds 250,000 in Kerry Group. Few other farmers in Ireland could boast that sort of compound growth in their assets. Irish fund managers who presently hold most of the A shares have already taken note.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont under fire from Brown MR GORDON Brown, Labour's shadow chancellor, yesterday said in the Commons that the government had betrayed the British people by breaking election pledges not to increase taxation. He told Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that he would 'never be trusted again'. Neither, he said, would the Tory party so long as it was led by Mr John Major, the prime minister. Mr Brown challenged Tory backbenchers uneasy about the extension of VAT to domestic fuel and power to join Labour MPs in voting against the new impost at the end of the four-day Budget debate. Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, was ridiculed by Labour MPs when he argued that the betrayal charge could not be sustained. He claimed it had been made clear that if it became necessary to raise revenue - 'and no government can rule out that possibility for all time' - it would be done by extending the scope of taxation and not by raising rates of tax. Earlier Mr Brown called on Mr Lamont to say whether he had mentioned the likelihood of increases in VAT and National Insurance contributions in his personal election address. While volunteering to make a rare intervention on the second day of the Budget debate, Mr Lamont ignored the question. Brushing aside Labour jibes, he challenged Mr Brown to say whether the criticisms he directed at the government should also apply to France which, with a Socialist administration, also had 3m unemployed, and to Ireland and Spain, where, in percentage terms, unemployment was at a similar level. Mr John Townend, MP for Bridlington and chairman of the Conservative backbench finance committee, had less difficulty than the chancellor when Mr Brown asked if he had promised his constituents there would be no increase in taxation. 'I talked about no increases in direct taxation,' he said. The Budget was welcomed by Mr Michael Brown, Tory MP for Brigg and Cleethorpes, who underlined his confidence in Mr Lamont by saying he should present not only the November Budget 'but the one after that in particular'. Amid jeers and mocking laughter Mr Brown likened the significance of the chancellor's proposals to the measures taken by Sir Geoffrey Howe in 1981 which 'won' the 1983 election for the Conservative party and 'sowed the seeds' for the 1987 triumph.</p>

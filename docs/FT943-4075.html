			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei finishes at four-month low Share prices lost ground after a morning rally, and the Nikkei average closed 3.7 per cent lower on the week after five consecutive days of losses, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index fell 19.90 to 19,897.88, the lowest close since May 9, having recovered the 20,000 level during the morning session, with a day's high of 20,150.93. However, late arbitrage selling and a fall in telecommunication stocks depressed the index to a low of 19,853.17 in the afternoon. Volume totalled 585m shares against 304m. Activity surged at the outset due to settlements for futures and options trading. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 4.29 to 1,586.60 and the Nikkei 300 added 0.79 to 288.88. Gainers led losers by 556 to 415 with 228 issues remaining unchanged. In London, thew ISE/Nikkei index fell 1.69 to 1,291.00. Overseas investors were seen stepping up selling in the afternoon. Traders said some foreigners, who bought Japanese shares earlier this year were shifting their portfolios to the US and Hong Kong because of the lack of movement in the Tokyo market. Japan Telecom fell Y60,000 to Y4.4m. Other telecommunication sector shares were also weak, with DDI down Y5,000 to Y907,000 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone losing Y1,000 to Y885,000. Fuji Photo Film, the film maker, gained Y50 to Y2,230 on reports that the company had developed a floppy disk with a large storage capacity. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 34.40 to 22,249.92 in volume of 26.6m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits maker, rose Y50 to Y3,750. Roundup Profit-taking was one reason why a number of the regions markets fell yesterday. Bombay was closed for a public holiday. SYDNEY, already weak, slipped further after the diversified manufacturer, Pacific Dunlop, reported an annual profit at the lower end of market expectations. The All Ordinaries index closed 18.6 lower at 2,070.6, 1.7 per cent lower on the week. Pacific Dunlop lost 12 cents at ADollars 4.10. Its results were coupled with the continuing sell-off of BTR Nylex as major influences as the market dipped near the close. BTR Nylex fell 21 cents to ADollars 2.67. BANGKOK fell on selling by retail investors ahead of the reopening of parliament next week, the SET index closing 16.71 lower at 1,508.85, 2 per cent lower on the week, in turnover of Bt10.51bn. The finance sector, which shed 0.5 per cent, was the most active in Bt1.6bn billion baht. There was some talk of a possible interest rate rise by commercial banks. HONG KONG's Hang Seng index slipped 5.96 to 10,145.02, 2.5 per cent up on the week, but the spotlight again focused on mainland Chinese companies. The H share index tumbled 38.52, or 2.5 per cent to at 1,478.09, on profit-taking. On the week, the index was up 8 per cent and brokers said that they did not expect the consolidation period to last long. This week's rises were attributed to buying by overseas funds, and a follow-through from speculative demand. SINGAPORE closed easier but off the day's lows, the Straits Times Industrials Index ending 4.27 lower at 2,299.96, mainly on selling of shipyard stocks. The index was 1.3 per cent down on the week. SEOUL hit profit-taking and the composite index lost 6.64 to 984.80 after peaking at 1,002.72 in early trade. The index still finished 4.3 per cent better on the week. TAIPEI was nervous because of confusion over government policy toward liquidity, but the weighted index managed to close up 58.62 at 6,987.20 in thin turnover, down 0.3 per cent on the week.</p>

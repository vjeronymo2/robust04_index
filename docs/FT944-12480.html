			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: New lipstick line boosts Shiseido A new smudge-free lipstick has made an impression on profits at Shiseido, with the leading Japanese cosmetics manufacturer posting a moderate rise in interim recurring profits. Non-consolidated recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - for the first half rose 0.9 per cent to Y15.9bn (USDollars 163m), while overall sales edged down 1.5 per cent to Y196.8bn due to a sharp decline in sanitary products sales. After-tax profits advanced 1 per cent to Y7.8bn. Sales of Shiseido's new lipstick line, launched in July, totalled a record 2.3m units in the first two months, helping sales of the company's cosmetic's division rise 1.5 per cent to Y140.7bn. Revenue from its beauty salons, foods and drugs division fell 1.8 per cent to Y12.8bn. For the full year to next March, Shiseido expects parent recurring profits to rise 0.2 per cent to Y32.5bn, and sales to increase 0.2 per cent to Y392bn.</p>

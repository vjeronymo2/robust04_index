			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / They're picking up bad vibrations: The music industry is resigned to an inquiry into the cost of UK compact discs During the recent House of Commons inquiry into the price of compact discs, Mr Gerald Kaufman, national heritage committee chairman, complained that one interrupting witness appeared to be performing a duet with him. Both the UK music industry and its critics have stuck doggedly to their tunes during the debate on CD prices, without being distracted by the singing of the other party. Many listeners, however, have come away with little more than a headache - and no clear answer to the question: are UK music companies cheating consumers? Yesterday, the heritage committee published its report, condemning CD producers for charging too much and criticising retailers for failing to use their size to insist on price reductions. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, is expected within the next few days to announce whether he intends to recommend a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into the music industry. Music companies are resigned to an MMC inquiry. Both the committee and Sir Bryan stressed the importance of examining restrictions on parallel imports. The restrictions, contained in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988, allow the holder of a copyright to prevent the import of his or her work. This means that while the company which holds a copyright can import CDs, it can prevent independent companies from doing so. To many in the public gallery, the committee inquiry was an unimpressive affair. One observer, Mr John Preston, chairman of BMG Records (UK), who describes himself as a socialist, says that neither Labour nor Conservative committee members seemed to understand how a free market worked. They had difficulty accepting industry executives' assertions that production cost should not be the only determinant of CD prices and that companies could legitimately consider what consumers were prepared to pay. For their part, several industry witnesses retreated into resentment when confronted with the all-party onslaught from Labour's Mr Kaufman and Conservative colleagues such as Mr Toby Jessel. Music industry executives say they cannot understand why they have been the focus of such intense criticism, when the publishing industry is permitted to fix prices openly through the Net Book Agreement. They also point out that, unlike CDs, books are exempted from value-added tax. The publishing industry has argued that VAT on books would be a tax on learning. 'Why is Barbara Cartland more educational than Mozart?' one music industry official asks. Mr Preston adds that, unlike the far less successful British film industry, music companies have never asked for government money or special tax treatment. For all the discomfort the attacks have caused the industry, none of the critics has, until now, been able to point to anti-competitive practices by the music companies. An earlier OFT inquiry by Sir Gordon Borrie, Sir Bryan's predecessor, concluded last year that there were no grounds for an MMC inquiry because there was no evidence of any collusion between companies. Sir Gordon said there appeared no good reason why CDs should be more expensive than cassettes when production costs were the same - a point stressed in yesterday's heritage committee report. But Sir Gordon added: 'Producers and retailers have taken advantage of the willingness of consumers to pay a higher price for the perceived higher quality of a CD. In other words, the prices of CDs have settled around a level which, on the whole, the market appears willing to bear.' Sir Bryan told the committee last month, however, that lower CD prices in the US had persuaded him that the issue needed to be looked at again. Most worrying for the industry, he said he would look at a specific trading practice - restrictions on parallel imports. The heritage committee conceded that relaxing import restrictions could put the UK at a disadvantage to countries like the US which have tight controls. The UK would be open to US imports while the American market would remain closed. The committee recommended, however, that the Department of Trade and Industry re-examines current copyright legislation. A change to the copyright laws, permitting a flood of cheap imports, is what UK music companies fear most. Mr Nic Garnett, director-general of the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents music companies worldwide, says unrestricted cheap imports could damage the UK industry by depriving companies of the profits needed to invest in new, often risky, talent. Mr Maurice Oberstein, chairman of the British Phonographic Industry, says the pricing debate has focused on the effect of cheaper CDs on large companies such as PolyGram, Thorn EMI, Sony and WEA/Warner. The BPI has 150 members, however, many of them small, and lower profit margins could drive them out of business, he says. Leading companies such as Virgin Music started out as independent producers and it is the smaller UK labels which have traditionally found new talent. If profit margins become so small that independent companies can no longer operate, new acts will find it even harder to gain recognition, he argues. Mr Garnett adds that a more liberal copyright regime could result in imports of pirate CDs. He agrees that legislation could be drafted to allow only lawfully produced CDs to be imported, but says this will prove difficult in practice. 'What if the CDs are made in the Ukraine where there are no copyright laws at all?' he asks. The Consumers' Association pointed out to the committee that imports could be permitted from countries which have signed intellectual property conventions and which enforce them properly. Mr Garnett argues that this would not necessarily result in lower prices. Japan, which has no copyright controls, has some of the highest CD prices in the world, while the US, with strict restrictions against parallel imports, is regarded as having the lowest. In any event, he says, EC countries such as Denmark and Ireland have no bar to parallel imports, and the situation in France, Portugal and the Netherlands is unclear. There is no legal bar to UK companies importing CDs from these countries without the permission of the copyright holders. Nevertheless, the British Phonographic Institute estimates, based on figures provided by Gallup, that only 0.3 per cent of UK CDs are currently imported by independent distributors - the companies that might be expected to undercut the prices of the biggest groups. But if parallel imports do not take place at the moment, even though they are legally possible, and there is no evidence that they would result in lower consumer prices, why is the industry so strongly opposed to them? Mr Garnett says a possible reason prices do not fall when restrictions are lifted is that independent importers fail to pass on the benefit of their lower costs and simply enjoy higher profit margins. This would damage the mainstream industry without resulting in a significant benefit to the consumer. He says he does not know why parallel imports do not occur at present - possibly because even with cheap imports, selling CDs is not sufficiently profitable to make it attractive to independent distributors. The problem with changes in copyright law is that the outcome is difficult to predict, Mr Garnett says. An MMC inquiry would provide an opportunity to examine copyright rules in greater detail. It appears, however, that critics of the music companies would be unwise to regard an increase in parallel imports as a panacea. When pressed privately about why UK prices are higher than in the US, music industry executives say that British consumers are prepared to pay more than their American counterparts. The national heritage committee report argues that UK companies could substantially increase the size of the CD market if they charged less; in 1991, each American owner of a CD player bought 15 discs, compared with only 7.8 in the UK. But the UK industry is not doing badly. Delivery of CDs to UK retailers grew 12.2 per cent last year to 70.5m units, despite the recession and the availability of cheaper cassettes. In the first quarter of 1993, CD sales rose 32.4 per cent. Reams of paper will no doubt continue to pour from the offices of MPs and consumer groups. For all the irritation they cause, however, CD companies pay more attention to what comes out of music lovers' wallets.  ---------------------------------------------------- CDS: IN A SPIN OVER PRICES  ---------------------------------------------------- Suggested retail price categories (Pounds 1 = Dollars 1.57)  ---------------------------------------------------- US           Dollars   Pound equivalent  ---------------------------------------------------- Budget         9.95         6.34 Mid Line      11.96         7.62 Full Line     13.99         8.91  ---------------------------------------------------- UK           Pounds  ---------------------------------------------------- Budget         5.78 Mid Price      8.08 Full Price    11.74  ---------------------------------------------------- Source: National Heritage  ----------------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------------------------------- COMPARATIVE EUROPEAN PRICES (POPULAR MUSIC)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Published December 1991                                  Pounds Irish Republic                    17.13 Denmark                           16.73 France                            15.41 Belgium                           15.10 Portugal                          15.06 Netherlands                       14.95 Luxembourg                        14.69 Spain                             14.50 Italy                             13.40 Germany                           13.14 Greece                            12.86 UK                                12.78  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: British Phonographic Industry/Employment Conditions Abroad  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

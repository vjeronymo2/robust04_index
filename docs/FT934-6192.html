			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / BAe in deal to develop Indonesian car industry: Joint venture on regional aircraft to be considered British Aerospace is seeking to take a leading role in the development of indigenous aircraft and car industries in Indonesia in one of the fastest-growing regions of the world. Rover group, BAe's motor vehicles subsidiary, has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Indonesian government to lead the development of a national car project to design, develop and manufacture a small car for production in Indonesia. BAe also agreed yesterday to consider forming a joint venture to develop and manufacture regional turbopropeller aircraft with the Indonesian state-owned aerospace company PT Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (IPTN). With a population of almost 194m and an economy forecast to grow at more than 6 per cent a year in 1993 and 1994, Indonesia has long had ambitions to develop its car and aerospace sectors as part of the rapid industrialisation of south-east Asia. BAe said yesterday it had signed the two agreements after meetings in London with Dr Bacharrudin Habibie, the Indonesian minister for research and technology and chairman both of the Indonesian Agency for Strategic Industries and of IPTN. According to the motor industry memorandum, Rover will provide technology transfer and technical support to a joint small car programme. The car would be sold initially in the home market but subsequently would also be aimed at export markets. Production volumes would be up to 50,000 a year with output probably starting in 1996-97. It is understood that the car would be based on the chassis platform of the present Metro/Rover 100 and would be powered by Rover's 1.1 litre K-Series engine. In the early stages of the project Rover would supply mechanical components such as engines and gearboxes but the company said the ultimate aim was for the car to be completely manufactured in Indonesia. Rover would not take any equity stake in the project, and the strategic industries agency would be responsible for the financing, said the UK carmaker. Rover will head a group of five British companies developing the car jointly with the Indonesians, including T&amp;N, the engine components group; IAD, the automotive design and engineering consultancy; Mira, the automotive testing facility, and Inchcape, the international trading and motor retailing group, which is one of the leading independent car importer/distributors in Asia. Indonesia's plan for an indigenous car industry follows the success of neighbouring Malaysia in developing a national car, the Proton Saga, based on technology from Mitsubishi Motors of Japan. Indonesia is one of BAe's biggest customers and is its second biggest overseas military export market after Saudi Arabia. Portuguese airline sues BAe for Dollars 70m, Page 9</p>

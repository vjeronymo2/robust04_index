			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Climbdown inevitable over pits as MPs agree rescue plan AN EXPENSIVE government climbdown over the future of the coal industry became inevitable last night after a cross-party committee of MPs agreed plans which would safeguard at least half of the 31 pits threatened with closure. Ministers conceded that the proposals would form the benchmark for the white paper on the industry promised by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, for early next month. A report from the House of Commons trade and industry committee told the government to increase the market for domestic coal in the generating industry by a minimum of 16m tonnes a year at a cost of about Pounds 300m. It suggested that a further 3m tonnes might be sold outside the electricity industry. Yesterday Mr Heseltine met senior cabinet colleagues to finalise a draft of the white paper to be presented to Mr John Major, the prime minister, on his return from India later this week. Any attempt by the government to propose an overall market smaller than the minimum of 56m tonnes recommended by the committee would invite a further damaging defeat in the House of Commons. The MPs, who agreed the report after two days of wrangling between the Labour and Tory groups on the committee, made no mention of the number of pits which would be saved. But privately they agreed that the plan would mean that 16 pits would be assured of survival, with the future of three or four others in the balance. The remainder might be kept open for a short period while they were stripped of easily-accessible reserves. Plan to save up to 19 pits, Page 11</p>

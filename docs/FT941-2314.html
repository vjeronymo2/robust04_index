			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / N Korea's 'sea of fire' threat shakes Seoul: Pyongyang may be set on cultivating a nuclear madman image The mood in Seoul has turned distinctly sombre since last Saturday when the chief North Korean delegate at an inter-Korean meeting declared: 'Seoul will turn into a sea of fire.' After four decades, South Koreans had thought they had grown accustomed to the bellicose rhetoric of their northern brothers. But the inflammatory remarks by Mr Pak Yong-su are the talk of Seoul; the average South Korean has been made starkly aware of the potential seriousness resulting from the dispute over the North's nuclear programme. It was the first time in more than two decades that North Korea had threatened the possibility of war in a meeting with South Korea. But South Koreans appeared more shocked by the personal threats directed against their delegates and journalists attending the meeting at the truce village of Panmunjom. The outburst was triggered when Mr Song Young-dae, the chief delegate for South Korea, mentioned the possibility of UN sanctions being applied against North Korea for its refusal to accept full international nuclear inspections. 'It does not matter what sanctions are applied against us. We are ready to respond with an eye for an eye and a war for a war,' said Mr Pak. 'Seoul is not far away from here. If a war breaks out, Seoul will turn into a sea of fire. Mr Song, you won't survive the war,' he added. Meanwhile, North Korean journalists covering the meeting were telling their southern counterparts: 'You'd better prepare passports for flight to the US if you are not prepared to risk your life for your country.' But some government officials in Seoul yesterday were speculating that the barrage of insulting comments was carefully orchestrated and that North Korea is deliberately cultivating a 'madman' image as a new psychological negotiating tactic to win concessions. 'The North's whole strategy on the nuclear issue is based on intimidation, playing on international fears that they will lash out if they are pushed too far,' one government official said. The prevalent view in Seoul has long been that North Korea has fostered its image as a nuclear power to try to blackmail the US into granting concessions, including diplomatic recognition, the lifting of trade sanctions and the supply of aid for its tottering economy. Some analysts even believe the North is now blocking full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency not because it has something to hide, but because it does not want to disclose that its nuclear programme is an empty threat. This would seriously weaken its negotiating position. Most officials in Seoul are convinced that the North is pursuing a nuclear weapons programme, although Pyongyang might agree to abandon it if the US offers concessions. Complicating the game of diplomatic poker are signs of a power struggle in Pyongyang over the nuclear issue. Economic pragmatists, who want to open the country to foreign investment in a Chinese-style reform programme, may be urging President Kim Il-sung to play the nuclear card soon to avoid further international isolation. Plans to create economic zones for foreign investment have proceeded apace in parallel with the nuclear dispute over the past year. But the conservative old guard fears that allowing foreign influence into the country will undermine the government. They view a nuclear programme as their chief security guarantee against absorption by the South. What has added to the North's frustration in reaching an agreement with the US is the involvement of South Korea in the negotiations. Seoul has insisted that Pyongyang fulfil its 1991 bilateral non-nuclear pact before the US makes significant concessions to North Korea. Washington has supported the South Korean stance. North Korea has consistently sought to establish ties with the US and ignore South Korea's demands in an attempt to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington. Pyongyang used a similar 'divide and rule' strategy in playing off its former patrons, China and the Soviet Union, to gain concessions from both and maintain its independence. The vehemence of Mr Pak's remarks against the South Korean delegates reflects Pyongyang's belief that Seoul is trying to block a direct deal between North Korea and the US. But government officials in Seoul believe that the North Koreans may have miscalculated this time with the 'sea of fire' outburst. 'Many South Koreans appeared to have been little concerned about the nuclear problem,' said Mr Kim Jong-pil, the chairman of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party. 'They will now have to wake up from their illusions and prepare to meet the situation quietly but firmly.'</p>

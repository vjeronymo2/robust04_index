			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] San Jose, 5 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- Jose Maria Figueres,  National Liberation Party (PLN) presidential candidate, said it  is necessary for Costa Rica to review its relations with Cuba  within the framework of new international relations.    During an impromptu news conference a few hours before the  start of this country's general elections, Figueres cited the  need to evaluate the current state of relations between Costa  Rica and Cuba "without deviating from the issue of human rights,  which concerns all Costa Ricans."    "By respecting each country's decisions and internal  situation, we are obligated to analyze, review this case to  ascertain whether our position responds to current world  realities," the presidential candidate said.    He dodged voicing an opinion about the U.S. blockade against  Cuba, saying "what should concern us is our relations and  policies toward Cuba, and that is what we are going to  reevaluate."    "At any rate, I believe every country on the continent that  still does not have relations with that nation (Cuba) should  also review their policies," he added.    Figueres said "the world evolves. Nothing should remain  static. I believe we all must evaluate the possibility of  improving things, seeking, of course, that all our countries and  people, including the Cuban people, may have a better future."    With respect to the possible reestablishment of diplomatic  or  consular relations during his eventual administration, the  presidential candidate responded "first we must review our  policies in light of world conditions; afterward, we will  decide."</p>

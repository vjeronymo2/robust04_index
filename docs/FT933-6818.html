			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Canadian bank ahead despite provisions BANK OF MONTREAL, Canada's third-biggest chartered bank, yesterday reported third-quarter net profits of CDollars 180m (USDollars 136m), or 66 cents a share, slightly better than expected. This compared with CDollars 173m, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. The bank's chairman, Mr Matthew Barrett, said that despite higher provisions for credit losses, loan volumes were higher and securities trading and other income were up strongly. He said costs had been kept under control. Total revenues were up 7 per cent in the quarter, which ended July, and managed to grow at a faster rate than expenses. Most Canadian analysts had estimated the bank's third-quarter net profit would be 63 cents a share, said Mr Roy Palmer, bank analyst with Bunting Warburg in Montreal. For the first nine months of the year, the bank earned CDollars 508m, or CDollars 1.85 a share, up 5.9 per cent from CDollars 480m, or CDollars 1.79 a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 8.9 per cent and the increase in expenses, after exchange factors and taxes, was held to less than 2 per cent. Return on average equity was 13.6 per cent, against 14.4 per cent a year earlier. Provision for credit losses was increased 4 per cent to CDollars 675m. Non-performing loans totalled CDollars 2.1bn at end-July, up 2 per cent. Total assets stood at CDollars 111bn, against CDollars 105bn a year earlier. Bank of Montreal is the first of Canada's big six commercial banks to report its third-quarter results.</p>

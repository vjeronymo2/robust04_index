			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: TAKE A SHORT COURSE ON SHORTCAKE  </P> <P> One of the best ways to show off fresh summer fruit is in an old-fashioned  shortcake. Strawberries may best exemplify this dessert, but other berries,  peaches, nectarines and plums also make excellent fillings.  </P> <P> Although flaky cookies, pound or shortened cakes and spongecakes may be used as  the base, old-fashioned shortcake is traditionally made with a slightly  sweetened biscuit dough. Whether the surface is left rough or smoothed and  sprinkled with sugar is a matter of personal preference.  </P> <P> Tree fruit may be peeled, if desired, then sliced. Halve or slice strawberries;  leave other small berries whole. Sprinkle fruit with sugar, set aside and  occasionally stir gently until the sugar dissolves and forms a syrup.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, place the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder in a large bowl. Cut  in the butter and/or shortening with a pastry blender (Step 1) until the  mixture resembles coarse meal.  </P> <P> Make a well in the center of the ingredients and add the milk all at once (Step  2). Stir with a fork until well moistened and the dough begins to pull away  from the sides of the bowl (Step 3).  </P> <P> Spoon the dough into a 9-inch round cake pan that has been greased with  shortening. Spread to cover the bottom of the pan (Step 4). The top may be left  rough or smoothed, depending on personal preference. Sprinkle with sugar, (Step  5) if desired.  </P> <P> Shortcake is baked at 425 degrees 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and a  wood pick inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove from the oven and cool  on a wire rack about 10 minutes, then turn out of the pan.  </P> <P> Using a long, serrated knife, slice the warm shortcake in half horizontally  (Step 6). Spread the bottom half with whipped cream, then spoon on fruit (Step  7).  </P> <P> Place the top half over the fruit (Step 8) and cover with more whipped cream  (Step 9). Garnish the top with additional fruit (Step 10). Cut into wedges to  serve.  </P> <P> OLD-FASHIONED SHORTCAKE  </P> <P> 1 3/4 cups flour  </P> <P> Sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 tablespoon baking powder  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons chilled butter  </P> <P> 3 tablespoons shortening  </P> <P> 3/4 cup milk or half and half  </P> <P> Combine flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, salt and baking powder in large bowl. Cut in  butter and shortening with pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse meal.  </P> <P> Make well in center of ingredients and add milk all at once. Stir with fork  until well moistened and dough begins to pull away from sides of bowl.  </P> <P> Spoon dough into greased 9-inch round cake pan. Smooth top and sprinkle with  sugar, if desired.  </P> <P> Bake at 425 degrees 25 to 30 minutes or until golden brown and wood pick  inserted in center comes out clean. Remove from oven and cool on wire rack 10  minutes, then turn out of pan. Makes 1 (9-inch) shortcake, 6 to 8 servings.  </P></p>

			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: VAT would be blow for books Sir, Your readers who saw that the book trade expects a 5 per cent reduction in book sales as a result of VAT being imposed might well feel that the industry is protesting too much ('Industry tries to fend off the VAT man', October 11). In fact, our estimate of the likely reduction, based on detailed economic analysis, is at least 15 per cent, which makes all the difference between a relatively minor hardship and a catastrophic body blow. No industry could absorb such a loss of revenue without drastic upheavals: in the book business, we would expect to see many bookshop closures and 10,000 or more jobs lost, not to mention a substantial reduction in the number and variety of books published. Peter Kilborn, campaign manager, Books Add Value Campaign, 19 Bedford Square, London WC1B 3HJ</p>

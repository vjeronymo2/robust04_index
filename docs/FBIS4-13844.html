			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by M. Mollazadeh: "NATO's Cosmetic Actions"] </F>   [Excerpts] The limited strikes by NATO warplanes on some  less important Serb positions around the city of Gorazde,  strikes in which it is said that only one Serb tank was  destroyed, raise the question: Why has NATO resorted to this  cosmetic action? If we were to glance at the news reports  concerning Bosnia-Herzegovina, especially Gorazde, the answer  would not be very difficult to find. Before U.S. airplanes  overflew their positions, the Serbs had carried out chemical  bombing of Gorazde and the city was on the verge of collapse.  [passage omitted]    The Muslim people of Gorazde gained nothing from these  attacks and the danger of a massacre was not mitigated.  Clearly, the Western mass media carried out extensive  propaganda on this superficial action, as if to say that it  actually halted the Serb advance.    The Bosnian president welcomed NATO's action but openly  declared that such limited strikes were carried out too late and  could not change the course of events. This is worth mulling  over. A sovereign country such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, a UN  member, cannot expect support from the greater powers; it is not  in such a position. [passage omitted]    Obviously things will continue as they are, as the Serbs  will  not only continue their aggression, but will also try every  means possible to occupy all the Bosnian areas to which they  profess historical claims. They will not hesitate to perpetrate  greater atrocities, such as using banned chemical weapons.  Unfortunately, the world has closed its eyes to such crimes and  no sounds of deterrent seem to be emanating from any country.    In such circumstances, the Serbs continue their campaign of  bloody ethnic cleansing against the Bosnian Muslims.  Undoubtedly, limited, ineffective action will not solve the  problems of the Muslim defenders of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the  Bosnian war.    With their silence, the international organizations,  European  countries, the United States, and Russia have extended their  tacit consent for the Serbs' atrocities in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  which is tantamount to complicity in these crimes. They cannot  shrug off their responsibility with such superficial actions.    Limited operations against the Serbs cannot fool the Bosnian  Muslims into untimely optimistic conjecture. But since  conditions are so difficult for them, they cannot ignore even a  glimmer of hope.    There is also the theory that NATO carried out these strikes  to divert attention from the Serbs' use of chemical weapons  against the Bosnian Muslims. This is what happened and the  international mass media directed all its attention to reporting  on NATO's aerial operations so that people everywhere would have  less time to ponder the criminal actions of the Serbs and their  chemical bombing of Gorazde.    It is not unlikely that the international community's  inertia  and the indifference by Europe and the United States over using  their troops to halt the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina may result in  dismembering this country. This will enable the Serbs to  achieve their goals. If this occurs, there is no knowing where  the Serbs will stop, because they may covet other remaining  Muslim territory. The war may spread further in the region and  may even continue for an unforeseen period.    In the circumstances, will the world move toward unbridled  power for some countries and fail to rein in the lust for power  of fascist and chauvinist groups? If events in  Bosnia-Herzegovina are to be considered the criterion for  judgment, you can state with great regret that the world is  facing bleak prospects.</p>

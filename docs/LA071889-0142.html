			<p><P> July 18, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PACHYDERMS ON PARADE  </P> <P> Despite temperatures in the 90s, hundreds of people gathered Monday afternoon  to catch a glimpse of elephants, lions and tigers marching on the Anaheim  Convention Center.  </P> <P> The unlikely parade down Lewis Street and Katella Avenue marked the arrival  Monday of the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey circus, which will perform  at the convention center today through next Tuesday.  </P> <P> The circus's show animals were led from rail cars to the convention center by  famed animal trainer Gunther Gebel-Williams, who will retire from the ring at  the end of the season.  </P> <P> Long Beach residents Gina and Donald Davis brought their three children for a  glimpse of the show animals.  </P> <P> "We know they are coming to Long Beach . . . but we couldn't wait," said Gina  Davis. The animals and performers travel by train to each of the 39 cities  where the circus performs, spokeswoman Ashley Anderson said. After the animals  are unloaded, they are marched through each city to the circus show grounds.  Justin Rhea arrived an hour early Monday to guarantee a good spot for his  annual viewing.  </P> <P> "I never miss it, not even when I am ill," said the 81-year-old retired  salesman from Anaheim.

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Analysts see EC facing feedgrain glut MILLIONS OF extra tonnes of grain may flood into European animal feed markets from 1993 to 1995 and beyond because of poor weather for crops this year and sharp falls in prices stemming from cuts in European Community subsidies, analysts believe, reports Reuter from Amsterdam. They estimate that between 2m and 4m additional tonnes of grain will be used as animal fodder in the community in 1993, rising to between 7m and 9m a year within three years. 'The main effect is going to be on imports of soyameal and tapioca, particularly if high protein prices due to poor crop conditions in the US are maintained,' one German analyst said. He estimated about 10 per cent of annual EC imports of animal feeds, or 4m to 5m tonnes of mainly soyameal, could be replaced by feed grain by the 1995-1996 July-June season. Under new EC regulations the community's farmers are no longer able to sell feed grain to public intervention stocks and a wet summer in northern Europe has left large portions of the wheat crop only suitable for feed and not bread making. Grain prices had slumped by up to 25 per cent so far this year in comparison with 1992 prices and the changes in EC laws implemented from July 1 were expected to lead to further falls of about 5 per cent in 1994-95 and 5 per cent in 1995-1996, analysts said. 'These price reductions are only rough estimates because they depend on developments in the European monetary system - 'green rates' and realignments,' one added. The shift towards feed wheat has been most marked in animal feeds in southern Germany, France, Spain and Italy and less so in the Netherlands and northern Germany where easy access to the big North Sea ports makes soyameal transport costs competitive. 'The proportion of grain in pig feed formulations has increased from between 3 to 5 per cent to about 10 to 15 per cent this year,' one Dutch analyst said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 29 (XINHUA) -- On the 5,800-km  coastline around the Bohai Sea, more than 40 ports have  undertaken expansion projects, with overseas investment being  one of the main funding sources.    The area around the Bohai Sea, embracing the four provinces  of Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei and Shanxi and the cities of  Beijing and Tianjin, boasts many important ports whose combined  handling capacity accounts for over 40 percent of the country's  total.    The central government has recently listed it among the  regions to be developed first in the next century, because of  its large import and export volume--half of the nation's  total--and its trade relations with over 160 countries and  regions.    So far, Qingdao port has received a loan of 20 billion  Japanese yen from the Japanese Government, and Dandong port, 20  million U.S. dollars in loans from the Asia Development Bank.    Tianjin has also sought out cooperation with foreign  investors.    At present, port construction has progressed smoothly in the  area.    In Liaoning, the completion of the Dayaowan Project will  enable Dalian port to claim an annual handling capacity of over  100 million tons at the beginning of the next century, ranking  the port as one of the world's largest.    Qinhuangdao in Hebei Province, the country's No. 1 port for  coal exports, will show an increase of 30 million tons in annual  handling capacity by 1996.    Tianjin, China's largest artificial port, will handle 60  million tons of goods by the end of this century, when the  ongoing projects of the Beijiang, Haihe and Nanjiang harbors are  completed.</p>

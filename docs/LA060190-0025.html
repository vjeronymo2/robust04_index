			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: 'FIRE WAS BURNING' AN INTRIGUING LOCAL BOW FOR IGLOO TROUPE  </P> <P> Don't be put off by the title of the igLoo group's first production in its  Hollywood space.  </P> <P> The pretentious sounding "A Fire Was Burning Over the Dumpling House One  Chinese New Year" doesn't even hint at the chords struck by the writing of Paul  Peditto and the lead performances in this production of his Steppling-esque  exploration of a small-time hustler and his alcoholic, drug-ridden girlfriend.  </P> <P> Horace is a bartender in a Manhattan transvestite bar -- well, it's a job --  and Baby Jane is a regular customer, hiding under a frowzy wig and behind dark  shades. Their mutual spark ignites and they begin a muddled odyssey that ends  in Atlantic City, he behind a casino gaming table and she in scroungy Baltic  Avenue bars.  </P> <P> It's a disconcerting, harrowing journey. But under Daniel Piburn's theatrical,  tightly wound direction, there is also the sense of humor that most people find  to help them survive life's traps.  </P> <P> A lot of that humor, and a great deal of insight into what makes Baby Jane  tick, is provided by the exceptional performance of Maria Tirabassi as the lost  girl trying to find a light to follow. Chris Peditto is fine as the passive  Horace, irresistibly drawn to Baby Jane but hampered by his own inability to  act on his better judgment. Samantha Kaye also impresses as Jane's junkie  girlfriend.  </P> <P> "A Fire Was Burning" is an intriguing local bow for this relocated Chicago  company. They're imaginative and unafraid to take chances, and that makes for  exciting theater.  </P> <P>  At 6543 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood; Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays,  7 p.m.; indefinitely. $12; (213) 962-3771.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Dark Ride' a Symphonic Tone Poem in Words  </P> <P> There is a linear plotline in Len Jenkin's "Dark Ride" at Beyond Baroque, but  it's of little import.  </P> <P> A writer is hired by Sublime Publications to translate an ancient Chinese  manuscript, but can't decide if the fragments are real or a fraud. One fragment  describes a girl whose lover has left her. The lover steals a precious gem from  an obsessive jeweler, and here we leave reason and venture into Jenkin's  hypnotic, other-worldly realm of fluid language, of scrambled eras, mixed  images and surprise packages of dramatic genres.  </P> <P> This carnival ride -- "Listen, lady, if he's old enough to enjoy the ride, he's  old enough to need a ticket," hollers an announcer -- is dark, but it's also  full of light. Less of a play than a symphonic tone poem in words, it requires  the audience to listen, to submit to its rhythms and to absorb the significance  of its calligraphic brush strokes as they flash past.  </P> <P> In a large company, Jonathan Emerson makes a strong impression as the  Translator, as do James Nixon as the lover turned Thief, Synthia Hardy as Deep  Sea Edna, and Nancy Magathan as Margo, the girl who lost her lover and becomes  the bait for his capture.  </P> <P> Director Alec Doyle guides his large cast with expert attention to the text,  given an added advantage in his energetic staging by Kevin Adams' versatile set  and intricate, dream-world lighting. David Dowse and Lee Scott provide a sound  design that places the audience smack in the front seat, as they are reeled  through the fascinating labyrinth of the translator's Book of the Yellow  Ancestor.  </P> <P>  At 681 Venice Blvd., Venice; Saturdays and Sundays, 8 p.m.; ends June 24. $8;  (213) 822-3006.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Only You' -- Good Stuff Trapped in a TV Sitcom  </P> <P> Timothy Mason's "Only You" at 2nd Stage has a fine, versatile set designed by  Robert L. Smith, effective costumes by Jill Ohanneson and excellent, intricate  lighting by J. Kent Inasy. It's well directed at the proper frenzied pace by  Joel Asher, and boasts some good performances, particularly Mark Arnott's  hysterical, loony, paranoid bachelor and Kristina Starman's ditzy bimbo, who  can't rise above being an armchair feminist.  </P> <P> But none of these admirable efforts keep the play from seeming merely a  television version of Howard Korder's "Boys' Life." If these latent-adult males  struggling with junior high school mentalities in the battle of the sexes bear  any resemblance to the thirtysome-thing males of the early '90s, we're in deep  trouble.  </P> <P> Jeff Doucette, Stacey Stone, Carey Eidel and Ric Stoneback, as a heavenly  manipulator, do their sitcom best, but can't keep "Only You" from looking like  a pilot that didn't make it.  </P> <P> Playwright Mason has been seen to better advantage in plays such as "In a  Northern Landscape." What possessed him to move in this direction?  </P> <P>  At 6500 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood; Thursdays through Sundays, 8 p.m.; ends  July 1. $15; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Mixed Bag of Monologues at Theatre/Theater  </P> <P> The three monologuists whose visions make up "Triple Vision," a brief program  at Theatre/Theater, present a mixed bag of effects with some hits and some  misses.  </P> <P> Susan Van Allen's four pieces are linear, almost plotted, but she doesn't take  her material as seriously as she could. From her nasty little girl, who  screeches that she wants to go to the zoo, to her elitist novelist working as  an office temp, she starts on an intriguing path of satire without ever  reaching a conclusion.  </P> <P> Don Victor is more successful, less linear and more startling in his  imaginative approach and evocative writing. His surrealistic Commander Ray is a  bouquet of verbal Dadaism, and his aging baby-sitter Waldo, improvising a story  for his charges through audience suggestion, is clever and oddly touching.  </P> <P> The highlights of the program are Siobhan Fallon's excerpts from her one-woman  show. Her ostentatiously programmed therapist, her chorus girl in a non-Equity  stock production of "My Fair Lady" and her pantomimed "Fish" are singular  delights and spark this uneven hour.  </P> <P>  At 1713 N. Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood; Saturdays, 5 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m.; ends  July 1. $10; (213) 871-0210.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] On 11 November the Atomic Energy Subcommittee  (chairman: Isamu Yamashita, Advisor to the Federation of  Economic Organizations), Advisory Committee for Energy, Agency  of Natural Resources and Energy, MITI, began meetings to review  nuclear fuel recycling operations and improved safety measures  for nuclear power generation from the standpoint of overall  government energy policy. The subcommittee will compile an  outline for its interim report in the first part of May next  year, and thereafter consider nuclear fuel recycling operations,  international relations, etc., separately before issuing its  final report.    The Basic Policy Subcommittee of the Advisory Committee for  Energy has been meeting since September to deliberate stability  and flexibility in energy supply. During the course of these  discussions, it was noted that there is a need to consider the  role of nuclear energy in light of a new energy policy based on  changes in the environment.    While keeping a close eye on the status of the Long-Term  Plan  for Development and Use of Atomic Energy that is currently under  review, the Atomic Energy Subcommittee decided to hold intensive  discussions on improving the safety measures for nuclear power  generation.    The first points for consideration are measures to improve  safety in LWRs, which are the mainstream of nuclear power  generation in Japan, and improving and expanding activities to  present information and promote atomic energy in order to  increase understanding of nuclear power generation among the  general populace.    Second, it is important to obtain international  understanding  about nuclear fuel recycling operations in light of increasing  interest throughout the world in nuclear non-proliferation, so  the subcommittee will consider the course of future policy that  can measure up to questioning from both foreign and domestic  sources as it reaffirms the path toward reprocessing and  recycling.    Third, the subcommittee will consider methods for  cooperation  in nuclear power safety, mainly with the countries in the  vicinity of Japan that have already introduced nuclear power  generation or plan to do so in the future.</p>

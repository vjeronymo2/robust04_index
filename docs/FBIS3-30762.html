			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Feb 7 (TANJUG) -- President Slobodan  Milosevic of Serbia and head of the UNPROFOR mission Yasushi  Akashi in Belgrade on Monday assessed that the signing of a  peace agreement accounted for the most efficient way to end the  war in the ex-Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Present at the talks also were UNPROFOR Commander for Bosnia  General Michael Rose, special envoy of the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees Nicholas Morris, and Yugoslav Foreign  Minister Vladislav Jovanovic.    The signing of a peace agreement would avert or discourage  the forces opting for continued war, it was assessed at the  talks.    The evasion of a peace agreement by war option protagonists,  assisted by foreign factors, can only flare up war conflicts  bearing heavy consequences om regional peace and stability, it  was cautioned at the talks.    On Sunday, the Moslem side rejected a draft accord on  lasting  truce in the Sarajevo region as drawn up by Bosnian Serb leader  Radovan Karadzic and Asushi Yakashi. The Moslems also turned  down a peace plan by the European Union (E.U.) in Geneva twenty  days ago, opting for war and trying to win out military  intervention against Bosnian Serbs.    A resumption of political talks, to which the Serb side  commits itself and on which the international community would  have to insist strongly, is the only rasonable road to peace, it  was said at the talks.    It was pointed out that Serbia, as it has been doing so far,  would lend support to peace efforts by the United Nations in the  areas of former Yugoslavia.</p>

Ya. Oboimov and S. A. Derevyanko; UDC </F> 621.396.93]    [Text] The appearance of cellular mobile radio  communication (SPR) networks in Russia's Interlinked  Communication Network (VSS) revealed some additional vulnerable  places in the organization of the electric communication sector,  and posed new problems of network control before science.    The problems of the sector's development are aggravated by  the difficulties in the economy, and in particular:     -  the higher cost of raw materials, supplies, energy  resources, and construction and installation work;    -  the practical absence of Russian-made communication equipment  satisfying modern requirements;    -  the unfavorable exchange rate of the ruble, which makes major  purchases of imported equipment impossible with the existing  financing volumes;    -  unfinished processes of the sector's management and  privatization;    -  obsolete standards and guidelines.       Broad sections of the radio spectrum continue to be  inaccessible to new communication services.    At the same time there are factors which are acting in favor  of the development of new communication services, systems and  resources: relatively low cost of microelectronic equipment per  telephone number, especially of digital transmission and  switching systems, in comparison with traditional systems; the  prospects for allocating sufficient frequency bands making it  possible to develop the network not by laying cable lines but by  organizing radio systems of various configuration, both in  cities and in the countryside.    Such radio systems have enjoyed wide application abroad, and  are beginning to be introduced in our country. Thus, two  cellular mobile radio communication networks have been operating  since 1992--in Moscow and in St. Petersburg. In that same year  two standards were adopted in the Russian Federation for  cellular mobile radio communication systems--NMT and GSM.  Adoption of still other standards is possible--PCN, DECT etc. In  addition, creation of regional networks in the 830-890 MHz band  on the basis of the DAMPS standard has been permitted. A  competition was conducted for the right of designing and  operating SPR networks on the basis of the GSM standard in  different regions of Russia.    However, the process of creating public SPR is far from  smooth. In order that the correct decisions could be made, let  us analyze some of the problems that have arisen during  development of mobile communication networks in Russia.  <H5>  Interaction of SPR With the VSS </H5>   Owing to the disintegration of the USSR, the Interlinked  Communication Network, or the Unified Automated National  Communication Network (YeASS) is undergoing a deep crisis  brought about by upgrading of interrepublican networks to the  international level, displacement of financing sources locally,  and elimination of centralized leadership. On this backdrop,  greater interest in establishing SPR networks, the status of  which had been until recently at the level of the status of  departmental communication networks, adds to the overall chaos.    In fact, neither the Main Directions for Development of the  YeASS [1] nor the guidelines on the General State System of  Automated Telephone Communication (OGSTfS) [2] contains a  definition of public mobile radio communication, of which SPR is  a variant, and of its role in the YeASS (VSS). Document [2] is  obsolete regarding mobile radio communication and conflicts with  [1]; even so, it has not been rescinded. It is because of this  in particular that uncertainty exists in the means of connecting  mobile radio communication networks to the OGSTfS.    Connection of SPR with the rights of a hundreds and a  thousands group and with the rights of regional dial telephone  systems and local telephone networks with a 90 code is  permitted. The terms of the competitions carried out for the  best plan for organizing cellular networks clearly require  connection to the AMTS [automatic long distance telephone  exchange] with a 90 code. This is possible only for one cellular  net in a region. But considering the future, we need to foresee  a series of codes for local networks, for example on the basis  of the NMT or GSM or PSN standard. In the initial stage, when  the network is servicing a small number of subscribers, the  number capacity is used wastefully (one code of the local net  representing 100,000 numbers).    In addition, assigning such codes to the SPR involves  technical difficulties in a number of regions due to the lack of  AMTS equipment, the need for laying new connecting lines, and in  Moscow, moreover, exhaustion of the number capacity.    These and other problems of developing public mobile radio  communication are in my opinion the consequences of unanswered  questions involving interaction of mobile radio communication  networks with the VSS. The main question is this: What is public  mobile radio communication--individual networks existing as  foreign appendages to the OGSTfS, a system of electric  communication not having independent significance, a statewide  system like the OGSTfS, or something else? And the problem lies  not in the difficulty of the definition but in the  unpreparedness and reluctance of specialists to tackle the  problem head-on. As a result the debate rages over the question  as to whether to connect the mobile radio communication net to  the OGSTfS at the local or the transit level, and the  corresponding recommendations have already been adopted and are  being distributed through the country. But great difficulties  arise in fulfilling these recommendations, because we still  don't have any answers to the more general questions, such as:  Will a unified national mobile radio communication network be  created, and on what principles; what should be the mutual  relations between this network and the OGSTfS?    A well-coordinated solution can be found if we recognize the  obvious: Public mobile radio communication is a more general  communication system than the OGSTfS. In fact, under this  condition we do away with the questions as to the independence  or dependence of mobile radio communication, and as to a unified  network, because SPR should doubtlessly be united into a unified  national network integrated with the OGSTfS. The number system  needs to be common with the OGSTfS, as should the signaling  system. On the other hand questions regarding connection of  networks should be resolved only with regard for technical  feasibility, on the basis of the general principles of creating  and developing SPR networks and the OGSTfS. Adoption of the  concept of unity of SPR and the OGSTfS means creating a new  supermonopolistic electric communications structure.    And so, unity of the systems would mean the following:     -  common principles of network organization;    -  standardization of requirements on equipment interfacing  parameters;    -  common number and signaling systems;    -  common requirements on subscriber services.       Now a few words about the last item. The monopoly in  electric  communications has important significance. In order to break it  up, we need to have as many independent companies as possible  participating in providing communication services. In this case,  as a rule, territories and subscribers are divided among  different service companies in accordance with a permit to  operate (a license). No special problems arise in servicing  ordinary subscribers. But mobile subscribers who are not  associated with any particular territory must be serviced  anywhere. This is very important, and companies operating mobile  communication networks must service all SPR subscribers with the  same quality, without differentiating between ``ours'' and  ``theirs.'' This requires coordination of the actions of the  companies. Unified standards need to be adopted for each band,  equality of access to acquisition of licenses must be ensured,  and legislative acts protecting the rights of subscribers must  be written and adopted. These functions may be carried out by  the Ministry of Communications, but on the condition that it  does not act as an economic agent.  <H5>  The System of Mutual Settlements </H5>   With the disintegration of the old centralized communication  system into a number of independent organizations, problems  arise associated with fair distribution of rate income.    Several structurally, financially and legally independent  organizations may participate in the acquisition of the end  product (communication services), for example: a mobile radio  communication network; a local telephone network (city or  rural); an intercity telephone station; a trunk line  communication network.    When intercity connections are made between mobile  subscribers, the number of independent organizations  participating in this may reach up to seven. They all have a  rightful claim upon part of the funds collected from subscribers  for the communication services rendered. The soil for acute  conflicts between the indicated organizations is created. This  is manifesting itself especially clearly in the creation of new  SPR networks. In such a situation there is an extremely great  need for working out the principles of mutual settlements and  developing the corresponding standards.    Three variants are possible:    1) adoption of a general agreement between interested  parties  regarding the share of participation in providing communication  services, and the distribution of rate income corresponding to  this order;    2) adoption of an agreement on distributing rate income on  the basis of arriving at identical profitability;    3) distribution of rate income in proportion to the service  load.    The first two variants are technically simple, because they  do not require additional solutions, but they are very complex  in terms of reaching agreement between the agreeing parties. In  addition once an agreement has been reached, it may be put into  question after a while, because the conditions of interaction  are constantly changing.    The third variant requires that we solve a number of  technical problems, the main one being installation of devices  by which to register the load. But this variant is the fairest,  because it permits an objective assessment of the share of the  participation of each of the parties in providing communication  services.    The share of income enjoyed by each organization  participating in providing communication services must be  proportional to its investment. The following approach can be  proposed as a means of determining the latter.    We conditionally divide all rate income into three  categories. In the first, we include income from services  provided only to ``one's own'' subscribers--for example,  assigning a subscriber's number, installing and moving  subscriber equipment, and so on; in the second--income from  services provided to any subscribers regardless of membership to  the network (different additional forms of services); in the  third--income from services which are provided with the  participation of different organizations, for example  connections between subscribers of different networks.    Payment for the services of the first and second categories  should go to the networks and organizations providing these  services, while payment for services in the third category  should be distributed between the organizations that participate  in the process of providing them. In this case the share of  income received by telephone stations, SPR networks and  intercity stations must be proportional to the service load,  while the share of income of trunk line communication networks  must be proportional to the number of channels used to organize  the connections, their length and the time they are used.    The statement of communication services rendered that is  received by a subscriber must be drawn up with regard for all of  these components, but there must be only one; otherwise the  subscriber would receive several statements for each call or  other service, which is inconvenient.    Unfortunately the requirement of having a single statement  is  not easily fulfilled. The fact is that with introduction of  cellular networks and time-based payment for telephone calls in  city and rural networks, the problem of establishing accounting  centers to collect charges from subscribers arises. Such centers  exist today only under the AMTS, and they service subscribers  using intercity communication. In the meantime establishing  accounting centers for each network could hardly be considered  to be the optimum solution.    From my point of view the best variant is to create an  independent accounting center that would service all networks of  its regions having a need to maintain accounts with subscribers  and mutual settlements with other networks. Such a center would  draw up and send the subscriber an integral statement of  services rendered on the basis of information on connection  rates, and conduct mutual settlements among the communication  networks on the basis of information on the service load or the  share of participation in providing communication services. The  center could be established on the basis of the accounting  center of the AMTS, to be separated out as an independent  organization later on.  <H5>  Management of the Frequency Spectrum </H5>   The purposes of managing the frequency spectrum are to  distribute and redistribute it among users in order to achieve  its optimum, economically effective use.    The system currently existing in the country, the functions  of which include distributing the spectrum and monitoring it  (the State Commission on Frequency Distribution under the  Russian Federation Ministry of Communication, the State  Inspection Office of Electric Communication of the Russian  Ministry of Communication, the network of territorial agencies  of the State Inspection Office of Electric Communication  (oblast, kray, republican), the technical monitoring stations,  and city radio monitoring points, does not unfortunately have a  criterion for the effectiveness of the spectrum's use, owing to  which it is still being distributed out of some ``higher''  rather than economic considerations. This is doing a great deal  of harm. An example of this is mobile radio communication. It  hasn't developed much at all in the last 10-15 years because of  the refusal to allocate legal sections of the spectrum foreseen  by the Regulations on Radio Communication for priority use by  mobile radio communication.    The ``powerful'' sectors have enjoyed the most favored  treatment in the spectrum's distribution: defense, state  security, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of  Communication, insofar as this aids in reaching ideological  objectives. The resulting situation was unable to stimulate  economy of the spectrum, or progress of communication resources  in general.    Another significant shortcoming of the existing system of  the  spectrum's management is subordination of the indicated agencies  to the Ministry of Communication. And this means that  distribution and monitoring functions are concentrated for  practical purposes in the same hands, which doesn't do anything  to raise the level of management.    Thus economical approaches never existed, and they don't  exist today. There are many examples of this. Despite some  changes, bands are allocated as before, on the basis of the  residual principle, for mobile radio communication. Thus, only  small sections of the 800-900 MHz band have been allocated,  which will not be able to satisfy the needs of SPR when  communication systems working on the GSM standard are introduced  on a wide scale. International bands allocated for GSM equipment  in all of Europe, and foreseen by the Radio Communication  Regulations, are to be closed indefinitely in our country. We  are once again laying our on ``rut,'' different from the general  European track.    Need we remind ourselves that the spectrum is as much a part  of our national wealth as are oil, gas, coal etc.? And we'll  deplete it as well. Incorrect distribution of the spectrum would  be analogous to its plunder: It brings no income to the state,  and besides that, the consequences are hard to correct, because  the sector accumulates a large mass of equipment that cannot be  simply shifted to another frequency band.    The need for managing the spectrum by economic methods has  been around a long time. The spectrum must have value; it must  be fought for with the ruble. Significant changes are needed in  the work of agencies responsible for the spectrum's  distribution, and namely:    1) The State Commission on Frequency Distribution must not  be  a part of any ministry. It must be an independent agency, for  example under the Government or the Supreme Soviet;    2) when the spectrum is distributed among users, the  effectiveness with which the allocated frequency bands are used  must be accounted for mandatorily. This requires development and  approval of the procedure for determining it;    3) electric communication inspection offices and technical  radio monitoring stations must be taken out of the organization  of the Ministry of Communication, and they should become  independent agencies;    4) the right to use a portion of the spectrum to operate  equipment within a certain territory must be granted on a  competitive basis to local electric communication inspection  agencies under the oversight of the State Inspection Office;    5) licenses must be issued for a limited term. The value of  the license must be determined by auction.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   These questions are only a small part of the problem of  organizing mobile communication networks. The sector is  presently on the threshold of great changes. Integration of  communication services on a single digital basis is beginning,  and the status of a mobile subscriber is being extended to  ordinary telephone network subscribers with the introduction of  personal radio communication. In this case the latter is  significantly more important than may appear at first glance.    Owing to sharp growth of prices of cable products and of  construction and installation work, and growth of operating  expenses, some telephone networks are already trying to set up  telephone services by introducing radio systems, without waiting  for the appearance of personal radio communication systems. In  this situation we need to resolve the questions of interaction  between old and new networks, of frequency regulation, and of  introducing an effective system of mutual settlements as quickly  as possible.

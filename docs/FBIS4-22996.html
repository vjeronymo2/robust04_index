Kirov, St. Petersburg;  UDC 577.152.3]    [Abstract] The high antioxidant activity of biological  liquid in general and human blood plasma in particular due to  the role of various high- and low-molecular compounds has been  attributed to the antioxidant protection (AOZ) mechanism of the  blood plasma which is realized due to its ability to retard  metal-dependent free-radical reactions involving the development  of OH[.sup].[/] radicals. Yet speculations that nonenzymatic  antioxidant protection whose action is directed at lowering the  active oxygen form (AOF) is active in the blood plasma while  enzymatic antioxidant protection is triggered under a deep  oxidative stress where superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the key  antioxidant protection enzyme prompted the development of a  method of purifying superoxide dismutase from human blood plasma  and carrying out a comparative analysis of the purified enzyme  and Cu- and Zn-superoxide dismutase erythrocytes. To this end,  superoxide dismutase was measured by Nishikimi's method with  Fried's modifications, and the superoxide anion radical was  generated in a system consisting of NADH, phenasinemetasulfate  (FMF), and tetrazolium nitro blue. The experimental procedure is  outlined. Superoxide dismutase was isolated by gel filtration on  AsA-34 and AsA-44 ultrogels made by LKB (Sweden). The protein  isolated from blood is classified as glycoprotein which is  thermally stable up to a 75-85 temperature; its molecular  mass immediately after filtering was equal to about 147,000 D. A  comparative analysis of the effect of some compounds capable of  forming chelate complexes with metals contained in the active  enzymes on the plasma and erythrocyte superoxide dismutase  activity shows that the purified enzyme's properties differ from  those of Cu- and Zn-superoxide dismutase and that the enzyme  belongs to a new class of extracellular superoxide dismutase  present in the organism's biological fluids. It is speculated  that under a marked oxidative stress, superoxide dismutase  plasma passes to an active state, making it possible to trigger  the enzymatic protection mechanism and engage them in  neutralizing active forms of oxygen.

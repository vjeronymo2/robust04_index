			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: So what's your poison, then? - David Cohen predicts that the government could have some problems in curbing abuses of NICs A short passage tucked away in the middle of Peter Lilley's speech to this week's Conservative party conference at Bournemouth is likely to have a more tangible impact on UK taxpayers than all the headline-grabbing rhetoric of his more illustrious cabinet colleagues. Unfortunately, so vague was the threat by the social security secretary to clamp down on schemes designed to avoid paying National Insurance contributions (NICs) that it is extremely difficult to anticipate what its impact will be. Salary payments trigger NIC liabilities for both employer and employee. But whereas a highly-paid worker is charged only on his first Pounds 22,000 of income, employers must pay NIC at a rate of 10.2 per cent of all salary, without limit. Companies with high-flying employees have successfully mitigated potentially enormous NIC bills by paying staff bonuses in the form of assets rather than cash. The assets used are always convertible readily into cash, so the employees have no complaints. And since NICs, unlike income tax, generally are charged only on direct cash payments, the company achieves a 10.2 per cent saving. This blatant avoidance has infuriated the Department of Social Security. Its repeated response has been to extend the NIC net to catch the non-cash benefits then in vogue. But this tactic has proved futile because the closing of each loophole has led invariably to the discovery of a new one. In the latest chapter of this lucrative farce, Lilley announced at the end of August that he was adding diamonds and fine wines to his NIC hit list. In response, dealers in the City of London - the English capital's financial district - are now being showered with tasty-sounding platinum sponges and less tasty - but, apparently, equally cashable - supplies of arsenic. These peculiarly exotic bonuses will mark the death throes of NIC-dodging if Lilley has his way. 'I am fed up with spivvy schemes . . . paying yuppies their bonuses in gold bars, diamonds or vintage wines,' he told the assembled Conservatives. 'I'll put an end to them once and for all.' No details were available as to how he proposed to achieve this elusive objective; his department would say only that an announcement 'in due course' would reveal the scope and timing of the new measures. Plainly, though, to make any real headway, the DSS will have to reverse the present assumption of NIC law that a non-cash benefit is exempt unless listed expressly. The danger of such a reversal is that it might vacuum up all sorts of genuine benefits which Lilley has no wish to penalise. He showed his awareness of this pitfall by telling reporters, after his speech, that luncheon vouchers were an example of a perk that would stay outside the NIC net. But his lawyers will doubtless explain to him the difficulty of finding general definitions which are capable of distinguishing a luncheon voucher from an arsenic certificate. If the exempt benefits are actually to be listed one-by-one, there will be a flood of candidates. Employers will insist that a whole range of perks - from pensions and health insurance to free holidays and clothes - is provided for good commercial reasons and should continue to enjoy NIC immunity. However harshly Lilley wields the knife, three time-honoured techniques for paying less NICs seem certain to survive: Employees can be paid in the form of shares in their company. Imposing NICs on these is most unlikely because it would conflict with the government's commitment to wider employee share ownership. If a company can show that people providing it with their services are self-employed, the whole issue of employer's contributions will never arise. Owner-managers who control most private companies can trim their NIC bills by extracting money as dividends rather than bonuses.

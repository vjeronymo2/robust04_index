			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovene </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Four parties held separate congresses in Bled  this morning prior to the unification congress that is scheduled  to commence in half an hour.    The Liberal Democratic Party [LDS], the Democratic Party,  the  Greens-Ecologically Social Party, and the Socialist Party are  thus supposed to form the new LDS--the Liberal Democracy of  Slovenia.    The new party, which, after unification, will possess 30  seats in parliament, which is one-third of all deputies, will  continue to be led by Dr. Janez Drnovsek. He particularly  emphasized the importance of continued cooperation with the  Christian Democrats this morning. We have reports by Bojan  Veselinovic, Sandi Frelih, and Gojko Brvar from the separate  party congresses in Bled this morning:    [Begin recording] [Veselinovic] The morning congress of the  Liberal Democrats was opened by party president Dr. Janez  Drnovsek, who said that foreign countries are following the  events in our country with interest and added that the  reputation of the present LDS is growing gradually but steadily.  Faced with the choice of whether to continue building on teh  party's autonomy and risk another showdown with the newly  emerged party or to link itself with the Eco-Greens, the  Socialists, and the Democrats, we have decided in favor of  unification, Drnovsek said.    Unification, he said, does not mean a change in the  composition of the present coalition. Drnovsek particularly  stressed the need for the new LDS to cooperate with the  Christian Democrats to ensure the stability of the political  scene. Relations will be good with the two remaining government  parties until program differences occur, Drnovsek said.    The afternoon unification congress is supposed to elect:  Drnovsek as the president of the new LDS, [Dimitrij] Rupel as  the president [as heard]; 60 members of the party council, which  will be formed proportionally on the basis of the results of the  last general elections; [Igor] Bavcar, [Vika] Potocnik, [Viktor]  Zakelj, and [Peter] Tancig for vice presidents; and [Gregor]  Golobic as secretary general.    They will subsequently agree as to who will coordinate the  work of the clubs of deputies of the three merging parties in  the parliament. The afternoon congress is also supposed to  decide about the amendment to the proposed documents, with  which, bearing in mind various material situations in the  merging parties, secretaries general of these parties would  guarantee with their personal assets the settlement of any  possible party debts.    Let us also report that the new LDS will have 30 seats in  parliament, which is two seats less than it would have had if  the current Democratic deputies [Tone] Persak and [Danica]  Simsic were have supported unification.

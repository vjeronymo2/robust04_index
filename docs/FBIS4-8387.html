			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 13 Apr--Presidential spokesman Andrzej  Drzycimski said on Wednesday on Radio Three that Lech Walesa had  decided to sign the budget law because he believed that, "at  this moment and in this situation, Poland needs stabilization  and a signal for the Western partners with whom we cooperate  that we are a country that is taking a grave risk but, at the  same time, is trying to bring about political stabilization by  introducing legal norms."    "It has been a difficult decision because we already know  today that the budget law will not be fully implemented.  President Walesa hopes that modifications will be introduced  during the course of the budget year. This need is probably  also perceived by the authors of the law," Drzycimski pointed  out. He added that the president does not rule out the  possibility of filing a complaint with regard to the budget with  the Constitutional Tribunal. However, he will acquaint himself  with experts' opinions and legal analyses beforehand.    One of the reasons the president wants to veto the parish  local government law is that this law comes into force during  the course of the election campaign, Drzycimski said. "This law  does not resolve many problems; generally, it does not resolve  anything, and, in fact, it introduces more chaos," he said.    The president wants to talk to the coalition but not about  the past, Drzycimski said. "The issue involving Rosati belongs  to the past, in the president's opinion. This matter has been  closed, and there is no need to return to it. If the coalition  puts forward a new candidate, a meeting will certainly take  place," Drzycimski added.</p>

			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> DE KLERK OKS ANTI-APARTHEID RALLY  </P> <P> Acting President Frederik W. de Klerk, in a major concession to anti-apartheid  leaders, today approved plans for a massive church-led demonstration in Cape  Town on Wednesday and declared, "The door to a new South Africa is open."  </P> <P> In an extraordinary statement contrasting sharply with his predecessor's  hard-line responses to public protest since the government imposed a state of  emergency three years ago, De Klerk said arrangements are being made to ensure  that the protest will be orderly.  </P> <P> The protest will coincide with a special parliamentary session at which De  Klerk is to be nominated as president.  </P></p>

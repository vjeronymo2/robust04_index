			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Arts: Confusion in the middle ground - Television In the old ITV the received wisdom was that you won ratings with lowbrow stuff such as darts matches and moronic game shows but acquired prestige with expensive drama. Now the belief is that if you pick the right sort of drama you can win reasonable ratings and prestige simultaneously, and in the long term build a loyal audience. Hence the abandonment of darts, a reduction in game shows, and an increase in middlebrow drama such as The Bill, London's Burning and all those steam train detective series. However, the formula can go horribly wrong, as we saw last weekend with the screening of embarrassing flops on successive evenings. The Marshall looked a bit like another Europudding, those dramas filmed somewhere in continental Europe with international casts and umpteen co-producers in the hope that the Germans, French and British will all like them. The idea has never worked yet and probably never will, but the oddest aspect of The Marshall was that although it had the characteristically false tones of the dubbed programme it appeared to have been recorded in English lip-synch, and although it was set in Florence the cast all seemed to be British, from Alfred Molina as the Italian police marshall and Gemma Craven as his wife to such small roles as Clementina, which was taken by Anna Cropper. To use such an impressive cast to make such a lead-footed and boring programme was a shame. But at least it was not intent upon stuffing its political correctness down the viewer's throat, which is such a characteristic of Lynda La Plante's work. From Widows to Sunday's Seekers Ms La Plante has been dishing up the same combination of resourceful, reliable women and violent, hateful men. No doubt politically correct broadcasters wriggle with delight over her multiracial casts, however unlikely the teamings. This time we were given tubby, blonde, middle-aged Stella and svelte, black, young Susie. And their chief factor in common? A husband; the same one, simultaneously. The absolute b-b-bigamist. But what can you expect from a man . . . when he emerges from the mind of La Plante, anyway. As in Prime Suspect you can ignore all this sermonising flim-flam if there is a good taut plot to follow, but Seekers was hopelessly confused. ***** First acquaintance with Ruby Wax in Girls On Top suggested one of those American women with more drive and chutzpah than talent. Second thoughts, when she began doing her own weird shows, was that she might be able to create a world of her own in a way that only Barry Humphries had previously managed. But the first of a new series of The Full Wax on BBC1 last Thursday brought third thoughts: perhaps the joky sadism which requires Joanna Lumley to play a mentally unstable lush, thrown over by her husband in favour of a bimbo with big boobs (Ms Wax meets Miss La Plante) cloaks a genuine streak of cruelty. Still, Lumley had the last laugh: not only was she very funny parodying her own character from The Avengers, and just as good as Jennifer Saunders (whose mannerisms and tone of voice she adopted, wittingly or not) in the comedy recipe sequence, but at the end, spattered with cream and breathless from portraying hysteria, she was still achingly beautiful . . . which is hardly the first phrase that springs to mind in describing Ms Wax. Precisely the sub-text of the skit, you may say, but does Ruby Wax really accept her own appearance in the way that, say, Phyllis Diller seems to, or is the joke jealousy actually all too real? ***** Best comedy of the week, and for a very long time, was the first in a new series of The Comic Strip Presents on BBC2. Oddly enough this also took the form of a pastiche of action series from the seventies. There was Jason Bentley, a Peter Wyngarde lookalike in lace cuffs and crushed velvet flares, whose modus operandi was to drive the Rolls to a country house occupied by a mad colonel and his daughter (mini skirt and too much makeup), drink a bottle of claret, smoke 50 cigarettes and arrest everybody. Jim Broadbent played Shouting George of 'The Weeney', a 10-Guv-a-day copper who always drifted his car into the police yard sideways. And the stars were Bonehead and Foyle, who saw their job as climbing chimneys, doing handbrake turns, and pointing automatics while bellowing 'Freeze]' ***** However irritating you may find John Pilger, from the grinding monotone of the voice to the hectoring didacticism of the manner, you surely have to admit that he is right about Pol Pot, Cambodia and the spinelessness of the international community, and you have to admire his tenacity. Alone among the battalions of television journalists, Pilger seems to mind that a cosmetic job is being done on the genocidal Khmer Rouge to enable the UN to claim that it has organised democratic elections in Cambodia. Having gone back to the country again and again, Pilger made yet another visit for Viewpoint 93 on ITV and left no one in doubt about his feelings: that suppressing the name of the Khmer Rouge and tolerating their 'participation' in elections is like suppressing the name of the Nazi party and tolerating their participation in European elections. ***** Installing a camera crew in a family house and filming the result may be a perfectly legitimate form of entertainment but it is surely time that television stopped pretending that it is a way of investigating reality. Paul Watson, who produced the 12-part BBC1 series Sylvania Waters which began on Thursday, is having a second go at copying the famous 1972 American series which used 'fly on the wall' techniques to observe the effects of cameras on family life. His first attempt was with the Wilkins family in Reading in 1974. Watson describes his new series, about the Baker-Donaher family in Sydney as 'living soap opera', which sounds admirably modest, and seems to go some way towards admitting the unreality of the affair - but I wonder. Perhaps the bickering, boozing Noelene and Laurie deserve everything that is coming to them, but - like others before them in this situation - they now regret ever having become involved. No one who really appreciated the likely outcome would ever agree to such an arrangement in the first place. No doubt that explains why we always see the same sort of crass egotists in this sort of series. As we laugh at their antics in the coming weeks it might be as well to abandon Watson's word 'living' and consider it as just another Australian soap opera, designed largely to appeal to unsophisticated teenagers. ***** Channel 4's culture magazine Without Walls goes from strength to strength. Earlier this season it showed an unusual trio of programmes about the effects of drug taking upon the creation of works of art, and last night it concluded another trio, this time about technology and man's mastery (or otherwise) of nature. The twist that has made it such an engrossing series is that instead of just talking to the usual white-coated scientists in rimless glasses it talked mainly to science fiction writers. Remembering the accuracy of some of the predictions of writers such as HG Wells and Arthur C. Clarke, and the technical creativity of Asimov, it is no surprise to discover that Brian Aldiss, JG Ballard, John Brunner and others now have thoughts - about artificial intelligence, cloning, virtual reality and so on - which illustrate activity at the frontiers of modern science far more vividly than you would expect from plain scientists. Furthermore Without Walls deserves credit for building some sort of bridge - however narrow, however populist, however temporary - between the two cultures.</p>

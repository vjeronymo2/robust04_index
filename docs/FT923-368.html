			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Perot continues to tease US voters MR Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who continues to tease the last drop of suspense out of a bemused public, indicated yesterday morning he might not announce the next step in his political plans until the end of this week. He said on breakfast television that the leaders of his volunteers, convened in Dallas, would yesterday hear presentations from the US presidential campaigns of Governor Bill Clinton and President George Bush, return home to report to the state movements, and then tell him what to do. If the process stayed on schedule, he said, 'it will happen by the end of the week'. Reiterating his now familiar line, he added: 'I don't make the decision. The volunteers will make the decision about what they believe is in the best interests of the country.' Later in the day, after meeting Mr Clinton's officials, Mr Perot was all agog. 'It was fascinating. . . It was like standing in front of a firehose with hard facts and information pouring out,' he said, adding that he had found much common ground with the Democratic contender's economic programme. He adopted a similar line after talks with the Bush camp, saying: 'There is a great deal of overlap.' Both Mr Bush and Mr Clinton also took to breakfast television programmes yesterday morning in an orgy of muesli politics, but both confessed they had no idea if Mr Perot would enter the presidential contest. Mr Bush said his team would present to Perot supporters a specific plan to lower both taxes and the federal deficit. Mr Clinton said his delegation would do the same. Mr Bush argued that the question of taxation would be 'the big difference in this election'. He is now claiming the Clinton plan would mean higher taxes on any American earning more than Dollars 36,600 (Pounds 21,800) a year, well below the Dollars 150,000 threshold (or Dollars 200,000 for a couple) that Mr Clinton says would be necessary to finance his investment schemes and provide middle-income tax cuts. Pressed over whether he would abide by his recent promises not to increase taxes 'ever, ever,' Mr Bush insisted this was what he meant. Mr Clinton countered by trying to get more mileage out of Mr Bush's refusal to engage him in debate. He said 'George Bush is like a kid on a play yard' saying 'we will do it my way or no way'. Mr Clinton's lead over Mr Bush has narrowed from 21 percentage points to nine points, a poll for the ABC News/Washington Post said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. The survey gives Mr Clinton 51 per cent of the vote and Mr Bush 42 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.92 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The statutory authority for this subpart is contained in the Act of 13 September 1960 (74 Stat. 878, 32 U.S.C. 715), commonly referred to as the ``National Guard Claims Act'' as amended by Public Law 90&hyph;486, 13 August 1968, (82 Stat. 756), Public Law 90&hyph;525, 26 September 1968 (82 Stat. 877), Public Law 901&hyph;312, 8 July 1970 (84 Stat. 412), and Public Law 93&hyph;336, 8 July 1974, and the Act of 8 September 1961 (75 Stat. 488, 10 U.S.C. 2736) as amended by Public Law 90&hyph;521, 26 September 1968 (82 Stat. 874) and as amended by Public Law 98564, 20 October 1984.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) For purposes of this subpart, the following terminology applies:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) ARNG personnel. A member of the ARNG engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Claimant. An individual, partnership, association, corporation, country, State, commonwealth, territory, or a political subdivision thereof, or the District of Columbia presenting a claim and meeting the conditions set forth in section 536.20. The term does not include the U.S. Government, any of its instrumentalities, except as prescribed by statute, or a State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia, which maintains the unit to which the ARNG personnel causing the injury or damage are assigned. This exclusion does not ordinarily apply to a unit of local government that does not control the ARNG organization involved. As a general rule, a claim by a unit of local government other than a State, commonwealth, or territory will be entertained unless the item claimed to be damaged or lost was procured or maintained by State, commonwealth, or territorial funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) State. As used in this subpart the term ``state'' includes self-governing commonwealths and territories of the United States; for example, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.93 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Scope.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) This subpart is applicable in all places and sets forth the procedures to be followed in the settlement and payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims for death, personal injury, or damage, loss, or destruction of property caused by_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Members or employees of the ARNG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Noncombat activities of the ARNG when engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709, provided such claim is not for personal injury or death of a member of the Armed Forces or Coast Guard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An employee whose injury or death is incident to service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A claimant dissatisfied with an administrative settlement under this subpart as the result of activities of the NG of a State, Commonwealth, or Territory is not entitled to judicial relief in an action against the United States. Whether he or she has a legal cause of action or may file an administrative claim against such political entity depends upon controlling local law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Claims arising out of activities of the ARNG when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing duties at the call of the governor of a State maintaining the unit are not cognizable under this chapter or any other law, regulation, or appropriation available to the Army for the payment of claims. Such claims should be returned or referred to the authorities of the State, for whatever action they choose to take and claimants should be informed of the return or referral. Care should be taken to determine the status of the unit; members at the time the claims incident occurred,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly in civil emergencies as units called by the governor, are sometimes ``federalized'' during the call-up. If the unit was federalized at the time the claims incident occurred, the claim will be cognizable under subparts C, D and F or other subparts pertaining to the Active Army.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.93 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims payable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tort claims.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All claims for personal injuries, death, or damage to or loss of real or personal property, arising out of incidents occurring on or after 29 December 1981 based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negligent or wrongful acts or omissions, of ARNG personnel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity within the scope of employment, within the United States while engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709 will be processed under the FTCA (subpart D). Such claims arising before 29 December 1981 will, except as modified herein, be processed and settled in accordance with the provisions of subpart C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Noncombat activities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A claim incident to the noncombat activities of the ARNG while engaged in duty or training under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, 505, or 709 may be settled under this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Deluxe solution to a growing problem - Why a UK banking software company preferred getting a US parent The Software Partnership, Cheshire-based and uncompromisingly British, had every intention of staying that way when it set out to find a buyer towards the end of last year. A specialist in banking software, which last year reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1m on turnover of Pounds 5.6m, it sought a buyer for two reasons; it wanted access to international markets and it needed a partner with deep pockets to underwrite both its expansion and ambitious research and development programme. However, in June this year it was bought for an undisclosed cash sum by Deluxe Data Systems, the electronic funds transfer subsidiary of Deluxe Corporation, the US cheque printer. DDS has revenues of about Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m) and its parent is one of the 300 largest corporations in the US with revenues of Dollars 1.7bn. Mr Nigel Walsh, co-founder and managing director, said he was happy with the outcome but regreted a suitable UK parent could not be found. He had ruled out a flotation, arguing that software houses generally fare badly on the stock market, and was disappointed by the attitude of large UK electronics groups. 'They looked at us from the point of view of the balance sheet and were prepared to acquire us on that basis. They did not seem to understand our technology or to have a strategy after acquisition.' Mainland European groups were not much better, seeing the company chiefly as a bridgehead into the UK market. In the end, it was Broadview Associates, the US-based mergers and acquisitions specialist, which identified DDS as a suitable parent. The deal seems more of a merger than a takeover, despite the discrepancy in size. Mr Walsh and co-founder Mr Ian Booth will continue to run Software Partnership in Runcorn, now recast as DDS's international headquarters. A third co-founder, Mr Howard Hanson, has been given charge of DDS's global research and development programme. Mr Brian Eadie, formerly Software Partnership's sales director, is now sales development director for the group. Mr James McGowan, DDS chief executive, emphasised the synergy between the two companies. 'Not only have we acquired a first class set of products to complement our own solutions, but we have also gained a highly experienced team with a solid understanding of the international financial marketplace.' Deluxe Corporation has been printing cheques since 1915 but is seeking to become less reliant on what is a maturing market. DDS, formed in 1961, is part of this programme. It provides processing services and software for electronic banking. According to Mr McGowan, Deluxe should have revenues of Dollars 4bn by the end of the century of which DDS's share should be some Dollars 500m. The acquisition of Software Partnership fills an important gap in its strategy. 'Within the decade, financial institutions will tailor their electronic delivery systems to the individual . . . screen phones, personal computers and interactive televisions will be used alongside automated teller machines and point-of-sale terminals,' said Mr McGowan. 'With the Software Partnership software, we now have the key piece needed to help institutions reconfigure their systems and move to the cutting edge of direct banking.' Banks and financial institutions using Software Partnership products include Barclays and the National &amp; Provincial Building Society. It was ahead of its time in realising that electronic delivery of banking services would take a diversity of forms and that the secret of rapid and economic development of new services was a common design allowing any device, such as a telephone, personal computer, or television, to connect to any banking system or application. It is essentially a building block approach. Now Software Partnership is the latest building block in Deluxe's growth strategy. It seems unlikely that Mr Walsh and his team will have much time or inclination for regrets that the Stars and Stripes rather than the Union Flag hangs over their corner of Cheshire.

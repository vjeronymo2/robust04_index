			<p>BFN     [Text] The problem of the Black Sea Fleet should be solved  at the negotiations between Ukraine and Russia without  interference of "any third parties," Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk said in his interview with the World service Radio  Ukrainy on Saturday. He emphasized that he had never spoken  about participation of any other party in this process.    In Kravchuk's words, during his telephone talk with Viktor  Chernomyrdin on Saturday he proposed to the Russian premier "to  meet at the governmental level and to solve this problem with  the help of experts and ministers."    "The statements voiced by ministers are not obligatory the  truth in its final instance," Kravchuk said given various  interpretations of the results of the negotiations in Sevastopol  presented by Vitaliy Radetskyy and Pavel Grachev, heads of  military departments of both countries. He expressed hope that  the Black Sea Fleet problem would be solved "with Russia's  president and government."    Kravchuk called the meeting between Ukrainian and Russian  Defense Ministers held in Sevastopol on 21-22 April "a search  for ways out" and called not to make any "far-reaching  conclusions."    Kravchuk reassured that Ukraine "will support Russia's  interest to have its base in Sevastopol" and noted that "nobody  should be granted any unilateral advantages."    "One cannot force Russia to leave its bases in Crimea," said  Kravchuk. He pointed out that "we must sign corresponding  documents on rent of this bases by Russia for a definite time."  "The main thing is to solve on which conditions and principles  this would be done," Kravchuk said.    He underlined that he does not see any other way out --  "this  problem cannot be solved by dictatorship or sanctions."    Kravchuk said that existence of foreign bases on the  territory of any country not obligatory threatens to its  sovereignty. As an example, he mentioned functioning of U.S.  naval bases in several regions of the world.</p>

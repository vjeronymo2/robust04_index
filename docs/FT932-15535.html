			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / BR in talks to avert strike FURTHER TALKS are to be held today between British Rail and the two main rail unions in a final attempt to avert Friday's planned 24-hour stoppage, Robert Taylor writes. BR management worked over the holiday weekend to try to convince the unions not to proceed with their planned disruption. The two sides, however, appear far apart. The RMT, the main rail union, continues to insist that it needs a guarantee from BR of no future compulsory redundancies and an end to contracting-out of work. Aslef, the train drivers' union, is demanding that existing national agreements covering the deployment of its members should not be changed. Until now BR has tried to offer the unions forms of words that would convince them that every effort would be made to avoid any compulsory redundancies as the railway network prepared for privatisation, due to start next year. But BR management failed on Friday to make any breakthrough with the unions. Sir Bob Reid, BR's chairman, has emphasised that the industry cannot afford any more one-day strikes. The 24-hour stoppage by the RMT on April 2 cost BR Pounds 10m gross.</p>

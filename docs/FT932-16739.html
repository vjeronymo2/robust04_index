			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Sport: Where bloodlust rules - Grand National / Michael Thompson-Noel on the hypocrisy behind a violent horse race HOW MANY horses will be slaughtered in today's Grand National steeplechase at Aintree, near Liverpool? One horse, two horses - a trio of hapless creatures? In theory, this long-distance slog - 30 fences, 4 1/2 miles, with modern-day winners taking about nine minutes to complete the course - has been tamed and made safer for man and beast. In particular, the notorious Becher's Brook fence has been rendered less barbaric following the carnage in the 1980s. But the Grand National has not been neutered. In common with all steeplechase and hurdle racing, it has a dreadful potential for mayhem and mischief - as witnessed in 1990, the year when Aintree's management was finally shamed into making significant alterations to Becher's, such as removing the acute and backwards-facing slope on the landing side of the fence, and raising the ditch (also on the landing side) by 30 inches. That year, though, the race still claimed two victims. Scottish Grand National winner Roll-A-Joint died when breaking his neck at the jump known as the Canal Turn, and Hungary Hur broke a leg approaching the 19th fence. The enduring popularity of the National, which attracts a huge TV audience, is based on its excitement plus betting and bloodlust, although the latter factor is never admitted. The media love the race. Watch this afternoon's coverage and marvel at the tortuous lengths to which the BBC goes to cover up the violence. If you believed its commentators, you would think 40 pit ponies were hacking round Hyde Park. Over the years, I have become a connoisseur of attempts by the Grand National's apologists to present it in a favourable light. A recent example is Reg Green's introduction to his revised edition of The History of the Grand National: A Race Apart (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, Pounds 14.99), in which he calls the race the 'most enthralling of all sporting endeavours.' He goes on: 'For thrills and drama, the race has no equal on Earth. But, more than this, it seems to transcend mere sport in its unique power to reflect in one afternoon the whole of life. Sometimes the tragic, the evil or the cunning are seen. More often, though, it is the courageous, the humorous, the generous, the triumphantly optimistic side of life that you will find in the pages of its history.' There is a distinct echo here of what Hugh McIlvanney, The Observer's star sports writer, once claimed. 'The race,' wrote McIlvanney, 'is as arbitrary and incalculable as life . . . The Grand National is often cruel, but appreciation of it does not imply sadism or even callousness.' Pull the other one, McIlvanney. Even more fatuous was last Sunday's Observer in which Richard Baerlein, doyen of Britain's racing correspondents, gave the entire game away. 'The Grand National,' he started, 'is still the greatest betting medium of the year, and enjoys a worldwide television audience of around 50m. 'But this exposure also brings critics of the race. Armchair viewers, with a very limited knowledge of the intricacies of racing, protested so strongly after the deaths of Brown Trix and Seeandem in the 1989 National that the fences have been trimmed to make jumping less formidable, and the famous ditch on the other side of Becher's Brook has been filled in.' What Baerlein did not say was that Brown Trix and Seeandem died in the grisliest of circumstances. One of them, fatally injured and in danger of drowning, had to be winched out of the brook at Becher's in order to be shot by the racecourse vet. What 'knowledge of the intricacies of racing' do you need in order to write off such carnage as an everyday sporting incident, let alone as a metaphor for life? Baerlein did not leave it there, of course. On and on he stumbled. 'The public,' he wrote, 'have gone 'soft' on their attitude to racing and are getting softer all the time. If the authorities continue to give way to all and sundry, in 10 years' time or so they may do away with steeplechasing altogether, leaving only hurdle racing for the winter. That has already happened in Australia, and the Americans are leaning that way.' There is a great deal of patronising snobbery and self-deception in all this. It is a favourite claim of the jumps crowd that they are a more fun-loving, down-to-earth bunch than people who merely race horses on the Flat. The jumps crowd detest being accused of cruelty. And they salve their consciences by claiming that jumps racing is merely a dangerous sport in the way that motor racing is dangerous. But racing cars do not smash their backs, necks and legs, and never have to be shot by the track-side mechanic. Their self-deception is akin to that of the fox-hunting mob - almost all of whom are mad - who always claim, with spellbinding arrogance, to be genuine horse- and country-lovers in touch, at a deeper level than the rest of us, with Nature and her ways. Today's Grand National is thought to be wide open. No doubt it will be a spectacle. But I couldn't care less who wins. For me, the only acceptable result will be 40 live horses at the start of it and 40 at the end.</p>

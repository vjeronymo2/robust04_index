This type of violence includes the physical, sexual, or psychological assault of women by partners, intimates, family members, and acquaintances. Commonly referenced types of behavior that fit within this definition include family and intimate violence, spouse abuse, partner abuse (including same sex relationships), women battering, courtship violence, sexual assault, and date rape. Public health approaches violence as a health issue and consequently, uses injuries, both fatal and nonfatal, psychological and physical, to quantify the impact of violence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purposes of this announcement, the area of attention is in primary prevention of violence against adolescent (12+ years of age) and adult women by persons known to the victim (family members, partners, and intimates) rather than by strangers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interventions for VAW may encompass training/education, legal (e.g., mandatory arrest policies), behavioral, or environmental change strategies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Multifaceted programs are programs which incorporate multiple interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of VAW and that results in injury or death. Since beliefs and behaviors are difficult to change, effective prevention models require a combination of interventions that provide specific strategies for establishing a coordinated program. For multifaceted programs to be effective, interventions must be complementary. For example, the benefits of referral protocols are potentiated by expanding emergency shelter and support services for victims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No single solution has been effective in the prevention of VAW. To maximize effectiveness, primary prevention programs should be based on multiple complementary interventions in multiple settings. These programs should be community-based and tailored to meet the specific needs of the community, including the most effective strategies and personnel. Supporting and empowering communities to develop effective prevention programs will represent an essential model for delivering interventions for those in need. The community-based model has been successful in dealing with other public health prevention efforts such as HIV prevention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Bangemann hits out at competition 'ayatollahs' THE European Commission's controversial decision last year to block a Franco-Italian takeover of De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, was 'completely wrong', Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC industry and internal market commissioner, said yesterday. Mr Bangemann - who last October clashed with Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, over the case - also launched an impassioned assault on competition 'ayatollahs', who rule on merger cases without taking into account economic reality. His attack was not directed at Sir Leon himself, but at the 'gurus' who staff national and Community merger control authorities. He singled out Germany's cartel office for particular criticism. 'What I'm angry about is that there are some academics, mostly lawyers by profession, who have no idea of the reality of economic life. They are the experts who are taking the competition decisions, which is complete madness,' Mr Bangemann said. Mr Bangemann's comments could reignite the smouldering debate over EC competition and industrial policy. In Strasbourg today, commissioners are set to agree a new Community budget, including provisions to retarget some existing EC funds to help struggling industries. Competition advocates suspect such moves may result in funds being channeled 'vertically' to individual sectors, such as cars or electronics, contrary to EC policy. Mr Bangemann said yesterday that the Community should persist with its free-market industrial policy, but he added: 'A horizontal approach does not mean you can't take up a definite example (for EC funding).' The blocking of the De Havilland takeover was vociferously attacked by both Italian and French governments at the time and Mr Bangemann still disputes Sir Leon's recommendation. He said yesterday: 'I have had to defend it (the decision) as a collegiate (Commission) decision and I've done that, but now I can say it was completely wrong, as has already been seen.' Sir Leon argued in October that the market for turboprop planes like those made by De Havilland was completely separate from the market for jets, but Mr Bangemann said yesterday that Lufthansa, the German airline, had recently decided to buy 50-seater jets to compete against turboprop aircraft on commuter routes. Mr Bangemann made an attempt to dilute Sir Leon's influence over merger control inquiries last year. But that dispute appeared to have been defused last week when the Commission renewed Sir Leon's mandate to handle the internal decisions on such inquiries jointly with Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. Separately, Mr Bangemann urged member states to continue their efforts to bring down internal EC border controls before the end of the year. He warned that Brussels would speed up legal action to punish member states which maintained controls in breach of EC obligations.</p>

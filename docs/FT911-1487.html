			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Travel: A good place to hear yourself think - The wilds of Scotland's Ardnamurchan peninsula SCENE I: It is 5pm on a late-April Sunday and I am sitting at a place near the end of the Ardnamurchan peninsula in the north-western highlands of Scotland, gazing across a short stretch of sea into the mouth of the Sound of Mull. The sun is out and the sea only gently tousled by the wind. Mull itself is coloured like a painting by an Australian Impressionist: blue, black, grey, fawn and the colour that is not green and not black but somewhere in between. In the right foreground is a small bay with grass growing up to the shingle and sheep and lambs wandering eccentrically among the rockpools. In the left foreground is the toy ruin of Mingary castle, or at least the ruin of the small part of it that survives, toy-like and forgotten. I think: perhaps what I am enjoying - the view, the quiet, the orderliness - is what is called serenity, for the view across to Mull has only ever been interrupted or in any great way modified by volcanoes and glaciers, and then not recently, so that what I am looking at probably pre-dates human consciousness. I think this to be the case because I am not the sort of person who believes that things only exist - saucepans, Scottish landscapes - if there is someone there to observe them. What exists, I am sure, is blue, black, grey, fawn and the colour that is not black and not green. Scene II: 10am the following day. It is cold and not inspiring. I am at the lighthouse at Ardnamurchan point, the most westerly tip of the British mainland. It must be charming in the summer but in late April it is bleak and gale-swept. To the north-west are the islands of Muck, Eigg and Rhum; beyond, Canna, Barra, South Uist and Benbecula. The Ardnamurchan lighthouse was built in 1849 by Robert Louis Stevenson's uncle. Nowadays the ground and out-buildings - but not the lighthouse tower  -are owned by Peter de Savary, the property developer and America's Cup challenger, who also owns Land's End and John o'Groats and thus holds sway over the most southerly, northerly and westerly tips of Britain. On my way down to my car I peer into a small wind-shielded ravine and notice a scattering of primroses gleaming so luridly and unexpectedly that they might have been borne there by interstellar gusts. I think: what strangeness is it in his nature that compels a hot-shot like de Savary to buy up the most southerly, northerly and westerly points of Britain? I could ring him on his car-phone and ask him to explain. But then I think: he probably wouldn't know, is too rich to care, is rich enough, at any rate, to regard the question as far more odd than any possible answer. Scene III: I am now at Glenborrodale Castle, a luxury hotel (also owned by de Savary) which is halfway along the peninsula and surrounded by magnificent gardens. I am reading a small book by Jimmie Macgregor - Macgregor Across Scotland, BBC Books, Pounds 4.99 - in which the wee pundit describes walking from the Scurdie Ness lighthouse near Montrose on the Scottish east coast to the Ardnamurchan light on the west, and calls Ardnamurchan 'an almost perfect place.' He is right, for the peninsula is wild and beautiful, a haven for all sorts of creatures - wildcat, otter, golden eagle, pine marten, badger  - though not immune to the influence of 'incomers,' people moving in from England and pushing up property prices which means that the locals have to leave and the old crofting ways die. According to Macgregor: 'The oft-proffered argument that there are many Scots in England is a weak one. There are 5m Scots and 50m English, and the fact is that Scots go to England because they need money, and the English can move to Scotland because they have it.' I think: the arrival of incomers is inevitable and not at all tragic. Few of us live where we would most like to live (Palm Springs, in my case; Belgravia at a pinch). I think: If people in Scotland have to move south to earn some money then they are at liberty to move back again once they have made it. But then I think: that sounds like Norman Tebbit, which upsets me so violently I almost have an accident. Scene IV: I am now at Corran, at the eastern end of the peninsula, waiting for the ferry so that I can cross Loch Linnhe for the short drive to Fort William where I will catch the night train to London. It is a hobby of mine when waiting for transport to study the rules and conditions laid down by the transport company. The Corran ferry is operated by the Highland Regional Council, a cautious body to judge from its 'conditions of carriage,' two of which state: 'The Council shall be entitled in their absolute discretion and without assigning any reason to refuse to receive or ship any goods or vehicle, or any part thereof, or any passenger. 'The Council are not liable for failure to operate the ferries at the scheduled times, or at all, and they are not liable for any loss, damage or injury resulting from delays, through whatever cause arising.' I think: that just about covers it.</p>

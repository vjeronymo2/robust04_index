			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WELL-TRAVELED KRAMER SHOWS HEART OF A LION  </P> <P> Despite being cut twice and suffering a serious knee injury, Erik Kramer never  lost faith in his ability to play quarterback in the National Football League.  </P> <P> It paid off for the former Burroughs High and Pierce College standout last  month when he signed a two-year contract with the Detroit Lions.  </P> <P> "It feels great to throw an NFL ball again instead of that big balloon they  have in Canada," said Kramer, who participated in the Lions' recent mini-camp  in Tampa, Fla.  </P> <P> The mini-camp was Kramer's first football action since partially tearing  ligaments in his left knee during a scrimmage with the Canadian Football  League's Calgary Stampeders last summer. He was the team's starting quarterback  at the time.  </P> <P> "I didn't think it needed to happen," Kramer said. "I knew going in, it was  risky to have a live scrimmage. But that's the breaks. You just have to play  the cards you're dealt."  </P> <P> Kramer said the injury occurred when a defensive lineman rolled into him after  he released a pass.  </P> <P> "We had just one starting offensive lineman returning," Kramer said. "The  starting left tackle was a tight end in college and had never played offensive  line before. He had already gotten beat a few times."  </P> <P> Kramer underwent arthroscopic surgery, which kept him out the entire season.  When his CFL contract expired, he sent videotapes of his play to several NFL  teams.  </P> <P> "I got some feedback from Detroit, Washington and Tampa Bay," Kramer said. "I  worked out for Detroit and made the decision from there. I feel like I have a  pretty good shot there."  </P> <P> Kramer, 25, is among six quarterbacks competing for what is expected to be  three roster positions.  </P> <P> The others are Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware of Houston; former USC star  Rodney Peete, the starter most of last season; former Hoover High and Glendale  College standout Bob Gagliano, who sparked the Lions' season-ending five-game  winning streak; Eric Jones, who spent last season on the developmental squad;  and former starter Chuck Long, who is asking to be traded.  </P> <P> "The coaches say all the quarterbacks will share equal time in practice, and  that's where I'll have to build my base," said Kramer, an honorable-mention  All-American at Pierce in 1984 when he led the Brahmas to a 10-1 season. "That  will give me the chance to develop a good foundation going into the preseason  games. Once I get into the preseason, I know I can put on a pretty good show."  </P> <P> Kramer's pro football odyssey began in 1987 after signing with the New Orleans  Saints as a free agent out of North Carolina State. After his release at the  end of training camp, Kramer became a hot commodity two weeks later when NFL  teams were seeking replacement players during the players' strike. Kramer opted  for the Atlanta Falcons, for whom he started two games and passed for 335 yards  and three touchdowns in an upset of a veteran Rams team.  </P> <P> The Falcons kept Kramer after the strike, but he did not play another  regular-season game. Kramer was relased the week of Atlanta's 1988  regular-season opener.  </P> <P> He signed with the Stampeders in October and started five games, completing 62  of 153 passes for 964 yards and five touchdowns.  </P></p>

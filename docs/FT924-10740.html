			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Technology: Waging war against the paper chase - How a US defence initiative could help the commercial sector trim development times Every working day, another billion pages are added to the piles of paper stored in US businesses, which keep more than 95 per cent of their estimated 3,000bn documents in paper form. Keeping on top of paper-based information can be a nightmare which, if it turns into a paper chase, can seriously delay a new project's development as time is wasted locating information and keeping up with design changes. In the US Army the problem surfaced more than a decade ago when the programme manager for the M-1 tank complained that a flood of paperwork and unco-ordi-nated computer programs were crippling its development. That prompted the US Defence Department to decide in 1985 that all new weapon systems should be designed digitally. The decision looks likely to have implications that go beyond the military sector. Building a modern weapon system, or the aircraft in which it is fitted, is a challenge that will be familiar to many commercial manufacturers. It involves correlating hundreds of thousands of physical parts, units of information and bits of paper to build specialised equipment in the quickest and most efficient way, and control the materials needed for its construction. In January, California-based Computer Sciences Corporation, one of the computer industry's largest independent professional services companies, was awarded a contract from the Defence Department to develop a system that aims to end the paper chase. The system, known as Joint Computer-Aided Acquisition and Logistic Support (J-Cals), is valued at Dollars 744m over 12 years if the US government exercises all its options, and will link 245 military sites across the US. CSC says it will enable the department to build, maintain and support weapon systems without the traditional 'paper-laden' tools such as technical manuals and engineering drawings. The spin-off effect for the commercial and industrial sector is not lost on I. Gary Bard, president of CSC's integrated systems division. 'The benefits could be enormous,' he says. For every dollar spent on J-Cals, there could be a return of five or six to one, and more if its implementation leads to a re-engineering of the production process. CSC's brief is to design a system which can access very different types of data, from technical manuals to computer graphics, and capture and store the information on an integrated database. 'Our job is to put everything together,' says Bard. 'Already we have integrated 42 software packages.' Bard sees five main features of J-Cals: first, it establishes a global data management system, and has the ability to access data from different 'islands of automation' via a global data dictionary, and make it available to engineers, designers and other staff concurrently. Second, the system establishes a management system that allocates the tools required to perform a function and works out priorities in a paperless environment. The other three characteristics are particularly important in defence, but could be applied elsewhere, says Bard: acquisition, or bringing together all the data for bidding and purchasing; providing a single source of technical information and thus ensuring that everyone has access to changes; and logistic support, a process of describing what happens to a part during its lifetime, thus enabling a logistics analyst to decide where to put his priorities. The J-Cals solution is a sophisticated architecture based on open system standards, and blends by a number of separate 'enabling technologies' - everything from Cadcam to data compression and optical character recognition. Two of the most important are imaging and distributed database technologies, to convert paper documents to electronic images and then make them widely available via a nationwide network. Among the benefits Bard sees from J-Cals are immense reductions in time  - the data acquisition process for bidding and purchasing could be reduced to a week from anything between four months and a year; fewer mistakes, because the system is configured to ensure that parts are supplied to the right equipment; and better-quality data. There is an inevitable non-defence spin-off for CSC as the Defence Department's 300,000 contractors will soon be required to deliver their technical data in a format compatible with J-Cals, and many of these companies have a separate industrial client base. Already, CSC has won two important contracts in the US following its J-Cals work - one for a big, unnamed defence contractor and the other with Caterpillar, the world's largest construction equipment group.</p>

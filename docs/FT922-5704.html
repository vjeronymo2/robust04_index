			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Russian managers reluctant to adopt western practices MANAGERS of Russia's biggest industrial enterprises are supporting moves towards a market economy but believe it is 'unethical' to adopt western practices such as mass layoffs and aggressive pricing policies to reach that goal. This is one conclusion of the first report into why many senior managers of enterprises, from arms producers to textile manufacturers, have not responded to the government's 'shock therapy' to shift Russia from a planned economy to a free market one. The report by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is based on opinion polls and interviews involving 200 of Russia's biggest enterprises. It paints a portrait of an average senior manager who finds it unethical to charge 'excessive' prices to his friends and to demand payment from other enterprises which claim they cannot pay. With debts between enterprises reaching Rbs1,300bn (Pounds 7.2bn), according to the central bank's latest figures, the report cites a fear among enterprises that demanding late payments from each other will mean 'everything will stop'. A reluctance to fire employees explains why a 15 per cent fall in production for the first quarter of this year has not resulted in a surge in unemployment. The report notes that the courts and trade unions also deter enterprises from sacking workers, but many directors feel responsible for their workforce and hope that the bad times will pass. It also notes that 80 per cent of managers favour privatisation, in part because they believe it will be the only way to attract foreign capital. There is a widespread belief that foreign investors will avoid state-owned enterprises. Western-style pricing policies, however, find little favour among the managers. After the liberalisation of prices in January, enterprises, most of which are monopoly producers, have tended to raise their prices, until they cannot sell their goods, rather than cut their costs. They continue to add to their costs a fixed 25 per cent (the maximum allowed by the state), plus the new value added tax of 28 per cent which they pass on to the buyer.</p>

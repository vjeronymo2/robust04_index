			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>   [Text] Starting today, a faceless judge has 10 days to  confirm the Office of the Prosecutor General's request to  sentence Juan David Ochoa Vasquez to a six and a half year  prison term.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Juan Ortiz] Today, the  Prosecutor  General's office sentenced Medellin Cartel drug trafficker Juan  David Ochoa Vasquez to six and a half years in prison, within  the anticipated sentencing framework for the crimes of illicit  enrichment, drug trafficking, and collusion. At the hearing,  which lasted approximately four hours, Deputy Prosecutor General  Francisco Jose Sintura defined the terms of the negotiation,  which includes the sentence handed down and the payment of a  multimillion bond. [Sintura] The Prosecutor General's Office  decided to impose a sentence, after granting the reductions  allowed by law for confessing, voluntarily surrendering to  justice, and reaching an agreement with us.    [Ortiz] With this sentence, Juan David Ochoa could request  parole in a little more than a year since by then he will have  served 75 percent of his sentence, started on 16 February 1991.  Today's agreement with Juan David Ochoa Vasquez concludes the  proceedings against the Ochoa familiy, the first one to accept  surrendering to the law. [end recording]</p>

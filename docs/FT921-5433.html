			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Argentine bank to launch bond of up to Dollars 100m ARGENTINA'S largest private sector commercial bank, Banco Rio de la Plata, is set to launch a bond of up to Dollars 100m in the international market tomorrow, writes Stephen Fidler. The three-year bonds, the first for a private commercial bank since the market reopened to Argentine borrowers in late 1990, will carry a coupon of 9 1/8 per cent. They are expected to be priced to yield 3.75 percentage points over US Treasury paper, suggesting an issue price of below 100. An underwriting group will be led by Merrill Lynch. Argentine private sector companies have issued Dollars 321m of bonds since late 1990. The main shareholder of the bank, with assets of Dollars 1.7bn and a capital to assets ratio of 4:1, is Fundacion Perez Companc, a foundation formed and owned by the Perez Companc family, whose members also control a further 33.7 per cent of the shares. Mr Roberto Ruiz, a bank director, said the bonds were being sold against a backdrop of an improving Argentine economy. Argentina's banking system was well capitalised and the indebtedness of its domestic corporate and consumer markets was low.</p>

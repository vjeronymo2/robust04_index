			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mamduh al-Wali] </F>   [Text] An economic report Prepared by the Information  Center of the Cabinet points to: a continuation of the gradual  drop of average interest rates for treasury notes and of the  average discount rate, stable interest rates for deposits and  loans in U.S. dollars over the past several months, a relative  rise in the exchange rates for all of the main foreign  currencies, a drop in Suez Canal revenue indicators during  January and February 1994 compared to the same period in 1993,  and a drop in sales of reinforcement bars during the same  period, in which electricity, oil, and gas production rose, and  inflation continued to decline gradually.    Monetary indicators in the report by the Information  Center--which is overseen by Dr. Hisham al-Sharif, an advisor to  the administrative development minister--point to a stable  average interest rate for deposits in Egyptian pounds since last  July. That rate remains at 12.5 percent. However, in actuality,  public-sector banks with accumulated liquidity are paying 11  percent to 11.5 percent for three-month deposits; the longer the  deposit term is, the lower these rates are. Small banks are  paying the lowest rates, due to their more difficult  circumstances and relatively high risks.    Between April 1993 and April 1994, the interest rate for  short-term U.S. dollar deposits remained stable at around 3.04  percent.    The average interest rate for treasury notes has continued  to  drop gradually, reaching 13.4 percent during the first week of  April 1994, compared to 14 percent at the start of 1994. Experts  believe that the drop is a sign of the market's health, because  the notes are devoid of risks, and it is senseless for their  interest rates to be higher than bank deposit rates. Also, the  continued drop in the treasury note rate will compel some who  save in treasury notes to go to the capital market in search of  higher returns.  <H5>  Special Rates Given by Large Banks </H5>   The average discount rate, which is the rate the central  bank  charges for loans to banks, continued to drop, reaching 16.06  percent in March 1994 and 16 percent in the first week of April  1994. However, in practice, the banks are lending to enterprises  at an interest rate 2.5 percent higher than the discount rate.  Thus, loans for some industrial activities have rates of 18  percent, while loans for commerce have slightly lower rates. At  the same time, some large banks are lending to some of their  clients at 13 percent, because these banks need to invest their  liquidity surpluses to offset the cost of deposits. On the other  hand, the index number of the loan and discount balance at the  end of 1993 is the same as that of March 1992, which is  connected to the current slump.    The lending rate for U.S dollars was 5.04 percent during the  first week of April 1994, which is the same rate as that of  March 1993.    Exchange rates for the main foreign currencies rose in  general during the first months of 1994. Between January and  March, the U.S. dollar rose from 337.24 piasters to 337.94  piasters; the European Currency Unit [ECU], from 367.68 piasters  to 375.09 piasters; the pound sterling, from 493.99 piasters to  494.85 piasters; the German mark, from 192.96 piasters to 197.6  piasters; the French franc, from 56.78 piasters to 58.06  piasters; and the Japanese yen, from 299.8 piasters to 328.07  piasters per 100 yen.    During the first week of April 1994, the rates for the  German  mark, French franc, and ECU fell slightly, while those for the  other currencies rose.  <H5>  Explanation for Drop in Inflation </H5>   The monthly inflation rate--i.e., the rate at which consumer  prices increase--increased by 0.5 percent in January 1994 and by  1.2 percent in February. Thus, the annual basis for inflation  rates, which indicates the rate of change in a month relative to  the same month of the previous year, reached 7.4 percent during  January and 7.3 percent during February 1994.    The annual average inflation rate, which better reflects  inflation, reached 11.8 percent during January and dropped to  11.4 percent during February. We asked Dr. Mukhtar Khattab, the  chief of the decisionmaking support section in the Information  Center of the Cabinet, how inflation can drop while the prices  of some commodities, including rice and sugar, have risen in  previous months. He said that the consumer price index is one of  the best practical methods for measuring inflation. However, it  does have several shortcomings: It is based on a single consumer  basket, whereas in reality different groups in society have  different consumer baskets, depending on their social level. The  Egyptian index prepared by the Statistics Agency contains 402  goods and services. The annual base of inflation during February  was 7.3 percent. But the rate of inflation for the prices of  some goods and services included in the indicator was higher  than 7.3 percent during that month: Fish prices rose by 14.7  percent, housing and fuel prices rose by 10.4 percent, prices  for pharmaceutical and medical instruments rose by 16.8 percent,  meat and poultry prices rose by 10.3 percent, prices for cereals  and starchy foodstuffs rose by 11 percent, ready-made clothing  prices rose by 9.7 percent, and the price of sugar rose by 11  percent. However, the indicator measures the average price of  goods and services according to their relative weight in the  consumer commodities basket. Thus, a 10-percent rise in fuel  prices does not mean a 10-percent rise in inflation, because the  weight of fuel in the consumer's budget may be 5 percent. Thus,  the effect of such an increase on inflation in 1971, for  example, was canceled out.    On the other hand, a drop in the prices of some commodities  may cancel out increases in the prices of other commodities, so  that the consumer price index drops. Last February, the  indicator of dry legumes dropped by 0.5 percent, while prices  for dairy products and cheese rose by only 0.4 percent,  restaurant and hotel prices remained unchanged, beverage and  cigarette prices remained unchanged, and prices for furniture,  carpets, and household effects rose by 3.6 percent.</p>

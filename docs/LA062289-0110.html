			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEATER CENTER RENEWS SPIRIT OF DEDICATION  </P> <P> Last month, the board of directors of the Santa Paula Theater Center accepted  with the deepest of regrets the resignation of William Lucking. As a co-founder  and co-artistic director of the SPTC, we applaud his efforts and salute his  contributions for helping to make it one of the most lauded and popular  theaters in Ventura County.  </P> <P> What began as a dream in the minds of both Bill and Dana Elcar has materialized  into a theater of quality work structured on the sound foundation of first-rate  talent and productions.  </P> <P> While we will miss Bill's involvement and wish him well in his new endeavors,  under Dana's guidance, the SPTC will remain a testament to the lofty ideals  they set together. It will continue to represent the idea they foresaw and  reflect the excellence their professionalism demanded.  </P> <P> On behalf of the board, I wish to assure our patrons that the directors have  renewed their spirit of dedication to the theater created by Bill and Dana. The  SPTC will continue to present outstanding and exciting works in the county's  most beautiful and historical setting.  </P> <P> MARY ALICE ORCUTT HENDERSON  </P> <P> President, board of directors  </P> <P> Santa Paula Theater Center  </P></p>

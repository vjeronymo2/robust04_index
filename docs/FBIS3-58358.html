			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report Inger Jagerhorn: "Minister Refuses To Sacrifice </F> Farmers"]    [Text] That Sweden could be forced at the very end of its  negotiations with the EU [European Union] to trade off  agricultural subsidies against its membership contribution is an  extremely sensitive issue within the government.    The mere thought of such a trade-off has caused Agriculture  Minister Karl-Erik Olsson to lash out, most recently after a  DAGENS NYHETER interview with European Affairs Minister Ulf  Dinkelspiel on Wednesday [5 January].    When DAGENS NYHETER wrote in its article that such a  situation could arise, Karl-Erik Olsson rang Ulf Dinkelspiel and  was, by his own admission, "a little heated."    As a result Ulf Dinkelspiel contacted DAGENS NYHETER and  underlined once again what he said in the interview: that each  specialist area will be negotiated on its own merits.    "I will not accept any trade-off or agree to these things  being played off against each other," Dinkelspiel said firmly.    Nevertheless, both Karl-Erik Olsson and Ulf Dinkelspiel  admit  that even though the Swedish Government's intentions are the  best, no one can prevent the EU's negotiators from making such a  linkage in the final phase of the negotiations.    "That is the time when we could find ourselves in such a  situation," Ulf Dinkelspiel said. "In the final stage of the  negotiations you have to look at things as a whole."    According to DAGENS NYHETER's information, the risk of this  will probably be greater, the greater the number of agricultural  issues which remain unresolved in the final phase. That is why  the agriculture negotiations are under time pressure so that  they do not give rise to the risk that money for farmers will be  played off against the contribution to the EU budget from  Sweden's state coffers.    Ulf Dinkelspiel also revealed that Sweden is refraining from  pushing its demand for a change to the basis on which membership  contributions are calculated. This means that today Sweden is  remaining firm on only one demand relating to its membership  contribution -- namely that a phasing-in period of several years  is granted before full contributions are made.    The Swedish membership contribution is expected to be about  22 billion kronor. From the treasury's viewpoint a cut in  agricultural subsidies would not be very much help. On the  other hand, it could placate certain EU countries and help them  accept a phasing-in period.    The agricultural support which Sweden is granted and the  membership contribution which Sweden will have to pay are not  amounts of money which can be arrived at through rough  estimates. There are clear rules for how they are to be  calculated.    This is the second time that the agriculture minister has  reacted sharply to a cabinet colleague's presumed treachery  vis-a-vis the farmers. The last time was when Finance Minister  Anne Wibble said in Brussels on 23 November that the government  must be prepared to "trade off one thing against something  different." After a sharp reaction from Karl-Erik Olsson she  was forced to say publicly that she was not referring to  agriculture.    There still seems to be a thorn in the side of the  agriculture minister.    "At the time Wibble was actually talking about budget,  regional policy, and budget policy. It is not difficult harbor  the suspicion that she was linking precisely these areas,"  Olsson said.    He reminded DAGENS NYHETER that there was a discussion "in  parts of the Finance Ministry" and also in Social Democratic  circles with the thrust that certain sections of agricultural  support would be excluded in the event of Swedish membership to  reduce the burden on the EU's budget. But it turned out that  that model proved impossible, he said.</p>

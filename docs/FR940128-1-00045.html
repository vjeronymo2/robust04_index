			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency recognizes that not all processing activities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will require hand washing and sanitizing. Activities that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not require such steps include the handling of raw fish and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fishery products prior to the initial washing step (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly from the fisherman) and the handling of finished  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products in shipping cases. These activities are exceptions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, to the general rule that employees must thoroughly wash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and sanitize their hands after each contact with an insanitary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface. Additionally, when insanitary objects come into contact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with product contact surfaces, they must be thoroughly cleaned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and sanitized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the processing of cooked products, the raw material may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also serve as a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms. For this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason, employees or equipment that handle or touch the raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material must be cleaned and sanitized before being used with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooked product or ice, or they could convey the microorganisms to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these foods (Refs. 63, 64, 73, 74, 84, 87, and 88).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(c)(1), the agency is proposing to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sanitary practices of the employees, especially as they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relate to hand washing, sanitizing practices, and the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for cross contamination, be checked and recorded at least every 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours during processing. This monitoring will ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees arriving for work and returning from the midshift break  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have properly washed and sanitized their hands. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of hand sanitizing solutions tends to be reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the course of a production day because of the reaction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sanitizer with organic matter and dissipation as a gas (Ref.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 82). It will also cause a regular assessment of the adequacy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the normal operating procedures. Finally, recording will provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance that appropriate procedures are being followed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In &sect;123.10(a)(8)(i), FDA is proposing to require that hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washing facilities be located in all processing areas in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washing and sanitizing is required by CGMP's so that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities are readily accessible to employees who work in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing areas. The agency has tentatively concluded that proper sanitization is such an important part of preventing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spread of disease as to warrant a requirement that hand washing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment be conveniently located to facilitate their use. Where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these facilities are not conveniently located, they may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frequented by the employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in &sect;123.10(a)(8)(ii) that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities be equipped with hand cleaning and effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitizing preparations and single-service towels or suitable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand drying devices. Ordinary soap is acceptable for hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washing. Hand sanitizers need to be fast acting because of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short contact time involved. In contrast to the sanitizing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, which can involve leaving a sanitizing spray on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment for extended periods of time, hand sanitizing usually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves a quick dip in and out of the sanitizer. Of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitizers described previously (see discussion of proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;123.10(a)(4)), quaternary ammonium is not fast acting and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not suitable as a hand sanitizer. The others are appropriate as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand sanitizers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

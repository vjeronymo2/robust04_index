			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firmer ahead of the Budget A TRADING week likely to be dominated by today's Budget speech in the UK parliament, but also by hopes for cuts in interest rates both in Germany and in Britain, made a confident start yesterday. Ex-dividend adjustments in several blue chip shares restrained the day's gain in the FT-SE 100 Index to 6.5; but for these technical factors, the rise would have been twice the reported figure. Equity strategists expect Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, to announce some fairly moderate tightening of fiscal policy today, but believe he will avoid any risk of jeopard-ising the fragile recovery in the UK economy; economic optimism was encouraged by news that UK manufacturing output increased by 0.8 per cent between December and January. At the same time, a further cut in UK base rates is certainly 'on the agenda' and London has become significantly more confident of a reduction in German rates following the recent trimming of the Bundesbank's money market rates. Early falls in the Footsie reflected the ex-dividend adjustments in such leading names as ICI, Barclays, RTZ and Abbey National. Hardly a sector was immune from these pricing factors and the Footsie dipped 7.2 to within 9 points of the 2,900-mark in early trading. However, with the March future on the FT-SE 100 Index still positive with only a few days' life left in the contract, shares soon rallied and moved slowly ahead. At best the market was more than 12 Footsie points up, before interest died away towards the close of the final pre-Budget trading session in equities. The closing reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,922.4 for a net gain of 6.5. Seaq trading volume slipped to 578.1m shares from Friday's 769m. But all the signs have been that retail, or genuine investor, business in equities has remained high, reflecting improved confidence in prospects for economic recovery and further interest rate cuts. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained 12.5 at 3,112 yesterday, and non-Footsie business made up nearly 72 per cent of the day's total. On Friday, retail business was worth Pounds 1.54bn, bringing a total of Pounds 8.78bn for the week. The increased level of retail business has now extended for the past five months and has significantly improved levels of profitability among London-based securities firms. Underlying confidence in the outlook for interest rates across Europe was reflected in gains in shares in UK property and building and construction companies yesterday. Rises were strongest in UK building groups with interests in Germany. London's hopes of lower rates in Germany were not discouraged yesterday by a repetition of strong anti-inflation views by the president of the Bundesbank. A further indication of the positive mood underlying the stock market came from bid-related activity, both in the leisure and property sectors. A market raid was mounted on shares of Owners Abroad by Thomas Cook, the German-owned travel agency, ahead of today's closure of the Pounds 290m hostile bid by Airtours. The latest developments in Hong Kong were outweighed for UK investors by profits and an excellent dividend payout by HSBC Holdings.</p>

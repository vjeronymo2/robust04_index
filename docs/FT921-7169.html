			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Observer: Out of the mine-field Unlike most of Britain's construction industry chiefs, Tony Budge is prepared for anything. Parked outside his company's Retford HQ are a Scud missile-launcher, a squadron of ex-Soviet tanks and enough other second-hand fighting vehicles to equip a third world army. 'I always wanted to be a Royal Engineer,' says the 52-year-old Budge, a keen supporter of the military vehicle conservation group and active fundraiser for the Army Benevolent Fund. But just as he was about to sign on, his father was taken ill and the would-be sapper was press-ganged into the family building company as a left-handed bricklayer. Then, after training as a civil engineer, he started his own company A F Budge. His career has never looked back. As chairman of Britain's third biggest road-builder - the M62 corridor is his main theatre - Budge is better placed than most publicly-quoted competitors such as Tarmac, Wimpey and Laing. He avoided house-building, and is gaining from the surge in government roadworks. However, a recent expansion into open-cast mining had pushed gearing over the 100 per cent mark. Hence the decision to sell Budge Mining - the UK's biggest private coal-producer - to management led by his younger brother Richard. Although the two brothers are going their separate ways they still share an interest in the new Sheffield airport they are building.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday prayer sermon by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani </F> in Tehran on 7 January -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the second sermon, in addition to calling the  people to piety, the performance of our religious duties, acting  on what is made obligatory, and shunning that which has been  forbidden, I wish to refer to the present condition of our  revolution and our country in pursuance of some of the recent  remarks of the esteemed leader of the revolution [Khamene'i]. In  my view, it is an important topic and I hope that our ummah will  pay special attention to this important topic.    Recently, in his remarks the leader has a few times stressed  an issue to which I feel the media has not paid sufficient  attention, despite the fact that full attention is usually paid  to his remarks. That issue, which is a very important issue, is  his repeated references to the fact that today it is a major sin  -- an unforgivable sin -- to create despondency among the  people. He is emphatic on this point and repeatedly refers to  it. I wish to talk a little concerning these comments. I  believe that it is an appropriate time to raise this issue,  because I feel that we are faced with a very dangerous and a  very mischievous propaganda conspiracy.    We have completed one period of reconstruction and we are on  the threshold of launching the second plan. I wish to provide  some explanations that are also relevant to our discussion.  That plan is now being studied by the Majles. I have a very  clear impression, and there are numerous clues for it, that the  world arrogance, especially America -- because today it is the  leader of that propaganda campaign and is guiding those  pressures -- has realized that the Islamic revolution has  successfully passed through many dangerous stages that they  predicted would lead us to a dead end, that the people are  reaching the stage of necessary confidence, and that the country  is achieving necessary stability. They are afraid that if this  revolution, with all that it stands for, achieves full  political, economic, and cultural stability and if it can  strengthen its foundations they will no longer be able to damage  it and the matter will be completely taken out of their hands.    You are aware of the previous stages and how they confronted  us at each stage. Today we are entering a completely new stage,  and I see that there is an organized propaganda campaign waged  against us, so that the people may lose their confidence in  Islam and feel that the revolution and Islam will not be able to  build the country and will not be able to create prosperity for  the people. This in short is the essence of the propaganda  onslaught that is being waged by them today. Its aim is to  weaken the morale of the people, if they succeed. If they do  succeed in creating despondency among the people they have  achieved their greatest goal in history and have prevented a  danger that threatens the center of world arrogance. They will  then be able to weaken the general movement that exists in the  world today.    Iran is not their only target. Today you see in some  newspapers -- there are of course many such reports, but here  you only see a small portion of it -- that arrogant observers  have become worried that the wave of Islam has passed beyond the  borders of Iran, that the new Islam, the Islam that was  propagated by the Imam [Khomeyni] has transcended Iranian  frontiers and has penetrated many Islamic countries. Even in  Western countries it has aroused a great deal of interest among  the perceptive individuals -- not ordinary people who are  influenced by propaganda, but people of conscience, people of  understanding. They have this fear.    Therefore, they have to deliver their blow at the base of  the  revolution. If here they can persuade the people that this is  not in their interest, then they have achieved their aim. I am  sorry that to a large extent they receive the basic material for  their propaganda from inside our country. Certain people who  have good intentions and who feel concerned about the country  raise some minor issues and magnify some difficulties and  problems to such an extent that immediately you see that Radio  Israel, BBC Radio, and Voice of America broadcast it back to us.  And it is not limited to those three radio stations. You notice  that any small issue that we raise here reverbrates throughout  the world and gives rise to a flood of special articles in  newspapers, which are today regarded as the source material for  the newspapers in the Third World. They are then translated and  taken to all Islamic countries.    It requires special alertness. I get really worried when I  see that well-intentioned individuals quote certain untrue  figures and statistics that are contrary to the realities and  that will only lead to the despondency of the people and make  them negative. They will weaken the morale of the people or, at  least, sow the seeds of doubt in them. This is our very serious  duty -- to mention our positive points, to talk about the  efforts of these people, the endeavors of this nation, the gains  of this nation.    Perhaps one of the reasons for this -- I am not sure if this  is the reason -- is that our media is inclined to give  prominence to negative reports. Those who are interested in  appearing in the media say something negative, because they see  that the following day their names and remarks are published in  big letters on the front pages of newspapers. Of course, a  person might have said something with good intentions, so that  he can express what is in his heart. See what is happening in  the world today, and why the leader of the revolution regards  this as a major sin.    This does not mean that we should not refer to the  difficulties. It does not mean that we should not criticize. If  we do not criticize, the issues will not be put right. However,  one should say these things in such a way that one only refers  to the facts. If a certain organization wishes to say, for  instance, that the deprived classes are faced with problems, and  if it raises a slogan that the bones of the deprived classes are  being crushed [in last week's Friday prayer sermons Ayatollah  Jannati used an almost identical sentence saying that the bones  of deprived classes are being crushed], then he [as heard]  should also give the correct figures and statistics. He should  say how much we are spending from the public treasury for the  deprived classes, how much we are spending in deprived areas,  how much we are spending on reconstruction, how much we are  paying in subsidies to them, how cheaply we are selling the  bread, how cheaply we are selling the fuel, how cheaply we are  selling vegetable oil, how cheaply we are selling medicine. Let  him give those figures, and then say that there are also some  problems, so that the people may know that their treasury, their  country, their Majles, their government, their leader are  working for them. However, if one only comes and says that the  situation is a certain way... [pauses] if one did not know those  individuals one would have doubted their sincerity.    At times, I feel that there are some deceitful, satanic  individuals who get close to podiums and pens and produce false  figures, and then it goes into the newspapers. This has  happened, and whether some people try to make amends for those  mistakes or not the feeling of despondency will continue. As  your trusted friend I tell you that with the implementation of  the First Plan world arrogance realized that it has lost out.    They realized the country's problems were solved, that  there are no more problems. The biggest problem in the country  was our strong dependence on foreign currency earned from oil  sales. The West could always bring our country to its knees with  that weapon.    Four or five years into the plan they realized that Iran is  not as vulnerable as they had thought because we have non-oil  exports worth at least $5 billion annually. Of course, it is  about $4 billion in official figures, because those who export  do not put down true figures. If, for example, their goods are  worth $1,500, they put down $1,000 in their statements. The  true figure is higher. We have also saved more than that amount.    In many areas we do not need the foreign currency earned  from  oil sales. Raw materials for many factories -- steel,  aluminium, copper, chemicals, and others -- are domestically  produced. Many intermediary goods are produced by our own  industries. They make the machinery.    The food situation is not like in the past. If we put slight  pressure on consumption and control the consumption of bread and  other things, our present grain production would be sufficient  for our needs. Tea is reaching self-sufficiency. Wheat has had  a marvelous growth. Chickens have reached self-sufficiency.  Food in our country is generally no longer imported, except for  a few items. For example, if we were importing $4 billion worth  of foodstuffs three years ago, we need to import $1 billion  today. That is, about a third.    I can see that our needs from the outside world have  decreased. Many of the heavy machinery that you see -- tractors,  bulldozers, loaders, wagons, locomotives, engines for large and  small machinery -- a large portion of them are being built by  our own industries.    Our defense industries' requirements were always imported  and  we had to undergo a huge expense. We now import practically  none of our defense needs.    It is the same with the chemical industry, which is the most  important. Oil by-products, which we used to import, we are now  producing -- most of them ourselves. We are expanding gas to  replace other fuels.    The West realize that our dependence on oil has decreased.  For that reason, now that they cause a shock and talk about  dealing us blows, they deal a blow to their own friends.    Despite the fact that the price of our oil came down by  nearly 30 percent in our budget calculations, we submitted our  budget -- and also the Plan -- to the Majles like that of 1372  with a different growth figure.    This is due to the fact that the infrastructural works  carried out during the course of the First Plan have yielded  their intended results, and today the problem of dependence on  oil has been resolved to a large extent. Of course, if oil  generates more income, we will naturally be able to work faster.  For instance, instead of spending $10 billion on  reconstruction, we will be able to spend $20 billion. However,  if such an increase is not possible, we will not be facing any  danger. The speed of work might be reduced, but the country  will not face any danger. Enough infrastructural works have  been carried out in our country to meet our needs today.    If we do not face any unforeseen event, then we can be  confident that for the next five years we will have no  electrical power cuts and black-outs in this country. At  present, we have connected 200 towns to the national gas  network, and we are in the process of connecting other towns  with a great deal of speed. We have taken telephone lines to  the heart of our rural areas. Our transport system is enjoying  a full balance, in the sense that we have enough cargo for our  trucks, while at the same time the cargo does not have to wait  for trucks. The capacity of our ports has increased from 16  million tonnes to 28 million tonnes, and at present we do not  have any problem with our ports. We have, to a large extent,  harnessed our water resources. Moreover, we are managing to  meet the needs of our factories for raw material with what we  produce domestically. Praise be to God, the country does not  have any problems at the moment. This is exactly the thing that  has worried the arrogant countries.    I have been informed that during confidential meetings  between Western countries discussing Iran, the Americans have  stated that this, and not Islamic fundamentalism, is the danger  they faced. When the right time comes, we will of course reveal  all this in a documented manner. The Americans have said: This  constitutes the real danger, and we should not allow Iran to  develop itself. If Iran manages to accomplish this, then we  will not be able to do anything.    However, we have already passed through this stage during  the  course of our first development plan, and it is now too late for  the Westerners to realize this and enter the arena. If they had  delivered this petroleum-shock to us four years ago, then there  would have been danger. Today, however, there is no danger,  whatever they do. I can confidently tell you, as your expert,  that even if they stop our oil exports, Iran can still maintain  its present course and enjoy the same conditions as today. Of  course, if such a thing were to happen, then the process of  development would have to slow down. Still, that would not  constitute a problem. If, for example, we were intent on  building a factory in two years, we would then have to do it in  five years. [passage omitted]    What, however, is clear is that we have overcome the  dangers,  and today the Westerners are intent on disheartening the people.  This is because the type of work we have carried out can  naturally have economic and social consequences.    The most important thing that we ever did... [pauses] one of  the most important things that we have done was to reform the  price systems. They consider this a weak point, however. I  would like to emphasize that it is absolutely impossible for us  to be able to reconstruct our country by creating artificial  prices and imposing on domestic products by employing mechanisms  such as ration coupons and legislations. No industry can expect  growth if its products are sold at artificially set prices. No  industrial producer will ever enter the arena willingly under  such circumstances. The reform in the price system was another  major problem of ours, the bulk of which has been resolved,  while the what remains must be dealt with step by step.    Those moribund snakes who have left this winter behind, have  started to raise certain issues and ignore all the services  offered by the government. Although they are aware that these  issues are really points of strength, they still raise them  hoping they may be able to weaken the people's morale. However,  they are once again mistaken, as these people are very  discerning.    When I made the trip to Mazanderan just recently -- you saw  a few small corners of what I saw there -- the people showed  their mettle. The people are always waiting for an opportunity  to express their feelings, what they understand. The people  naturally carried out the maneuvers of being truly present in  the arena. They made me understand that all those ill-omened  and disheartening themes that are being fanned from some podiums  domestically and by some foreign media cannot discourage them.  They are far advanced in understanding the issues. They  understand better than those who imagine themselves to  understand and talk big. [passage omitted]    It was the same in countries abroad; the same in our  neighboring countries. We have had visits abroad and you  yourselves have seen their example. The eyes of the Muslims  outside also are on us. Fortunately the signs of Iran's  construction are there as well. Mr. Niyazov who was our guest  during these last few days said that the officials of heads of  the CIS who were in Ashgabat three or four days ago reported to  their heads that the Turkmen markets are full of goods, contrary  to the other CIS states. Then the CIS heads asked where those  goods came from and were told from our Iranian brethren. The  Iranian merchants are filling this place in that way. That means  that your neighbor is feeling the signs of construction here  because of its commercial link with you. Then all the CIS heads  encouraged that link, instead of being concerned.    That is the Iranian that you say seeks to export terrorism.    That is the movement that exists. Let us not be ungrateful  for that bounty of God. I am not claiming that we do not have  any difficulties either. We certainly have difficulties.  Sometimes something is expensive, something may be hard to  find, some might bully. Well, such incidents in a state that  seeks to reconstruct, which seeks to invest in its  infrastructure, seeks to struggle and lock horns with the most  satanic power in the world, seeks to confront international  embargoes -- well, it will have such problems as well. It is  not right that a country that annually is spending hundreds of  thousands of millions of tumans [10 rials] on the deprived  through subsidies, through services to deprived area, through  relief committees, through other organizations that have a  relief aspect for the people, and many other ways. Essentially  the revolution is for the deprived and essentially it is the  deprived who are our friends and army in the revolution arena.  Then we should constantly say from our podiums and by our pens  that the deprived are being crushed. Sometimes one sees some  individuals who say that the bones of the vulnerable stratum are  being broken. They misspell bone, yet they can chant slogans  very well.    Let us not approach the people's morale in this way. The  services that we are giving to those same people are not in my  hands or the hands of those like me. It is the masses of the  people, our community, our Hezbollahi managers, our oppressed  revolutionary personalities who are advancing their country  toward God as well as toward welfare in the face of the wave  upon wave of prevalent mischief. They must be supported. Our  enemies must not be allowed to open up unsound windows and enter  with poisonous propaganda. We should not dishearten those  people who are in the arena, self-sacrificing and heroic; a  people who have always routed the enemy by their heroism. That  is the word of the leader. In his remarks he had other great  words. He said compare your country with your neighbors and the  other developing countries. I do not wish to name them and give  figures about their lives. Their difficulties are not at all  comparable to ours. Their conditions of life are not comparable  to ours. That must be made a point -- power and morale in the  people.    Of course many of our friends and media constantly publish  figures and the services rendered. The only point I want to  make is that anyone who is interested in the revolution today  must avoid disheartening the people pointlessly. Of course,  however, if there is some truth to be told, if it is not told it  is possible for the falsehood or the wrong or the deviation to  remain. It is right to criticize; it is right to point out  problems; it is right to reform; and it is right to pursue  reform and also to confront wrongdoers. All that has its own  path, but all must be for encouraging the people, heartening the  people and their presence in the arenas, because that is the  very thing that is a thorn in the side of world arrogance. It  is the very thing that is targeted by world arrogance to prevent  the people from remaining in the arena. Thank God our people  are so alert and so aware that in these 15 years they have come  through the hardest trials with honor.    At the end of this sermon I must offer congratulations and  condolences to the families of the martyrs whose noble bodies we  will be escorting for burial today. One of the most painful and  and one of the most selfless families are those who have men  missing in action. Their position is even more difficult than  the families of the martyr's because at least they have the  grave of their martyr and their situation is clear. Our dear  forces on the borders are carrying out a tremendous job through  finding the markers that we had for them, identity tags and  numbers, which are found in either the Iraqi or Iranian soil.  They are gradually finding the unknown martyrs, who are  considered, for the time being, to be missing. I thank them and  also call on them to speed up their operations so we could know.  For this very reason we do not know how many prisoners we have  in Iraq. Many of those who we think are prisoners might be  martyrs or vice versa. This is a very valuable job and I thank  them. We also humbly thank the families of the missing, may God  bless them greater patience. [passage omitted]</p>

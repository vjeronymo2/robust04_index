			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Imry incurs Pounds 24.5m loss after making provisions of Pounds 21m IMRY Holdings, the property company taken over by Barclays last December after one of the largest debt write-downs in corporate history, incurred a loss for the year to March 31 of Pounds 24.5m. The company made provisions of Pounds 21m against loss on investment and trading properties and joint venture schemes. Value of the investment and trading portfolio fell by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 276.6m. Its net assets were Pounds 71m at the year end. Mr David Davies, chairman, said last year was one of the most demanding ever experienced by the property industry. However, he added that lower interest rates, together with a bottoming out of the economy, was encouraging greater activity in the property market as a whole. Imry's current debt is about Pounds 200m, of which Pounds 60m is owed to Barclays. The balance, due to other institutions and banks, is a mixture of long-term debentures, a facility to finance part of the trading portfolio and a medium-term loan secured on the The Shires shopping centre in Leicester. Mr Davies said that Imry was unlikely to remain part of Barclays in the long term. He said that a flotation or a reversal into a quoted company was 'a logical outcome' over the next three to five years. Imry's property is split between office and retail property, with a small element of industrial property. Its largest asset is The Shires, which covers 500,000 sq ft. After Barclays took control of Imry, it appointed Mr David Casson and Mr Lawrence Jones as non-executive directors. Mr Casson is deputy divisional director of general advances Barclays Banking Division Head Office. Mr Jones is senior risk management director of Barclays Bank London central region. The company had net rental income of Pounds 18.9m. Its net interest bill was Pounds 18.6m. Barclay's involvement in Imry stemmed from 1989 when it financed a highly leveraged takeover of the company.</p>

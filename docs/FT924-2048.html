			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Off the summit It did not take financial markets long yesterday to decide that the Edinburgh summit was a more of a political than an economic policy success. True, the meeting agreed on a package to bolster growth, but the short-run effect will be minimal. The pressing problems of currency uncertainty against a backdrop of high unemployment and tight money were not addressed, so it cames as no surprise that, after an initial rise, the French franc quickly fell back. It closed still in the danger area at over FFr3.41 to the D-mark. If that indicates a market belief that pressures on the system are likely to continue, the French bond market seems to be taking its own view of how the authorities will react. Last week, French bond prices rose on the expectation of a devaluation which would allow short term rates to fall. Yesterday, bond prices fell around half a point on the prospect of continued monetary squeeze. Good inflation figures, perversely, did not help; they were simply a reminder that, with real short rates of 9 per cent, money is almost unbearably tight. How long that situation can last is a moot point. Devaluations elsewhere in Europe have eroded French competitiveness; the Irish and Danish currencies still look vulnerable. Were they to devalue, the franc could be brutally exposed. Then again, Edinburgh's agreements may redouble the political will to hold the line. The next speculative attack will almost certainly not now be mounted before the new year and Germany's economic situation is deteriorating fast; the IFO economic institute now expects a half point fall in real economic output next year. That might keep alive just enough expectation of lower German rates to defer the final assault on the franc. A sharp deceleration in money growth would help even more - but that still looks like wishful thinking.</p>

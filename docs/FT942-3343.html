			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Don't shoot, I'm only the regulator: The review of the UK's electricity pricing regime must tread a fine line Good judgment undoubtedly played a part. But shareholders in regional electricity companies in England and Wales would find it hard to deny that they have been lucky since they bought into the sector four years ago. London Electricity, which serves the capital, should kick off the results season today with another set of impressive figures. Its profits performance has contributed to the shares more than doubling in value since flotation in 1990. In spite of recent falls, they have outperformed the FT-SE-A All-Share index by 68 per cent during the period. Back in 1990, the power industry was viewed by the City as a safe but dull investment. London is not exceptional among power companies, most of which have performed similarly. East Midlands has outperformed the market by more than its London counterpart, even though its profits for 1993-94 will be depressed by Pounds 130m because of poor acquisitions. However, the good times may be coming to an end. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, will shortly announce the results of a review of the pricing regime which helped the regional companies to make their unexpectedly high profits, and which is now considered to have been too lenient. He is threatening to be tough; 'draconian', according to industry insiders. Prof Littlechild is reviewing the distribution prices of the 12 regional companies and the two Scottish power companies, privatised in 1991. Distribution accounts for more than 80 per cent of the companies' profits in England and Wales, and 40 and 20 per cent respectively at Scottish Power and Scottish Hydro-Electric. While the review is important both for the companies and the customers, for whom distribution costs constitute a quarter of their electricity bills, it also has wider implications. Increasingly, countries from the Pacific Rim to South America are privatising their utilities. Since the UK has been in the forefront of transferring electricity, telecommunications and water to the private sector, its regulation model is studied both for its qualities and its shortcomings. The perceived shortcomings have come to notice recently as critics, including Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, the main electricity generating company, and opposition Labour MPs have pointed to the idiosyncratic styles of different UK regulators and called for a more co-ordinated and consistent regime. Prof Littlechild, together with Mr Ian Byatt, the water regulator, who is conducting a parallel exercise, will thus be subjected to searching scrutiny in their application of the regulatory regimes. Prof Littlechild must tread a fine line: if he is too tough in setting price targets, he risks the regional electricity companies successfully challenging his decision through the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. At the other extreme, less stringent prices could lay him open to charges that he is favouring already rich companies at the expense of consumers. In retrospect the controls which have allowed English and Welsh companies since 1990 to increase distribution prices by an average of 1.1 cent above inflation every year seem woefully inadequate for an industry which has made significant cost reductions; even the companies admit privately that they have had a relatively easy ride. They deny, however, that they misled the government about what could be achieved after privatisation. 'No one expected to be able to implement the kinds of jobs reductions or efficiency improvements which have been effected,' says one executive. The companies have typically lost more than 20 per cent of staff; Eastern, the largest regional power company in England and Wales, has cut jobs from 8,770 in March 1990 to 6,500. Other efficiency measures have included cutting layers of management, more flexible working, improving purchasing, and setting up business centres where profits, rather than cost, are the focus. In addition, capital expenditure has been lighter than expected because of the recession. The result of these changes and the relaxed price control regime is that the companies and their shareholders enjoy an embarrassment of riches. For instance, London Electricity's forecast pretax profits for 1993-94, at between Pounds 180m and Pounds 190m, compared with just Pounds 126m in the year before privatisation. This has enabled the company to double dividends to shareholders from 10.45p per share in 1990-91 to an expected 22.4p for 1993-94. Similar progress has been made by each of the other 11 regional companies and, to a lesser extent, the Scottish groups with their tighter price controls. But the underlying performances of the regional companies may be even better than the companies are stating publicly. Most of the regional companies have set aside substantial sums to meet future potential costs such as redundancy pay and pension provisions. To charges from consumer groups of profiteering, the companies point out that customers have also benefited from privatisation. Services have improved and prices have fallen in real terms for all but the largest customers. This year domestic tariffs have fallen by 6 per cent in some areas at a time when most European countries are experiencing price rises. Consumer groups say the effect of privatisation is less clear-cut since prices rose prior to 1990 as the government sought to enhance profit levels and thus make the industry more attractive for investors. Prof Littlechild's task is to assess how far the division of post-privatisation spoils needs to be reallocated. The regional companies do not like the way he is tackling it. Their overriding objection centres on his definition of capital invested in the businesses. This is crucial because the price controls which will be set for the next five years will take into account what he considers to be an adequate rate of return on capital. In a letter to the companies he has indicated that he favours a rate of 6 per cent. He has suggested that the definition of capital employed in the business should be the market capitalisation of the companies about a year after privatisation. The companies argue that the true figure for capital employed should be what it would cost them to replace their assets. The distinction between market value and replacement cost is important to the companies: the post-privatisation market capitalisation of the sector was Pounds 8bn, whereas replacing assets could currently cost Pounds 12bn in total. It is in the interests of the companies to win as generous a definition as possible on capital employed. The regulator is suggesting they might earn 6 per cent on a figure less than half that which they estimate is adequate. Observers suggest that if Prof Littlechild is unwilling to compromise on this tricky issue, the regional power companies in England and Wales would be forced to reduce distribution prices next April by up to 20 per cent. He has indicated that in future years they would be able to raise prices by inflation minus 4 per cent. In times of low inflation that would mean price cuts. While this would disappoint some consumer groups, the regional companies say they could not tolerate it. 'Right now we think the MMC would give us a better deal,' one chief executive said yesterday. 'If Prof Littlechild sticks to his line, the returns for us would be woefully inadequate.' Some of the companies are already devising strategy for appealing to the monopolies commission. Prof Littlechild's review is sure to arouse controversy. But it is likely that a compromise on price controls will be reached to placate most, and probably all, the 14 companies. Whether this will satisfy consumer groups, which feel the utilities have profited at the expense of customers, is doubtful. Power companies may continue to reap rewards which many consumer advocates find unacceptable.</p>

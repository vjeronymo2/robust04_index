			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Key senator demands prosecutor on BNL PRESSURE was building in Congress last night for the US administration to reconsider its refusal to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the government's handling of the scandal over Dollars 5bn of illegal loans to Iraq, made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). The increased pressure came as Senator David Boren, the conservative Democratic chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, demanded that a special prosecutor be named to investigate the BNL-Iraq affair. He has been holding closed Senate hearings to determine why the CIA and Justice Department concealed information on the BNL affair from a US federal court. Mr Boren said last night that new information had come to light in the past two weeks that should compel Mr William Barr, US Attorney-General, to appoint a special prosecutor. In a letter to Mr Barr yesterday, Mr Boren said the CIA had admitted that, with the 'strong advice' of the Justice Department, it had written a misleading letter about BNL to US prosecutors in Atlanta. Mr Boren cited what he called 'an unprecedented statement' from Judge Marvin Shoob of the BNL case in Atlanta, which stated that 'decisions were made at the top levels of the US government and within the intelligence community to shape this case.' Mr Boren said 'a truly independent investigation is required to determine whether federal crimes were committed' in the government's handling of the BNL affair.</p>

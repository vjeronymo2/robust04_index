			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 2 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  said here today that China is willing to contribute to the early  realization of peace and stability in the former Yugoslavia with  the joint efforts of the international community.    Li made the remarks in a meeting here this afternoon with  Slovenian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs  Lojze Peterle and his party.    The premier noted that conflicts in that region are one of  the negative effects left by the Cold War. After the Cold War,  the world has not become as peaceful as some people have  imagined.    The fact is that the world has witnessed a rise of  destabilizing factors, such as national disputes, regional  conflicts and economic discrepancy. This has been shown all too  clearly in the former Yugoslavian region, Li said.    China is concerned about the evolution of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina situation, he added.    China holds that international conflicts should be settled  through peaceful means and that the sovereignty and territorial  integrity of each country involved be respected, and the rights  and interests of its minorities be protected, he said.    Though far away from Europe, China sincerely hopes that  Europe attains peace and stability, Li said.    Peterle expressed his appreciation for this stance of the  Chinese side, adding that Slovenia also hopes for a just and  fair solution to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.    During the meeting, Li extended a welcome to Peterle on his  first visit to China.    Li also recalled his meeting with Slovenian Prime Minister  J.  Drnovsek while attending the world environment and development  conference in 1992. He asked Peterle to convey his best wishes  to his Slovenian counterpart.    The Chinese premier invited Drnovsek to visit China within  the year. Peterle said that Drnovsek is looking forward to that  visit.    Peterle told Li that he was pleased to be here and his talks  with Chinese officials have been satisfactory.    He voiced the belief that the bilateral relations will be  enhanced in the future.    Later in the afternoon, Chen Muhua, vice-chairperson of the  Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress,  met with Peterle and his party.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Optimism on new Aids therapy: Glaxo decides against licensing anti-HIV drug to Wellcome A combination of two Aids drugs, Glaxo's new 3TC and Wellcome's established AZT, has the strongest and most prolonged clinical effect of any treatment yet tested. First results of clinical trials with the 3TC-AZT combination, which were released at an international congress on Aids therapy in Glasgow yesterday, show the drugs cut virus levels in blood cells by 99 per cent after a year. This compares with an 11 per cent reduction over six months using AZT alone. The results are so encouraging that Glaxo has decided to continue developing 3TC itself rather than licensing it to Wellcome. The two UK pharmaceutical companies had announced in March a provisional agreement giving Wellcome the option to develop and market 3TC as a treatment for HIV infection, the virus that causes Aids. But negotiations to implement the agreement have collapsed because Glaxo now sees 3TC as a more promising potential product. 'Glaxo is fully committed to the development and eventual marketing of 3TC and will proceed to bring it through the regulatory process as quickly as possible,' the company said yesterday. It plans to file for regulatory approval in the first half of 1995 to sell 3TC in combination with AZT. The two companies are continuing discussions on commercial co-operation over 3TC/AZT combination therapy. The Glasgow conference heard results from two trials of 3TC/AZT involving a total of 352 patients infected with HIV. As well as producing the drastic reduction in the levels of virus, the combination was far more effective than AZT in improving patients' CD4 cell counts, which measure the damage done to the immune system by the infection. 'The results of AZT/3TC in combination are better than any of the combinations which have been tried to date,' said Dr Schlomo Staszewski of Goethe University Clinic in Frankfurt, Germany, who led one study. 'These data are extremely significant not only for their effectiveness in reducing virus and increasing CD4 cell levels but also because the effects persisted throughout the year-long study,' added Prof Christine Katlama of the Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, the other study leader. 'It is also important to note that the combination was very well tolerated by patients.' Longer clinical trials will be necessary to confirm that the 3TC-AZT combination actually improves the health and extends the life of people with HIV. First evidence from test-tube experiments that 3TC plus AZT could be effective in combating the disease emerged publicly at the World Aids Conference in Japan in August this year. Combinations work better than single drugs in fighting HIV, because it is more difficult for the virus to develop resistance to two or more chemicals at once.</p>

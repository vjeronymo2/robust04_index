			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Survey of North Oxfordshire (6): Farmers threaten exodus - Agriculture MOVES to cut European Community aid to Britain's farmers could lead to an exodus from the land, prompting a serious decline in rural areas such as North Oxfordshire, according to the National Farmers' Union (NFU). Farmers in the region complain they have already been hit hard by the recession and warn that the EC's so-called MacSharry II package of agricultural reforms, involving large cuts in the prices paid for milk, cereals and beef, could drive many of them out of business. After several months of falling or static producer prices in agriculture, the reforms planned by Brussels have added to the farmers' gloom. In North Oxfordshire the prognosis has been made worse because it has a high concentration of the most vulnerable farming sectors: small dairy holdings, beef farms and mixed pigs and poultry. The region's ironstone soil, meanwhile, is not fertile enough to support industrial-scale cereal farming and the undulating geography is too steep for the latest machinery used in crop production. Mr Nicholas Turner, chairman of the NFU branch in Banbury, is pessimistic about farming prospects. 'In North Oxfordshire we don't do anything very well. We don't have big fertile fields like East Anglia and, unlike the hill farms of Wales, we don't qualify for aid as a disadvantaged area. 'The land won't give you fantastic yields and yet our production costs for machinery and fertilisers are higher.' In a bid to cut costs, many farmers in the area have decided to share machinery, land and buildings. But these measures have pushed up rural unemployment and led to a wholesale contraction in the farming community. 'We've come to the stage where people cannot tighten their belts any further,' warns Mr Turner. 'If Mr MacSharry's reform plans go through, many of our members will abandon farming.' These NFU members are disillusioned with European quotas, agreed under the Common Agricultural Policy, which limit the amount of produce they can sell. Dairy farmers claim they have suffered most under the production ceilings and many have switched to beef farming. Livestock should be a profitable sector for the region, which boasts ideal free-draining grassland among the 48,000 hectares under cultivation. But prices are depressed and cattle-rearing is in danger of becoming uneconomic. Most of North Oxfordshire's beef passes through Banbury market, one of the largest in Europe, where up to 670,000 head of stock are sold each year. Prices, however, are the same or less than they were 10 years ago and Mr Jim Watson, managing director of Midland Marts which runs the market, says the beef trade is heading for a long-term recession. Mr Watson also blames the recession for hampering expansion of the market. 'Banbury has been hit as hard as anywhere else and we have had to make a number of economies. 'Nobody examined their costs as they should have done during the 1980s. We didn't and we've had to cut staff.' The market, however, has been insulated from the worst effects of the agricultural downturn by two developments: the EC's decision not to cut prices paid for sheep, and the opening of the M40 motorway. The market sells more sheep than anything else and has become the main source of slaughter stock for Britain's wholesalers and export customers. At busy times of the year, Banbury's sheep trade has a turnover of more than Pounds 1m a week, with most of the stock being exported to France. 'Sheep sales are doing better than for some years,' says Mr Watson. 'But the same cannot be said for cattle because feeding costs have risen sharply.' The M40, meanwhile, has transformed Banbury's links to London and the south-east. Exporters using the M2 and M25 can now drive from Dover to Banbury without leaving the motorway network. 'It has helped tremendously. We've had more business as a result,' adds Mr Watson. But in the local area, the upturn in sheep sales has not had a major impact. Only 16 of the 614 farms in the Cherwell district are devoted exclusively to sheep, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, while 102 farms rely on less stable dairy and beef incomes. Faced with increasingly fragile profits from traditional sectors, many farmers are diversifying into leisure activities. Mr Turner, a tenant farmer for Trinity College, Oxford, has abandoned dairy production in favour of beef, but he hopes to boost his income further by building a Pounds 50,000 golf driving range. 'More and more farmers are looking at leisure schemes like go-karting and golf courses,' he says. 'There are also a lot of barn conversions as farmers sell off buildings to raise capital.' Farmers who cannot sell buildings because they are tenants or those who do not win planning permission for leisure projects are finding it difficult to survive. They say the problems have been exaggerated because banks are reluctant to extend loan facilities. The prospect of subsidy-cutting EC reforms means many farms face an insecure future, making some of them a bad risk for banks. 'The survival rate of farms is linked to how much they can borrow,' says Mr Turner. 'Farmers are easy targets for banks to constrict, and the banks are making arbitrary decisions on loans.' It is a view that is echoed by Mr Watson at Banbury market. He claims the lenders are 'turning the screw on farmers when they should be helping them'. Complaints over banking policy and the effect of European reforms are expected to be aired again tonight, when farmers meet for the NFU's monthly meeting at the Old School and Manor Hotel in Bloxham. Mr Turner has no doubt who is to blame for the problems. 'We are all suffering because the CAP has failed. It was supposed to give farmers a standard of living equal to industrial counterparts. But farm incomes have declined 14 per cent in the past year. 'The European commissioners are not doing their job. Maybe we should go to Brussels and shake them up a bit.'</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Knocked about but unbowed: Israel's economy is healthy - yet growth depends on the peace process Peace-making in the Middle East was always going to be a stop-go affair. So it is not surprising Israel's economy is being knocked about in its wake. At the start of this year, economic liberalisation, a flood of well-educated immigrants from the former Soviet Union and rising hopes of peace were leading to fast economic growth, rapid technological advance, surging exports and an investment boom that saw the value of securities quoted on the Tel Aviv stock exchange rise from about Dollars 8bn to Dollars 50bn between 1989 and 1993. A very different, and grimly familiar, picture of Israel has dominated the world's headlines since the end of February, when Mr Baruch Goldstein, a fanatical Jewish settler, massacred 29 Palestinians worshipping in a Hebron mosque. The Hebron killings and the authorities' heavy-handed treatment of the occupied territories jeopardised the peace process and did nothing for Israel's image abroad. At the same time, the investigation of alleged insider dealing and share price manipulation on the Tel Aviv stock exchange alarmed domestic investors and helped push the index of 100 leading shares down by nearly a quarter from its mid-January peak of 259. In the space of three months, the mood swung from viewing Israel as possibly the world's next hot growth prospect to just another emerging market economy where the speculative bubble had burst. But though there are still many risks - not the least, the threat of extremists on either side again knocking the peace process off course - the Israeli economy has underlying strengths. Those could become more apparent if efforts towards an overall Middle East settlement, involving Syria, Lebanon and Jordan, as well as the Palestinians, are maintained. Israel at the weekend began to withdraw and redeploy troops in the occupied territories in preparation for Palestinian self-rule and the arrival of the first contingent of Palestinian policeman; it follows last week's agreement between the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organisation for international observers to be deployed in Hebron, allowing negotiations on Palestinian self-government in Jericho and Gaza to resume. Both sides appear anxious to make up for lost time. The Israeli government is keen that progress on Palestinian self-rule should be followed by economic co-operation. The government's hope is that peace will enable Israel to use its rich human capital and scientific and financial expertise to play a bigger role in a world economy where growth is increasingly knowledge-based. The stock exchange has reacted positively to recent events, with the 100 share index closing yesterday at 210.2, nearly 6 per cent above last month's lows. Confidence among businessmen and government officials is high that growth this year will rise to between 5 and 6 per cent, exceeding last year's 3.6 per cent. And unemployment is expected to decline further after an unexpected fall to 9 per cent in the final quarter of last year from 11.2 per cent in 1992. There appears to be no let-up in the influx of foreign delegations and study missions to examine business opportunities. Even after the Hebron killings, long-term investment funds continued to flow into Israel. The Claridge investment group, in which the Canadian Bronfman family has a big stake, began putting together a Dollars 150m fund for wealthy international investors to put money into Israel shortly before the massacre. According to Mr Jonathan Kolber, Claridge president, the fund was oversubscribed last month. The limited economic fall-out from the Hebron killings indicates investors' earlier enthusiasm for Israel has deeper roots than last year's handshake on the White House lawn between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, and Mr Yasser Arafat, the PLO leader. It testifies to an improvement in the economic fortunes of a country that, in the mid-1980s, was on the brink of hyper-inflation and notorious for over-regulation and socialist policies. A rigorous stabilisation programme brought Israel's annual inflation rate down from 445 per cent in 1984 to less than 20 per cent two years later, preparing the ground for growth. Today Israel, with only 5.4m people, has a gross domestic product of Dollars 65.5bn, dwarfing its neighbours. At about Dollars 12,500, GDP per head is far above the Dollars 1,000 per capita GDP in the occupied territories or Egypt's Dollars 600. To be sure, inflation, at 11.2 per cent last year, was high by western standards. But the Bank of Israel appears on course to hit the government's 8 per cent target this year. The government is cutting taxes for businesses and individuals. It is committed to a programme of privatisation, due to raise about Dollars 1.5bn this year on top of Dollars 1.3bn in 1993. Spending priorities have been shifted to encourage growth: the 1994 budget envisages a 15 per cent expansion in infrastructure spending and a 30 per cent rise in funding for education over 1 1/2 years. Trade unions have lost a lot of power, although this year has seen a damaging strike at Bezeq, the national telecommunications company. Only 30 per cent of annual wage changes are now reached through collective bargaining, against 90 per cent 10 years ago. Building on existing free trade agreements with the US and Europe, Israel is progressively exposing its domestic economy to competition from abroad. At the same time, the state has developed a range of policies to promote research and development that have helped Israel's spending on R&amp;D reach 3 per cent of GDP - more than the US, Japan and other leading industrial countries. Israel tops the world league table for published research in the natural sciences and engineering, with more than 60 papers per 10,000 members of the labour force, against 30 in the US. According to The Lancet, the UK medical journal, Israel produces proportionately more medical research publications than the US or UK. Immigration from Russia, which has boosted the population by 550,000 since 1989, has greatly strengthened Israel's pool of scientists and engineers. That and Israel's heavy investment in education recently prompted Union Bank of Switzerland to predict Israel could become the third most competitive country in the world in the years ahead, after South Korea and China, and ahead of Japan. The combined effect of government policies, immigration and, now, hopes of peace has been an upsurge in entrepreneurship and the mobilisation of capital to finance new businesses. This business renaissance partly explains why industrial exports rose by 18 per cent last year, in spite of recession elsewhere. The other central factor was the improved international climate engendered by the peace process: this helped Israel penetrate new markets in south-east Asia, China and former communist countries. But Israel still has some way to go before it can rank among the world's blue-chip economies. The stock market scandals have reinforced concerns among some foreign investors about a lack of transparency. Mr Alistair Stewart, general manager for Europe, the Middle East and Africa of General Electric, the US industrial giant, warns that Israel will have to improve its business integrity if it is to be a 'hub' economy for the Middle East. Others say it still has the hallmarks of a 'bubble economy' where company and stock market values are too high. Many foreign investors, and some Israeli businessmen, say the government has been too slow to cut taxes and privatise. Others complain that Israel's currency, the shekel, is still not fully convertible. None of these problems is life threatening. Indeed, in the days after Hebron, many Israeli businessmen argued their country could prosper even if the peace process ground to a halt. But there is recognition domestically that Israel will find it impossible to play a full role in the regional and world economies so long as there is no settlement with the Palestinians, or peace with Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. 'We fought five times. The Arabs didn't win the wars. We didn't win the peace,' says Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister. In the drive for peace, economic and security factors are inextricably combined. Many Israelis hope that peace will offer a chance of drawing the fangs of Islamic fundamentalism through trade and investment, and by eventually closing the gap between Israel's prosperity and the low GDP per head of neighbouring Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Israel, Mr Peres argues, cannot stay prosperous in a sea of poverty - 'otherwise waves of bitterness will lap over our small island'. It is a view shared by business leaders, who say they are ready to make sacrifices in the form of trade concessions to former enemies to achieve this goal. 'We want satisfied, well-fed neighbours with higher living standards and less violence,' says Mr Dan Gillerman, chairman of the Federation of Israeli chambers of commerce. Mr Dan Propper, head of the Israeli manufacturers association, puts it more bluntly: 'No one wants a new Iran next to us.'</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Italian Elections: Zeffirelli writes himself into the Italian political scenario - Andrew Hill has lunch with the great director who is standing in Catania, Sicily, for Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia On the eve of Italy's most important general election since 1948, Mr Franco Zeffirelli, film director and would-be senator of the Italian republic, took lunch on the slopes of Mount Etna with members of his entourage and three of his eight Jack Russell terriers. For a man known for opulent and often controversial stage and cinema productions, it was a suitably lofty viewpoint from which to survey his constituency - Catania, a city of decaying splendour on the east coast of Sicily. But this is not the image which Franco Zeffirelli the candidate has sought to promote, during an arduous campaign for Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia. Indeed, since the media magnate asked Mr Zeffirelli to scendere in campo (take to the field) for his new party, the film director has done just that, leaving what he calls the 'glass prison' of show business and talking to people in the streets. 'I think I'm a much better man for it,' he said in an interview with the FT at the weekend. Catania is a difficult constituency, not least because of the traditional apathy of the electorate in southern Italy, where the turnout is always lower than in the north. Yesterday, Palm Sunday, there was more activity in Catania's churches than in its polling stations, and Sicilian television reported a much lower turnout than in 1992 - although this time all Italians have a full two days in which to vote. More specifically, the city suffers from a disintegrating infrastructure, and is struggling to shake off a reputation as centre for one of the most powerful Mafia 'families', whose head, Mr Nitto Santapaola, was arrested last year. A constant theme of the last days of the election campaign was the question of how the Mafia will vote, with Mr Berlusconi severely criticised by his opponents for not clearly rejecting the support of Cosa Nostra. Meanwhile, his business lieutenants have been forced to deny allegations by former gang members that Mafia-inspired arson attacks on his new Standa supermarkets in Catania and Palermo in 1990 and 1991 only stopped after pay-offs to the local clans. Mr Zeffirelli has stepped into this delicate situation as an outsider, albeit one who knows and loves Sicily. His roots are in Florence, and he was also mooted as a Forza Italia candidate for Rome or Venice. But he chose Sicily because he wanted to dispel some of the myths about the island - in particular, its association with the Mafia in the minds of most foreigners - and reassure Sicilians that they, too, are part of the new Italy. 'It isn't the country of 'The Godfather' for god's sake: it's a country of wonderfully creative and beautiful people who want to do the best with their lives,' he complains. He says that, if elected, he would try to restrict himself to certain specific areas of policy, notably helping disabled people and drug addicts, and to resurrecting the cultural life of Italy from what he sees as 50 years of communist-inspired neglect. 'I'm not a baby,' says Mr Zeffirelli, who is 70. 'I want to see things happen now.' Indeed, had he started in politics 20 years ago, and devoted himself to it, one could imagine Franco Zeffirelli as a campaigning minister of culture along the lines of the late Melina Mercouri in Greece, an example he himself cites. Mr Zeffirelli calls it a national disgrace that Italy has no culture ministry, but at the same time rules himself out as a candidate for such a post. As it is, he is not clear how he would reconcile his parliamentary duties with forthcoming directorial commitments, which include film productions of 'Jane Eyre' this summer, and a life of opera star Maria Callas, which he should start filming next winter. What is clear is Mr Zeffirelli's commitment to Forza Italia as a strong alternative to the former communists and socialists in the opposing Progressive Alliance. As part of his campaign, the director has been distributing a lapel badge with a picture of Zeffirelli looking genial and relaxed. His aides call it 'The Smile', but behind it is an unsynthetic anger about the way in which the left has recycled itself for this election. 'The old nomenklatura are absolutely awful: they just don't deserve to survive,' he says, in one of his milder attacks. Mr Zeffirelli is certainly not uncomfortable about the pact between Forza Italia and the far-right National Alliance, particularly important in the south. Indeed, the director says he is 'disgusted' by the description of the National Alliance as a neo-fascist party, and describes Mr Gianfranco Fini, the Alliance's politically adept leader, as 'the greatest statesman we have'. As for international criticism of Forza Italia, Mr Zeffirelli - used to criticism of the artistic kind - draws a parallel between the new Italian republic promised by Mr Berlusconi and his allies, and the first Florentine republic set up in the 14th century. 'They (the Florentines) were surrounded by emperors, popes, dukes and counts, all of whom looked at Florence with fear - and they did all they could to make it fall.' He leaves a dramatic pause and then adds, with that smile: 'They finally managed to bring it down - but it took 200 years.'</p>

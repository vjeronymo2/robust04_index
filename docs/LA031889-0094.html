			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Oil Prices Soar: Oil futures prices rocketed past the $20-a-barrel mark as the  momentum that began building on Monday swept the market higher for the fifth  consecutive day. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the April contract for  West Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark grade of U.S. oil, leaped 49 cents  to a 19-month high of $20.33 a barrel in moderate trading. It was the highest  level since Aug. 14, 1987, when crude prices were $20.57 a barrel, and capped a  weeklong rally during which prices rose $1.83 a barrel from last Friday's close  of $18.50.  </P></p>

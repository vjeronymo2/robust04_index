			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN COOKING IS A GROUP EFFORT;  </P> <P> LEISURE: COOKING CLUBS CAN PROVIDE A WAY TO EAT WELL WHILE SHARPENING CULINARY  SKILLS.  </P> <P> Cooking clubs are as varied as the dishes their members prepare. If you're  interested in forming one with friends or neighbors, here are some tips to make  sure many cooks in the kitchen don't spoil the broth:  </P> <P>  -- Organize the cooking to accomplish particular goals. If you just want to  eat well, assign each guest a dish or course to bring; the host can prepare one  course or only be responsible for the setup, cleanup and beverages. If the goal  is to share expertise and to learn new techniques, cook as a group, assigning  each person a task. That way, everyone will learn how to make the dish, and no  single member will be burdened with too much work. Cooking together renders  failures more acceptable and less threatening, provides more opportunity to  learn from each other and analyze the procedures, and is generally more fun.  </P> <P>  -- Settle ahead on a budget and the method for sharing expenses (usually  adding up everyone's bills and dividing equally). Avoid buying ingredients that  are expensive when the recipe calls for only a small proportion of the package  -- a tablespoon of Madeira wine, for example. If no member has a bottle of  Madeira from which to donate a tablespoon, substitute with another flavoring or  split up the leftover wine among members.  </P> <P>  -- In planning the menu, consider the dinner as a whole. Including several  heavy, rich or complicated dishes may start as a challenge but finish as an  invitation to indigestion. Consider a theme, perhaps ethnic or seasonal. Select  dishes that use techniques you would like to practice, such as souffles,  poached or steamed fish, or puff pastry.  </P> <P>  -- Choose recipes carefully. They should suit taste, be worth the effort, not  take longer or cost more than you are willing to spend and fit the rest of the  menu. If you are tackling difficult recipes that are unfamiliar, choose from  sources -- such as the cookbooks of Julia Child or Madeleine Kamman -- that  include a lot of instruction and tips with the recipe. Keep in mind that some  recipes won't work, and chalk them up to education.  </P> <P>  -- Select dishes that can be prepared in the allotted time with plenty of  leeway for missteps. If preparing dishes that take more than two hours, assign  some do-ahead steps (such as stock-making) to members. Have food to nibble and  beverages available for the cooks while they work, or prepare a quick hors  d'oeuvre at the beginning.  </P> <P>  -- If it is necessary to buy dishes and glasses for a large group, check  restaurant-supply houses before you consider disposables or buy at retail  stores. A case of wine glasses or gilt-rimmed plates might cost less than three  dinners' worth of disposables.  </P> <P>  -- Decide cleanup division ahead of time. Everyone might stay to the bitter  end, or you might compensate the host with less work or expense in return for  doing the cleanup.  </P> <P>  -- Agree ahead of time whether children are going to be included in the  cooking and the dining. Set guidelines for their supervision so a parent is not  expected to chase after a toddler while cooking the crepes.  </P> <P>  -- A cooking club should be cooperative rather than competitive. Find out what  each member would like to learn to do and what each does particularly well and  could teach the others.  </P> <P>  -- Above all, don't tackle too much, whether it's too many dishes or too  complex a meal. Fun should be calculated into the formula.  </P></p>

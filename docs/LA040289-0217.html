			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA CANYON  </P> <P> The residents of 890 acres in Laguna Canyon and the city of Laguna Beach have  cooperatively agreed upon the desire for official connection through  annexation. The only stumbling block is the Local Agency Formation Commission's  sudden condition with respect to imposing, as a term of annexation approval, a  requirement by the city to collect transportation corridor fees.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach has long been on record as opposing the San Joaquin Hills Tollway  Corridor. To require this condition asks residents to compromise their  principles in a most serious way.  </P> <P> The condition is thoroughly unreasonable and unethical. In fact, I find the  imposed condition devious, deplorable and a wretched example of the misuse of  political power by an official government agency that is supposed to serve the  welfare of unincorporated residents.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, LAFCO meets to determine the fate of Laguna Canyon residents. In  light of The Times' recent disclosures of gift-getting politicians, I wonder if  we can hope for any impartiality with respect to decisions that ultimately  affect us. Is it too much to hope for a meticulously honest outcome to the  Laguna Canyon annexation issue?  </P> <P> SHAREN HEATH  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITY SUES EX-PLANNER ON CONFLICT ALLEGATIONS;  </P> <P> LITIGATION: ORANGE CITY COUNCIL SEEKS TO RECOVER MORE THAN $100,000 FROM FORMER  COMMISSIONER DON GREEK AND HIS ENGINEERING COMPANIES. HE IS SUING TOO.  </P> <P> The City Council has filed a conflict-of-interest lawsuit against former  Planning Commissioner Don Greek, seeking to recover at least $104,000 paid to  his engineering firms while he was a public official.  </P> <P> Greek used his position to influence other members of the Planning Commission,  Planning Department, city staff and City Council members "for the purpose of  benefiting his own personal and financial interests," according to the lawsuit.  </P> <P> The city filed the suit last week in Orange County Superior Court, five weeks  after voting unanimously to seek repayment of money paid to DGA Consultants  Inc. and Don Greek and Associates. Greek had been warned in writing by  Assistant City Atty. Gene Minshew that the contracts could be a conflict of  interest.  </P> <P> "I really don't have any comment except that (the city is) following through  with the procedure and we will be vindicated in the end," Greek said Tuesday.  "I am optimistic that we will prevail."  </P> <P> Greek has filed a $20-million claim against the city, paving the way for a  defamation lawsuit. Greek was a planning commissioner from 1983 until his  resignation in August to run for City Council. He lost in the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> Council members voted unanimously to sue after the district attorney's office  disclosed that it was investigating conflict of interest allegations against  Greek.  </P> <P> "The bottom line here is that as elected representatives of the people, we have  a reputation to take a stand in regard to ethical behavior and potential  conflict of interest," Councilman William G. Steiner said.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office is trying to determine if Greek has violated  State Government Code 1090, a felony punishable by a fine of $1,000 and up to  three years in prison.  </P> <P> The code states that state, county and city employees and officers "shall not  be financially interested in any contract made by them in their official  capacity or by any body or board of which they are members. . . . "  </P> <P> Since the contracts date back to 1986, the statute of limitations could have an  effect. The statute for criminal prosecution of a conflict of interest  violation is within "three years of discovery of the offense or within three  years of when it reasonably should have been discovered," Deputy Dist. Atty.  John Conley said.  </P> <P> The city will argue that the statute of limitations should cover at least four  years, which would include the Sandpiper School contract, a $20,000 agreement  awarded in 1986 just 12 days after Greek received a conflict-of-interest  warning from Minshew, according to Leo B. Newton of the law firm of Corrado  &amp; Newton, special counsel to the city.  </P> <P> Conley said he is also investigating whether Greek may have violated  conflict-of-interest provisions of the Political Reform Act, an misdemeanor  offense. Conley noted that his investigation is still weeks from completion  because he is seeking additional city documents, including minutes from  Planning Commission meetings.  </P> <P> According to the city's lawsuit, Greek was acting in his official capacity as a  planning commissioner when the city awarded his firms seven contracts ranging  from about $1,400 to $58,000.  </P> <P> Among the contracts outlined in the suit is one in which the city claims that  Don Greek and Associates appears to have solicited city staff members to win a  project. In a 1987 letter to city recreation superintendent Richard Kollen,  firm partner John Cuervo proposed a $23,500 plan to provide preliminary  engineering and design work for the relocation of a building.  </P></p>

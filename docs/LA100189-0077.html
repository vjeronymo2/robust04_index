Selleck II, as  president and owned by Selleck's father, Robert D., who is a principal.  </P> <P> The ground breaking also drew Lancaster business and civic leaders, led by  Mayor Lynn Harrison, who hailed the project's promise of offering a "wide  assortment of goods and services."  </P> <P> Robert D.

All but one of these changes to the Board's application and notice review procedures were implemented by the Board at that time. Most of these changes involved revising certain internal procedures of the Federal Reserve System (System), to improve the efficiency of processing applications that are reviewed by the Board in conjunction with the Reserve Banks and to reduce the regulatory burden associated with these application and notice procedures. Two of the changes_eliminating the stock redemption notice requirement for ``well-capitalized'' bank holding companies, and modifying the Board's delegation rules pertaining to competition and market concentration_necessitate amendments to certain provisions of, respectively, the Board's Regulation Y and Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  May 4, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Terence F.

These changes included establishing certain procedures to limit extension of the pre-acceptance period for applications; offering prospective applicants the opportunity to submit a pre-filing notice of intent to file an application; eliminating the stock redemption notice requirement for bank holding companies that are and, following the redemption would remain, ``well-capitalized'' on a consolidated basis and in generally satisfactory condition; expanding the authority of Reserve Banks to process all delegable applications without Board staff review; modifying the Board's delegation rules pertaining to competition and market concentration; reducing redundant post-acceptance processing of Board action cases; increasing the monitoring of cases requiring extended processing; and establishing a general consent procedure under section 24A of the Federal Reserve Act for investments by state member banks in bank premises.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In publishing notice of these changes, the Board also invited comment on any additional measures to eliminate or reduce burden associated with the Board's notice and application procedures.

For the purposes of this section, ``net consideration'' is the gross consideration paid by the company for all of its equity securities purchased or redeemed during the period minus the gross consideration received for all of its equity securities sold during the period other than as part of a new issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Board determined to eliminate this notice requirement for bank holding companies that are and, following the redemption or purchase, would remain ``well-capitalized'' on a consolidated basis and in generally satisfactory condition.

If a party submits an application or notice to the System pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act, Change in Bank Control Act, Bank Merger Act, or the Bank Service Corporation Act, the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority (12 CFR 265.1&hyph;265.11), permit the appropriate Reserve Bank to act on such application or notice unless certain circumstances are present. Specifically,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;265.11(c)(11)(v) of the Board's Rules provide that a Reserve Bank is not authorized to approve the following transactions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) With respect to BHC formations, bank acquisitions or mergers, the proposed transaction involves two or more banking organizations:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) That upon consummation of the proposal, would control over 30 percent of total deposits in banking offices in the relevant geographic market, or would result in an increase of at least 200 points in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) in a highly concentrated market (a market with a post-merger HHI of at least 1800); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Where divestitures designed to address any substantive anticompetitive effects are not effected on or before consummation of the proposed transaction[.]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board determined to revise its Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority to increase the resulting market share criterion that would require Board consideration of a bank merger or acquisition from 30 percent to 35 percent. In particular, the Reserve Banks may now act on applications involving two or more banking organizations that, upon consummation of the proposed transaction, would control 35 percent or less of total deposits in banking offices in the relevant geographic market. This change would also reflect the Board's practice, in computing market share, of weighing deposits of thrifts in the subject market at 50 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of this change to the Board's Rules Regarding Delegation of Authority, the Board also determined to eliminate the need for Board approval of applications involving divestitures designed to address anticompetitive effects, which divestitures are not completed on or before consummation of the proposed transaction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As a result, the Federal Reserve Banks may now act on applications involving proposed divestitures to address competitive concerns, provided the divestitures are undertaken in accordance with the Board's position on the timing of divestitures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See 57 FR 39641 (September 1, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> id.; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  see also BankAmerica Corporation, 78 Federal Reserve Bulletin 338, 340 n.15 (1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

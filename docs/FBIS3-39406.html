			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Albert Chernyshev, Russia's </F> ambassador to Turkey, by NOKTA correspondent Tulay Cetingulec in  Ankara; date not given--punctuation as published]    [Excerpts] [NOKTA] You have been in Turkey for seven years  and you will return to your country as the deputy foreign  minister in March. You have been described as a "lustful"  person and an "agent." Can you describe how you feel as you  prepare to leave Turkey?    [Chernyshev] I told myself when I arrived in Turkey that I  was "a man first, then a politician and diplomat." I still feel  the same. My lengthy stay is described in Russia as a  "forgotten mission." But I have become very familiar with  Ankara. Relations between Turkey and Russia have always been  favorable, despite the reports that have been published in  various newspapers. Of course, I have been troubled by the  reports that were published against me. Such is the fate of  diplomats. My new appointment is a promotion. I will visit  Turkey frequently because my field of study is the Black Sea,  Caucasus, Central Asia, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and  India. [passage omitted]    [NOKTA] Russia has moved to redeploy the troops it withdrew  from the independent republics. Moscow recently decided to  dispatch troops to Georgia and establish bases there. Does  Russia wish to reestablish its former strength in the region?    [Chernyshev] True, we withdrew our military forces from the  republics in the Caucasus some time ago. Of course, we did not  withdraw them all. The disintegration of the former Soviet  Union left those republics without military forces. They do not  have their own armies right now. Their security problems must  be solved. Agreements have been reached with those republics at  their request. Turkey has similar agreements with the United  States. In accordance with those agreements and on the basis of  the consent of the CIS republics, the Russian border guards have  assumed the responsibility of guarding their borders in Central  Asia. That must not be seen as an imposition by Russia. The  countries concerned will meet Russia's expenses one way or  another at some point. That means guarding borders will not be  free. The repayment may not be in the form of cash. It may be  in the form of particular convenient measures. Several  newspapers have claimed that Russia's approach is aimed against  Turkey and other countries. That is not true. Russia's  military units have not been deployed for an offensive purpose.  Russia will maintain a symbolic presence of 23,000 troops in the  Caucasus.    [NOKTA] You said in a statement two years ago that "you are  afraid of the pan-Turkic ideology." Do you still fear that  ideology? Isn't the pan-Slavic ideology a threat?    [Chernyshev] Aggressive nationalist and separatist trends  existed in the past. Unfortunately, they still exist now. The  pan-Slavic, pan-Arab, and pan-Turkic ideologies, including  fundamentalism, remain. Placing these extreme trends under  control is very important. We have a common understanding with  Turkey on that. We are prepared to cooperate to struggle  against extreme trends.    [NOKTA] Can you comment on Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's approach?    [Chernyshev] As far as the pan-Slavic, pan-Russian, and  pan-Nazi trends are concerned, Zhirinovskiy can be regarded as  an example. His statements conflict with our official foreign  policy. They have nothing in common. His views are not binding  on Russia. But they will be considered. As far as politics are  concerned, Zhirinovskiy has no horizon or perspective. He has  gained popularity because of the problems created by reforms.  Compared with the work the political parties carried out to  explain the differences among them during the election campaign  in Russia, Zhirinovskiy's campaign was very rudimentary. While  waiting for a miracle amid the difficulties at the time, the  people voted for that primitive [ilkel] man. But he has only 64  of the 450 seats in parliament. Zhirinovskiy's party has no  serious officials. Literally speaking, he is a one-man show.    [NOKTA] Reports say he will visit Turkey soon. What does he  expect to achieve through his visit? He has said Russia has a  dangerous weapon that is more effective than a nuclear bomb. Is  that true?    [Chernyshev] Does such a weapon exist in the world? No,  Russia has no such weapon. Zhirinovskiy is just talking.  That's all. Not only has he spoken against Turkey, but against  several other countries. This has harmed Russia's relations  abroad. I have no information on his visit to Turkey. But I  believe we should also work with him. We must understand him.  He sometimes says he "loves Turkey." But he also says he is  "opposed to Turkey." You have similar officials in Turkey. But  I talk to officials like him.    [NOKTA] Can you comment on the common interests between  Turkey and Russia and on where things clash?    [Chernyshev] Turkey has agreed that Russia has long-standing  and wide-ranging interests in its relations with the CIS and the  republics in Central Asia in the political, economic, and  cultural fields. Russia has agreed that Turkey has gradually  increasing interests in the region. No clash between the  interests of Turkey and Russia can be allowed to take place.  Any inclination by either country to move the other out of the  region will be obstructed.    [NOKTA] Foreign Minister Kozyrev has said that the clashes  in  the Balkan region and the tension created by religious  differences may kindle a third world war. And a difference of  opinion exists between Turkey and Russia on Bosnia.    [Chernyshev] We have condemned the massacre in Bosnia. No  national war based on religious differences is being fought in  that country. The fighting has been caused by the mistakes of  the past. Extremist elements must be blamed for the war.  Everyone wants to be independent. But they all lived together  in the past. I agree that the sides did not enjoy equal rights.  The Bosnians are of Serbian origin. But they adopted the  Islamic faith 500 years ago. Most of them were atheists under  communist rule. Basically, we are Orthodox people. But you  should ask who follows the Orthodox faith in Moscow? The people  would not know. It is an artificial separation. Independence is  very costly for the peoples. Independence without funds and  resources will create problems. How will the minorities exist?  Independence is very costly.    [NOKTA] Should the concept be abandoned?    [Chernyshev] What should be considered first is the issue of  territorial integrity. That should be followed by minority and  human rights. There will be upheaval if everyone wants to  become independent. A third world war may break out. A serious  threat exists. The issue of the independence of Bosnia and  Karabakh may cause upheaval in the world. So a threat exists.    [NOKTA] There was upheaval in the former Soviet Union. Has  that threat been warded off?    [Chernyshev] The disintegration of the Soviet Union was a  serious mistake. Everyone is suffering now. An effort is being  made to correct that mistake. Please forgive me for saying that  only stupid people like us are clamoring for "independence."  But I have no use for such an independence. The most important  thing is to learn to live together. That is difficult to  achieve. Such independence may be a concept in principle but it  should not apply in practice.</p>

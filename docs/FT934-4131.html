			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Query over missile treaty The US is asking Russia to agree to a new interpretation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to allow it to test and deploy a theatre missile defensive system without contravening the ban on defences against strategic missiles. US officials insisted that they were seeking to 'remove a long-standing ambiguity', not to change the treaty or to adopt the broad interpretations of the Reagan and Bush administrations, which claimed that the ABM treaty allowed the deployment of space-based missile defences. 'Our intention is to make clear the distinction between theatre missile defence not limited by the treaty and strategic defences that are limited,' the State Department said. While defences such as the Patriot system, used against Scud missiles during the Gulf war, are allowed by the treaty, defences that could inter-cept faster medium-range missiles could fall under the prohibition on national defences. The 1972 ABM treaty was intended to curb the arms race between the US and the Soviet Union. Many arms control specialists remain firmly opposed to any tinkering with the treaty. If the clarifications sought by the Clinton administration were to count as changes to the treaty, it might prove difficult to persuade the Senate to ratify the revised treaty.</p>

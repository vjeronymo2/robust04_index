			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sa'ib 'Urayqat, chief Palestinian negotiator </F> to the Washington talks, in Tunis, by unidentified  correspondent, in the studio, on 27 February -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, in Tunis; good  evening.    ['Urayqat] Good evening to you.    [Correspondent] The government today decided to set up a  state commission of inquiry on the tragic incident that took  place in Hebron. A decision was also made ordering restrictions  on the movement of Kakh activists and the release of around  1,000 detainees. How do you react?    ['Urayqat] The decisions fall short of what the Israeli  Government is required to do, especially given that it is aware  of of the expectations of the Palestinian leadership. It must  be made absolutely clear that negotiations cannot possibly  continue for their own sake. Any negotiations in which the  settlements do not figure as the first item on their agenda will  be pointless. We had expected the Israeli Government to choose  between peace and settlements. We had hoped the Israeli  Government would order the complete disarming of the settlers,  announce its acceptance of the idea of international protection  for the Palestinians and a disbandment of the settlements in  Gaza as a fist step. These resolutions are procedural and do  not bear on the core of an issue that is closely bound up with  the peace process.    [Correspondent] This evening, the Palestinian leadership is  engaged in consultations following the tragic incident,  especially as it may affect the peace negotiations. How does  the Palestinian leadership plan to proceed on that score?    ['Urayqat] As I have said, the negotiations are not an end  in themselves. Negotiations are to bring peace. The Israeli  Government will have to choose between peace and settlements,  since the two cannot go together; they are mutually exclusive.    The issue is far more serious than the Israeli or U.S.  Administrations seem to think. The United States has ignored  the core issue and focused on procedures like moving the talks  to another site. Our opinion has been communicated to the U.S.  Administration and the Israeli Government. The failure of the  Israeli Government to make meaningful decisions does not bode  well for the future.    [Correspondent] When do you think the PLO will decide its  next move on the peace process?    ['Urayqat] I cannot say when. All I can tell you is that at  2000 today the meetings will begin, with the participation of  PLO Executive Committee members. All are now here, as are the  heads of other negotiating teams.    [Correspondent] Do you think the Palestinian-Israeli talks  will stop?    ['Urayqat] The talks are already at a standstill. As you  know, the Washington talks were supposed to go on until next  Wednesday. As I have said, negotiations are not held for their  own sake. The next move is now up to Rabin and the Israeli  Government. They will have to choose between peace and  settlements.    [Correspondent] Am I to take it, then, that the PLO wants to  reopen the Oslo file?    ['Urayqat] Call it what you will. We are talking about an  issue that has a direct bearing on our efforts to achieve peace.  We are negotiating for peace. We have said time and again that  settlements are a time bomb that may go off at any minute. One  exploded on Friday. We cannot tell what will happen tomorrow,  or the day after, or next month. The Israeli Government and the  international community have a major responsibility on their  hands -- the settlements and international protection for the  Palestinian people. Again, negotiations in which the  settlements do not figure as the first item on their agenda will  be meaningless.</p>

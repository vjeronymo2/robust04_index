			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Strong second half for Atkins Atkins Group, the Leicester-shire-based textile manufacturer, returned to profits in the second half resulting in a pre-tax figure of Pounds 157,000 for the year to March 31, against Pounds 243,000 last time. Second half profits increased from Pounds 51,000 to Pounds 205,000. However, there were extraordinary charges of Pounds 242,000 (Pounds 302,000), relating to provisions on a property sale and an aborted acquisition, resulting in a retained loss of Pounds 368,000 (Pounds 416,000) after paying the dividend. The shares fell 4p to 116p. Mr David Haggett, chairman, said: 'Our latest figures start to demonstrate the benefits of the actions taken over the past year.' He added that the present half would reflect the seasonality of the business but garment and hosiery prospects were healthier. Gearing had been cut over the year from 38 per cent to 34 per cent. The intention to sell property had been affected by the depressed market but Mr Haggett said there had been increased interest. The value of the properties had been reduced by Pounds 225,000. Turnover amounted to Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 16.5m). Earnings per share came out at 3.81p (5.25p). A final dividend of 4p makes a total for the year of 7.6p (9.6p).</p>

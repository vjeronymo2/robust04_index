			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No evidence of need for London council Sir, Would international business be more likely to come to London, and, that already here, stay if the capital had an elected council for the whole of the built-up area grounded in the English system of local government? The study London Factor ('London's image at risk, says report', June 16) argues precisely that. The report says financial service companies feel London is drifting aimlessly in the absence of such a council, and is destined to lose out to other cities. I framed and did the interviewing for the study, but feel obliged to dissociate myself from this interpretation. Businesses with a high clerical component reduce operations in London because costs and managerial complexities are too great - things a London-wide council would not mitigate. Foreign banks that leave do so because London is over-banked. International companies remaining have seen London become more important recently to global business strategies revised in the wake of the worldwide recession; but costs and potential returns will loom ever larger in future in their locational decisions and may lead some to move business away. A London-wide council would have little impact on either factor. Those interviewed felt London's standing specifically vis-a-vis Europe would on the whole not be significantly reduced by financial centres and a central bank developing on the mainland - though again, some work would inevitably move that became more suited to a European location. Problems mentioned by businesses interviewed - manpower, training, transport, regulations - could be noticeably reduced through higher quality decision-making and administration in existing local, central, and institutional governments. None raised would appear to be better addressed through a new local authority for Greater London. It is important - unquestionably - to sustain London's image and its unique status among world metropolises. Special, and highly flexible, arrangements have to be found to bring real strategic thinking regularly to bear on big issues. Systems of city-wide government elsewhere, and continual failure in London's past to orchestrate land-use planning successfully as between housing transport and jobs, show us what to avoid, not what to repeat. A London-wide local authority has been superimposed on the London Factor study. I fear it does not emerge from the evidence. Graham M Lomas, 49 Smithamdowns Road, Purley, Surrey CR8 4NJ</p>

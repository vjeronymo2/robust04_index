			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Moscow denial on plutonium A quantity of weapons grade plutonium found on a Lufthansa flight to Munich from Moscow last week threatened yesterday to provoke a serious row between Germany and Russia. Moscow denied the plutonium was Russian, saying an inventory of all its sources had discovered no loss or theft. German experts said analysis could pinpoint the point of manufacture in Russia. According to Munich police couriers detained arriving from Moscow had been carrying 300-350 grammes of plutonium 239  - a few millionths of a gramme of which will kill - in a lead-lined steel case. It was the third seizure in four months of weapons-grade material from the former Soviet bloc. A spokesman from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party, claimed yesterday there had been 267 cases of smuggling of radioactive material since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.</p>

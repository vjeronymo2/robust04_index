			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Condon expects compromise on police reform proposals SIGNS of possible compromise on police reform emerged yesterday when Mr Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police commissioner, said he was 'confident' that some of the recommendations of the Sheehy report would not be implemented. Mr Condon, Britain's most senior police officer, said he expected consultations during the next two months to produce changes on pay and conditions which would be in the public interest and fair to police officers. The comments of the commissioner, who has frequent contact with Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, reflect a growing feeling among police chiefs that the government will be prepared to dilute or abandon some of the more far-reaching aspects of the Sheehy report. The report, drawn up by Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, recommends fixed-term contracts, performance-related pay, the abolition of three ranks and changes to starting rates, overtime and pension arrangements. Mr Condon, speaking at the publication of the Metropolitan Police annual report, said the police service had to be modernised, and he believed it was already at the forefront of change in the public sector. Much of the analysis by Sir Patrick and his committee was good. But the recommendations for constables and sergeants were flawed and not in the public interest. He identified recommendations for short-term contracts, a Pounds 2,000 a year reduction in starting salaries and pension changes as proposals that would undermine rank-and-file officers. The police, Mr Condon said, faced an unsettling time and he did not want them to spend the next two years worrying about pay and conditions. 'The sooner we can get settled down with a sensible package the better.' Mr Howard, who is holding talks on the Sheehy proposals until September, is almost certain to press ahead with fixed-term contracts for senior officers. But chief constables argue the committee's proposal to put all ranks on 10-year contracts could discourage high-quality recruits from joining the police. Many senior officers are reconciled to the introduction of performance-related pay, but regard the Sheehy report's proposed approach as too mechanistic. The Metropolitan Police report showed crime in the capital relatively static, with 944,200 offences reported. There was a small, 1 per cent fall in burglaries - the first for five years.

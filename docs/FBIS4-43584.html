			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Guest commentary by Economic Minister Marianne Jelved </F> (Radical Liberal): "Jelved Predicts 60,000 Fewer People Out of  Work in a Year and a Half"]    [Text] The government's estimate is supported by both  domestic and foreign economic analysts -- and that may be the  reason for Anders Fogh Rasmussen's frustration. His use of such  strident terms as "statistical chicanery" and "touched-up  figures" speaks for itself. He and the Liberal Party ought to  look ahead.    Anders Fogh Rasmussen is desperately trying to talk away the  economic upturn that is in progress.    In an recent article in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE, he gave a fresh  example of his numerical exercises with the aim of showing that  the forthcoming drop in unemployment is not "real."    At the same time he makes a big thing out of the fact that  the latest unemployment figures, for February, show an increase  compared with January.    It is evident from, among other things, the comments from  the  Danish Bureau of Statistics on the February unemployment figures  that the increase is presumably due to transition problems with  the labor market reform. The other current indicators of  economic development confirm that an upturn is in progress. Thus  the newly released national economic figures for the fourth  quarter of 1993 show a big growth in production, and employment  in the private sector (seasonally adjusted) has started to rise.  Therefore there is absolutely no reason to believe that the  government's current estimate of an unemployment decline of  20,000 in 1994 and another 25,000 in 1995 will not prove valid.  This would mean that over 60,000 fewer people will be unemployed  at the end of 1995 compared with today.    The government's estimate is also increasingly supported by  other economic analysts, both at home and abroad. But that may  really be the most important reason for Rasmussen's frustration.    In addition Rasmussen airs his well-known views on  "statistical chicanery" and "touched-up figures."    The strident language speaks for itself. It is difficult in  a  short article to take a stand on the numerical acrobatics. I  will not weary the reader with this. And all the figures behind  the government's estimate have been laid out fully and openly in  the "Economic Digest." But I would like to make two comments.    The first is that Rasmussen has suddenly started to include  1993 in his calculations.    It is unfair to use the large drop in employment and the  sharp rise in unemployment last year as a yardstick for  evaluating the government's policy. The most important measures  -- the tax and labor market reform and increased public  investments -- did not have an impact until the beginning of  this year.    Instead of concentrating on the past, Rasmussen should look  ahead -- that is the Liberal Party slogan, after all -- and  comment on the estimate for 1995 when the effects of the  government's economic policy achieve their full impact in the  form of a continued drop in unemployment, a sharp rise in  employment in the private sector, and a substantial improvement  of public budgets.    My second comment is that Rasmussen has made a factual  error.  He alleges that the government's current employment estimate  includes people who are on leave from work under the new system.    As I have explained in answering a long list of questions  from the Folketing Political-Economic Affairs Committee, this is  just not correct. Rasmussen should have known this from his  frequent use of the "Economic Digest."    In general Rasmussen's insinuating tone is ill placed. Of  course the Economic Ministry uses internationally approved  methods when it adds up employment and unemployment. And the  methods are the same as those used by previous governments.    Rasmussen must feel hard-pressed when he resorts to this  kind  of "argument."</p>

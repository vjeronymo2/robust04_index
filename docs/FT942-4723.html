			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Coal boost fuels Leigh rise Improved profits from coal extraction and lower interest charges helped Leigh Interests, the waste management group, increase pre-tax profits by 4 per cent to Pounds 9.9m last year on a similar rise in sales to Pounds 113.2m. The profit rise is the first since 1991, when recession began to hit the operations in the south of England. It was fuelled by a Pounds 1m rise in operating profits to Pounds 2.3m in the coal extraction business - the result of the need to dig holes for landfill. Profits were also helped by an 18 per cent fall to Pounds 3.4m in interest charges. The final dividend is held for the third year at 5.37p, for an unchanged total of 7.83p. Earnings were 5 per cent ahead at 10.8p. Mr Arthur Kent, finance director, said cover would have to be rebuilt before the dividend could be increased. This meant profits would have to recover to 1991's peak of Pounds 14.8m. The cautious policy arises in a year which saw competition and over-capacity in the liquid waste sector hit the group. Volumes fell by 5 per cent while average prices for treated waste dropped 3 per cent. This trend continued and was also beginning to hit incinerated waste. Mr Kent said Leigh was tackling the problem by extending its waste treatment processes and cutting costs. About Pounds 1m had been cut from on-going costs, he said. Exceptional charges of Pounds 700,000 were taken for redundancies and reorganisation. Offsetting the bad news on liquid waste, Mr Kent said Leigh was confident the marginal improvement in landfill prices would continue. Leigh said its financial position was secure, as it had agreed a Pounds 45m revolving credit facility with a banking consortium. Net debt fell from Pounds 50m to Pounds 48m, representing 69 per cent of shareholders' funds. COMMENT Leigh was one of the first in its sector to feel the bite of recession, but shows no signs of being an early recovery play. The coal businesses is doing better, largely because Leigh is extracting from its own sites rather than British Coal's, but there are no plans for pushing this forward. The waste business now appears to hang on the long-promised draft EU directive forbidding the disposal of liquid waste with solid. When that becomes fact is anyone's guess. Forecasts are for Pounds 11.5m, for a prospective p/e of 17. This might appear somewhat over-valued, at least until another bid rumour comes along.</p>

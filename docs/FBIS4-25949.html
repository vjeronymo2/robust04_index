			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 15 (XINHUA) -- China's publication of  the "Delhi Declaration" demonstrates the Chinese Government's  determination to basically popularize nine-year compulsory  education and eliminate illiteracy among middle-aged and young  people by 2000.    This is also a part of carrying out international promises,  a  spokesman from China's State Education Commission told XINHUA  here today.    On December 16 last year, Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing  attended the nine-nation education-for-all summit in New Delhi  and signed the declaration together with the leaders and  representatives from the other eight countries, Bangladesh,  Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia, India, Mexico, Nigeria and Pakistan.    China published the "Delhi Declaration" today.    In the Delhi Declaration, the leaders of these nine highly  populated developing countries reaffirmed their commitment to  meeting the basic learning needs of all their people by making  primary education universal.    The spokesman said that the publication of the declaration  in  China would promote the reform and development of the nation's  education agenda.</p>

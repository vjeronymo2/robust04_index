			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- "The federal Democratic Russia  Party is farther apart from the authorities than the Russia's  Choice party. Politically, the Democratic Russia Party is  closer to the centre than the Russia's Choice," co-chairman of  the Democratic Russia movement Lev Ponomarev, whose idea it was  to set up a new party, told ITAR-TASS.    According to Ponomarev, the party, which is now being set up  by Yegor Gaydar, i.e. the Russia's Choice party, would most  likely be a bourgeois-type organisation, while the Democratic  Russia Party regards itself as a "right-wing social-democratic  party in the Western sense of the term", and will "contribute to  the social adaptation of the population to the ongoing reforms",  will combat bureaucracy.    Ponomarev explained that the Democratic Russia Party was "in  a way a party of the opposition". It is in opposition to the  government, especially to the local authorities in the  provinces, but not to the president, whom the party still  regards as the "locomotive of reforms". "We dare oppose the  authorities to a greater extent than the Russia's Choice party.  We have not signed the social concord agreement, while Gaydar  did it," Ponomarev stated.    "The Democratic Russia Party relies on the backing of the  same social groups as the Russia's Choice, that is the  intellectuals, small and medium-size businessmen, and it will  inevitably compete with Gaydar's party for influence on these  sections of the population," Ponomarev noted. "As to the already  existing organisational foundation of the Democratic Russia  movement, Ponomarev said that it had split between the two new  parties. In some places most of the members of the movement's  regional organisations had joined the Russia's Choice party (for  instance, in Archangel), but in most of the regions they decided  to join the Democratic Russia Party. He said that in Moscow the  membership of the Democratic Russia movement had split between  the two parties almost equally.    Ponomarev believes that in spite of all their current  differences, the democrats were obliged to nominate one common  candidate to the post of president during the future elections.  "We do not plan to nominate our own candidate. We shall do  everything we can to have one common candidate from all the  democratic forces," he stressed.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / World Trade News: Nafta tremors shake Canadians A LABOUR dispute at an Ontario factory owned by Nestle, the Swiss food and beverage group, has underlined the pressures on Canadian manufacturers and their workers to adjust to a more competitive trading environment in north America. Nestle locked out 220 union members at the factory near Ottawa after they refused to agree to more flexible working hours. The factory's main products are instant coffee and Quik flavoured powders. Lower tariffs under the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement have helped boost the plant's exports to 70 per cent of output. However, Nestle has excess instant-coffee capacity in its US and Canadian plants and is seeking to rationalise production. Workers at its two US factories have accepted the arrangements being resisted by the Canadians. Nestle also has a coffee plant in Mexico. Production is geared entirely to the domestic market for the time being, with exports discouraged by customs duties in the US and Canada. However, tariffs between all three countries will be phased out if the North American Free Trade Agreement comes into force as scheduled next January.</p>

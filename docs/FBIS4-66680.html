			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Prabhash Joshi: "Who is Afraid of Kanshi Ram?"] </F>   [Text] The muck that Mayavati slung around did not stick  despite the Holi festival. There just was no question of its  sticking on Gandhi. However, even Kanshi Ram could not  understand what happened to this muck that was flung around  after a lot of planning. Now he is going around telling people  that if the BSP government is formed, he will remove the  Rashtrapita [Father of the Nation] title used for Gandhi. If  Kanshi Ram does not know, we must tell him, that calling Gandhi  Rashtrapita has nothing to do with any government. No Congress  government has given this title to Gandhi. There is no law which  says that Gandhi should be known as the Rashtrapita. In the  constitution written by Baba Saheb Ambedkar, there is no article  about "Rashtrapita."    There is a position of president in the Constitution. The  Sangh family people who consider it inappropriate to call Gandhi  the Rashtrapita should ask themselves why should the nation  called India have a "pati" [husband] when it does not have a  "pita" [father]? Similarly, is the army a woman that it should  have a pati? I know that "pati" in "senapati"[military  commander] does not mean husband. However, the "pita" in  rashtrapita does not imply a father, either. Neither the Sangh  family nor Kanshi Ram is doing any favor to poor Bapu [father]  Gandhi. Neither the Congress Party nor the Congress government  made him the father of the nation. It was Subhash Chandra Bose  who first called him the father of the nation, and just like  Ambedekar, he disagreed with Mr. Gandhi on several issues. Many  people admit that Bose was not treated fairly similar to the  treatment of Ambedekar.    It is popular practice to call Gandhi the father of the  nation and this appellation materialized during our independence  struggle. As long as the people respect him, it does not matter  whether there is a BSP government or a BJP [government]. They  may have a huge majority in the Parliament but this image just  cannot be removed from people's minds. No government can remove  popular beliefs by issuing edicts. Even dictators like Hitler  and Mussolini could not change the people. Autocratic communist  governments could not make such changes. The power of the  government is limited when dealing with the populace.    If Kanshi Ram cannot understand this truth about human  society, it is not just because like Mayavati, he is a political  illiterate (as Chandra Shekhar put it). Kanshi Ram and Mayavati  both consider themselves representatives of the lower castes.  They distort history while speaking the language and cliches of  the people around them. That is why the talks of Manyavar  [respected one] (as Mayavati calls him) are saidto be some kind  of epigram language in the Hindi-speaking areas. One epigram  popular around here is, "The new mullah [Muslim priest] chants  Allah-Allah all the time." We do not have to explain it since no  one can understand it. The 'Respected One', Kanshi Ram, is the  newest mullah in the government. He is a junior partner in  Mulayam Singh's minority government in Uttar Pradesh. However,  he is crying "power" as if he is a political Allah.    However, this is not the only proverb that fits him. There  is  another axiom that the Hindi region has for people like him. I  know that people will say that I am using this proverb because  of my Brahmanic arrogant mentality. Let them say that. However,  just like there is no proof that the word 'Harijan' was coined  by Mahatma Gandhi, there is no proof that this proverb was  originated by a Brahman or the Brahman caste. You all know this  proverb and it is popular in different regions in different  formats: If a mouse finds a rag, it considers itself a cloth  merchant. In some places, they say: If a mouse finds a rag, it  considers itself a king.    Now, there are at least 25 states in India that is Bharat.  Uttar Pradesh is one of these states. It is the largest state if  you consider population, however, it is still only one of 25  states. Its vidhan sabha has 421 seats and there were elections  for these 421 seats last November. The Bahujan Samaj Party which  supposedly represents bahujans (the masses) won only 68 seats  out of the total of 421 seats. It had this success only because  it ran for elections in cooperation with Mulayam Singh Yadav's  Samajwadi Party. Manyavar Kanshi Ram's BSP could not even win  one-sixth of the total U.P. Vidhan Sabha seats. If we count all  the seats in state vidhan sabhas in the nation, these 68 seats  looklike a small rag cut out of the huge bolt of cloth. However,  Kanshi Ram is using these seats to announce that his party will  form governments in several states during the next two years,  and the BSP will form the government at the Center [national  government] after the '96 election.    We do not have to go very far [for proof]. BJP [Bharatiya  Janata Party] claimed that a larger number of people  participated in the Rama temple campaign than in the  independence struggle and considered itself to be the only  representative of Hindus who constitute 82 percent of the  nation. BJP had established its governments in four  states--Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and  Himachal--in December 1992. It also had 119 seats in the  Parliament. Its Rama disciples did not care for anyone else and  destroyed the Babri Masjid while celebrating a "Hindu victory  day." The BJP was fully confident that the injustice done to the  one of the holiest Hindu shrine was vindicated, therefore, the  whole Hindu world would be ecstatic and the BJP would win any  election from there on. Its slogan during the election held a  year later was, "Now five states, tomorrow the whole nation."  What did the Hindus of these five states do to the BJP? We do  not need to tell you that.    Compared to Manyavar Kanshi Ram's BSP getting 68 seats,  right  here in Uttar Pradesh the BJP won 2.75 times more seats during  this very election! If we look at the percentage of votes, the  BJP received six times more votes than did the BSP. Kanshi Ram  calls his BSP the party of the masses because if the scheduled  castes and tribes, backward castes, and Dalits are combined, his  party would have the majority of people in this country behind  it. The BJP arithmetic was much simpler that this. It did not  have to combine several castes. More than 82 percent people in  this country are Hindus. There is only one party of the  Hindus--BJP. Hindutva [Hinduness] is its only philosophy. Kanshi  Ram considers the higher castes separate from himself while the  BJP considers all Hindus to be one. If we use Kanshi Ram's  reasoning, the BJP should have the right to form the government  all over India permanently since the Hindus have the majority  vote in India.    That fact that the Hindus in the nation are not with the BJP  was proved not only during the November elections but during all  the elections that were held in the past. How can we accept  Kanshi Ram's claim that the Dalits, semi-Dalits, and all  backward castes are with him? In any society, the majority never  works together, however, the minorities have the tendency to  unite in every part of the world. Jinnah had claimed that the  Muslims in the whole country were with him and his Muslim League  was the only party representing the Muslims. Only the English  who wanted to divided India into several countries endorsed  Jinnah's claim. The minority Muslims in India did not accept  that. When Pakistan was established, and even now, there were  and are more Muslims in India than in Pakistan. No one has  forced them to live in India. Most of the Muslims in undivided  India preferred to stay in secular India rather that going to  Islamic Pakistan. What better example can there be to show the  hollowness of the claims made by the sole representatives of a  caste or religious group?    Kanshi Ram, who has the rag of 68 seats and is in the  government for a short time, is challenging everyone in the  nation on behalf of the BSP. If he does not understand the  reality of BJP, we will present him with the example of Devi  Lal. Devi Lal had won 86 of the 90 seats in the Haryana vidhan  sabha. At that time, he was considered the most powerful leader  using caste as an issue. He not only considered himself the  leader of the Jats in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and  Rajasthan, but also wanted to become the leader of farmers all  over the country. The BJP was confident that all Hindus were  with it. If they were not, they were going to be. Kanshi Ram  believes that all Dalits and semi-Dalits are with him. Since the  Hindus and the Dalits and semi-Dalits are the majority, both the  BJP and the BSP claim that they can form a government over the  whole nation.    Devi Lal also had the same confidence in the majority. He  knew, and said openly, that there are no Jats [farming caste]  south of the Vindhya mountains. Therefore, he considered himself  the leader of the majority because he was a farmer and not  because of the power he got as leader of the Jats. He said that  farmers were all over the country and, therefore, farmers were  the majority in an agricultural nation. If all farmers united,  he would be ruling the whole country. Devi Lal wanted to rule  the nation as the leader of the farmers. He used to openly  ridicule the Indian Farmers Union. His simple argument was that  a union is formed by a weak and minority group to fight against  the powerful majority. What need did the farmers have to form a  union? They have the majority in the nation, and votes.    Devi Lal wanted to form the government of farmers just like  Kanshi Ram wants the government of Dalits. Devi Lal ridiculed  the farmers union because he believed that the farmers made up  the majority in the nation, and they should form the government.  The rest of the people should be at their mercy. Similarly,  Kanshi Ram ridicules reservation quotas. The majority in the  nation are the Dalits and they should have the government. When  they form the government, the minority Brahmans, Kshatariyas,  and other castes will have reserved quotas. Devi Lal believed  that all the problems the farmers have will be resolved once  they have their own government. Therefore, he asked the farmers  to unite and help him form the government with their votes.  Kanshi Ram also says that if the Dalits win the government, all  their problems will be resolved. Thus, he is going around  telling the Dalits that he will help them form their own  government. Just like providing government to the farmers meant  Devi Lal being in the government himself, Dalits being in the  government means Kanshi Ram being in the government.    When being in power becomes the means and end to one's  being,  then the result usually is what happened when Devi Lal took  power or what happened to Indira Gandhi and the country when she  became all powerful in the government. The same is happening to  Laloo Prasad Yadav in Bihar. Kanshi does not appear to  understand that Devi Lal had a broader and more powerful support  base, however, he used it to gain a powerful position in the  government for himself. How is Devi Lal doing now and what  happened to Indira Gandhi? Whichever leader tells the people  that his or her becoming the head of the government is the  panacea for their ills, is only looking for power for him or  herself. Such leaders do not help the people. Instead, just like  Bhasmasur [a mythological character] they destroy themselves.  What happened to Devi Lal will happen to Kanshi Ram soon. You  will see!    I am saying this not just because when the goal is only to  gain power and position, it is self-destructive. The other  reason is that the government of religious groups or a  narrow-minded government of small factions just can not succeed  in this country. Only a government with popular support can be  stable. A government based on confrontation and dissension  collapses like a sand castle in no time. The Marxists said,  "Laborers of India, unite! You have nothing to lose except your  chains." The Indian workers never united to form a government.  The farmers were later told to unite and make a government. The  farmers have not yet formed their government. The farmers and  the laborers were asked to unite and make their own government.  They neither united nor did they form a government of their own.    Later, in the seventies, all non-Congress parties succeeded  in forming their own government. It did not last two and a half  years. After 12 years, a government representing the lower and  middle castes was formed. It did not last even one year. Then,  they tried to unite the people over religion to form a  government. By inciting caste-related memories and religious  emotions, they created a paralyzing atmosphere. Even religion  could not provide stability to the leaders in the government.  Now Kanshi Ram is pitting the Dalits, backward castes, and  minorities against the high caste people and other exploiters in  order to win himself a government position. He is having various  castes fighting with each other at different places. He has only  68 seats and is just a junior partner in the government. He has  no clout in any other state or the Parliament. What will happen  to him in the next election? Now, he is stating; You will see us  in 10 states next year and at the Center the year after that!    We have many or rather innumerable castes. None of these  castes is spread through the whole nation. Those castes that are  in every region are not equally powerful in these regions. Any  caste that is powerful in one state could be very weak in  another. A caste could be able to rule in one place and could be  just a server in another. Neither Brahmans nor Rajputs ever  ruled the whole nation. Not only have middle and backward castes  ruled at one time, but even aborigine groups like Gond, Bhil,  Bhilale, Muiya and Santals have also ruled. A caste, a coalition  of castes, groups or an organized group cannot rule the whole  nation. Those who know their religion and know the caste system  of their society did not try to rule the whole nation in the  name of religion or caste. If a religion or caste did gain  power, however, their government was stable because they  cooperated with other religions and castes and had a broad  social base for supporting their government. The country has  functioned well by the cooperation of opposing forces and not by  creating tension and confrontations among groups.    When Chandra Shekhar said that many politically illiterate  people like Mayavati have emerged, he did not mean that these  upstarts have read neither Gandhi nor Ambedekar. He means that  these people do not understand the government of this country or  the disposition and character of the social, economic, and moral  bases that give it stability. One can seize power for the sake  of gaining power, however, one cannot maintain it without giving  cohesion to the broad political, social, economic, and moral  missions. Kanshi Ram does not have such a broad mission. The  pathetic man thinks that he will get into government by having  the lower castes fight with the so-called high castes. He will  have the Indian society bathe in the blood of caste friction.  The political parties are not exposing his deceitful ploys  because they are afraid of losing Dalit votes. Who is afraid of  Kanshi Ram? Only those who have become shallow because of their  involvement in corruption. A small rag does not a cloth market  fill. What happens when one keeps repeating Allah, Allah? If you  do not know, go ask Kabir [poet who ridiculed dogmatism].</p>

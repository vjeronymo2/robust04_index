			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A CLUTCH of poor economic data led to hopes of a cut in interest rates which drove stock index futures sharply forward, writes Joel Kibazo. Having opened at 2,764, the March contract on the FT-SE was sold down to 2,753 within the first half-an-hour of the opening. However, bargain hunting helped the contract recover and it was trading at 2,765 by 11.30am when the economic statistics, particularly the poor jobless figures, led to speculation that the UK government would soon be forced to reduce interest rates. The talk led to greater momentum for March as the gilts and short sterling also put in a good performance and the day's high of 2,790 was reached just before the close. March finished at 2,788, up 29 from the previous session and about 6 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash of around 8. Volume was 8,482 lots. Dealers said March continued to move forward in after-hours' trading. Turnover in traded options improved for a second day, reaching 34,917 lots. Around a third of the total was composed of trades in index options, with 11,880 contracts recorded in the FT-SE 100 option and 965 lots in the Euro FT-SE 100 Index option. British Airways was the busiest stock option with a total of 2,652 lots dealt and was followed by Ladbrokes with 2,078 contracts. Hillsdown, British Aerospace and Asda were also active.</p>

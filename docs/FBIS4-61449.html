			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahkilskyy </F> at UNIAN in Kiev on 5 May]    [Text] Kiev -- At a news conference at UNIAN on 5 May,  Acting Prime Minister Yefim Zvyahilskyy answered questions from  that news agency's journalists and representatives of other mass  media.    [UNIAN] With your support, the approved 1994 budget does not  contain a deficit. The National Bank of Ukraine estimates that  the deficit in the first quarter of this year came to over eight  trillion [karbovantsi] against the background of the whole of  last year's deficit of 9.5 trillion. Are you still in favor of  the idea of a budget without a deficit? If not, how soon can we  expect emission [emisiya] as a source of deficit elimination and  of what size?    [Zvyahilskyy] To have a budget without a deficit is an  aspiration of every state. I backed the no-deficit budget in  the first quarter in order to see whether it would be possible  to lose money gradually. Given the complex economic situation,  a way out is strict control over the budget's revenue and  expenditure. The policy of a no-deficit budget, in my view, is  justifiable. However, we noted in the Law on the Budget that we  would make corrections as the result of each quarter. This is  what we are doing. I think that an analysis of the first  quarter's results will be ready by 20 May and will be submitted  for consideration by the Supreme Council on 20-25 May. I am  convinced there will be no emission in the near future.    [UNIAN] Subduing hyperinflation is considered to be your  greatest achievement. Is not a 38 percent slump in production  in the first quarter too high a price to pay for this?    [Zvyahilskyy] That depends on how you look at the production  slump. From the standpoint of the generation of electricity on  Ukraine, for instance, the slump in that sphere's production is  18 percent.    I cannot trust statistics. There is an instruction and we  are in the process of making an in-depth analysis. Considering  the list of other items, there is a 1- to 3-percent increase in  certain articles. It can also be said today that our steel  workers are gradually raising the volume of production too,  which could be accounted for by the fact that many enterprises  have been demanding larger quotas and licences on top of the  state contract or state order, to reequip themselves  technologically, using proceeds from the goods sold. Analyzing  the data on the rate of production growth in metallurgy in March  compared with February 1994, the figures are follows: The  extraction of iron ore rose by 3.8 percent, the production of  cast iron by half a percent, steel by six percent and steel pipe  by 2.3 percent. True, though: Ready rolled metal was down 2.8  percent. You are right in saying that there is a production  decline in machine building, etc. However, the production of  foodstuffs was also up.    [UNIAN correspondent] Ukraine's legislation guarantees the  repatriation of profit for foreign investors. In practice,  however, where can investors who have set up production in  Ukraine and are earning karbovantsi, repatriate their income?  When will the work of the currency exchange resume?    [Zvyahilskyy] I have instructed our professionals to work  out  that issue and find ways of settling it. There are many  options, but what is most important now is to find one  acceptable and beneficial both for Ukraine and the investors  themselves. We are working on this problem and I think it will  be resolved in the very near future.    I would like to emphasize that the work of the Ukrainian  Interbank Currency Exchange [UICE] was only halted rather than  having been closed down. But should there be an attempt to  resume the activity of the UICE forcibly, I shall resign. I  believe that the work of the currency exchange at the  transitional period of crisis is only good for a small number of  individuals, but detrimental to millions of ordinary people.    [UNIAN] Of what will financial and credit support for  enterprises, to be provided according to the resolution "On  Urgent Measures To Overcome the Payments Crisis and Normalize  the Work of Enterprises" signed by you on 4 May, consist?    [Zvyahilskyy] The government will only be granting financial  and credit support to the enterprises that produce competitive  goods and have a sales market (Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers,  in Yefim Zvyahilskyy's words, has already gathered the  information required from ministries and departments, in order  to identify those enterprises), whereas the enterprises that do  have a sales market will only be able to receive money having a  realistic clear-up and production realignment program.    [UNIAN] Has the concept of a future monetary reform been  developed? What will it be like, a parallel or confiscatory one?    [Zvyahilskyy] A new banknote factory has been commissioned  in Ukraine. The money is very good. We can print an unlimited  amount of it and also some for other countries. As for the  reform, a working group has been set up and there will by all  means be the introduction of the hryvnya. The issue of banning  the circulation of foreign currency in Ukraine, which does not  apply to the Ukrainian karbovanets, is also under  consideration. This move will not be to everyone's liking but  it would be justifiable. This is one of the elements of hryvnya  introduction.    [UNIAN] You said on the eve of the elections to the Supreme  Council: "The government officials that stood and failed to get  elected, have to resign from civil service". Does it mean now  that over twenty highly qualified bureaucrats have to go?    [Zvyahilskyy] This is a matter of personal conscience and  depends on the officials themselves. When Labor Minister  Mykhaylo Kaskevych, a professional I greatly respect, came and  wrote a letter of resignation, I could do nothing but endorse  it. Others, however, have not yet written anything... Although  I have told Economy Minister Roman Shpek about a few of his  deputies who failed to reach parliament, no pressure can be  applied to those people. This, I repeat, is a matter of their  conscience.    [UNIAN] In connection with various reports of your  participation -- and that of your relatives -- in  entrepreneurial structures, are you and your relatives now  prepared to fill in a declaration of incomes? What is in your  way?    [Zvyahilskyy] I filled in such a declaration when I decided  to stand for a member of the new parliament. As Yefim  Zvyahilskyy, I have taken part in no commercial structure. Nor  am I taking part in them. I shall fill in the declaration, when  need be. The participation of the Zasyadko mine in Donetsk,  where I was director, in the institution of the first Ukrainian  international bank, cannot be regarded as personal commercial  activity.    [UNIAN] There is an ever-increasing amount of talk about  wider-ranging regional economic independence. Where do you think  is the boundary the regions cannot be allowed to overstep? What  are the main differences on the development of the Crimean  Peninsula you and Crimean Vice Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov  have?    [Zvyahilskyy] On my initiative, I met Yevgeniy Saburov on 4  May. First of all, I asked Saburov whether he could see Crimea  within Ukraine. The vice prime minister said: "So, and only so."  Afterwards, there began negotiations, with the agriculture,  economy, and external economic relations ministers taking part  in them. In the course of the conversation, I voiced the  opinion that Crimean presidential decrees in many respects  contradicted the Constitution of Ukraine and that working in  this manner was, of course, no longer possible. The Crimean  side, in its turn, expressed understanding that one could have  done without decrees in settling many issues.    Yevgeniy Saburov also acknowledged the reasonability of  arguments by the chairman of the board of the National Bank  [NBU], Viktor Yushchenko. I also emphasized: "A state can only  have one national bank." The only thing that I guaranteed for  the Crimeans, was transferring financial aid from any state by a  purposive allocation to Crimea without delay: The money that  will be received by the NBU, will in an hour's time be  transferred to Crimea down to the cent." We reached  understanding that actions by the Crimean Government should not  affect the interests of Ukraine. We agreed on a meeting between  Ukraine's Government delegation and the Crimean president on 7  May. It is not worthwhile to stage confrontation. It is better  to lend assistance to Crimea in resolving its problems. My  opinion is that the decision only to provide Ukrainian language  textbooks for Crimean schools is ill-considered.    [UNIAN] What is your attitude towards the Black Sea Fleet  issue?    [Zvyahilskyy] The government is preparing specific proposals  on this issue. This problem cannot be left unresolved, which is  why all options are being made ready, including the possibility  of rent. A preliminary accord has been reached on a meeting in  the very near future with the head of Russia's government,  Viktor Chernomyrdin, to work out all contentious issues on the  Black Sea Fleet.    Yefim Zvyahilskyy then answered questions from  representatives of other mass media. Answering the question  whether Ukraine would accept IMF conditions for the receipt of  credits, Yefim Zvyahilskyy said he would not agree to the  condition of cancelling the fixed currency exchange rate. "We,  by all means, shall come to this but it will not happen in 1994.  The thing is that once we free the rate, we shall have all  prices for food, housing, gas, and electricity rising  several-fold. We then will have to raise wages and pensions  without, however, having the money for this in the budget. This  is exactly why this road cannot be taken or the economy will  crumble."    As for the question on the attitude towards dividing powers  between the president and the prime minister and his personal  preferences for any presidential candidate, Yefim Zvyahilskyy  declined to answer. "I am an industrialist and a businessman. I  am not aware of politics although, of course, I know what is  what in it." He also spoke in favor of a professional  parliament and pointed out that the Cabinet of Ministers would  be formed. As for his personal future, he said he cold not  envisage any tragedy for himself. "I shall be a rank and file  people's deputy," he said. "However, if the president deems it  necessary for me to remain in the Cabinet of Ministers, I shall  remain," Yefim Zvyahilskyy told the UNIAN correspondent.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs 25% profit expansion CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest building society which has grown much faster than the rest of the industry since 1985, defied the recession yet again last year by raising its pre-tax profits by 25 per cent. The society's 1991 results, to be announced on Thursday, will show that pre-tax profits passed Pounds 180m, up from Pounds 144.7m in 1990. This was achieved despite sharply increased losses on bad loans. These rose from Pounds 17m to over Pounds 100m, but more than Pounds 60m of them came from the small Pounds 800m-assets Portsmouth Building Society, which C&amp;G absorbed in a rescue operation early last year. Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, will point out on Thursday that C&amp;G has effectively doubled its total assets in just two years to over Pounds 14bn. The increase has come partly from a series of aggressive mergers in which C&amp;G has absorbed smaller societies, but also from organic growth of its core businesses. Unlike most other top ten building societies, C&amp;G has not diversified into new banking activities, and concentrates on its traditional saving and mortgage loan businesses for upmarket customers. It is the only one of the fifteen largest societies which does not offer its customers the use of cash machines. As a result, its costs are among the lowest for the entire banking sector at under 27 per cent of its income. It is now vying with Leeds Permanent for the fifth place by asset size in the building society industry.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WITH PEACE BREAKING OUT, SOLDIERS PONDER GETTING OUT;  </P> <P> MILITARY: MOST SERVICE PERSONNEL ARE STAYING PUT. BUT MANY SEE BIG CUTBACKS ON  THE HORIZON AND ARE CONSIDERING MAKING THE LEAP BACK TO CIVILIAN LIFE.  </P> <P> Bob Thorlakson looked back at 22 years in the Army and ahead to the shrinking  military of the post-Cold War '90s and made a decision.  </P> <P> "I got out. I decided not to wait around for the cuts to hit," he said.  </P> <P> Thorlakson and untold numbers of other men and women in the American armed  forces are trying to make their peace with peace.  </P> <P> Some are leaving. Many more are considering it. Most apparently are hoping to  hold on, unsure whether they will avoid the ax but unwilling just now to give  up the uniform and make the leap back to civilian life.  </P> <P> "You read so much about the cutbacks that are coming down the road," said Lt.  Col. Bill Daniels, who plans to retire this year after he completes his 20th  year in the Air Force.  </P> <P> These private struggles are being played out across the nation and at U.S.  bases abroad as the Bush Administration and Congress scale down defenses in  light of a suddenly receding Soviet military threat. Big force reductions are  coming -- some estimate 300,000 people over four years -- although the crunch  is not likely to hit many military families until next year.  </P> <P> Thorlakson, 45, didn't know when he retired last December if he would have been  forced out by the cutbacks. He held the rank of lieutenant colonel and was  nearly eligible for promotion. But the Army's future -- and thus his own --  looked so murky that he took his chances on a civilian job.  </P> <P> Like many others who had never held a job outside the military, Thorlakson  stumbled at first. He took a job selling family financial services but soon  found it didn't suit him. He quit. Now he is looking for work in personnel  management.  </P> <P> Thorlakson, of suburban Washington, is confident that he will find a good job.  But for many others facing similar decisions, the prospect of change can be  intimidating -- even though it's too early to know how many one-time soldiers  will be competing for civilian jobs.  </P> <P> "They are apprehensive. They don't know what's going on," said Jack Merritt, a  retired Army general who keeps in close contact with servicemen. He is  executive vice president of the Assn. of the United States Army, a champion of  Army causes.  </P> <P> The fear is felt even among those just entering the service.  </P> <P> Merritt spoke recently to ROTC cadets at Norwich University, a military school  in Northfield, Vt.  </P> <P> "That was foremost on their minds: 'Is there a future for me now?'  </P> <P> "My answer is, of course there's a future, but it will be a future for fewer  people," he said.  </P> <P> Pentagon planners are worried too. They've never had to shrink an all-volunteer  force, which now has 2.1 million active-duty personnel. Many careers will be  slowed, many ended. And some will be changed even before they begin. A recent  Pentagon report to Congress said many ROTC students, some of whom signed up as  long as five years ago, will not be allowed to enter active duty. They will  have to serve their required time in the reserves.  </P> <P> Soon, probably starting next year, the pink slips will start coming. The  Pentagon is concerned that this might hurt morale and discourage America's  youth from taking a chance on the military in the future.  </P> <P> In force reductions after World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars,  thousands of draftees were itching to turn in their weapons and get back into  civvies.  </P> <P> "That's not true today," Christopher Jehn, the assistant defense secretary for  force management and personnel, said in an interview. "Everybody in the  military wants to be there, including many who believe they made a career  commitment to the military."  </P> <P> "They've all got contracts with us," Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said  recently. "And so how we treat them is going to have a big impact on our  continued ability to recruit and retain first-class people to serve in the  military."  </P> <P> The problem is most acute in the Army, which plans to cut about 135,000 from  its total force of 770,000 by 1994. And Congress could order more.  </P> <P> Most Army cuts will hit the enlisted ranks but officers also will be dropped.  The Pentagon recently asked Congress for greater authority to fire officers in  grades below lieutenant colonel. It said this would be done only as a last  resort, but added: "The Army's situation is severe enough to warrant such  action," even if more is done to encourage officers and others to quit  voluntarily.  </P> <P> Brig. Gen. Timothy Stroup, the Army's top personnel manager, said one of his  main goals is to prevent former soldiers from feeling that they were unfairly  forced to leave.  </P> <P> "They go back to the hometowns of America . . . to be the fathers and mothers  of the next generation of young men and women that join the military," Stroup  said. "It's important that we have satisfied alumni."  </P> <P> Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed  Services Committee, said: "Memories are long. If we botch the job now in  scaling back military spending, can we depend on an all-volunteer force to come  to our rescue in the future?"  </P> <P> Many in Congress are calling for deeper and swifter reductions than the  Administration has proposed. They know that the quickest path to a "peace  dividend" is to save on troop costs, even though the Defense Department  cautions against a politically inspired rush to retrench. The Pentagon spends  nearly half of its $300-billion-a-year budget on manpower.  </P> <P> The Pentagon said it can reach its goal of shrinking the armed forces by 50,000  people this year with few if any firings. Fewer recruits will be hired to fill  the usual number of vacancies left by retirements, resignations, deaths and  discharges.  </P> <P> Attrition alone won't do the trick in 1991, though, or for the next several  years.  </P> <P> Because the services have not yet resorted to dismissals, the fear of firing is  only beginning to set in.  </P> <P> "When you see those cuts, then you'll see a different attitude among the young  kids with 10 or 12 years of service: 'Where am I going?' they'll wonder," said  Col. Fred Allega, a Marine pilot who is retiring, but not because of the coming  squeeze.  </P> <P> "People are feeling more secure than they should," said Navy Capt. Bruce  Sherman.  </P> <P> Stanley D. Hyman, president of Identify Research Institute, which advises  military people on making the transition to civilian life, said most soldiers  are at least vaguely aware of the painful adjustments they face but are trying  to ignore them.  </P> <P> "It's like they're thinking, 'I know I'm going to the dentist to have all my  teeth pulled, but it's next year. I'm all right now. When it's going to be  tomorrow, I worry.' "  </P> <P> Hyman hears from soldiers around the country. One recent day, while talking  with a visitor at his home in McLean, Va., Hyman got a call from a sailor who  said he was thinking of quitting because his base at Norfolk, Va., would be  cutting back.  </P> <P> "This guy is scared," Hyman said after hanging up.  </P> <P> Signs of increased anxiety among military people are just beginning to appear,  said Hyman, who has been advising service families for more than 20 years. He  predicts that force reductions will take a heavy emotional toll in the next  several years.  </P> <P> "We're going to see more suicides, more family breakups," he said.  </P> <P> Jehn, the Pentagon personnel chief, said he needs Congress' help to make the  force reductions as quickly as required but as painless for people as possible.  </P> <P> The Defense Department is asking for authority to provide severance pay to  enlisted people who get the ax -- something never done before. Under current  law, officers cut after five to 20 years of service are given one month's base  pay for each year of service, up to $30,000. Jehn said enlisted people should  get equal treatment.  </P> <P> Stroup, the Army personnel chief, said the department also needs more latitude  to cut officers.  </P> <P> "We don't want to do that, but we have to reduce the force and you want to keep  your force balanced so you don't have too many senior officers and no junior  officers," he said.  </P> <P> Jehn said the department also is developing an experimental program, in  cooperation with the Labor Department, to help servicemen with 10 to 14 years  of experience adjust to the civilian job market. They will be advised on ways  of searching for a job, conducting themselves in job interviews, and writing  resumes.  </P> <P> "Those kinds of things most of these people aren't going to know," he said.  </P></p>

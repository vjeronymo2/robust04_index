			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Information Minister Michel Samahah has said that  the media law will be passed in the next few weeks. In a  wide-ranging interview with the United Arab Emirates newspaper  AL-KHALIJ, which will appear tomorrow, Samahah discussed the  upcoming regional tour by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, security issues and government concerns in Lebanon,  and various other issues.    Samahah said that Christopher's tour is neither a positive  nor a negative development insofar as negotiations are  concerned. What matters to us, Samahah added, is UN Security  Council Resolution 425, the implementation of which would pave  the way for our wider participation in the general Arab talks  involving Resolutions 242 and 338.    The information minister added that Lebanon will see  Christopher's tour as significant if the latter were to bring  with him something new that calls for direct communication with  the Lebanese Government, such as information concerning  Resolution 425, its mechanism, and the timetable for its  implementation. Otherwise, Lebanon will see nothing new in  Christopher's tour.    Samahah said that once Israel commits itself to withdrawal  beyond the international borders, Lebanon will be ready to  discuss arrangements concerning the withdrawal phase, deployment  of the Lebanese Army, and control of the occupied territories.  The information minister added that the illegitimate presence  in the south will have to withdraw with the Israeli withdrawal.    Concerning the media, Samahah said that the television and  radio law will not be late in coming and is expected to be  passed within the next few weeks. He said that the law will  guarantee freedom of thought and expression and the public's  access to information. In return for which, there are  obligations that the law will address. The media should not be  used to foment sectarian hatred or undermine the unity of  homeland and its national symbols.    Samahah called on the media to return to being the Fourth  Estate. The media, he said, should be free from political and  financial manipulation. [passage omitted]</p>

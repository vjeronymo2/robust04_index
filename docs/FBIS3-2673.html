Granic, in talks with the Bosnian Government in the fourth  day, said the parties could be signing a preliminary agreement  this afternoon on the confederation, which will then be linked  to the Bosnian Serbs to form a two-republic Bosnia-Herzegovina.    However, U.S. officials appeared less optimistic.    "They are still engaged in talks and we are relatively  hopeful there might be something this afternoon," one officials  said.    "They may get there and they may not," he said.    The plan, initiated by the United States, would require  economic ties between the Muslim-Croat federation to the  Croatian Republic, the reason why the Granic was here.    Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton and visiting British  Prime Minister John Major said they would work together "for a  resolution of the crisis" in the Balkan republic where ethnic  war had raged for 22-months, killing tens of thousands of  civilians.    They said a "joint civil planning mission" would be sent to  Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, to help revive the city's basic  facilities.</p>

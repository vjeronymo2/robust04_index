			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter opposed the provision, believing that the provision required transport vehicle operators to implement a regular schedule of stopping and checking on tie downs, regardless of whether there is reason to suspect they are loose (Ex. 5&hyph;35). OSHA has more clearly stated its original intention in the final that the operator must check tie downs whenever there is reason to believe they are loose or the load has shifted. For example, this would occur if an operator can feel the load shift, or knows that the transport vehicle has hit an object or pothole which jarred the load. OSHA believes this work practice is necessary to protect the transport vehicle operator from having an accident due to logs shifting or breaking the tie downs. In addition, this provision is necessary to protect the transport vehicle operator from being hit by shifting or moving trees when he unloads the vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (h)(8) of the final rule requires that each deck of logs be stacked and located so it is stable and provides each employee with enough room to safely move and work in the area. This provision has been adopted from the proposal. The 1978 ANSI logging standard contained a similar requirement. There were no comments opposing this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision combines two different requirements. First, this paragraph requires that decks and piles of logs be constructed so they are stable. OSHA believes that decks must be carefully stacked so logs do not shift, roll or fall off the deck and strike an employee who may be working or passing through the storage area. Second, this paragraph requires that the work activities in the vicinity of the storage are well-planned so enough room is provided for those work activities so that an employee is not harmed if the stacked logs shift, roll or fall. OSHA believes these work practices are necessary to protect employees working in the landing area. According to the WIR survey, 20 percent of injuries reported involved accidents at landing areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (i) Training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In paragraph (i) of the final rule OSHA has specified various training requirements. For several reasons OSHA believes training is a critical element in a integrated control program to reduce the number of accidents, and consequently, the number of fatalities and injuries in the logging industry. First, the logging industry is a high hazard industry. Employees need to be made aware of the various hazards so they can actively participate in making the workplace safe. According to the WIR survey, 10 percent of the workers who reported injuries said that being unaware of the hazard had contributed to their accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, training is also essential in achieving compliance with the substantive requirements of the standard, including the use of personal protective equipment and safe work practices. Without effective training, employees may not be aware of how to perform their job safely or how the integrated controls can reduce injuries and fatalities. Third, training is especially important in complying with the logging standard because the standard relies heavily on safe work practices to prevent accidents from occurring. Employees who are not trained in how to perform their job safely can put themselves and other employees at risk of injury. Various studies of accidents in the logging industry indicate that poor work practices are a major contributing factor (Ex. 2&hyph;1, 4&hyph;3, 4&hyph;14, 4&hyph;15, 4&hyph;61, 4&hyph;63, 4&hyph;121, 4&hyph;125, 4&hyph;129, 4&hyph;138, 4&hyph;172, 5&hyph;20). For example, according to an accident study conducted by one commenter, 40 percent of accidents were due to poor planning, 40 percent were due to poor technique, and 15 to 18 percent were due to carelessness (Ex. 5&hyph;20). Only 2 to 5 percent of the accidents were due to equipment failure. The WIR survey indicated that poor work practices of employees or a co-worker were a contributing factor in more than one-half of all accidents reported (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA's FCI report indicated that unsafe work practices and misjudgments accounted for 42 percent of logging employees who were killed (Ex. 4&hyph;61).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

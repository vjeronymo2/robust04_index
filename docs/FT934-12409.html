			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Smith appoints Quin to key post MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday appointed Ms Joyce Quin, a pro-EC moderate, to the key European affairs job on Labour's front bench. Ms Quin, 49, replaces Mr George Robertson, the highly regarded rightwinger who masterminded Labour's effective parliamentary campaign against the Maastricht treaty. Mr Robertson, 47, who was elected to the shadow cabinet in last week's elections, was promoted to shadow Scottish secretary in an earlier round of appointments. Ms Quin, who was a member of the European parliament for 10 years from 1979, will be expected to exploit the government's continuing difficulties over Europe. Her first challenge will come early in the next session of parliament, when the government must legislate to increase British contributions to the EC. Rightwing Conservative backbenchers are already threatening to block the bill. Ms Quin will also deputise for Mr Jack Cunningham, the shadow foreign secretary, who retained his high-profile job in spite of a lacklustre reputation and a poor performance in the shadow cabinet elections. The full list of appointments, which completes Mr Smith's front bench team, includes four newcomers, and four MPs who served Mr Neil Kinnock, the former leader. The newcomers are Mr Nick Raynsford, who becomes a spokesman on London, Mr Kim Howells (overseas development), Mr Bryan Davies (education), and Mr Adam Ingram, (social security). Mr Ingram was Mr Kinnock's parliamentary private secretary. The MPs returning to the front bench are Mr George Howarth (environmental protection), Mr John Garrett (Citizen's Charter), Mr Kevin Barron (employment), and Mr Donald Anderson (defence).</p>

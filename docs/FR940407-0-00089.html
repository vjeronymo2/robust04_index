			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rules and guidance continue to allow for a variety of approaches to specifying statutory maximum penalties, although exceedance-based approaches are encouraged. Thus, for example, where emission limits are specified in units of mass emissions, statutory maximum penalties can be specified as a function of the degree to which the limits are exceeded, as measured in terms of some increment of mass emissions. Alternatively, statutory maximum penalties could be specified as a function of the cost of credits or allowances in trading programs. The final rules and guidance require that EIP's be structured in conjunction with applicable enforcement authorities, in such a way that violations of multisource and/or multiday emission limits translate into sufficient numbers of some combination of violations, sources in violation, and days of violation. There are no criteria that suggest that this requirement should necessarily be met by considering that the violation occurred at each such source. The final rules further identify supplemental provisions that may enhance deterrence, such as mandatory minimum penalties, or address uncertainties inherent in the design of a program, such as penalty triggers linked to measures of compliance tracked through the program audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following criteria have been established for assessing the adequacy of the deterrent effect of EIP penalty provisions. The primary focus is on an assessment of the adequacy of the statutory maximum penalties in the EIP, through an evaluation of deterrence ratios (i.e., the ratio of the maximum penalty per violation to the cost of compliance). In a program with tradeable emission allowances or ERC's, the cost of compliance will be related to the market value of allowances or credits. Under a range of foreseeable noncompliance circumstances, this deterrence ratio must be high enough to deter noncompliance to a degree comparable to traditional programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other aspects of deterrence should also be considered in evaluating the adequacy of penalty provisions. These aspects include the likelihood that noncompliance will be detected and the credibility and predictability of responses to noncompliance. These aspects should be considered in light of administrative procedures and resources established within the EIP, as well as other program design elements related to emission quantification and monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Interface With Existing Emission Trading Policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EIP rules and guidance, being broadly applicable to any kind of EIP, generally cover the same type of emission trading programs that have historically been addressed by the EPA's previously released guidance on emission trading, primarily contained in the Emissions Trading Policy Statement (ETPS) and its appendices (51 FR 43831, Dec. 4, 1986). Although based upon the same general principles, the EIP rules and guidance provide both greater flexibility and more comprehensive programmatic requirements for such programs. The proposal defined the relationship between the EIP rules and the ETPS such that the provisions of the ETPS which apply to trading between existing sources (i.e., the bubble and generic bubble provisions) would represent one particular model for how States could choose to design such a program that would be approvable under the EIP rules. The proposal, however, in no way constrained EIP's involving emission trading to the specific provisions of the ETPS. The proposal solicited comments on this proposed relationship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only a few commenters addressed this issue. Two commenters agreed with the proposed approach. Another commenter disagreed with retaining the elements of the ETPS that are now addressed by the EIP rules, on the basis that such ETPS provisions are rendered obsolete by the new rules, and the EPA should not encourage the use of less flexible policies. Another commenter recommended that the ETPS should be updated to include the flexibility contained in the EIP rules and that it should then continue to be applied to trading done for the purpose of meeting other statutory requirements (e.g., RACT/non-RACT trading).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rules retain the proposed relationship between the ETPS and the EIP rules. The final rules do not encourage States to limit their design of EIP's to meet the specific provisions in the ETPS. However, the final rules recognize that States may want to implement emission trading without embarking on the design of new approaches to emission trading. Retaining the ETPS provides a known regulatory option for those States that want to apply it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

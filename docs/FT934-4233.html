			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Markets: Good news runs rampant - Wall Street / The Budget and You Any doubts equity investors may have had about the strength of the US recovery should have been dispelled this week by what was probably the most positive batch of economic data seen since the end of the recession. In successive days, there was good news on consumer confidence, nation-wide manufacturing activity, personal income and consumption, and leading economic indicators. Most important of all, the latest jobs data was very bullish. Government figures released yesterday showed that non-farm payrolls rose 208,000 in November (analysts had predicted a rise of around 140,000), and that the national unemployment rate dropped from 6.8 per cent to 6.4 per cent. cent). Admittedly, there was some bad news - home sales fell and store sales were disappointing in November - but it was not enough to dent hopes that theUS economy could record growth of more than 4 per cent in the final quarter of this year, up from below 3 per cent in the previous three months. Aside from the positive economic data, analysts will also have to start factoring into their forecasts the impact on growth of the latest declines in oil prices. This week, the price of a barrel of oil fell to Dollars 14.95, the lowest it has been in more than five years. The decline - which stemmed from last week's failure of oil exporting countries to agree on production cuts - may have rattled oil stocks, which have dropped sharply in recent days, but it should help the industrial and transport sectors. One might think that all this good news would have provided a strong fillip to share prices this week. Think again. Stocks did rise over the five days, but not by much. From the opening on Monday to mid-morning yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had gained only 17 points, or less than half a per cent, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 (a broader measure of share price performance) had barely moved at all. The apparent lack of enthusiasm among investors about the economy has its roots in two factors. First, share prices are close to their record highs and stocks remain expensive in terms of company earnings, so investors are wary about pushing equities any higher. The Dow seems to have found a short-term ceiling around 3,700, and it is probably a question now of waiting for corporate profits to catch up with share valuations before stocks look worth buying again. Second, concern about the outlook for interest rates continues to nag at investors. Bond prices may have stabilised this week, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond seemingly stuck between 6.2 per cent and 6.3 per cent, but investors appear convinced that long-term interest rates are only going to go higher, not lower, during the next six months to a year. If interest rates do rise steadily over the next 12 months, the flow of investors' money into equities, which has been the single biggest factor driving prices higher over the past two and a half years, could begin to slow. Although interest rates have been edging higher for little more than a month, an executive at Fidelity Investments, the largest US mutual fund group, noted earlier this week that some of the firm's clients had been favouring short-term money market funds over stock and bond funds in recent weeks. It is premature to sound the alarm about money flows, however. Money-market funds now return a miserly 2.5 per cent and it would take a big fall in stock and bond prices, and/or a significant increase in interest rates, before anyone other than the most conservative, risk-averse investor finds 2.5 per cent an attractive option.  ------------------------------ Monday     3677.80 -    6.15 Tuesday    3683.95  +   6.15 Wednesday  3697.08  +  13.13 Thursday   3702.11  +   5.03 Friday     3704.07  +   1.96  ------------------------------</p>

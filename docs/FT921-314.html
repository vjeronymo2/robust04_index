			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / French Bonds: Recovery imminent as market hits nadir and if so - when President Francois Mitterrand will have Mrs Edith Cresson replaced as prime minister. The fate of Mrs Cresson has been debated so loudly for so long that the smart school in French finance tends to dismiss it as an irrelevance. Irrelevant or not, the dire performance of the ruling socialists in last Sunday's regional elections sent the French bond markets spinning downwards on Monday morning only to waver for the rest of the week. The prime minister's future is still in the balance, but the outlook for French bonds looks much brighter. The consensus is that the market has now reached its nadir - what no-one seems to agree on is when the recovery will begin. 'Things can only get better,' said Mr Bernard Godement, head of French economic research at the Nomura Research Institute in Paris. Mr Godement reckons the upswing has already started. Others are more pessimistic. Mr Francois-Xavier Chauchaud, market economist at Banque Indosuez in Paris, agrees with Mr Godement that the market will not fall any further, but he expects to see a few sluggish weeks of stability before it starts to rise again. 'You have to remember how heavily investors' perceptions of France are influenced by events in Germany,' he said. 'I don't see any prospect of a real recovery in the French bond market until there is evidence that German inflation is falling, and we won't get that for another month.' So far this year the progress of French bonds has been at best erratic. The market was strengthened by interest from international investors in the opening months of the year, only to fall again when they retreated in the approach to last weekend's elections. The yield on the benchmark 10-year OAT government bond ended last week at 8.72 per cent, compared with 8.38 per cent a month ago. The Matif bond futures contract hovered around 107.6 at the end of the week. Meanwhile, the spread of French bonds over German bunds, now seen as a critical mark of the market's competitiveness, has widened to around 66 basis points. This is still lower than the peak of 70 basis points just before the Maastricht summit in early November, but well above the levels achieved earlier this year. France may have slowed down, but it shows no sign of slipping into real recession.  Unemployment is still rising and hit 9.9 per cent in February. But Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, is still exercising tight control of the economy and inflation was held at 3 per cent last month. The latest forecast from Paribas suggests that the French economy ought to muster growth of 1.8 per cent this year - lower than the official forecast of 2.2 per cent, but well above the 1 per cent achieved last year. When German interest rates come down, presumably in the second half of this year, French rates will almost certainly follow. This should be the final fillip for the bond market.</p>

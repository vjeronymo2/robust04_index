			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the first session of the new Serbian parliament,  the 250 deputies, 123 of whom are from the ruling Socialist  Party of Serbia, are today expected to elect the parliament  speaker. Before the vote, deputies discussed the candidates for  the post of parliament speaker. "The leader of the Democratic  Community of Vojvodina Hungarians [Demokratska Zajednica  Vojvodjanskih Madjara -- DZVM], Andras Agoston, said that the  Hungarians should not tip the scales and added that it would be  best if someone from the opposition were elected as parliament  speaker, but that the five DZVM deputies would abstain in the  vote in parliament, not only on this issue, but also when the  new government is voted on."</p>

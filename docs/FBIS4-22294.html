			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sh. Karimov, by UzA [Uzbek Agency] </F> correspondent A. Niyaziy: "The Generation's Health Is the  Country's Wealth: Interview With Shavkat Karimov, Health  Minister of the Republic of Uzbekistan"]    [Text] [Niyaziy] Shavkat Ibragimovich, it is completely  obvious that an economic reform cannot have an effect on all  spheres of social life. What effect on the nation's health is  exerted by the economic reform being carried out in Uzbekistan  --the changeover to a different system?    [Karimov] Actually, during the period of the changeover to  market relations it is impossible to take a superficial attitude  toward the questions of the social protection of the workers. In  essence, any reform is carried out for the good of the nation.    For three years the economic reform has been carried out in  the country. At the same time, as compared with other states in  the Community, a lot has been done in our republic to improve  the social protection of the population. Naturally, the question  arises: how was it possible to achieve this in the complicated  conditions of the changeover to market relations, when the  economy frequently comes up against unforeseen difficulties? But  the fact of the matter here is that, unlike many countries in  the CIS, the social protection of the population in Uzbekistan  has been elevated to the rank of state policy.    It is precisely the need to carry out a strong social policy  that stipulates one of the five basic principles of creating a  new society in our country. That is why, for the last three  years, that the health indicators in our republic have been  rather good. Whereas the average life expectancy in 1991 in our  republic was 69.3 years, in Russia it dropped from 69.6 to 66.  Child mortality for each thousand newborn infants in Uzbekistan  dropped from 37.3 in 1992 to 31.6 in 1993, and the death rate in  childbirth dropped from 79 to 41.6.    [Niyaziy] What do you think is the basic factor for the  improvement in these indicators?    [Karimov] This is achieved basically thanks to the concern  that is shown and to the implementation of our President's  edicts in this area and the "Soglom Avlod Uchun" state program.  The goal of this program is clear-cut: in order for the future  generation to grow up healthy, the children must be born  healthy. And that will be possible when the mothers are healthy.  This is the indisputable truth that constitutes the basic  essence of the program.    We carried out a preventive study of 5.1 million women. On  the basis of the survey results they were grouped into three  different groups. The first group includes healthy women who are  capable of giving birth to healthy children -- as many as they  want. The second consists of women who have been subjected to  some kind of ailment. They must, first of all, restore their own  health, and only then will they be able to give birth to a child  under a physician's constant observation. But for the women in  the third group it is recommended that they not give birth to  children, inasmuch as they are suffering from serious, chronic  ailments, and for them giving birth to a child would result in  weakened descendants and would represent a danger for the  mother's own health. Public health workers have been engaging  very actively in improving the health of the women included in  the second and third groups.    As is attested to by science, the most favorable period for  women to give birth is the age between 20 and 35 years. At that  time, as a rule, healthy, capable, beautiful children are born.  In addition, for the best possible development of the child, it  is important for him to be nourished by his mother's milk. It is  not accidental that 1993 was declared the "Year of Mother's  Milk." In nature there is no product that is capable of  replacing mother's milk. That is the medical side of the  question, but there is also a moral side: as he takes in his  mother's milk, he also absorbs love and all the higher feelings.  That kind of child acquires an immunity to diseases and has a  loving attitude toward his parents and to everyone else. It is  for good reason that people say, "If a person's mind has not  been nurtured on mother's milk, you cannot grow him on cow's  milk." Therefore among our nation it used to be customary to  breastfeed boys until the age of 30 months and girls until the  age of 24 months. That idea has also been reflected in the "For  a Healthy Population" program.    In order to bring up a healthy generation it is necessary to  have a healthy way of life. Therefore Uzbekistan is the only  country in the world in which the "Soglom Avlod Uchun" Order has  been established, and an international fund has created with the  same name. As you might recall, our President's first edicts  were aimed at protecting and strengthening the health of mother  and child. Concern for the fate of future generations has been  firmly stated in legislation and has been embodied in the free  distribution of food products for pregnant women in low-income  families. Our President has also promulgated an Edict dealing  with the providing of medicines to pregnant women on a  preferential basis.    Unfortunately, in certain places these measures are not  being  carried out properly. I would like to emphasize that the state  strives, to the best of its abilities, to support and strengthen  every family. So if certain families, having forgotten their  duty to the state, do not care about whether they are giving  birth to a healthy child, are they raising that child correctly  for society? Will today's infants be able in the future to  become the best kind of citizens, and to multiply their  Homeland's wealth?    [Niyaziy] How do you evaluate the demographic situation in  Uzbekistan?    [Karimov] The population increase in the republic is stable.  Every year something of the order of 700,000 children are born  in our republic. The natural mortality rate constitutes 150,000  persons. Consequently, every year the population increases by an  average of 500,000 persons. That is, the republic is growing  younger from year to year. Currently 48 percent of the  population is made up of young men and women below the age of 18  years. The future of our state will be determined specifically  by these young people.    At the same time, according to data that is available to us,  in 1993 the level of the natural mortality in Russia increased  from 12 to 15 percent. Consequently, the population decreased by  approximately 800,000 persons. And, as the specialists attest,  if extraordinary measures are not taken, this process can become  worse and can lead a great power to serious consequences.    In Uzbekistan the approach to this problem is completely  defined. As I mentioned, before introducing market relations in  our republic, the state policy on the social protection of the  population was defined. Life confirms the correctness of the  path that was chosen by Uzbekistan and reinforces one's faith  that our republic will become a great state.</p>

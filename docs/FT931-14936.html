			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / No soft touch for business: Karel van Miert, new EC competition commissioner, talks to Andrew Hill Earlier this week, a British newspaper described Mr Karel van Miert, the European Community's new competition commissioner, as 'an old-style socialist'. It was a description which made the Belgian commissioner laugh: he says he intends to exercise EC competition rules 'without ideological preconceptions'. Mr Van Miert's style, it seems, will be different from that of his predecessor, Sir Leon Brittan, a British free-trader and former minister under the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Sir Leon was often criticised for pursuing an unbending hard line against cartels, state subsidies, anti-competitive mergers and national monopolies. Together, he and Mr Peter Sutherland, the Irish commissioner who preceded him, built a strict competition policy into the backbone of the European single market. When Mr Van Miert was appointed before Christmas, companies and governments that had fallen foul of Sir Leon breathed a sigh of relief, believing competition policy would be relaxed. Under Mr Van Miert, the thinking went, private-sector groups bent on expansion through takeovers would be subject to less rigorous scrutiny from Brussels; plans to liberalise national energy, telecoms and postal monopolies would be shelved; and governments would be given more leeway to subsidise loss-making state industries. This view is too simplistic. First, Mr Van Miert has already demonstrated that he is no soft touch for big business. In his previous role as transport commissioner, he pushed through measures to liberalise the sheltered EC air transport market, despite the initial reservations of France and southern EC member states and some of the Community's largest airlines. Opponents won some concessions, notably on the timing of full liberalisation, but Mr Van Miert's low-profile negotiating style achieved the desired result: open competition on all EC routes by mid-1997. This week, in his first interview since taking office, Mr Van Miert told the Financial Times he would adopt a similar approach to competition policy: determined, even-handed and pragmatic. The existing competition rules, he stressed, have not changed, but 'from a philosophical point of view, there might be a different attitude on . . . how to cope with the rules'. In particular, Mr Van Miert explained, a strict competition policy would not be the sole guiding principle in anti-trust and state aid decisions. He said industrial, regional, social and environment policy should also be taken into consideration. 'I think the economy should be efficiently run, which means a fully fledged competition policy should be one of the main instruments,' he said. 'But competition is not the ultimate goal of the economy. The ultimate goal is for the economy to perform for the people, so that everyone gets his fair share and companies have a good environment to prosper, to invest and to be competitive.' How would this attitude work in practice? Mr Van Miert would not talk about specific cases, but referred to the three main areas of his work: Mergers. Mr Van Miert has to work within the strict framework of the 1990 EC merger rules. Under them, simple decisions are taken by the Commission's merger task force and only initialled by the commissioner. Sometimes, however, the attitude of the competition commissioner is crucial. The controversial Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, was only blocked by the Commission in 1991 because of Sir Leon's fierce opposition. Competition lawyers in Brussels believe Mr Van Miert might not have taken such a strong line. Mr Van Miert himself suggested that in cases where the Commission is likely to oppose a merger, the companies themselves should be allowed to decide how the deal could be amended to meet Commission objections. That could mean an end to the detailed negotiations between Commission and companies, which were a feature of Sir Leon's application of merger policy. 'I feel we should avoid as much as possible, intervening directly in the responsibility of how companies are run,' said Mr Van Miert. In practice, however, he may have to make deals - or face the unpalatable option of blocking a merger outright. Monopolies. Sir Leon Brittan told Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, that he would make liberalisation of state monopolies his principal aim, if he was given a second term. That may have been one reason why Mr Delors believed it was prudent to move Sir Leon from competition to the external trade portfolio - a move welcomed by Mr Delors' compatriots in France. But in spite of the optimism of French energy and telecommunications utilities, Mr Van Miert said he had not shelved the Commission's special powers to liberalise anti-competitive monopolies. Much will depend on whether Mr Abel Matutes, the new energy commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, who has added telecommunications and postal services to his industry portfolio, will want to enlist Mr Van Miert's support for an aggressive campaign against such groups. State subsidies. Competition lawyers and officials within the Commission believe this is the area where Mr Van Miert will face the most challenges to his authority. 'One of the most interesting things to watch will be whether industries in crisis are going to be subject to special rules,' said Mr Michael Reynolds, a partner in the Brussels office of Allen &amp; Overy, the British law firm. Sir Leon upset the French, Italian and Spanish governments by taking an extremely tough line on illegal state aid. But as the recession deepens in Europe, the pressure on governments to subsidise ailing industries is increasing. As Mr Van Miert put it: 'These will be the most difficult decisions because of the economic situation, the difficulties in many sectors and because the margin for different assessments is bigger than in other (areas of policy).' As if to underline the point, one of the first ministers to seek advice on Mr Van Miert's attitude to state intervention was Mr Michael Heseltine, president of Britain's Board of Trade, who came to Brussels yesterday with his suggestions for easing pit closures in the coal industry through subsidies. Mr Van Miert suggested in the interview that he may try to release the pressure on industries suffering from recession by giving governments longer in which to reduce state subsidies. What Mr Van Miert now needs is a series of cases on which to cut his competition teeth. Followers of competition policy are concerned that he has not altered the composition of his cabinet to include any competition experts, but officials in the Commission's competition directorate are cautiously optimistic. 'We have a very professional commissioner, who's experienced and with whom we feel quite comfortable,' one official said. Certainly his public profile is likely to be lower than that of his predecessor. Sir Leon delivered more than 400 speeches in his four years as competition commissioner. Mr Van Miert made about half that number as transport commissioner.</p>

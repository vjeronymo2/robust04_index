			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Observer: Tunisian parallel Former president Habib Bourguiba could be forgiven for thinking there is some poetic justice in the fact that the first news of the mutual recognition between Israel and the PLO came from Tunis. As Tunisian head of state during 1957-87, Bourguiba tried to convince his peers that they would fail to undo what the UN had done; in other words, they would have to recognise Israel. In Jericho (then part of Jordan) 28 years ago, Bourguiba propounded what he called the 'doctrine of stages'. This suggested that the Palestinians should recognise Israel and seek to restore their lost rights by negotiation rather than by war - which they were bound to lose. For his prescience he was burned in effigy around the Arab world; Nasser plotted to topple him.</p>

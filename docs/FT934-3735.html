			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Hopes for trade accord rise after transatlantic deals: France softens stance on farming subsidies The US and the European Union yesterday lifted hopes of a successful completion of the Uruguay Round of trade talks by settling a number of bilateral disputes and throwing negotiations open to all 116 countries in the round. Hopes of success were raised further by European foreign ministers, who gave a provisional seal of approval to the outline US-EU deal on market access. In a significant shift, France indicated it was ready to accept a bilateral pact on agriculture, which includes revisions to the hotly contested Blair House accord limiting subsidised farm exports. France has consistently threatened to veto a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord unless the 1992 Blair House agreement is changed substantially. In a move seen in Brussels as preparing French public opinion for a potential settlement, Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, declared: 'Blair House is dead. Another agreement has succeeded Blair House.' However, diplomats in Brussels cautioned that a series of intra-European disagreements could still threaten the deal. After all-night US-EU negotiations in Brussels, first Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, and then Sir Leon Brittan, his EU counterpart, flew to Geneva to announce that all disagreements had been settled, with the exception of US access to Europe's film and television market, and aircraft subsidies. The message to Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, was that despite outstanding differences on two issues, the US-EU tariff-cutting package was ready to be put before all countries negotiating in the Uruguay Round. It will be used to lever bigger tariff-cutting offers from other countries, in particular Japan, which is being pressed in financial services, leather goods and processed foods. The scale of the package agreed emerged during briefings in Geneva at which the trade negotiators talked of EU tariff cuts to the US averaging more than 50 per cent. Products such as wood and paper have joined a lengthening list of products for which tariffs have been slashed to zero. These alone are worth Dollars 5bn to US exporters, Mr Kantor said yesterday. The US has offered similar cuts to European exporters. Big tariff cuts have been agreed on Europe's electronics sector, as well as for US glass, ceramics and textiles. Apart from modifications to the Blair House accord, the US has also agreed to add ocean shipping to its package of liberalisation proposals. The two have agreed terms for opening their multi-billion procurement markets and on a new, more powerful multilateral trade organisation to replace Gatt. In Brussels, diplomats said a list of demands by France and other disgruntled EU member states could still sink prospects for a settlement and weaken Sir Leon's efforts to present a united European front in Geneva. France wants to strengthen European trade weapons to match the US arsenal and it is demanding a guarantee from its EU partners that French farmers will not have to make cuts in production beyond those required by the Common Agricultural Policy reforms agreed in May 1992. Mr Juppe said negotiations within the EU would start today among EU ambassadors in Brussels, continue at the Brussels summit on Friday and Saturday, and only after a further meeting of EU foreign ministers would France decide whether it would initial a draft Gatt accord.

			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CINEFILE  </P> <P> Peter O'Toole joins previously-cast John Goodman in Universal's "King Ralph,"  scheduled to film in the U.K. in mid-April. The comedy's based on a novel,  "Headlong," by the late Welsh actor-writer Emlyn Williams, which has the entire  Royal Family wiped out in an electrical storm during the photographing of a  family portrait. A trace of the royal bloodline leads to Goodman, a Las Vegas  lounge pianist. O'Toole will play royal secretary to the new, improbable King  of England. David S. Ward writes and directs. Then, in July, Goodman reunites  with filmmakers Ethan and Joel Coen for "Barton Fink," a '40s murder mystery in  which Goodman will play a Hollywood screenwriter from Kansas City. He last  worked with the writing-producing-directing Coen brothers team on "Raising  Arizona." . . .  </P> <P> Isabella Rossellini has landed the lead role in Imagine Entertainment's "Closet  Land," written and to be directed by Radha Bharadwaj, a Temple University film  school grad with TV credits in her native India. The script, originally  developed at the Sundance Institute, is an intense drama that takes place in  one room with a man interviewing a female prisoner. Because of its anti-torture  theme, Amnesty International is reportedly supporting the script in Hollywood.  The film, produced by Janet Meyers, will start production by or before May.  </P> <P> Carl Reiner has cast Kirstie Alley as a repressed housewife who embarks on her  first extramarital affair in "Sibling Rivalry." The comedy, written by Martha  Goldhirsch, begins filming in May for Castle Rock/Nelson Entertainment.  Columbia will release.  </P> <P> Exotic locations: Producer Jeffrey Sneller will soon find himself producing  films virtually at opposite ends of the globe. First comes "The Ice Runner,"  rolling April 30 in Murmansk, U.S.S.R., near the Finnish border, under the  direction of James Fargo. Timothy Bottoms stars as a CIA agent imprisoned in  the Soviet gulag in 1986; Pat Morita plays a Mongolian trader. Negotiations are  under way with Rod Steiger and Joanna Pacula for the other key roles. Four  Seasons will handle U.S. distribution. . . . Then in June, Sneller and producer  Raju Patel launch production in Africa on Sneller's own adaptation of Joseph  Conrad's journey into colonialist depravity, "Heart of Darkness." Michael  Wadleigh, best known for "Woodstock" and "Wolfen," will direct the Allied  Entertainment production. Negotiations are under way with Liam Neeson to play  the main protagonist, Marlow. Filming will take place in Kenya, Zaire, Uganda  and Zimbabwe. . . .  </P> <P> Also filming in Africa -- in Burundi, a country which has never before  witnessed Western film making -- is "Snake Eyes." Malcolm McDowell, Sydney  Penny, Lois Chiles, French star Philippe Leotard and Jason Cairns star in this  modern-day fable for Jaques SandozFilm Prods. At $5.5 million, the film is said  to be the most expensive Swiss-backed film ever.  </P> <P> Writer-producer Paul Rapp and Teleview Prods. have set Joe Sirola in the title  role of "The Commissioner." This film biography of Kenesaw Mountain Landis,  Major League Baseball's first commissioner, goes into production this fall. No  director has been set.  </P> <P> Moshe Mizrahicq, whose directing career in Israel and France has resulted in  three Oscar nominations for best foreign film, including the Oscar-winning  "Madame Rosa," has come to L.A. to prepare for his first American film.  "Paradise Man," to shoot this fall mostly in New York (with some locations in  France), is based on a detective novel by Jerome Charyn, an American writer  more celebrated in France than here. Casting for Rosa/Guy Prods. will get under  way in a few weeks. KIRK HONEYCUTT  </P></p>

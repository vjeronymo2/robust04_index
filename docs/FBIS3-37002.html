The Bosnian Crisis Has Thrown Moscow Into  Confusion"]    [Text] A serious conflict is brewing between Moscow and  the West for the first time in 10 years. By rejecting the NATO  ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs and demanding the urgent  convening of the UN Security Council, Russia is running the risk  of ending up in international isolation.    Of the European states only Greece -- the Serbs' traditional  ally -- has displayed full solidarity with Moscow's position.  The distribution of forces in the Security Council is also  extremely unfavorable: In the event of a vote 13 out of the 15  Security Council members will support the NATO line, China will  abstain, and only Moscow will come out against.    Although it does not look as if there will even be a vote.  The United States and its allies disagree with Russia's opinion  that a special Security Council resolution is necessary to carry  out air operations in Bosnia. Washington, Paris, and London  believe that there have been quite enough previous UN decisions,  which Russia, incidentally, could have blocked but did not.    Thus Moscow is losing the only real prospect of preventing  the implementation of the NATO ultimatum. The further  development of events no longer depends on the will of the  Kremlin. Whatever bellicose calls are made from the Duma  rostrum, Yeltsin cannot fail to realize that Moscow's potential  is limited.    Recently, it is true, certain politicians (and not just of a  Zyuganov-Zhirinovskiy orientation -- Sergey Shakhray, for  example) have discoursed in earnest on the possibility of World  War III in the event of a strike against the Bosnian Serbs. You  really have to possess a rich imagination to imagine that the  Russian Government would agree to plunge its people into a  nuclear conflict so that Radovan Karadzic's soldiers can calmly  lay siege to Sarajevo, stationing their guns 5 km from the city  center rather than 20 km away, as the NATO countries demand!    In supporting the Serbs, the Russian authorities are guided  chiefly by emotions and the logic of the internal political  struggle: Moscow has no serious economic or political interests  in Serbia. The possibility cannot be ruled out that Yeltsin and  Kozyrev arrived at the conclusion that readiness to resort to a  diplomatic conflict with the West would strengthen their  positions inside the country. But here it is important not to  cross the line where disagreements between allies (this is  precisely what Yeltsin has recently been calling Western states)  become an unbridgeable gulf.    You get the impression that the Russian president is  searching agonizingly for this line. It was no coincidence that  Bill Clinton was unable to get through to him by telephone for  two days. Moscow replied hardly plausibly that it was  "impossible to communicate with Boris Nikolayevich for technical  reasons." Most likely Yeltsin simply was not ready to talk with  his U.S. colleague. By going quite far in its support for the  Serbs, the Kremlin has now been forced to resolve a very complex  task: How to prevent a rupture with the West and, at the same  time, save face.    Russian diplomacy is in disarray. Signs of a certain  softening of the position have already appeared. Yuliy  Vorontsov, permanent representative at the United Nations,  unexpectedly declared that Moscow would not stand in the way of  attempts by NATO aircraft to lift the siege of Sarajevo.</p>

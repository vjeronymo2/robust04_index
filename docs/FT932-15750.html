			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / BR lobbies against strike BRITISH RAIL launched a campaign among its employees at the weekend to persuade them not to join a second 24-hour strike on Friday. Managers at depots and stations across the country have been told to talk to staff and explain that there could be further job losses and dwindling business for the railway industry if disruption continued. On April 2 BR lost about Pounds 10m in gross revenue because of industrial action. BR's move follows Thursday's breakdown of peace talks between management and the two rail unions, RMT and the drivers' union Aslef. The gap between the sides appears wide. RMT wants BR to guarantee no compulsory redundancies and no use of contract labour, while Aslef is demanding that BR should not change national agreements covering the deployment of drivers. BR said yesterday: 'We understand the fears which stem from the coming privatisation of the industry but no employer can guarantee jobs for life.' Mr Paul Watkinson, BR's employee relations director, believes BR 'went a long way on Thursday to meet the demands from the unions'. In a document presented to the unions BR reaffirmed that it would 'seek to achieve any necessary manpower reductions by voluntary severance coupled with natural wastage and arrangements for redeployment and retraining'. It had also promised to 'discuss such arrangements with the unions and staff representatives at the appropriate level'. BR assured the unions that it would 'consult on any proposals for job reductions and contracting out in accordance with established procedures and take measures to avoid compulsory redundancies through the application of current agreements'. These offers did not satisfy the executive committees of the two unions but further talks before Friday's planned strike cannot be ruled out. BR remains reluctant to adopt a tougher stance for fear of a complete shutdown of the network. BR's legal advisers suggest it would fail to secure an injunction against the promised strike, which they accept is lawful. A lock-out would precipitate legal redress from BR's freight contractors, while depriving the unions of the check-off system for paying union dues could not be achieved overnight and would do nothing to resolve the dispute. Separately, London bus crews will not be striking on Friday. Instead, their local representatives meet on April 22 to discuss further industrial action, including another two one-day strikes, a lobby of Parliament in May, and a public petition against plans to privatise and deregulate London's bus services. Members of the National Union of Mineworkers have been called on to strike next Friday in the campaign against pit closures. Late on Thursday night Mrs Anne Scargill, the wife of the NUM president, started an underground sit-in with three other women at Parkside colliery on Mersey side, one of the pits facing imminent closure.</p>

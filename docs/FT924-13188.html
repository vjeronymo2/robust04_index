			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Mountain bikes kept in suspense Mountain bike riding can be a painful experience without suspension - both for rider and machine - and for serious riders suspension is becoming increasingly important. Muddy Fox, instigator of the mountain bike boom in the UK, has front or rear suspension available on various models, but has now gone a stage further with its Intereactive Suspension design combining front and rear suspension in one system. The concept, originated by the British inventor Dave Smart, links suspension movement of the wheels so that they rise and fall together, relative to the frame. No matter how the weight distribution changes, the bike always retains level trim. The chain tension interacts with the suspension system to ensure that the force the rider puts into the pedals cannot compress the spring, so the bike can climb and sprint as fast as any conventional rigid frame.

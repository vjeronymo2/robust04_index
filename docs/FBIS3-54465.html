Following the reading of the Majles  Inquiry and Investigation report on the performance of the Voice  and Vision organization at the open Majles sessions Tuesday and  Wednesday of last week, in an unprecedented move, the Voice and  Vision organization broadcast the first part of an answer from  the chief of this organization to the Majles at 1600 on Saturday  8/15/1372 [6 November 1993] over the national network of the  Voice of the Islamic Republic.    At the end the announcer said that the continuation of the  answer would be read in subsequent programs on the Voice of the  Islamic Republic, but as of the time of this report this has not  been done. It is said that other parts of the answer were  prepared by the chief of the Voice and Vision organization, but  for unknown reasons they have not yet been broadcast.    In the text that was read on the Voice of the Islamic  Republic, many insults were directed at the members of the  Inquiry and Investigation Group and the Majles deputies. RESALAT  did not publish it because of the insults and slander, and  because of the press law.</p>

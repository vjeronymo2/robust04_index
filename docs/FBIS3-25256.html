			<p>Language: <F P=105> Afrikaans </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Johannesburg WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN today  claimed that President F. W. de Klerk had told lies when he  revealed details last year about South Africa's nuclear weapons  program. The paper reported that the court records of the trial  behind closed doors in 1989 of an air force officer, Brigadier  Johan Blaauw, indicate that South Africa and Israel exchanged  nuclear weapons technology, and that extensive cooperation had  taken place between the two countries. [passage omitted]    President De Klerk said today that a statement on the matter  will be released as soon as possible. In its reaction to the  report, the Atomic Energy Corporation has denied that South  Africa provided nuclear weapons technology to other countries.  Chief Executive Officer Dr. (Waldo Schtupf) said in a statement  that President de Klerk was correct in saying that South Africa  had never exchanged nuclear weapons technology. He said tritium  has several commercial uses and South Africa had purchased the  material from various sources.    On the delivery of uranium oxide to Israel, he said South  Africa has for a long time been involved in trading in the  material and had delivered it to several countries, including  some which do not manufacture nuclear weapons.    Cape Province Attorney General Frank Kahn said the police  have been instructed to investigate the publication of documents  relating to the trial, which had been held in camera.</p>

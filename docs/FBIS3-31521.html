			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with President Zhelyu Zhelev by an unidentified </F> representative of the Panorama political review program in  Sofia; date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Panorama] Is it a  coincidence that you signed the Partnership for Peace initiative  precisely at this juncture, at the same time that NATO imposed  its ultimatum? Is there any connection with the ultimatum that  NATO has given to the Bosnian Serbs?    [Zhelev] There is no connection of such a kind, although  certain mass media, especially some newspapers, politicians, and  representatives of various institutions, have permitted  themselves to find such a connection. No such connection  exists. The simple truth is that the decision to sign the  initiative was made much earlier, prior to the ultimatum. The  coincidence in time is purely accidental.    [Panorama] Since only 24 hours now remain before the  ultimatum expires, I would nonetheless like to clear up one  point. Has there been any change in Bulgaria's position  regarding the air strikes, and do any differences exist between  the main institutions of state on this issue?    [Zhelev] I will permit myself here to reiterate extremely  concisely the main points of our position, because it is very  often distorted and misrepresented in an incorrect light.  Bulgaria was one of the first countries in the Balkans to  formulate its position clearly and precisely regarding the  disintegrating Federation of Yugoslavia. As you will remember,  we were the first to recognize the four former Yugoslav  republics; we were the first to declare that Bulgaria will under  no circumstances exploit the difficulties that the former  Yugoslavia was facing; and we were the first to declare that  Bulgaria will under no circumstances participate militarily or  allow military intervention on its part in the events in  Yugoslavia, that we will send neither troops nor weapons, nor  embark on any form of military path. I consider that we have  preserved this position until the present day.    At the same time, we asked the other Balkan states and  neighbors of the former Yugoslavia to adopt the same position of  renouncing military intervention in the conflicts in Yugoslavia,  because such an act, even if undertaken for the most noble  motives, may prove to be a direct way to drag the country in  question into a new Balkan war, a war in which all the other  neighbor countries of former Yugoslavia will find themselves  involved.    Of course, we have to adjust, to correct our position to  take  account of the new situation that has arisen, but there will be  no fundamental changes in our position, which remains one of  active neutrality. We regard the NATO ultimatum as one of the  last peaceful means, a peace effort by the European structures  to settle, [pause] to contribute to solving the conflict in  Bosnia and in Sarajevo, in particular.    One has to draw a distinction between the ultimatum itself  and the actual use of weapons. These are two quite different  things. The ultimatum is purely and simply a warning, designed  to compel the warring parties to sit down at the table and hold  serious negotiations, first and foremost on halting the conflict  and then on gradually settling the points at dispute, about  which they are fighting.    [Panorama] Have you heard whether the ultimatum is producing  any results regarding the disputes?    [Zhelev] Yes, you are right. So far, the ultimatum has  produced very good results. According to the information that I  have been receiving at least, the Serbs are withdrawing their  heavy artillery at a fast rate, while the Muslims are fulfilling  other actions that are required under the ultimatum.    [Panorama] Do you consider that the Greek Government  decision to impose a unilateral de facto embargo against  Macedonia [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  complicates the situation in the Balkans?    [Zhelev] Naturally, Greece is a sovereign state and is  entitled to decide its own moves, its own steps in the Balkans,  but I consider that to make this move precisely at this moment  does not contribute to reducing the tension in the Balkans.    [Panorama] Mr. President, in conclusion, in view of the  development of events around Bosnia, does any real military  threat exist for Bulgaria?    [Zhelev] No, I can state quite categorically that no such  threat exists for Bulgaria.</p>

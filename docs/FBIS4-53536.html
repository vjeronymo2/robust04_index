			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Mass rallies have been  held in different parts of the DPRK to mark the 14th anniversary  of the heroic Kwangju popular uprising in South Korea in May  1980.    Mass rallies took place in South Pyongan and North Hwanghae  Provinces Thursday.    The speakers at the rallies described the Kwangju uprising  as  an anti-U.S., anti-fascist democratic resistance in which the  entire citizens of Kwangju rose up in a death-defying struggle  for independence, democracy and reunification.    Fourteen years have passed since the resistance fighters of  Kwangju shed blood of patriotism, but their desire has not been  realised, the speakers said, adding that this is because the  U.S. imperialists have not given up their design to keep hold on  South Korea as their colony and military base.    Referring to the vicious campaign of the United States to  stifle the DPRK over its "nuclear issue," the speakers said the  United States unilaterally called off the third round of talks  with the DPRK and is manipulating some dishonest quarters of the  International Atomic Energy Agency in an effort to put  "international pressure" on the DPRK.    If the desire of the Kwangju martyrs is to be realised, they  said, it is essential to get the U.S. troops and nuclear weapons  withdrawn from South Korea and overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet  regime. The South Korean people and students must fight more  courageously to bring about a new morning of democracy free from  subjugation, they stressed.</p>

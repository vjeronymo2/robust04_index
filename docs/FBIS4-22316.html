			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Dvoynishnikova, under rubric </F> "Initiative": "President Ilyumzhinov Has Subordinated Himself to  President Yeltsin: But He Will Remain With Kalmykia Until  `Economic Stability' Arrives"]    [Text] Kalmykia President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov recently  announced the liquidation of the Republic's Constitution and the  Republic's resubordination to the Russian Constitution. He  stated that the majority of the population supports his  initiative concerning the repealing of the Republic's currently  effective Constitution. Kirsan Ilyumzhinov also reported that  the Republic's new Basic Law is in the process of preparation:  this is the Great Steppe Code, the enactment of which means the  practical liquidation of the Republic's sovereignty. The  historic document that has been taken as the basis has been  adapted to the realities of modern life and contains the  following principles: the inseparable link with the nation of  Russia (the impossibility of the Republic's secession from the  Federation); RF [Russian Federation] citizenship; etc. The  question of the president's status is in the process of being  resolved. One possibility is that he will be confirmed by the RF  president, that is, on the basis of his status he will be  equated to an administration head.    President Ilyumzhinov, who was immediately christened by the  Western SMI [mass media] as the "unifier of Russia," gave an  interview to a SEGODNYA correspondent.    He reported that his appeal at an expanded session of the  peoples of Kalmykia, at which he announced the repeal of the  Republic Constitution, had "caused indignation on the part of  the opposition." "Kalmyks suddenly felt that they were Kalmyks.  Base nationalistic feelings sprang up. But the nation supports  my decision, and the incompletely beaten opposition has crawled  out: basically former Communists who are striving to gain power.  It is they who are attempting to unsettle the situation. They  have declared that I am a traitor, and have created a committee  to save the Constitution," Mr. Ilyumzhinov said, stating that he  is firmly resolved to "stop the theater of the absurd."    "I have ordered that the mass media publish everything, and  later on we shall analyze it. Once again I want to demonstrate  that, for me, power is not for the sake of power, but for the  sake of the nation's well-being. Because I am the only president  who does not receive any salary for occupying the position. I  give my salary to a children's home. I wanted to demonstrate the  same thing when I was in the White House on 3 and 4 October,"  the president stated.    According to Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, Moscow is "still looking  at"  his unexpected decision, which, he admits, not even his closest  aides knew about. As for the other autonomous republics, so far  as the president of Kalmykia knows, they are unanimous in  censuring the step he took.    "I feel that in Russia there must be one president and one  Constitution," he emphasized, remarking at the same time that "I  shall not leave until economic stability arrives in Kalmykia.  And, for the time being, everything is proceeding according to  my scenario."</p>

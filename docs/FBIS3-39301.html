			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Nicosia O AGON in Greek on 9 February  1994 on pages 16 and 17 carries a 3,380-word interview with  Theofilos Yeoryiadhis, chairman of the Committee of Solidarity  With the Kurds, by correspondent Niki Miltiadhou. The interview  begins with Yeoryiadhis explaining how he got involved with the  Kurdish problem, saying he became interested in it after  learning the Turkish language and dealing professionally with  Turkish issues. He and some friends, such as Lakis Pingouras,  established the Committee of Solidarity With the Kurds in 1988.    The correspondent asks what the committee has done for the  Kurds and Yeoryiadhis answers that it has done many things but  he cannot say it has done what it should have done.    Responding to a question on how Cyprus can help the Kurds  and  how the Kurds can help Cyprus, Yeoryiadhis says: "The Kurds are  already helping Cyprus by maintaining a war that keeps 350,000  Turkish soldiers occupied. Two weeks ago, we saw the Turkish  military service extended by four months, proving that there is  a lack of personnel. Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller last  week said that Greece is creating problems, therefore, it cannot  pull its forces from the Aegean and move them to Kurdistan.  This shows that the Turkish Army has its hands full with the  Kurds and is not capable of making a second war against either  Greece or Cyprus.    "Furthermore, the Kurdish revolution has blocked Turkey's  dreams of resurrecting the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans and  Central Asia following the collapse of the Soviet Union.  Therefore, the Kurds help Cyprus by keeping the Turkish Army  busy, that is by making the Turks incapable of expanding the  invasion or starting a second war in Cyprus.    "Our help has been multifold. Beginning with the political  aspect, friendly countries, such as Cyprus, must raise the  Kurdish problem at international forums and condemn Turkish  terrorism and violations of human rights. The international  community must press the Kurdish issue. Parties, organizations,  and the people in general must give practical and financial help  to a nation that fights and safeguards our security.    "The Kurds in Turkey even attack the tourism industry and,  as  a result, we benefited last year. Our hotels were full last  September and October with German tourists who would have gone  to Turkey but finally came to Cyprus. This indicates that even  our tourist sector benefits from this war."    Asked to compare the Kurdish and Cypriot struggles,  Yeoryiadhis says: "You have answered this question yourself ...  [ellipsis as published] There is no struggle and this is why I  insist that since we are not fighting, we must at least help  those who fight for us. It may seem unlikely that the Turkish  Army in Cyprus will either be blocked because of an expansion of  war and Turkish domestic problems or will have to withdraw. The  latter option is possibly more unlikely because the reservists  can cover their needs, but the possibility that the Army will  stay blocked remains.    "We must see this and understand that our only way out is to  respect the political factor that, on the one hand, causes  Turkey's financial bankruptcy--the Turkish pound was devalued 20  percent during a stock exchange crash--and, on the other, causes  a political crisis. There is no government that can make a  decision on a Cyprus solution. There is no willingness and this  is the most basic issue."    Yeoryiadhis is then asked which countries support the Kurds  and who helps them. He answers: "The Kurdish people, the PKK  [Workers Party of Kurdistan], which was established in 1978 is  based on a basic principle, the people's self-rule. It does not  try to secure help from foreign countries so it does not become  dependent. Foreign help causes dependence. We have the example  of the Iraqi Kurds. Their continuous dependence caused the  Kurdish people in Iraq to be destroyed.    "Kurdish assistance mainly comes from the Kurdish people  themselves, the immigrants. There are about 1.5 million Kurds  in Europe alone. Kurdistan's National Liberation Front has some  300,000 active members in Europe who contribute to the Kurdish  struggle. Assistance from others in the international community  is not ruled out."    Discussing which countries are friendly toward the Kurdish  people, Yeoryiadhis remarks: "There is a significant opening in  Europe. Greece is friendly toward the Kurdish struggle, as is  Cyprus, Belgium, the Scandinavian countries, Austria, Italy, and  Spain. Basically, the only countries that oppose the Kurds are  France and Germany, which follow the Turkish policy on the  Kurdish issue because of interests in Turkey."    Asked how the Americans see the Kurdish struggle,  Yeoryiadhis  replies: "The Americans oppose Turkey's division because they  consider it a factor of stability in the Middle East, a factor  against Iran and Islamic fundamentalism. But, they obviously  favor the creation of a political state, particularly in  northern Iraq."    Asked to comment on the declaration of war against the Kurds  by Turkish Prime Minister Ciller, Yeoryiadhis says that such  declarations are common but various Turkish officials give  different dates as to when a new offensive will begin.  Yeoryiadhis adds: "There is some confusion on an exact time  because they try to hide the real picture and avoid world  reaction. The developments, though, show the opposite.  Turkey's economy is continuously being destroyed and there is a  political crisis." Furthermore, Yeoryiadhis says: "It seems  that Turkey will not make it [against the Kurdish uprising] to  the year 2000. This year, the Kurds will strongly attack  tourism in Turkey, aiming at exhausting its economic resources,  mainly foreign currency, so that it will not be able to finance  the war against them."    Yeoryiadhis is then asked to explain why there are so many  Kurds in the occupied part of Cyprus, since the Kurds are at war  with the Turks. He responds: "The Turks' basic policy is to  evict the Kurds from the Kurdish areas to minimize the war.  They have emptied and destroyed more than 800 Kurdish villages  in Kurdistan. They do the same thing with the other  nationalities in Asia Minor. There have been forceful movements  of people since the Ottoman Empire. There were many  nationalities that simply disappeared with these movements. The  same thing happened in the genocide of the Armenians. In  addition to those they slaughtered, one million Kurds were moved  to the Syrian desert to be destroyed. The Turks are nomadic  people. They moved from Central Asia to Asia Minor and also  within Asia Minor. Movement is something natural for the Turks  and the Kurds. They do not react to the movement. They do not  understand the characteristic of localism and are not bound to  the land in the way we say, `this is my village.' Anyway, the  basic problem of the Kurdish people throughout history has been  the lack of national consciousness. Their ancestors were the  Medians [from Media, ancient name for the mountainous area in  Asia between Armenia, Assyria, Persia, Parthia, and Ukraine].    "Indeed, there are Kurdish settlers in the occupied areas of  Cyprus who came after the 1974 war or fought in this war.  However, many Kurds go there to find work or because of their  expulsion from Kurdistan. However, this should not be used as  an excuse against helping the Kurds because there are only a few  settlers the Kurdish movement condemns as associates of the  Turkish state. On this issue, there is a relevant statement by  PKK General Secretary Abdullah Ocalan to Greek Cypriot  correspondents who visited their camp in the al-Biqa' Valley in  1991. These settlers actually are fanatic Muslims, belonging to  the fascist party of Alpaslam Turkes. However, these people were  used for settling the occupied areas at the beginning, even  before the Kurdish movement was founded in 1978. The mass  settlement of Kurds was based on a plan in 1974-76. But there  are also Greek-speaking Pondians in the occupied areas. This  could be a positive thing, as a base for us in the occupied  areas. There are also Kurdish soldiers in the occupation army  because military service is obligatory. Unfortunately we do not  capitalize on this."</p>

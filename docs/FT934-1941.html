			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Light in vale of tears: Philip Stephens asks whether the Ulster accord will end violence History is against them. But Mr John Major and Mr Albert Reynolds are attempting to jettison the past. It is a brave endeavour. It could end in more tears. But they might, just might, succeed. After 25 years of bloodshed, the provisional IRA has been offered the best chance it may get to extricate itself from its campaign of violence. Some among its leaders will be tempted to take it. The joint declaration by the UK and Irish prime ministers, announced in the wood-panelled splendour of the state dining room in Number 10 Downing Street, does not square the circle between the fears of Northern Ireland's unionists and the aspirations of its nationalists. But then language, no matter how carefully crafted, cannot disguise the realities which divided Ireland and then divided the community in the north of that island. Nobody looking at the history of Ulster since 1968 - stained by the killing of about 3,000 people and littered with failed political initiatives - could say confidently that Mr Major and Mr Reynolds have found the philosopher's stone. Nor could anybody listening to the thundering venom of Rev Ian Paisley, leader of the hardline Democratic Unionist party, underestimate the hatred and mistrust which seeps through the political pores of the province. When men speak easily of blood and God in the same breath, the normal rules of political judgment must be suspended. There are already mutterings of a backlash by the Protestant paramilitaries against Mr Major's 'treachery'. Then there is the IRA, an organisation which seems to have all but lost its raison d'etre during the past 25 years in an ever more brutal and random killing spree. Behind the synthetic charm of Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, are terrorists who will find it hard if not impossible to kick the habit of murder. So it is not difficult for cynics to place the Downing Street accord among all those other failed attempts to find a political solution to a tribal war. Even some of his cabinet colleagues are not quite sure whether the prime minister has been naive in falling for what one described this week as the 'peace bandwagon'. But Mr Major and Mr Reynolds believe that this time the public mood is running in their favour. Even if the IRA cannot be coaxed quickly to the negotiating table, there is an opportunity to break the acquiescence of the law-abiding nationalist community upon which the gunmen depend. Sinn Fein kept its counsel yesterday. But producing a document which won the acquiescence of Mr James Molyneaux, the moderate Ulster Unionist leader, and applause from Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, which is mainly Catholic, was of itself no mean achievement. The declaration is a tortuous document, showing all the awkward joins inevitable in any paper subject to literally hundreds of hours of word-by-word bargaining. Its central message, however, is relatively straightforward. Both the London and Dublin governments offer a guarantee that the unionists in Northern Ireland will never be coerced into unification with the republic. As part of an overall political settlement Mr Reynolds is ready to renounce his government's constitutional claim to the north. London, for its part, acknowledges it is neutral about the aspirations of the Irish nationalists. It has no selfish, strategic or economic interest in remaining in Northern Ireland. It will not stand in the way of unification if a majority in the province so decides. But the document is more than simply a synthesis of past public statements or a rewriting of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. In his recognition of the unionist veto, Mr Reynolds has become the first Irish prime minister to accept publicly the reality of partition. In return for the entrenchment of the constitutional guarantee for Ulster, Mr Major has gone further than any British prime minister before him in speaking the language of the Irish nationalists. To take one sentence from the most hard-fought section of the statement: 'The British government agree that it is for the people of the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, north and south, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish.' The wording is deliberately labyrinthine. The demonology demanded it be so. But the message is clear. In return for Mr Reynolds's implicit acceptance of Irish partition, Mr Major has reinforced the studied neutrality of the British government over the ultimate future of Northern Ireland. The government will not join the ranks of the nationalist 'persuaders', but nor will it stand against such persuasion. The door has been opened to those in the Republican movement who want to exchange the bullet for the ballot box. Sinn Fein could have a probationary place at the negotiating table within three months of an end to violence. British intelligence reports suggest there is a power struggle within the IRA army council between those who want to end the terror campaign and those who are determined to fight on. Neither Mr Major nor Mr Reynolds is sure which side will come out on top. Mr Molyneaux may find it hard to offer grudging support for the initiative if Mr Paisley succeeds in his aim of mobilising hard-line unionist opinion against the declaration. The Protestant gunmen lurk in the background. The planned talks designed to shape a political settlement will be a hazardous and protracted affair. There is no guarantee that the statements of principle agreed by the two governments can be turned into new political structures for Northern Ireland. But Mr Major and Mr Reynolds joined yesterday in insisting that there was no moral alternative to the course upon which they had embarked. Now it is up to the IRA.</p>

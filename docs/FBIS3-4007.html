The scientists, from the Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural  Sciences, came to this conclusion based on a survey of southern  Jiangsu's Suzhou, Wuxi and Changzhou.    According to associate research fellow Huang Wenxin, who was  in charge of the research project, southern Jiangsu covers an  area of 17,500 sq km and has a population of 13 million.    Its gross domestic product last year jumped by at least  tenfold over 1979, when China began its rural reform, and its  economic development speed ranks first among the country's rural  areas.    According to the latest statistics, the proportion of  industry in this area rose to 90 percent last year and that of  the non-rural labor force to 80 percent.    The annual farmers' income last year averaged more than  2,000  yuan per capita, and the standard of farm machinery and  irrigation in more than one half of the counties and cities had  already caught up with that of the economically-developed  countries.    At present, southern Jiangsu is promoting its rural  modernization by setting up more industrial and commercial  zones, rural residential quarters and farmland-protection areas.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Curious way for Lloyd's to treat its capital base Sir, The circular just sent out by Lloyd's debt collectors is more remarkable than the aspects Mr J Hamilton Stutt highlights (Letters, October 1) in that it seeks payment of 'debts' that everyone from the chairman of Lloyd's downwards agrees do not exist. This bizarre situation arises because of the 'double count' - in essence syndicates writing errors and omissions policies reserving against possible claims from other syndicates who themselves reserve against such claims not being paid. Lloyd's itself has been happy to take an overall credit for this double count in order to satisfy the Department of Trade and Industry's solvency requirement for the market as a whole, but in spite of repeated requests, it continues to refuse to make a similar credit available to individual Names. The result is that many Names able and willing to trade on will be unable to do so because they decline to make further funds available to meet what are known as 'solvency deficits' - which do not in fact exist. The situation will only be resolved when the double count is unwound by the settlement one way or the other of the many legal actions between Names and their agents. Who wins and who loses is irrelevant. Meanwhile, Lloyd's appears determined to inflict the maximum damage on its members - a curious way to treat the capital base.

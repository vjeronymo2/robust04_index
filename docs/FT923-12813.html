			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Banco de Chile plans Dollars 75m deal BANCO de Chile, the country's largest private sector bank, is set to become the first Chilean borrower to tap the international bond market since the debt crisis of the 1970s. The bank is planning to raise a Dollars 75m five-year funding next week from a Eurodollar bond issue lead-managed by Bankers Trust International. While borrowers from Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela are now regular visitors to the international market, Chilean banks and companies have been able to raise funds at cheaper rates in their domestic markets. Reform of the pension industry in the early 1980s encouraged the development of a liquid domestic debt market. Chile is one of only a few countries in the world where 20-year corporate bonds are actively traded. Bankers said yesterday that few Chilean banks would be able to raise international funds and on-lend to domestic companies at attractive rates. Banco de Chile will use the proceeds to finance dollar loans to companies in capital goods sectors. Pensions reform was part of a structural adjustment which included the privatisation of state industrial holdings and a reduction of Chile's external borrowings. Foreign debt stands at around 55 per cent of gross domestic product, down from over 100 per cent in 1987. The government runs a small budget surplus, and the current account is in balance, despite several years of strong economic growth. Commercial bank loans to Chile trade at around 90 per cent of face value in the secondary market, against 50 per cent of face value for Argentina and under 40 per cent for Brazilian debt. Banco de Chile has assets of around Dollars 4.5bn. As a leading commercial lender, its fortunes are linked to the fortunes of the Chilean economy. It is still tied to the aftermath of economic collapse in the late 1970s. Around 70 per cent of each year's profit is paid to the central bank, which took over the management of Banco de Chile's bad debt portfolio to save it from liquidation. Bankers Trust expects to price the Banco de Chile bonds to yield around 2 per cent more than US Treasury paper of the same maturity, similar to the yield spread of benchmark Mexican bond issues.</p>

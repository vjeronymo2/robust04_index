			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / FO drops plan for contracting-out: European rules on pay lead to confusion THE FOREIGN Office announced last night that it had suspended preparations to contract out services because of new regulations protecting workers' pay and conditions when they transfer to the private sector. The Foreign Office lead is likely to be followed by other departments and underlines the extent to which the government's Pounds 1bn programme of contracting out has been thrown into confusion by the regulations. These regulations, which stem from a European Community directive, mean companies may not normally cut the pay and conditions of staff who transfer to the private sector. Private contractors would also be liable for high redundancy payments if they shed jobs. About 80 per cent of the costs of providing government services are labour. The government agreed to adopt the regulations only after a threat of court action from the European Commission. At a meeting earlier this week senior civil servants from government departments criticised the Treasury, the environment department, and the Cabinet Office for failing to clarify the legal position. Foreign Office officials warned they would halt the department's programme to test the feasibility of contracting out services such as information technology and some training because of the confusion. The Confederation of British Industry has warned that companies will refuse to bid for contracts to provide local authority services because of the new regulations. Mr John Hall, chairman of the CBI's competing for quality committee, said: 'On the face of it there is no longer any point in companies taking part in tenders for public services. We will fight the government and the unions tooth and nail.' The regulations were included in the recently published employment bill to harmonise UK legislation - the Transfer of Undertakings (Employment Protection) Regulations - with the European Community's acquired rights directive. Mr Hall said contractors might find it hard to take on existing workforces profitably.</p>

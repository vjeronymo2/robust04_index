			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Norman Patterton] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 13 SAPA -- President F W de Klerk  said on Wednesday [13 April] he hoped the international  mediation effort to resolve policial differences would result in  agreements that had long escaped the country. Addressing a  press conference in Pretoria after a cabinet meeting, he said  government negotiators had been instructed to be constructive  rather than technical at mediation talks.    Some progress had been made on Wednesday to establish the  terms of reference for the mediation process for kwaZulu/Natal.  "Hopefully, mediation will take off soon as a result of this  meeting," Mr de Klerk said.    He warned that the success of the mediation effort hinged on  the will of political parties to find a solution. If any party  tried to use mediation for fancy tricks it would not work, Mr de  Klerk said.    It seemed mediation might begin by Friday night or Saturday  morning.    A second four-way summit would not be held before this  because the bid to find a solution to the issue of a Zulu  monarchy had to be co-ordinated with the foreign mediation  effort.    He believed the four-way summit task group had come up with  with a document which contained a solution to the issue of the  political accommodation of Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.    Mr de Klerk said he did not believe the election date should  be "mediable". The date was a matter to be addressed by the  country's political leaders.    Government, however, believed the elections should be held  on  the scheduled date.    Expressing his "deep concern" over strikes throughout the  country, he said political parties such as the African National  Congress, which was affiliated to unions organising the strikes,  should be responsible for halting the stoppages and contributing  to free and fair elections.    "Any action which harms the economy of the country is  harmful  to each and every voter."    Mr de Klerk denied the Transitional Executive Council had  proposed that the state of emergency regulations for Natal be  tightened. This was an oversimplified interpretation. The  Executive Council had adopted a resolution that certain  investigations should be conducted into the situation in the  region, Mr de Klerk said.    Reacting to a television cameraman's remark that he found  political developments confusing, Mr de Klerk said: "I don't  hold it against you. I thnk things are pretty confusing."</p>

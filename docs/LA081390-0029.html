			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BHUTTO DENIES CORRUPTION CHARGES, VOWS TO 'FIGHT ON';  </P> <P> PAKISTAN: THE OUSTED PRIME MINISTER BLAMES THE PRESS AND THE MILITARY FOR HER  DOWNFALL. SHE FEARS FOR HER SAFETY BUT STILL PLANS TO RUN FOR HER FORMER  OFFICE.  </P> <P> Three months ago, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto finally took action against the  corruption and incompetence that threatened her fragile government: She ordered  alterations at her family home, Bilawal House.  </P> <P> Workers suddenly surrounded the posh seaside villa with a 30-foot-high  reinforced-concrete wall topped with sharp spikes. Gun turrets, with slits for  machine guns, were put atop each corner. Barbed wire was laid out front.  </P> <P> Now, a week after Bhutto was abruptly deposed, the transformation of Bilawal  explains much of the tragedy of Benazir Bhutto, hailed only 20 months ago as a  champion of Pakistan's poor and a darling of Western democracy.  </P> <P> "She got increasingly arrogant," a Western diplomat said. "She got out of  touch. And she got paranoid."  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times inside the armed compound, Bhutto, who suffered  nearly five grim years in prison under the previous military regime, said she  is afraid today -- for herself and for Pakistan.  </P> <P> "I go to bed at night waiting for a knock on the door," she said softly.  "Normally, they come in the night to arrest you. Across the country, there's a  great deal of uncertainty. No one knows what's going to happen."  </P> <P> Backed by Pakistan's powerful, politicized army, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan  pledged free elections, citing corruption and misuse of power. Bhutto says she  will run and win what most predict will be a bitter and bloody campaign.  </P> <P> "The thought is quite traumatic," Bhutto said. "I think: 'Oh my God, do we want  to go through this again?' But then I think it's a matter of honor. The way  they dismissed us was so unjustified. So totally wrong. We must fight on."  </P> <P> But the 37-year-old Radcliffe and Oxford graduate said she will "not recognize"  or submit to special courts that the interim government is creating to  investigate charges -- made by diplomats, businessmen and analysts as well as  her opponents -- that Bhutto's government was the most openly corrupt in  Pakistan's 43-year existence.  </P> <P> Indeed, she refused to concede any corruption in her family or Cabinet. She  blamed the press instead.  </P> <P> "It's been trial by newspapers," she said angrily. "It's like witch hunts in  medieval times. We've been hounded by hearsay and rumor."  </P> <P> Alternately defiant, strident and appealing for sympathy, the first woman to  head a modern Islamic state defended her attempt to lead this impoverished  country and third-largest recipient of U.S. aid into a working democracy.  </P> <P> "My head is held high," she said. "I didn't make any compromises."  </P> <P> She also didn't make much progress. Bhutto leaves little but a souring economy,  a restive military and a cycle of urban terrorism and ethnic violence that has  killed at least 400 people this year here in Sind province, her home region.  </P> <P> Her administration passed two budgets, but nothing else. Businesses and  bureaucracies were burdened with 26,000 patronage appointees. Prices shot up  for food and fuel. She was headstrong and naive. Her aides were worse.  </P> <P> Bhutto admits her staff was "young and inexperienced," but she insists that  wasn't the problem.  </P> <P> "We were never given a chance," she argued. "From day one, our hands and feet  were tied. There was a whispering campaign, of intrigue, innuendo and slander."  </P> <P> Political rivals tried to bribe her supporters. She charged that religious  mullahs undermined her and that military intelligence tapped her phones,  compiled dossiers on key aides and spread false stories.  </P> <P> "This is political victimization," she said.  </P> <P> It's also familiar ground for Bhutto. Her courage as a political prisoner only  added to her charisma as an opposition leader after Pakistan's army strongman,  Gen. Zia ul-Haq, deposed her popular father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, and had him  hanged in 1979.  </P> <P> Bhutto never forgave the army for her father's death. Apparently they never  trusted her. After her election in November, 1988, the army kept control of  intelligence operations and most foreign policy, particularly concerning  Afghanistan and Kashmir, a disputed region claimed by India and Pakistan.  </P> <P> Analysts say the crunch came when Bhutto refused to give the army extralegal  powers to stop violence in Sind because she did not want to antagonize her  supporters there.  </P> <P> But Bhutto blames unnamed officials in military intelligence for bringing her  down. Their goal, she says, was to discredit democracy.  </P> <P> "That is why military intelligence is so dangerous," she said. "They sit there  and brief the army and the opposition with fabricated, handmade and concocted  stories."  </P> <P> Many, however, clearly don't believe Bhutto's denials of corruption.  </P> <P> Businessmen say kickbacks and payoffs were needed for everything from export  licenses to property loans. A banker complained that low-paid civil servants  were driving new Mercedes cars.  </P> <P> "The corruption is so blatant and so arrogant," he said. "And she never once  said: 'OK, let's clean house, let's look at the charges.' "  </P> <P> Bhutto insisted she asked for evidence but never got it. And she grew angry  when asked about her businessman husband, Asif Zardari, known for his polo  ponies and his alleged interests in government licenses for television,  telephones, oil and hotels.  </P> <P> "My husband is an honorable man," she said. "His businesses have not prospered.  They have suffered under my government. The charges against him are false and  baseless."  </P> <P> The night before, Zardari had entered a downtown political dinner like royalty.  Scores of burly, bearded men in traditional flowing shirts and upturned  slippers lined up to hug and kiss the only man sporting an expensively tailored  Western suit and the nickname "Mr. Ten Percent."  </P> <P> Zardari said he expects to be "the chief target" of the special corruption  courts. "Their goal is to use me to get to her," he said. "Let them do their  worst. I have nothing to hide."  </P> <P> For now, Bhutto works under semi-siege in Bilawal House, presiding over party  meetings, greeting well-wishers, sipping soft drinks. Aides hand out press  releases and warn darkly of impending arrests by a government packed with her  opponents.  </P> <P> On Sunday, police announced the arrests of five of Bhutto's associates, saying  they were the first cases in an investigation of corruption in her government.  </P></p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Savers: enemies of the State - Dominic Lawson demands a purge of those who are sabotaging the Party's plan IN STALIN'S Soviet Union the economy did not always go according to the five year plan. But it was, of course, impermissible to blame that on the plan itself. To do so would imply that the Communist Party under the leadership of Comrade Stalin was capable of error, an admission that would undermine the state. When things did go wrong in a very noticeable way, someone else had to take the blame. These people were called Wreckers. That was the generic term. The specific details of the Wreckers varied from five year plan to five year plan. They could be Mensheviks or Z ionists or on one more than usually paranoid occasion Doctors. Perhaps the time has arrived for the British Government to come up with a similar excuse. Like the old-style Communist Party it finds it absolutely impossible to admit of any error in its conduct of economic policy, let alone apologise for its mistakes. But the problem is, the public need someone to blame, they need a victim. The British government did, in its way, come up with some suitable Wreckers in the aftermath of the Exchange Rate Mechanism debacle. They were called Germans. Unfortunately we could not coerce the Germans into confessing that they had deliberately wrecked the British economy. Norman Lamont was unable to lock Helmut Schlesinger, the governor of the Bundesbank, in a cell to apply the torturer's time honoured persuasive techniques of sleep deprivation and electric shocks. No, like Stalin's NKVD, the British government must find its scapegoats among the more vulnerable indigenous population. They will be called the Savers. It is they who will be declared to be the deliberate saboteurs of the otherwise impeccably conceived and executed five year plans of the Politburo, otherwise known as Her Majesty's Treasury. The Savers have been coordinating their subversive campaign to wreck the economy for well over a year now. When the Treasury press office first put out their statement that 'the green shoots of recovery are clearly visible' early in 1991 the Savers deliberately cut back on their spending. Some of them used the obviously spurious excuse that they had been made redundant, and did not know where the next penny was coming from. Others, even more outrageously, said that although they were in work at the time, they feared they might be laid off in the near future, and would therefore save a greater proportion of their earnings. They did this in the clear knowledge that such a high level of saving would further delay the economic recovery of the Motherland. Some of the Savers, when captured and interrogated, will scream that they thought they were carrying out the policies of Major, the Supreme Leader, who had declared that inflation was the 'number one enemy of the Motherland'. These snivelling excuses will not be accepted by the courts. The recent cuts in interest rates, ordered by the proper political authorities - in contrast to the capitalist US where such things are decided by a totally undemocratic financiers' cabal - have met with a strong reaction from the Savers. They have wickedly decided to use this windfall - given to them by their generous government - to pay their mortgages and other outstanding debts. The result has been to nullify the new and unanimously acclaimed 'strategy for growth'. This has been a slap in the face for honest English shopkeepers, many of them Party members, who have been patiently sitting behind their counters waiting for customers to come in and spend all their money. Patriotic shopkeepers will be expected to hand in to the appropriate authorities the names of Savers who try to disguise their treachery by making occasional shopping forays. They can be detected by Stakhanovite shop assistants prepared to ask boldly and unconventionally the question 'Can I help you sir (or madam)?.' If the response is: 'I'm only browsing' or 'just looking', then a citizen's arrest may be made. Meanwhile, to those subversives who speculate that members of the cabinet are among those diverting their state-financed income to reduce their personal borrowings, the government's response will be: 'All bank overdrafts are equal, but some bank overdrafts are more equal than others.'

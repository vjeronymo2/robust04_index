			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: Lebanese bank stops trading GLOBE BANK, a small Lebanese privately-owned bank has closed for business and put all of its assets at the disposal of the Banque du Liban (BDL), Lebanon's central bank. BDL welcomed the move and promised to reimburse depositors as quickly as possible. Globe Bank is the third Lebanese bank this year to opt for 'self-liquidation', a process encouraged by BDL to reduce the number of banks competing in a market reduced by the 1975-90 civil war. The Libano-Bresilienne and Tohme banks closed last month. Four other small Lebanese banks declared bankruptcy late last year. Globe Bank and the BDL stressed the closure was by mutual agreement. A new Lebanese law enables banks to reimburse depositors through the Institut National de Garantie des Depots. Over the years, Lebanon's more than 80 banking establishments saw their capital base severely reduced by the fall in value of the Lebanese pound from LPounds 2.5 to the dollar before the war to a low of LPounds 1,200 to the dollar in the autumn of 1990. The Lebanese pound has for the past eight months stabilised at a rate of around LPounds 880 to the dollar. But the stabilisation of the pound eliminated currency speculation, which had become an important source of profit for some of the smaller banks. The bank closures have coincided with a dismal economic mood, provoked by Lebanon's failure to attract substantial foreign reconstruction aid and investment. The political atmosphere remains uncertain due to Israel's continued occupation of southern Lebanon, the unresolved question of parliamentary elections and doubts about the consequences of a scheduled withdrawal of Syrian troops to eastern Lebanon next September. Cabinet members continue to debate an austerity budget which would impose a 60 per cent ceiling on deficit spending. The original 1992 budget of LPounds 2,500bn (USDollars 2.84bn) is to be cut by nearly one-third - at a time when Lebanese trade unions are demanding a 60 per cent increase in the LPounds 75,000 monthly minimum wage. Proposed measures include the cancellation of transportation allowances for government and private sector employees and a higher tax on property sales and transfers.</p>

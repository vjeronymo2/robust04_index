			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A man accused of towing a record 56 tons of hashish and marijuana into San  Francisco Bay made his debut as his own lawyer and blamed the charges on former  Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese, among others. "This is just one of many cases being  played out across this country to justify the government expense for drug  interdiction," Calvin Robinson said in his opening statement to a federal court  jury in San Francisco. He said the laws under which he is being prosecuted were  "lobbied into existence by special-interest groups . . . the Elliot Nesses of  the '80s and '90s . . . Edwin Meese and Commissioner (William) von Raab," the  former head of U.S. Customs. Robinson also said he was innocent of smuggling.  Robinson, 47, of Napa, and his son, stepson and two nephews were arrested last  May when the Coast Guard seized a tug and barge and found 43 tons of hashish  and 13 tons of marijuana.  </P></p>

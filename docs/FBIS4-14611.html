			<p>BFN     [Text] The Belarusian Supreme Soviet has not made any  decision on the report presented by Alyaksandr Lukashenka, head  of the temporary legislative anticorruption commission.  Following examination of the report, none of the proposed draft  resolutions was adopted. After that, the parliament decided to  end its session, and the work of Lukashenka's commission as  well. However, in a conversation with journalists, A.  Lukashenka stated that the commission will continue to operate  in spite of the fact that six out of its nine members said they  no longer want to participate in it. In an interview with a  BELAPAN correspondent, Belarusian Supreme Soviet Chairman  Mechyslaw Hryb said that no decision was made with regard to  Lukashenka's report because the commission failed to present  deputies with specific evidence proving any wrongdoing on the  part of officials accused of corruption.</p>

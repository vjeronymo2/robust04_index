			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / BA warns strikes may force sell-off BRITISH Airways yesterday warned it would close or sell its restructured regional business if cabin crews in Manchester and Birmingham continued industrial action over pay cuts. Mr Robert Ayling, BA operations director, said: 'We can only keep this business running on the basis agreed in March, otherwise we will have to close the business or sell it to someone else.' He said no deadline had been set. Seven flights were cancelled following strikes at Manchester and Birmingham airports this month. BA has threatened to suspend without pay crew members taking further action. The union plans more one-day strikes and is balloting members over industrial action short of strikes. It is understood that earlier this year, BA had been on the point of signing over European and domestic services out of Birmingham and Manchester, as well as Highlands and Islands services, to a joint venture with Maersk Air, the UK investment arm of the Danish independent carrier. This was abandoned in March in favour of an in-house restructuring that would preserve jobs but cut labour costs. The Maersk deal would have saved an estimated Pounds 9m. The in-house restructuring is said to save Pounds 8.2m. Several airlines have taken similar steps to cut costs. Lufthansa, the German state carrier, is establishing a lower cost structure for domestic services. It will operate as a separate carrier under the name Lufthansa Express from October 25, and pay rates are intended to be lower than for Lufthansa. Mr Ayling said BA would not copy Lufthansa's strategy. Bassa, the section of the TGWU general union that represents the 500 cabin crew involved in the dispute, said the threat confirmed the fears of crews which had sought guarantees that the business would not be sold following the recent cost-cutting restructuring. Any buyer would have a 'rough ride' with 'angry' crews. The union denies that it agreed to new contracts under which about 1,000 crew members face pay cuts of Pounds 2,000 on annual salaries of Pounds 14,000, with no pay rise next year unless inflation is above 4 per cent. The union claims that its bargaining rights have also been reduced. BA insists agreement was reached. Last week BA made what it described as its final offer, worth about an extra Pounds 1,000 per crew member. The offer was designed to bring an end to the union's programme of one-day strikes and settle 221 legal actions by crew claiming breach of contract.</p>

The  spirit behind the GATT Uruguay Round agreement is that all  problems should be resolved multilaterally. One of the Uruguay  Round's major achievements was the decision to strengthen the  multilateral system as an advanced way of resolving  controversies." On 4 March, Amorim held a working meeting with  his Venezuelan counterpart, Angel Burelli Rivas, in La Guaira, a  city located near Caracas, to negotiate the signing of an  economic complementation agreement between their two countries.    Although Venezuela has no substantive trade problems with  the  United States -- as Burelli Rivas told GAZETA -- the Venezuelan  press gave wide coverage to the new measure announced by  President Bill Clinton. The Venezuelan media believe the Super  301 will give Clinton special powers to pressure Japan into  opening its market to U.S. products.    In the opinion of Burelli Rivas, the Super 301 could bring  problems to the United States within the GATT Uruguay Round  agreement.</p>

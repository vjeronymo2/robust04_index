			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 17 Apr (EFE) -- The situation of the  national electric power system is one of Cuba's most serious  problems, and, given this, it is currenty impossible to  eliminate power outages, Basic Industry Minister Marcos Portal  said in a lengthy television appearance.    Portal gave a detailed explanation of the causes that have  brought the power system to the brink of collapse, and he said  that with the measures now being implemented, Cuba might reach  60 percent of its generation capacity by December. During the  most critical days, capacity fell to 36 percent, which resulted  in relentless power outages, and today, according to the  minister, capacity is at about 50 percent.    He said one of the most important steps taken was to improve  the working conditions of laborers in this sector, mainly in  terms of provisions and incentives. This, along with the  startup of two new power plants, the purchase of $10 million in  spare parts, and strict control over public and private energy  consumption over the next few months, should alleviate the  situation by the end of the year.    "There are solutions, but we cannot accomplish miracles,"  Portal remarked, after pointing out the current crisis has been  caused by breakdowns and poor maintenance of the nation's  thermoelectric plants, the majority of which are Soviet and  Czech built; the country's difficult financial situation; and  the use of local crude, whose high sulfur content damages the  generators.    According to the minister, the supply of spare parts was  interrupted in 1990, and since then the thermoelectric plants  have been repaired or maintained with the reserve stock of spare  parts. Also, according to the minister, consumption of  electricity in homes increased 14 percent over the previous year  during the first quarter of 1994, mainly because of the use of  electric stoves, which are often homemade, because of a lack of  cooking gas, which is very scarce.    "It is not possible for every home to cook with electricity,  because the nation's power system could never assimilate the  demand," insisted Marcos Portal, after promising that, little by  little, the distribution of liquified gas would resume.    He also said "there are no privileges" in terms of power  interruptions.    He added that the incidents which occurred over the past few  days in some Havana neighborhoods were provoked "by malicious  people." Last week, the power outages lasted up to 20 hours in  different areas of the capital, which sparked angry protests of  residents and incidents in neighborhoods such as Alamar and  downtown Havana.</p>

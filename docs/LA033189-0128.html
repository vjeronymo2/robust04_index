			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Cerrell Buys Baer: Cerrell Associates Inc., a Los Angeles public relations firm  that has long specialized in political and governmental campaign consulting,  said it has purchased the Sherman Oaks public relations firm Daniel H. Baer  Inc. The purchase price was not disclosed. Joseph R. Cerrell, chairman of  Cerrell, said he hopes to expand his agency -- which is the 13th largest in Los  Angeles -- into one that handles more general public relations. "We started out  as a campaign management firm, but now that's just 16% of our total business,"  said Cerrell, whose agency has helped plan campaigns for such politicians as  John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Among the clients Baer brings to Cerrell  are General Telephone of California, Lockheed, Mattel and General Electric.  </P></p>

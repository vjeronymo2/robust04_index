			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Millwall halftime loss cut to Pounds 1.1m In the six months ended November 30 1991, Millwall Holdings turned in a loss of Pounds 1.1m, against Pounds 1.53m previously. The period included the three months close football season, when the football club received no income. Continuing activities accounted for Pounds 898,000 of the loss, from turnover of Pounds 872,000. In September the company disposed of Tavern Leisure for Pounds 2.4m cash. The sale gave rise to a profit of Pounds 877,000 in the holding company's accounts and to Pounds 441,000 in the group accounts. However, the group needs to reflect goodwill previously written off in the loss of disposal; therefore, an extraordinary loss of Pounds 1.98m will arise in the group accounts for the year. Losses per share for the half year were 0.98p (1.35p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kiril Vulchev] </F>   [Text] Sofia, June 13 (of BTA) -- The Russian  parliamentary delegation, which arrived late last night led by  Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the Upper Chamber of the Russian  Parliament, met with President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly  Chairman Aleksandur Yordanov, Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, and  Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov. The Russian delegation  includes the chairman of the Committee of Constitutional  Legislation and Judicial and Legal Affairs, Elena Mizulina, and  the members of the Upper Chamber's Committee Regulating Budget,  Financial, Exchange, Lending, Currency Issue, Taxation and  Customs Affairs, Mikhail Baskhmelnitsyn and Vladimir Chub.    "This visit to Bulgaria is not only a parliamentary one, it  is also a state visit. It is necessary to establish closer  political relations between Bulgaria and Russia, which will have  an effect on their economic relations as well," Mr. Shumeyko  said after his talk with the chairman of the Bulgarian  Parliament. According to the chairman of the Russian Upper  Chamber, it is impossible to treat all-European problems without  the participation of Bulgaria and Russia.    At their meeting Mr. Yordanov and Mr. Shumeyko stressed the  importance of the exchange of information between the Bulgarian  and the Russian Parliament; Mr. Shumeyko proposed to conclude an  agreement on interaction in the field of information and  exchange of experience in the sphere of legislation. "It is  very important that the Bulgarian parliamentary committees have  access to everything that is happening in Russia now," Mr.  Yordanov told reporters later. He believes that part of the  problems between Bulgaria and Russia can be resolved by  considering them first at the level of parliamentary committees.    The chairman of the Bulgarian Parliament said there were no  differences between Bulgaria and Russia about European  integration, NATO's defence structures and the Partnership for  Peace plan. "However, it should be taken into account that  Bulgaria and Russia are approaching the European structures from  different positions: Bulgaria is a typically European state, a  fact which has predetermined its Eurocentric foreign policy in  the last years, while things are much more complicated for  Russia because it is a vast state extending to Asia," Mr.  Yordanov said. In his view, Russia can itself become an  exponent of the integration idea in the contemporary world and  this is the path it has embarked on. Asked if he fears that the  intense interest Russian politicians have been showing in  Bulgaria of late could affect the process of Bulgaria's  integration with Europe and NATO, Mr. Yordanov replied in the  negative.    Mr. Shumeyko said that he and Mr. Yordanov did not discuss  the war in ex-Yugoslavia. "We paid little attention to the  Balkan crisis, because everything is clear -- what Bulgaria and  Russia seek is the earliest possible solution to the conflict in  Bosnia- Herzegovina," Mr. Yordanov said in turn. "Bulgaria has  been, and still is, suffering the heaviest losses of all as a  result of the embargo on ex-Yugoslavia and the crisis there,"  Mr. Yordanov recalled.    After his meeting with Prime Minister Berov, Mr. Shumeyko  said he hopes that during the visit by Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin to Bulgaria, scheduled for this autumn, the  two countries would conclude a number of efficient agreements  which their parliaments would ratified quickly thanks to the  present parliamentary talks. "Bilateral relations are never an  obstacle to the promotion of multilateral ones," Mr. Shumeyko  stated. "It is Mr. Berov and Mr. Shumeyko's shared opinion that  Bulgarian-Russian economic relations have made little progress  although a lot of governmental agreements were signed,"  Government Spokesman Raycho Raykov told the media. He said that  Mr. Berov and Mr. Shumeyko had considered the problem of mutual  indebtedness and the Bulgarian army's urgent need of spares for  nearly 100 percent of its facilities supplied by the ex-Soviet  Union.    The talks of Russian Upper Chamber Chairman Vladimir  Shumeyko  and Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov focussed on economic  cooperation. Mr. Daskalov told the media that the Russian  delegation wanted to know about any developments concerning the  consideration of Russia's bid for the Council of Europe (on May  11, 1994 Bulgaria took over the presidency of the Council of  Europe's Committee of Ministers for a term of six months).  "Russia is welcome as a full member of the Council of Europe  but will be admitted to it when it meets the criteria for  membership in the Council," Mr. Daskalov said. In his opinion,  Russia's bid for membership in the Council of Europe will be  considered during Bulgaria's presidency, but it will be  impossible to finalize the admission procedure within its term.  The Bulgarian foreign minister denied the allegations in some  Bulgarian papers that Russia had offered Bulgaria to form a  Belgrade-Sofia-Moscow axis.    "I have met a lot of presidents of late, but there are only  few you can talk with about any problem as frankly as with the  Bulgarian President," Mr. Shumeyko said after his meeting with  President Zhelev, the last on his formal meetings during the  visit. According to Mr. Shumeyko, most of the positions he and  Mr. Zhelev expressed are similar, but there were moments when  they had to explain things to each other -- the difference in  Russia's and Bulgaria's approach to the Partnership for Peace  initiative, for example. "Mr. Shumeyko conveyed greetings from  Russian President Boris Yeltsin to President Zhelev; the  Bulgarian President sent his best wishes to Mr. Yeltsin," Kamen  Velichkov, foreign policy advisor to the Bulgarian President,  told the media after the meeting.</p>

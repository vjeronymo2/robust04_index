			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System A new bout of pressure on the French franc, Belgian franc and Danish krone put more strain on the exchange rate mechanism's grid at the end of last week. At the close on Friday, some 8.13 percentage points divided the weakest currency in the system - the Danish krone - from the strongest - the Dutch guilder. The permitted fluctuation is 15 percentage points. Currencies, Page 29; Economic notebook, Page 17</p>

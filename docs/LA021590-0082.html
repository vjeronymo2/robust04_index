			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> CITY ALTERS WORK SCHEDULE  </P> <P> City Hall will close every other Friday to help meet anti-pollution standards  by reducing the number of vehicle trips by city employees, the City Council  decided Monday.  </P> <P> The new schedule, to start April 2, will affect about a third of the city's  employees but will not affect services, such as police, fire and maintenance  crews, according to personnel director Gordon Youngs.  </P> <P> City Hall will open 30 minutes earlier, at 7:30 a.m., and close 30 minutes  later, at 5:30 p.m., on days of operation. The affected employees will  therefore still be working 80 hours during each two-week period.  </P> <P> By closing every 10th day, Culver City will almost reach the goal of 1 1/2 city  employees per vehicle arriving to work set by the South Coast Air Quality  Management District, Youngs said. Failure to reach this goal could result in  heavy fines for the city.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 2 to approve the new hours, with Councilmen Jim  Boulgarides and Steven Gourley dissenting.  </P> <P> The majority felt that sacrificing one Friday of public access to city offices  is necessary to avoid the fines and help clean the air. Boulgarides and  Gourley, however, said City Hall should be open five days a week and that the  city could meet the anti-pollution standards through other means.  </P> <P> April 6 is the first Friday City Hall will close due to the new hours, Youngs  said.  </P></p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Iran calls attacks 'conspiracy' TEHRAN yesterday accused the west of a 'calculated conspiracy' to disrupt its elections later this week, after weekend attacks by anti-government Iranian protesters on Iranian missions overseas. The attacks by supporters of the Mujahideen Khalq opposition group followed Sunday's bombing raids by eight Iranian F-4 jets on Mujahideen bases in Iraq  -the first Iranian air strike against its neighbour since the end of the 1980-88 Gulf war. Iraq has complained to the UN Security Council about the raids, France yesterday condemned the raids, saying they risked igniting further violence in the region. 'Regional peace could be in danger,' said Mr Daniel Bernard, Foreign Ministry spokesman. He also condemned the subsequent attacks on Iranian embassies. Ambassadors from countries in which Iranian embassies were attacked were summoned to the Foreign Ministry in Tehran yesterday for a strong protest. A ministry spokesman was quoted as saying that the demonstrators should be extradited and compensation paid for damage to the missions. The raid also revived hostile exchanges between the two former belligerents, with Iran demanding that Iraq cease supporting the Mujahideen. Iraqi newspapers meanwhile condemned the raid, suggesting that the US lay behind the bombing.</p>

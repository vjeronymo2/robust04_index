			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Compensation for Brockbank underwriter Shareholders in Brockbank, the Lloyd's managing agency, are expected today to approve payment to the group's lead underwriter of Pounds 1.88m compensation plus 500,000 new shares for cancelling a profit-sharing deal, writes Ralph Atkins. The package is being offered to Mr Mark Brockbank as the group seeks shareholder approval to demerge its Lloyd's members' agency interests. Some of the companies concerned face legal claims by lossmaking Names. Under the original contract, Mr Brockbank, who owns about 18 per cent of the group, received 15 per cent of the net profit commission retained by the managing agencies. Brockbank said it now wanted to set up a new bonus pool for key staff. Brockbank's shares, which trade under Rule 4.2, currently stand at about 200p.</p>

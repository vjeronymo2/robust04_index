Independent observers in Yucatan catalogued a series of irregularities in a random sample of 250 voting booths, out of a total 1,400. In 115 of the booths there was no guarantee of a secret vote; in 101 there was pressure to vote for the ruling party; some 292 people voted without credentials; and 292 who wanted to vote could not. Under state law, if there are irregularities in more than 20 per cent of the voting booths, elections have to be cancelled. 'Nobody at this moment can assure that the elections were legitimate,' said Mr Julio Faesler, president of Council for Democracy. 'The situation is in sharp contrast to the promises of democracy made at the federal level.'</p>

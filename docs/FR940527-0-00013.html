The request will not be deemed to have been received by the Corporation until such payment is made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In the event that the Corporation determines that an estimated fee will exceed $250, the requester shall be notified of the amount of the anticipated fee or such portion thereof as can readily be estimated. Such notification shall be transmitted as soon as possible, but in any event within five working days of such determination, giving the best estimate then available. The notification shall offer the requester the opportunity to confer with appropriate representatives of the Corporation for the purpose of reformulating the request so as to meet the requester's needs at a reduced cost.

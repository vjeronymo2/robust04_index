			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (6): Waiting for better luck - Spain and Portugal have had recent setbacks Hesitations over public offerings by the governments of Spain and Portugal are understandable. When Endesa, Spain's big electrical utility, tapped the markets in June and when Cimpor, Portugal's largest cement producer, followed suit a month later, the results left much to be desired. Both Spain and Portugal have lacked momentum over recent months and certainly neither, though they have comparatively cheap markets in common, seems set for an early recovery and turnaround. 'Spain has not got a stand-alone story,' says Ms Anna MacDonald of London's Smith New Court. Much the same can be said for Portugal. 'Potential underwriters are telling companies thinking about offerings: wait,' says Mr Juan Cueto of Madrid brokers Ibersecurities. 'There have been unhappy experiences recently.' The Endesa offering, which was affected in subsequent months by the sustained volatility of the Madrid market, is likely to delay a public offering of Repsol, Spain's state-controlled oil, gas and chemicals group, until next year. Before the electrical utility came on offer, INH, the state energy holding company, had planned to reduce its 41 per cent stake in Repsol to around 20 per cent. A final decision on the Repsol timing is expected by the end of this month. The energy company is talking to the team that handled previous offerings - Lazards, Goldman Sachs and Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya - and the shared view at present is that little is to be gained from an 'uphill' move on the markets. A second privatisation phase of Cimpor, ranging from 20 to 25 per cent of the company and aimed at foreign investors, which had also been scheduled for the coming months, is also likely to be pushed back until 1995. 'We'll probably see the government going for controlled auctions because it won't be able to rely on the market,' said a London-based merchant banker close to the cement company. Should there be an offering, it can be taken for granted that Cimpor will seek to avoid the mistakes in July that led to a lukewarm response from foreign investors. Chief among the errors was the failure to appoint a global co-ordinator and the absence of any meaningful book building. The lesson for the Portuguese authorities was that going to the international markets without the appropriate technology is akin to shooting oneself in the foot. Applying these lessons will, nevertheless, require legis- lative changes as well as an overhaul in the financial culture of those who take decisions in Portugal's public companies. Cimpor, which raised Es39.6bn (Dollars 241bn) in its disposal of 20 per cent of the state-held equity, was in particular penalised by the legal rulings that caused the Lisbon government to fix the offer price at a cabinet meeting held a full two months before the cement company was on the market. Between the price fixing and the subscription period, the Portuguese market fell 15 per cent. In this respect any legislative change will, at the very least, have to reduce the government's role in an offer to that of establishing a price range instead of a fixed figure. It would also help, as one aggrieved underwriter in the Cimpor offering put it, 'if it were publicly announced that there is a real interest in the foreign markets and in having foreign institutions aboard.' The Cimpor experience will probably be a salutary one as Lisbon prepares for future privatisations and there will undoubtedly be global co-ordinators in place should Portugal's telecommunications group and its electricity generating company take the plunge and make offerings next year. In Spain the problem is not one of expertise. Global offerings in partial privatisation programmes have become very familiar, and profitable, to the likes of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and SG Warburg. Nor is there any difficulty about what is on offer; companies such as Endesa and Repsol can, all things being equal, sell themselves without difficulty. Nonetheless, the prospects are blurred by the overall market performance. The Endesa offering in June, which reduced the state equity in the utility by 9 per cent to 65 per cent, ended up raising only Pta 144bn (Dollars 106m) against the Pta200bn that had been confidently expected when the disposal was planned in February. 'We've had really bad luck with the markets over the past three months and our subscription period closed on a particularly bad day for equities,' a member of Endesa's treasury team said ruefully at the time. Everything that has happened in the intervening months leads Repsol's finance experts to fear the worst should they tap the markets before Christmas. But Repsol does not need that risk factor, particularly as the Spanish treasury, though concerned about the government deficit, is not under such great pressure that it cannot afford to wait. Instead, financial analysts are turning their attention to Telefonica, Spain's 32 per cent government-owned telecommunications group, and in particular to Tisa, the group's profitable international subsidiary which has grown into the biggest foreign operator in the fast-growing Latin American market. The parent company is at present locked in negotiations with AT&amp;T and GTE, which could lead to both US companies becoming Tisa shareholders as part of an ever-growing expansion programme in the Hispanic world. To judge by Tisa's expressed ambitions, once such a shareholding venture is sealed and delivered, the next move will be to seek fresh capital on the international markets.</p>

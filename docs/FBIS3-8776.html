			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The National Coordinating Council of the Union of  Democratic Forces [SDS] decided to hold the Sixth SDS National  Conference on 14-15 May. The forum will discuss issues related  to the election tactics, the future government, and the SDS's  partners.    It was pointed out that the attitude of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party [BSP] toward the government is totally  irresponsible. The country's economic and political situation  and the questionable status of the cabinet require the urgent  initiative of President Zhelev, who, according to the SDS, must  immediately begin consultations with the political forces.    The SDS sees the only solution to the situation in the  country as early elections.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LONG SHINES IN SHADOW OF HIS FATHER;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: SON OF 1964 OLYMPIC CHAMPION SETS HIS OWN ATHLETIC COURSE AS AN  OFFENSIVE LINEMAN FOR NEWPORT HARBOR.  </P> <P> Growing up with his body and his last name, Ian Long has had to answer a  seemingly endless string of questions.  </P> <P>  My but you're a big boy. How much you weigh anyhow?  </P> <P>  "I'm 6-feet-6, 288 pounds right now."  </P> <P>  And you say your name is Long? Any relation to Dallas Long, the shot-putter?  </P> <P>  "That's right. He's my dad."  </P> <P>  Your daddy was the Olympic champ in '64. You must be pretty good at it too?  You do throw the shot, don't you?  </P> <P>  "Nope."  </P> <P> Ian Long is a senior offensive tackle for Newport Harbor High School, a young  man eager to set his own course in the athletic world.  </P> <P> It's enough that Long inherited his father's mammoth body, his athletic skills  and his competitive spirit. And it's enough that he has to answer the questions  concerning his father, who won the gold medal in Tokyo in 1964 and the bronze  in Rome in 1960.  </P> <P> Ian Long is not interested in winning Olympic medals. He wants to be a football  player and he wants to earn his own acclaim in his own sport.  </P> <P> So far he has fared well enough.  </P> <P> He's a second-team all-Sea View League lineman for a team that has reached the  second round of the Southern Section Division VI playoffs. The Sailors (9-2)  play La Quinta (7-4) at 7:30 tonight at Bolsa Grande High.  </P> <P> Right now, the most important thing to Long is tonight's game. Not a possible  college career, not postseason honors and not comparisons to his father.  </P> <P> In fact, that's the last thing Long wants. And that's why he plays football and  doesn't go out for the track and field team.  </P> <P> "I don't want to be like my dad," Long said. "He doesn't expect me to be like  him. He wants me to go on in football and be successful there."  </P> <P> There have been hurdles for Long to clear, though.  </P> <P> One is his size.  </P> <P> Having grown to 6-6, 288 by his 18th birthday, one wonders if Long's stature is  a blessing or a curse.  </P> <P> On one hand, size alone piques the interest of college recruiters. On the  other, interest brings pressure and expectations that can easily surpass  talent.  </P> <P> So when Long showed up on the Newport Harbor campus as a 220-pound freshman,  Coach Jeff Brinkley decided he had better take it slow and easy. No sense  rushing things.  </P> <P> Brinkley considered Long's amiable personality, his athletic talents, his  potential and his strong desire to improve and established a game plan for the  long haul.  </P> <P> The goal was to make Long the best offensive lineman he could be.  </P> <P> "We set a course for his high school career," Brinkley said. "It's been a  year-by-year thing. I think Ian's progress has been steady. It's to the point  now that you see the progress game by game. That's encouraging."  </P> <P> Long said the past three games -- victories over Glenn in the first round of  the playoffs, archrival Corona del Mar and Saddleback -- have been among the  best he has played.  </P> <P> A patient program has helped, he said. He has learned that you don't always  have to overpower opponents, that brains and brawn can be a devastating  combination.  </P> <P> "He's set some realistic goals," Brinkley said. "We've just motivated him and  maximized his abilities."  </P> <P> Long's future is getting brighter and brighter.  </P> <P> "I think he'll probably get a full ride to a major university," Brinkley said.  "He'll work hard on the weights. It's possible he'll redshirt his first year.  They'll start the process of year-by-year improvement again. And by the time  he's a senior, he should be a good offensive tackle."  </P> <P> And that would suit Long just fine.  </P></p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television Every year a few more artists or series are considered worthy of a Christmas special, so every year they spread further into the days surrounding the actual holiday. Today they are all over the place. Christmas In Vienna (7.30 BBC2) is a concert from the City Hall featuring Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Diana Ross, and it sounds a bit like sacha torte: sweet enough to make your teeth ache. Stretching out half-hour comedies into much longer specials often results in failure. Whether the outstanding Waiting For God can survive, we shall have to wait and see. Since much of the strength comes from the superb acting of Stephanie Cole and Graham Crowden as the rebellious couple in an old people's home it may fare better than most (8.00 BBC1). Jack Dee is a perfectly good comedian but it seems doubtful whether he could sustain a 60-minute special; hence the various guests, presumably, in The Jack Dee Show (9.00 C4). Best of the lot is likely to be Lenny Henry: In Dreams (9.30 BBC1). His special last year, 'Bernard And The Genie', was one of the best of the Christmas programmes.</p>

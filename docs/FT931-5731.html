A total of 13.64m shares will be placed at 110p. On the basis of fully-taxed pro-forma earnings of 7.2p, that puts the shares on an historic multiple of 15.3p. Net assets per share were 62.4p as at December 31. Dealings are expected to begin on March 9. The company was founded by Mr Mike Firth, chairman and chief executive, and has expanded by buying from Berisford International businesses which process and package dried fruit and nuts. Yorkshire Foods made an operating profit of Pounds 3.87m in 1992 on sales of Pounds 63.2m. The company said that trading in the current year had started well. The placing, sponsored by Panmure Gordon, will raise Pounds 12m of new money. After the payment of expenses and redemption of certain classes of preference shares, it will provide Pounds 7.3m additional working capital for the group. The company's aim is to build a large food manufacturing group, and it is likely to make further purchases soon.</p>

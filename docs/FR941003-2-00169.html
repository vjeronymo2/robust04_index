			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  Specifically, the Commission finds the amendment to OFPA A&hyph;2 permitting Specialists to accept contingency orders, as defined in Phlx Rule 1066, without prior Floor Official approval, will remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by facilitating quicker and more efficient executions of such contingency orders. While the Commission believes that it is permissible for Specialists to retain the ability to refuse to accept contingency orders as market conditions necessitate, the Commission also believes that the proposed amendment to OFPA A&hyph;2 requiring the express approval of two Floor Officials in order for a Specialist to refuse to accept a contingency order from a customer account will serve to prevent Specialists from arbitrarily rejecting such customer orders, and will thereby help to protect investors and the public interest. In this regard, the Commission would expect the Phlx to monitor this area to assure that orders are not arbitrarily or unfairly being refused. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78f(b)(5) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds that the expansion of Phlx Rule 1066(c) to include four additional types of contingency orders is consistent with the Act and the rules thereunder, as well as the rules of other self-regulatory organizations which trade option products. Specifically, the definitions of all-or-none, <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  opening-only-market, <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  and market-on-close <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  orders are consistent with the definitions contained in the rules of other options self-regulatory organizations, all of which rules have been previously approved by the Commission. In addition, although not contained in the rules of other self-regulatory organizations, the ability, or in some cases the responsibility, of Exchange members to submit cancel-replacement orders in appropriate circumstances is set forth in Phlx OFPA A&hyph;7(b), which was previously approved by the Commission. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> American Stock Exchange, Inc.

OFPA A&hyph;7(b) states that in order to effect a change in the option series of an order placed on the Specialist book, a member shall submit separate cancel and replacement orders to the Specialists. In order to effect a change in the price or volume of an order placed on the Specialist book, a member may submit the appropriate cancel and replacement ticket or tickets to the Specialist. In Release No. 30670, the Commission found that this provision ``served the needs of investors and promotes investor confidence in the quality and integrity of the Phlx's options market by requiring specialists to respond promptly to cancellation instructions and to indicate immediately that the cancellation was accepted or that the cancellation was too late, and therefore, that the order was executed.'' In addition, the Commission found that the provision ``will improve the execution of customer orders by providing an efficient procedure for submitting changes in the terms of an order on the specialist's book.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Commission also finds that the proposed amendments to the definitions of stop (stop-loss) and stop-limit orders in Rule 1066(c) merely clarify the current definitions of those terms, and therefore present no new regulatory issues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also finds that the amendment to OFPA A&hyph;2's fine schedule to increase the penalties for infractions thereof will continue to provide a fair and effective means to enforce compliance with the provisions and thereby promote just and equitable principles of trade and the protection of investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, OFPA A&hyph;2(ii) permits specialists to accept spread, straddle, or combination orders, as those terms are defined in Phlx Rule 1066(d), (g) and (h), respectively with the express approval of one Floor Official. However, because such orders are discretionary in nature, and Section 11(a) of the Act <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  prohibits specialists from accepting discretionary orders, the Phlx has amended OFPA A&hyph;2 to prohibit specialists from accepting such orders, regardless of Floor Official approval. Thus, the purpose of Amendment No. 4 is merely to conform OFPA A&hyph;2 with the requirements and prohibitions of the Act, and necessarily serves to promote just and equitable principles of trade and protect investors and the public interest. Therefore, the Commission finds that no new regulatory issues are raised by Amendment No. 4. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 4 on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78k(a). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 4 to the proposed rule change.

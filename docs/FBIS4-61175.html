The Ukrainian Government  group was headed by Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov and  the delegation from the G-7 countries by Antonio Puri Purini,  authorized minister and head of the seventh department's working  group on nuclear safety. This meeting was of a consultative  nature, dealing mostly with issues of nuclear safety in Ukraine.  They discussed cooperation by donor countries of the fund for  nuclear safety, the EBRD, and other influential international  organizations with Ukraine in technical, economic, and financial  aspects. The sides, therefore, expressed readiness for joint  action in the area of the safe exploitation of atomic energy and  improving the state of the environment.    However, the word Chernobyl was often heard because one of  the main conditions for all-round help from the G-7 countries to  Ukraine is not only in resolving the problems of nuclear safety  but also in strengthening the economy and the gradual closure of  the Chernobyl AES [nuclear electric power station] generating  sets.</p>

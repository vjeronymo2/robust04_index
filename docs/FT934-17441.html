			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / World Bank to study Kenya aid squeeze THE WORLD Bank last night announced it had agreed to chair a consultative group meeting on Kenya in November, paving the way for an end to a two-year aid squeeze. In a statement last night the bank said that it was 'encouraged by the substantial measures taken recently (by the government) and by its commitment to continue these efforts'. The statement followed talks this week with Kenyan officials in Washington. Apart from steps to reduce mismanagement in the financial sector, the measures include abolition of import licensing, curbs on money supply, moves toward a market-driven exchange system, and reform of maize prices, said officials of the bank. The officials said they expected the government to complete the purge of the banking sector while continuing to implement reforms in other sectors. The decision marks a significant step in the return to international respectability of President Daniel arap Moi, subjected to aid 'sanctions' in November 1991 by donors angered by his government's economic mismanagement and human rights abuses. At the 1991 meeting of the consultative group in Paris, chaired by the bank, donors announced that they were withholding their response to Kenya's request for new assistance. Aid in the previous two years had been worth some Dollars 1.4bn. 'Delegates made clear their willingness to support Kenya's economic development, but stressed that levels of aid also depend on clear progress in implementing economic and social reforms,' the donors said. Within two weeks Mr Moi lifted the ban on multi-party politics. A general election which followed a year later saw Mr Moi returned to power amid opposition allegations of rigging. In the 12 months since then Mr Moi's new cabinet has turned its attention to a growing economic crisis, its efforts reinforced by the damaging shortfall in vital aid flows.</p>

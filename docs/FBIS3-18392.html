			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] A poll of supporters of the Swedish  political parties indicates that if New Democracy were to break  up before the election, most of its supporters would switch to  the Moderates or the Social Democrats. Supporters of various  parties were surveyed in October 1993 by IMU on their attitudes  toward the other parties; Lars Ryding reported the results in  the 7 February SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 11. Respondents were  asked whether they would consider voting for a party, the  alternatives being: would definitely vote for the party, would  consider it, probably would not, or absolutely would not. Of the  21 percent who said they would consider voting for New  Democracy, 57 percent also had positive attitudes toward the  Moderates and 53 percent toward the Social Democrats. The other  parties made out less well, although the nonsocialist parties  would get the majority of voters. A total of 40 percent would  consider voting for the Center Party, 31 percent for the Green  Party, 29 percent for the Liberals, 20 percent for the Christian  Democrats, and 17 percent for the Left Party.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Collor signs treaty on greenhouse gases THE Earth Summit has produced its first result, with the signing by Brazil's President Fernando Collor of one of two treaties being considered by the conference - on climate change. The treaty aims to oblige countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide, which are believed to result in global warming. But like most conference documents it has been widely denounced as ineffective, and some countries are exploring ways to strengthen it. The crucial weakness is that it does not impose any targets or deadlines on signatory countries. The original intention was to require that CO emissions be reduced to their 1990 levels by the year 2000. But the US - worried about the economic impact  -took exception to this and argued it was more important to concentrate on ways to cut emissions than on specific targets. As a result the treaty now only requires signatories to formulate plans 'with the aim of' returning emissions to their 1990 levels. But there are other provisions in the treaty to give it clout. For example, the industrialised countries which produce the greatest amount of CO must produce their plans within six months of the treaty coming into force (which happens after 50 countries have ratified). Developing countries have up to three years. The wealthier countries have also agreed to provide financial assistance and technology to Third World nations to help them deal with global warming. But the precise terms on which this help will be given, and how much of it will be available, is still the subject of tough bargaining. There is agreement, though, that for now all aid will be channelled through the Global Environment Facility, a financing vehicle jointly administered by the UN and World Bank. Signatories will also have to provide and regularly update information about emissions and plans for dealing with them. There will be two formal reviews of progress by all signatories before the end of the century. Germany has offered to host the first. Two constituencies which have welcomed the treaty in its softer final form are the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and the business community. Opec is still worried the treaty will lead to carbon taxes and other measures to curb use of oil, but the threat is now reduced. The International Chamber of Commerce feels the treaty is a good thing now it is less restrictive. Mr Michael Kohn, chairman of the ICC energy commission, described it as 'a realistic and significant step forward'. But many countries wish it was tougher. Ms Ruth Feldgrill-Zankel, the Austrian environment minister, is trying to drum up support for a 'declaration of like-minded countries' who would voluntarily subscribe to tighter targets. 'I was convinced from the beginning that we should give clear signals,' she said. She has the backing of Switzerland and the Netherlands, but other potential supporters are not keen on side declarations. Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, regretted the treaty 'unfortunately does not contain an adequately binding commitment to CO stabilisation'. But he pointed out that EC countries have already set stabilisation targets. IN an apparent attempt to seize the initiative and fill the Earth Summit's leadership vacuum, Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, said yesterday he was leading a move for an EC declaration on stronger action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. He also called on other countries to commit themselves to stabilising emissions by the year 2000 and for signatories to act before the convention becomes effective. Mr Topfer said he would like to see EC and EFTA countries joining forces on the issue. A senior EC official confirmed yesterday that the Community was preparing a statement calling for immediate action on emission reduction, to be read by Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, when he signs a treaty on climate change later this week. A joint European move emphasising dissatisfaction with the treaty, which was weakened to accommodate American concerns, would increase US isolation at the summit. US fears of this were highlighted when Mrs Ruth Feldgrill-Zankel, the Austrian environment minister, confirmed she had received a cable from Washington requesting she drop moves for an initiative to strengthen the treaty. She said the strongly-worded cable had been 'based on a misunderstanding' and added that her initiative was 'far from dead'.</p>

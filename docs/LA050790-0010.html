			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANIMAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS  </P> <P> Your declaration of contempt for the animal rights movement (editorial,  "Animals or Humans?" April 27) is so filled with warped reasoning,  anthropocentric piety, and loaded rhetoric that I scarcely know where to begin  to object. Perhaps with your silly claim that "to save the life of the lowliest  child . . . in the furthest reaches of Bangladesh" you would sacrifice any  animal "from hamster to great whale." As though animal rights advocates --  those diabolical, "hot-eyed," "unthinking zealots" -- prefer hamsters to dying  children and positively salivate at the thought of depopulating the hinterlands  of Bangladesh.  </P> <P> Of course there are "unthinking zealots" in the animal rights movement (as  there are on editorial staffs), but animal rights advocates on the whole are  law-respecting, humane people who have nothing to gain except the hope of  correcting what they perceive to be a terrible injustice. Moreover, their  purpose is not, as you claim, "to force a halt to the use for medical  research." Only a small percentage of laboratory animals are used for medical  research. Estimates vary from 6% to 33%. In this country alone, tens of  millions of animals whose only crime consists in their failure to be members of  the human species are caged, pinioned, irradiated, shocked, poisoned, shot, cut  open, implanted with diodes, and inevitably killed and discarded in  laboratories for purposes that have nothing to do with saving human lives or  reducing human suffering.  </P> <P> Thus the question is not "Animals or Humans?" but "Do we humans really want  cosmetics and toilet bowl cleaners at the cost of blinding rabbits and  torturing hamsters?" Do we really want to shoot hundreds of cats in the head in  order to discover what has been known since 1894 about brain injuries? Do we  really want biology and psychology students to go on repeating routine,  painful, death-dealing experiments with animals in order to learn what they  could easily discover from watching a film?  </P> <P> And do we really want to go on diminishing our own humanity on the arrogant  assumption that we have the right to exploit anything and everything on this  planet that can serve our self-declared higher interests?  </P> <P> JAMES L.

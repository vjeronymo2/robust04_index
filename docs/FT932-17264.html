			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Tampella disposal ends link with forestry FINLAND'S Tampella group is ending a century-long involvement in forestry through a FM3.6bn (Dollars 609m) sale of operations to Enso-Gutzeit, one of the country's leading pulp and paper groups. The agreement cuts Tampella's debt burden sharply and leaves it free to concentrate on its international metal engineering business. It also makes Enso one of Europe's top three newsprint manufacturers and the leading corrugated board producer in Scandinavia. Enso is acquiring Tampella Forest and Tambox Europe and lifting its stake in Sunila, a pulping company, to 47.5 per cent from 20 per cent. It is taking over FM2.6bn in debt and paying FM1bn, FM800m of which will be funded through a new share issue. The deal involves a reshuffle of state-owned assets as the state has a 57.8 per cent stake in Enso and holds more than 90 per cent of Tampella shares. The Bank of Finland, which holds the Tampella shares through an earlier rescue of Skopbank, has made it clear that it does not want to be a long-term industrial owner and the disposal should help it find new owners for the remaining business. The operations being sold had combined sales of FM3.35bn in 1992, and though lossmaking last year, are expected to return to profit in 1993. Tampella Forest is Europe's leading manufacturer of uncoated wood-containing book papers and its third-largest producer of special newsprint, with operations in Finland, Germany and Spain. Tambox Europe specialises in corrugated board and has eight mills in Finland, Sweden and Italy. The main effect of the deal will be to give Enso an enhanced position in newsprint production, as it will have a 1.2m tonne capacity when combined with a mill being built in Germany. It will also bolster its position within packaging and saw-milling. 'Advantages will be gained through streamlining and through a more intensive use of marketing,' said Mr Jukka Harmala, Enso chief executive.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / FT Guide to Investment Trusts (3): Simpler - and yet more complicated - The different types of trust and share available to private investors The investment trust industry's campaign to sell its wares to private investors has had one ironic consequence: investment trust shares are considerably harder for even professional investors to understand than they were a few years ago. For, while the industry has simplified with one hand, it has complicated with the other. It has simplified by making it easier for private investors to buy shares in traditional broadly-based trusts, notably through savings schemes. But it has added fresh complications: first, by introducing a range of specialist trusts, notably 'split-capital' trusts; and second, by introducing 'warrants' for many trusts of all types. Split-capital trusts embrace packages of different securities, designed to cater for various specific investment needs, and are difficult for the private investor to understand let alone assess. They are the investment trust industry's answer to the array of packaged products on offer from insurance companies and unit trust groups, and are designed mainly to appeal to investment advisers. Warrants, which give investors the right to buy investment trust shares at a given price in the future for a given period of time, became fashionable as a sop to buyers of new issues. They acquire value rapidly if the underlying shares do well. Both split-level trusts and warrants can be be perfectly efficient instruments - in knowledgeable hands. But they do rather muddy the water when private investors are searching for old-fashioned trusts to buy themselves. Around 50 of the 260-odd investment trusts are split-capital ones, and they have between two and five different types of security each: over 100 different quoted shares. And there are also over 100 quoted warrants attached to traditional trusts. So the private investor now has to pick his way through well over 400 different securities when looking for an investment trust to buy. That's nearly as daunting as trying to choose between the 1,500 or so unit trusts on offer. But it's not impossible. This is what you need to do: Clarify your investment objectives; Understand which types of trust and which types of security should help you achieve those objectives; Decide whether you are going to make your own selection or rely on advice from a financial adviser; and Make your choice - or weigh up your adviser's recommendations. The Association of Investment Trust Companies* divides its members into different categories, to make it easier to find the type of trust you want. Investment objectives First, do you want capital growth or income, or a mixture? If you want a mixture, you should probably stick to ordinary shares in one of the old-fashioned general trusts. These have shares in a number of companies in a number of different countries. If you want most of your money to remain in British companies, you may find it easiest to stick to UK general trusts. But many of the international general trusts have around half their portfolio in British companies. So if you are prepared to do a bit of digging, you can enjoy a much wider choice. But some of the trusts in these categories are rather more specialised than you might expect. So always check what the trust actually does, not just its category. Stepped preference shares, which provide regular pre-set increases in both income and capital are worth considering for investors who do not need to squeeze the last ounce of income out of their holdings. Growth If you want capital growth, you have two main choices. You can look at trusts in the UK and international growth sectors, or ones concentrating on particular geographic areas, such as America, Japan or the currently fashionable emerging markets. As we explain elsewhere in this guide, some of these are much riskier than others. But it is perfectly possible for an intelligent layman to concoct a short-list of possibilities, look at their objectives, their long-term performance, and technical factors (such as 'gearing' and the discount) and make his own mind up. The alternative route, buying some of the shares of split-capital trusts, can be dangerous without expert advice. Possibilities are capital shares, zero-dividend preference shares, and stepped preference shares. Very broadly, stepped preference shares are the most predictable; zeros promise a known return provided you hold them to redemption; capital shares are a high risk/high return instrument whose attractions can vary dramatically over a relatively short period of time. Two other possibilities for capital growth are warrants and index funds, and index-linked loan stocks. They are at opposite end of the risk spectrum. Index funds work much like an indexed unit trust. Index-linked loan stocks are an interesting alternative, which guarantee precisely to match a given stockmarket index when they are repaid, and pay the same interest meanwhile  -but the market price can fluctuate in the interim Warrants are another high risk/high return choice. If the price at which the warrant entitles you to buy the underlying share is below the market price of that share, it has a fairly obvious intrinsic value, which will rise (and fall) more sharply than the underlying share. Those with several years before expiry also have a more uncertain additional 'time' value. But a warrant which gives you the right to buy the underlying share at more than its current price and is near to its expiry date is valueless. Warrants are essentially speculative - ie, they can give an interesting fillip to a growth portfolio, but should never form the bulk of it. Income Investors interested primarily in income again have a number of different routes open to them. If you plan to make your own decisions, consider either investing in income trusts or buying a growth trust and periodically selling some of the shares in order to produce an income. (Discretion is obviously necessary here). Split-capital trusts have two types of share designed to produce a high income - income shares and ordinary income shares. But their prospects of capital growth, or even maintenance, are varied: some return none of your capital and the return on others is unpredictable. Tax considerations will influence your choice. Zeros, for example, are useful for people who want to turn income into capital, certain types of income share (known as annuity shares) do the reverse. Unless you are prepared to work hard to understand the subject, you are probably safer getting professional advice if buying any of the shares of split-level trusts. *AITC: telephone 071 588-5347 Useful books: SG Warburg Private Investor Guide to Investment Trusts, Pounds 15, tel: 071 382-4846; Credit Lyonnais Investment Trust Yearbook 1994, Pounds 19.95, tel 071 588-4000; River &amp; Mercantile Guide to Split Capital Investment Trusts, Pounds 4, tel 071 405-7722</p>

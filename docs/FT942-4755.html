			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Major appeals for traditional Tory votes in Euro poll Mr John Major issued a last minute plea to traditional Conservative voters to oppose a centralised federal Europe as the final stages of the European elections campaign erupted yesterday into a row over job creation. With all three party leaders winding up their campaigns at set-piece rallies, the prime minister focused his attention on persuading traditional Tory supporters not to abstain tomorrow in protest at the government's domestic record. In an implicit acknowledgement that the government needs to muster its core support to avoid an electoral catastrophe, Mr Major said protest votes and abstentions would severely damage Britain's interests in Europe. He told a rally in London that the campaign had shown 'we are the only party prepared to fight day in and day out for Britain's best interests in Europe'. But Labour and the Liberal Democrats insisted the poll would be a referendum on Mr Major's record record since the 1992 general election. Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting Labour leader, said that voters would be rejecting a government which was 'divided over Europe, riven with incompetence and incapable of telling the truth'. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, urged voters to deliver their verdict on a government which had 'broken its election promises and betrayed the hopes of the people'. The speeches came as the three main parties were embroiled in a fierce row over the implications for Britain of the report produced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on the working of labour markets. A clearly delighted Mr Major was joined by a phalanx of senior ministers in insisting the report amounted to a ringing endorsement of the government's emphasis on deregulated and flexible markets. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, said the conclusions had exposed Labour's commitment to a minimum wage as a recipe for job destruction. But Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, led an opposition counter-attack based on the OECD's call for flexible markets to be balanced by greater emphasis on education and training. In surprisingly confident mood at last night's rally and during earlier media interviews, Mr Major insisted that the Conservatives had won all the main arguments during the campaign. His relatively relaxed demeanour appeared to reflect confidence at Conservative Central Office that the heavy Tory defeat expected in tomorrow's poll will not be as crushing as suggested by some opinion polls. Party strategists believe the prospects are for the government to win closer to 20 seats in the Strasbourg assembly than the five or six some have projected.

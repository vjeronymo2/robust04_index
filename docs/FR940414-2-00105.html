The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Representations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. ITT Hartford, formerly ITT Insurance Corporation, is a stock life insurance company domiciled in Wisconsin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. On May 20, 1991, the Board of Directors of Hartford Life established the Separate Account. The Separate Account issues only flexible premium tax deferred variable annuity contracts. The Separate Account consists of several subaccounts (the ``Subaccounts''), each of which invests in certain underlying registered investment companies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. In December 1993, the Separate Account filed a Form N&hyph;4 to register interests of a new flexible premium contract to be funded by the Separate Account (the ``New Contract''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. HESCO will serve as the principal underwriter for the Contracts (including the New Contract). HESCO is registered with the Commission as a broker dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Contract owners may allocate purchase payments to any one or more of the Subaccounts, to the fixed account (the ``Fixed Account'') which is part of the general account of ITT Hartford, or to a combination of the Subaccounts and the Fixed Account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. A Contract owner may select one of four annuity options: life annuity; life annuity with 120, 180 or 240 monthly payments; joint and last survivor annuity; and payments for a designated period. Each annuity option provides for a series of annuity payments commencing on the annuity commencement date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. If upon death, prior to the annuity commencement date, the annuitant or the Contract owner, as applicable, had not attained his or her 90th birthday, the beneficiary of the Contract will receive the greatest of: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The Contract value determined as of the day written proof of death of such person is received by ITT Hartford; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) 100% of the total purchase payments made to such Contract; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The maximum anniversary value <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  increased by the dollar amount of any purchase payments made and reduced by the dollar amount of any partial surrenders (commonly referred to as a ``stepped up'' death benefit). If the deceased, the annuitant or the Contract owner, as applicable, has attained age 90, the death benefit will equal the Contract value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The maximum anniversary value is equal to the greatest anniversary value attained as follows. The anniversary value is equal to the Contract value on a Contract anniversary (anniversary of the effective date of the Contract), increased by the dollar amount of any premium payments made since that anniversary and reduced by the dollar amount of any partial surrenders since that anniversary. As of the date of death, Hartford Life will calculate anniversary value for each Contract anniversary prior to the decedent's 81st birthday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Contract Owners will not pay a sales charge at the time of purchase. However, a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') may be assessed against Contract values when they are surrendered. The length of time from receipt of a premium payment to the time of surrender determines the contingent deferred sales charge. Purchase payments will be deemed to be surrendered in the order in which they are received and all surrenders will be first from purchase payments and then from other Contract values. The CDSC equals 6% the first year, 6% the second year, 5% the third year, 5% the fourth year, 4% the fifth year and 3% the sixth year, and 2% the seventh year, and 0% the eighth year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. During the first seven Contract years, on a non-cumulative basis, a Contract owner may make a partial surrender of Contract values of up to 10% of the aggregate premium payments made to the Contract (as determined on the date of the requested withdrawal) without the application of the CDSC. After the seventh Contract year, the Contract owner may make a partial surrender of the greater of 10% of premium payments made during the seven years prior to the surrender, or 100% of the Contract value less the premium payments made during the seven years prior to the surrender, without the application of a CDSC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. ITT Hartford will deduct from Contract value each year a daily administrative charge at the rate of .15% per annum. In addition, for Contracts with Contract value less than $50,000, ITT Hartford will deduct from Contract value each year, on the Contract anniversary, a maintenance fee of $30. The annual maintenance fee is designed to reimburse ITT Hartford for expenses relating to the administration and maintenance of a Contract and the Subaccounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The Applicants represent that neither the annual maintenance charge nor the administrative charge may be increased during the life of the Contracts. Moreover, Applicants do not expect the annual maintenance and administrative charges to exceed ITT Hartford's average expected costs of administering the Contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. ITT Hartford will deduct a daily charge at the rate of 1.25% per annum to compensate it for providing mortality and expense guarantees with respect to the Contracts. (The Applicants estimate that of the 1.25% charge, 0.90% is for mortality risk and 0.35% is for expense risk.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

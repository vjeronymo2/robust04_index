			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "From the Flow of News"] </F>   [Text] About 500,000 people were subjected to repressive  measures in Azerbaijan from 1920 through 1956, reported the  chairman on the commission for investigating the affairs of  victims of political repressions under the Fund for Culture of  Azerbaijan, Murtuz Sadykhly. And 94 percent of the victims of  repression by the Stalinist regime during the period of  1933-1938 were individuals of Azeri nationality, although only  70 percent of the residents of the republic at that time were  Azeris. Practically none of the Armenians, who made up 11  percent of the population of Azerbaijan at the time, suffered,  not counting several families of "transgressing" Chekists:  because 80 percent of the workers of the republic's penal organs  were Armenians.</p>

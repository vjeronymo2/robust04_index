			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Jan (NOTIMEX) -- Antonio  Navarro Wolff, presidential candidate of the 19 April Movement  Democratic Alliance [AD/M-19], today announced that his  organization will study legal formulas to sue the government for  permitting the presence of U.S. soldiers in the country.    "We will ask the Defense Ministry for a copy of the  agreement  signed by the Colombian and U.S. Armies so we can act legally,"  the former guerrilla said. He described the arrival of U.S.  military engineers in southeastern Valle del Cauca Department as  "unjustified and a violation [violatoria]."    Some 133 military engineers from the Southern Command in  Panama today began social projects in Valle del Cauca  Department, the capital of which is Cali. The action has  created great discontent among political sectors because the  Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops without  congressional consent.    According to Navarro Wolff, who will run for president in  the  May elections, the administration of President Cesar Gaviria "is  concealing the real mission of the U.S. military contingent."  The AD/M-19 leader added, "We are following the case as  citizens." In recent days, Navarro Wolff traveled to the area  where the foreign soldiers are deployed and gave Colombian flags  to the residents.    The Union of Democratic Workers of Colombia [Sindicato de  Trabajadores Democraticos de Colombia] joined the protest by  describing the arrival of the U.S. troops as an "attack on  national sovereignty." The labor organization stated: "It is  unacceptable that at the request of the president, Colombia is  treated like an international beggar and permits the arrival of  troops in the country under the pretext that they are coming to  build a school."    Gaviria and the Defense Ministry have insisted that the  soldiers' mission is "humanitarian," and they have ruled out any  violation of national sovereignty.    The U.S. group yesterday began to build a school and a  health  center to serve approximately 2,000 people of a tourist area  near the Colombian Navy's Malaga Bay naval base on the Pacific.  Official sources indicated that the group will remain in  Colombia until 28 February, when the projects are scheduled to  be finished.</p>

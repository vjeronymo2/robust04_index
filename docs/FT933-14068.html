			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Poland ready for deal on Dollars 12bn commercial debt: Both sides are keen to settle POLAND and its London Club commercial bank creditors are to meet in London on Monday with high hopes of a breakthrough in their long-stalled negotiations over a debt reduction and rescheduling agreement. Mr Krzysztof Krowacki, the Polish government's chief debt negotiator, believes the time is now ripe to settle with the banks over the country's Dollars 12.1bn (Pounds 8bn) debt. He points to Poland's recently approved Dollars 660m standby loan with the International Monetary Fund, loan commitments of Dollars 3.8bn from the World Bank and a growing influx of foreign equity capital in evidence of this. At the same, he says, 'this is possibly the last time that we can explain to the Polish electorate that it is in Poland's interest to make a reasonable deal, even though it will cost Poland a lot of money.' The 300 creditor banks represented in the negotiations are also anxious to make a deal which would close a painful chapter in their relations with Poland. The communist authorities, who borrowed Dollars 17bn in the 1970s to prop up their regime by grafting western factories on to an unreformed system, defaulted on Poland's foreign debt in March 1981. Arrears on the official debt accumulated throughout the period of martial law from December 1981, but Warsaw resumed the servicing of its commercial bank debt in 1983. The arrangement lasted until the fourth quarter of 1989, when the first post-communist government stopped payments. Since then the original Dollars 9bn commercial debt has swollen to Dollars 12.1bn, mainly through the addition of capitalised interest. Both sides now want an agreement, but not at any price. Many banks remain angry about the terms agreed by the Paris Club of official creditors in April 1991. The centrepiece was a two-stage, 50 per cent reduction of the outstanding Dollars 33bn debt to governmental export credit and official lenders. The agreement, which was concluded mainly on political grounds to ease Poland's transition from communism to a market economy, includes a clause obliging Poland to seek similar terms from the commercial banks. But the banks, painfully recovering from their exposure to Latin American, Asian and African defaulters, are refusing to be put in the Paris club straitjacket. They are seeking a deal based on the assessment of their own economic sub-committee, despatched to Poland last month, of what the country can afford to pay. Poland's position in the heart of Europe, its commitment to market reforms, support from the IMF and World Bank, basic political stability and an educated population of nearly 40m make its prospects good, the bankers believe. But the Polish team will argue that Poland will only be able to service its debts over 30 years if it is left with sufficient resources to finance the necessary economic growth. Even without a London Club agreement Poland is faced with a serious bunching of debt repayments around the middle of the first decade of the next century, both to the Paris Club and to the international institutions which have been the main source of fresh capital since 1989. A further complication is that nearly 60 per cent of Poland's bank debt is denominated in D-Marks, where interest rates have remained high, in contrast to the decline in dollar interest rates in recent years. Resistance to concessions is expected to be strongest from the German banks, the biggest single creditors, who are also heavily involved in the Russian market and fear that concessions to the Poles now will be seized on by the Russians and other debtors, later. But the British banks, with less at stake, are also reluctant to agree a Paris Club style capital write-off, or allow Poland to retire up to a third of its debt by buying it from the secondary market, as the Poles have suggested. Over 160 smaller creditor banks have dropped out of the picture by selling their Polish debt on the secondary market where Polish paper has risen from its floor, several years ago, of around 18 per cent of face value, to around 33 per cent, in expectation of an agreement. Some tough bargaining lies ahead. But bankers believe that up to Dollars 2bn in foreign investment is just waiting for a debt agreement. This gives an incentive for Warsaw to settle. At the same time, many western banks are anxious to move into what is expected to become a profitable, fast growing market over the next decade and beyond. With a certain degree of flexibility on both sides, the prospects for agreement on the major components of a deal before the end of the summer look promising.</p>

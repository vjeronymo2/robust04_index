Commission President Delors will make a declaration on Thursday  afternoon [17 February] saying in so many words that the move is  not in the spirit of the Union treaty.    Diplomats say that the unilateral move by Athens is not  conducive to the European Union's [EU] "cohesion." Greece  currently holds the EU presidency. "The Union must stick  together as a union," a spokesman said. "The Greek move does  not contribute to this."    Resentful reactions to Athens' move had already been seen at  political talks between top civil servants from the member  states on Tuesday evening. It is usual for a member state  taking measures outside the Union to first contact the council.  However, the Greek representative appeared to be clearly  embarrassed by his government. The argument that a Greek harbor  was concerned did not sound very convincing to those present,  according to a diplomat.    The question will probably come up in the sidelines of the  talks to be held in Athens on Thursday and Friday by the  ministerial EU troika. This troika consists of Greece, Belgium  and Germany, the present, past, and future EU presidents. A  spokesman said it was not usual for the troika to publicly put a  member state in the pillory without prior consultation with the  Union member states. [passage omitted]</p>

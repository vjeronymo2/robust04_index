			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The ERM Crisis: Opening the way to base rate cuts - Competitive gains threatened WITH THE European exchange rate mechanism on the brink of collapse, analysts were yesterday relishing the implications for the UK economy. The release of continental European currencies from the mechanism would allow governments to cut interest rates and stimulate economic growth. This would help UK manufacturers struggling to sell exports in exceptionally sluggish European economies. The danger for the UK is that the competitive gains of devaluation that have boosted UK exports since September would be threatened by devalued European currencies. UK exporters would have to work harder to maintain market share. But, while a collapse of the ERM could threaten the UK's competitive gains, it would also open the way for further UK base rate cuts as former ERM members gave up the battle to hold their currencies at certain values and eased monetary policy. The UK government bond market reflected that belief with prices rising sharply and pushing long-term yields, which mirror the market's perception of future inflation, down to 7.825 per cent, their lowest level for well over 20 years. The 10-year gilt futures contract for September shot forward almost a full percentage point and closed  23/32 higher at 109.23 after some investors took profits. The Bank of England took advantage of the continued enthusiasm for gilts by announcing a Pounds 1.3bn issue of stock. Although gilts thrive on political stability buyers ignored the potentially disruptive effect of a huge Tory by-election defeat in Christchurch, southern England. Economists cautioned that most of the buying was fuelled by foreign investors attracted by the UK's status as a currency safe haven. They said that if the existing structure of the ERM crumbled the UK's competitive advantage might be eroded as ERM members cut rates independently.</p>

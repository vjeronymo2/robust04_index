			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Minister sacked amid bank sale row Mr Stefan Kawalec, the deputy finance minister responsible for privatising Poland's banking sector, has been sacked by Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the prime minister, after an outcry over the pricing of a bank privatisation. Shares in the Bank Slaski, which were offered to the public at 500,000 zloty in November, soared to 6.7m zloty when traded on the Warsaw stock exchange last week. Mr Kawalec, who was respected by local and foreign bankers, had been in charge of negotiations with ING bank of the Netherlands, which bought 29.5 per cent of Bank Slaski at the public offer price. Mr Kawalec came under fire last week from deputies in the PSL farmers' party, Mr Pawlak's own grouping, who charged that the bank had been sold too cheaply. The dismissal came in spite of the fact that Mr Marek Borowski, the deputy premier in charge of the economy, on Thursday took responsibility for the pricing decision. So far Poland has seen the privatisation of two big state banks. A third disposal, of the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy, is planned for the middle of the year. The government had been planning to sell off six more banks by the end of 1996.</p>

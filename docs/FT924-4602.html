			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Survey of Chicago - A Centre For Finance and Industry (3): Back to profitability but the neighbours are muscling in - Banking: the big two are not having it all their own way CHICAGO IS the banking centre of the Midwest, but its banks, handicapped by archaic state banking laws, have not experienced the healthy growth of some of their regional competitors. While the city's two biggest banks, First National Bank of Chicago and Continental, are returning to profitability, they are losing out in a battle for regional market share to more muscular bank holding companies in neighbouring states. Continental Bank, once a flagship of Chicago's investment community, was grounded by energy-related credit problems in 1984. Since then it has reshaped itself as a regional corporate bank, downsized significantly, and last year became a fully public company again, when the government sold the last of its Continental stock holdings, ending a Dollars 4.5bn bail-out. Continental last year had assets of Dollars 24bn, about half of its 1981 peak of Dollars 47bn. It incurred a Dollars 76m loss in 1991, but has had three profitable quarters in 1992. 'Continental is a brand-new bank now, run by new people,' says Mr Kenneth Puglisi, a Chicago Corporation bank analyst, 'It is really very focused.' Continental has shed its primary dealership in government bonds, divested most of its futures operations (though it still provides financial services to Chicago's many exchanges and brokerage firms), and sold off its retail accounts to its old rival, First Chicago. A lavish remodelling of the lobby of its LaSalle Street building replaced teller windows with upmarket clothing boutiques and coffee shops. Many older Chicagoans are still surprised that they can buy a pizza in the Continental concourse, but they can't open a cheque-book account. Analysts praise Continental's chairman, Thomas Theobald, for successful pursuit of the corporate banking strategy. While the bank still needs to bolster its credit ratings, the analysts say it has taken the lead in pricing corporate loans, and is using its focus to regain profitability. A few blocks away, Chicago's other big bank, First Chicago, has taken a different tack. Like other money-centre banks in the 1980s, First Chicago was battered by non-performing loans to developing countries, by the ups and downs of highly leveraged transactions and, most recently, by credit problems in its commercial property portfolio. In 1991, the bank earned only Dollars 116.3m on assets of Dollars 47bn, down from Dollars 221.1m in 1990. Losing patience with the slow bleeding of profits, and seeing little near-term improvement in the US property market, First Chicago took decisive action this summer. The bank announced the sale of Dollars 2.1bn in foreclosed properties and problem loans, valuing them at about 54 cents to the dollar. The sales and write-down left First Chicago with a Dollars 625m charge to earnings, but by taking the hit all at once, the bank is now free to move beyond the problem. Unlike Continental, First Chicago's strategy for survival in the 1990s is to focus on its retail franchise. The bank recently bought a smaller rival, American National Bank, to strengthen its retail base, and caught the outflow when Continental closed its teller windows. It still provides cash management and other services to corporate accounts, but its profile has become much more of a regional bank than a money-centre presence. In that role it faces stiff competition. The Chicago banking scene, with its many small but very profitable properties, is an attractive grazing ground for outsiders. Regulatory changes, some as recent as 1991, have opened Illinois to out-of-state banks, and now allow expansion through acquisition. Until recently, bank holding companies and branch banking were prohibited in Illinois. That regulatory twist spawned more than 12,000 independent banks in the state. Now, with profitability boosted by a year and a half of low interest rates and a generally resilient Midwest economy, the myriad small banks are the focus of aggressive regional consolidation. 'Illinois is now wide open to multi-bank holding companies,' said Mr Michael Sammon, senior vice-president for banking at Chicago-based Howe and Barnes Investments, 'However, since the state was so late in making changes, Illinois banks were not in the capital position to take advantage of them.' Regional giants like Columbus, Ohio-based Banc One have been massing bank holdings in their home states, and have ample capital to stage Chicago acquisitions. Banc One has bought a series of Chicago-area banks this year and NBD, a Detroit bank holding company, has been equally aggressive in Chicago's suburbs. Tending their own wounds, First Chicago and Continental have barely participated in the buying spree. Mr Sammon predicts that the consolidations and holding company purchases will continue through the next five years, although plenty of small independent banks will remain. Foreign banks are also on the prowl for acquisitions, and prefer to serve the international financing needs of the futures-exchange-dominated loop community. ABN Three years ago, ABN (now part of ABN Amro, the biggest bank in the Netherlands) bought Chicago's fifth-largest bank, LaSalle National. This year ABN Amro used LaSalle as the base to purchase Tallman Home Federal, a troubled but profitable savings and loan. The combined assets of Tallman and LaSalle top Dollars 12bn and have leap-frogged ABN Amro into third place in Chicago's bank ranking. Harris, now Chicago's fourth-largest bank, was purchased by The Bank of Montreal in 1984. The Canadian bank takes a very low-key role in the city, and has not had ABN Amro's bent for expansion. Not to be overlooked in Chicago's banking community is the stolid, and solidly independent Northern Trust. Led by conservative management, Northern avoided most of the credit pitfalls of its LaSalle Street neighbours and maintains a successful niche administering trusts, particularly corporate pension funds, and providing banking services to high net worth individuals. A perennial pick of bank analysts, Northern has assests of Dollars 14.3bn and last year earned a record Dollars 127.4m or a Dollars 3.41 per share, a 10 per cent gain over 1990. While its bottom line makes Chicago's fifth-largest bank a sweet acquisition target, Northern Trust, the management says, is not for sale.</p>

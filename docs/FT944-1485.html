			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Arts: Haitink and the LPO - Concert For fans of the London Philharmonic Orchestra the most likely question on everyone's lips at the moment is 'who will succeed Franz Welser-Most as music director?', a matter of even greater urgency now that Klaus Tennstedt, the LPO's principal guest conductor, has had to retire from conducting due to the ill health that has constantly dogged his career. One possible contender for the post is surely the present music director of the Royal Opera, Bernard Haitink. His long and fruitful association with Amsterdam's legendary Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, his musical directorship of Glyndebourne Festival Opera and his special relationship with the Vienna Philharmonic certainly single him out as a strong candidate for the LPO job, though whether his current position as the LPO's president will disqualify him remains to be seen. If he is to be considered, then the two concerts he gave with the orchestra on Sunday and Thursday might be viewed as something of a public audition. The tidy account of Beethoven's First Symphony which began Sunday's concert was a good example of Haitink at his best: neat and precise, free of interpretive quirks, it gave the impression of playing itself. Short of wit, maybe, but handled with an attractive lightness of touch. It was, in short, a pleasantly unassuming reading, a quality less welcome in the Ninth Symphony, where the interpretative challenges are so much greater and the weight of performance tradition so much more intimidating. Given Haitink's operatic experience, one might have expected a view of the Ninth riven with dramatic incident shot through with a palpable regard for its summatory, colossean dimensions. In the event, the bold rhetoric of the first movement seemed less than arresting, and the finale, for all the vigorous contribution of a well drilled LPO choir and the reliable team of soloists  - Karita Mattila, Ann Murray, Keith Lewis and Robert Lloyd  - was devoid of visionary ecstasy. Haitink was visibly exhausted at the end of it. And the packed Festival Hall audience vociferous in its appreciation. Just quite why was difficult to fathom. Thursday's concert showed Haitink on top form, however, not so much in a brash account of Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini overture and a rather subdued Ravel Mother Goose, but in a finely controlled and numinous reading of Vaughan William's Fifth Symphony. Haitink and the LPO are no strangers to VW. Their recordings for EMI of the First, Second and Seventh Symphonies have been enthusiastically received, further proof that VW is not the exclusive property of British artists, as conductors of the calibre of Rostropovich, Rozhdestvensky and Slatkin have triumphantly demonstrated. The Fifth, in particular, is well suited to Haitink's introspective temperament, but what impressed above all was his feeling for the longer line, his ability to inject a strong sense of purpose to the ambiguous, ruminative nature on much of the music without robbing it of its sense of wonder. With more performances like this and a more carefully chosen repertoire, Haitink could, perhaps, be just the music director the LPO so badly needs.</p>

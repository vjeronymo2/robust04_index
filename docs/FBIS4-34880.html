			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] San Salvador, 25 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- A clandestine  group, consisting of civilian crime victims, has claimed  responsibility today for the execution of at least 18 members of  holdup gangs during the past six months.    A member of the "New White Hand" ["Nueva Mano Blanca"], a  name used in the past decade by a so-called "death squad," has  told NOTIMEX the victims were "executed" in San Salvador and in  areas of the outskirts for their involvement in holdups.    A spokesman for this group, which emerged last January,  explained his organization consists of approximately 80  civilians, including women, who have been victimized by criminal  gangs. He has said that his group is not responsible for the  attacks on or murders of politicians and that its mission is to  fight crime "due to the authorities' inadequate actions to  eradicate it." He added the group uses 9-mm pistols to "execute"  gang members. The police have reported more than 50 criminal  gangs are operating in San Salvador. [passage omitted]</p>

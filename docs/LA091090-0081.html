			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Firm Sues Late Artist's Wife Over Copyrights: Jennifer Dumas, the wife of the  late artist Patrick Nagel, famous for his portraits of a striking woman with  high cheekbones and long dark hair, was sued by Mirage Editions Inc., a Santa  Monica firm that claims to hold the copyrights on a number of Nagel works. In  the federal lawsuit, Mirage asserts that after Nagel died in 1984, Dumas gave  the firm exclusive rights to produce and distribute a number of Nagel works  under an agreement whereby she would receive a $200,000 advance on foreign  sales of Nagel reproductions.  </P> <P> The suit said Dumas breached the long-term contract by entering into a separate  agreement with a Japanese company, Gallery APJ, to publish and distribute in  Japan a number of Nagel images for which Mirage holds the copyright. The suit  said the Japanese firm has sold various reproductions, including a calender of  Nagel works on which Mirage still holds the copyright. The suit seeks $100,000  per infringed copyright and at least $1 million in punitive damages. (Case No.  90-4803. Filed Sept. 6.)  </P></p>

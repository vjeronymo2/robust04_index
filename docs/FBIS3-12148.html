			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riyadh, Feb 26, SPA -- The Saudi newspapers deplored  today the massacre of Palestinian worshippers at Ibrahim mosque  yesterday.    Jeddah-based AL-MADINAH said the massacre was a result of  the  continuation of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.    The paper said the crime has provided a clear evidence that  the proposed peace initiatives will never be realized.    It would be better for those who raise their voices speaking  about human rights to get acquainted of the fact that no  peaceful settlement will never [as received] be realized without  putting an end to the Jewish settlements in the occupied  territories and departure of the Jewish settlers.    'UKAZ, which is also published in Jeddah, said the massacre  at Ibrahim mosque has reflected the criminal plots hatched by  the Zionist quarters against the Palestinians.    It is not a mere crime committed by one person as the  Israeli  authorities have been alleging, but is a well-arranged crime  prepared by a number of culprits, said the daily.    By alleging that the criminal committed suicide Israel is  trying to distract attention from the vicious bloody crime, said  the daily.    The daily held Israel responsibile of all massacres  committed  in the occupied Palestinian territories.    It also condemned shooting of the Palestinians who gathered  at the hospital to donate with their blood to the injured people  as well as shooting of the Palestinian demonstrators who shouted  to express their anger over the bloody incident.    This massacre was not the first of its kind and will never  be  the final one, said the daily.    For its part Riyadh-based AL-JAZIRAH said overlooking of  such  crime will never be tolerated or accepted.    The Israeli authorities should be held responsibile for the  massacre of the worshippers at Ibrahim mosque yesterday, said  the daily.    The paper criticized the Western information media which  used  to justify the Israeli acts against the Palestinians and the  Arabs.    When the Zionists commit crimes voices are always raised  calling for self-restraint and rationalization, added the daily.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WHO'S HOT / WHO'S NOT  </P> <P>  Rolling Hills center John Hardy scored 36, 37 and 36 points last week to help  the Titans go 2-1 and clinch a tie for their third straight Bay League title.  Hardy raised his average to 28 points per game.  </P> <P> Sophomore center Sean Goodwin (27 points) and forward Scott Klein (22) led  Miraleste past Marshall Fundamental, 84-60, giving the Marauders their 10th win  in 11 games.  </P> <P> Lance Haworth and Jeff Bowers scored to lift Palos Verdes' soccer team over  Beverly Hills, 2-0, as the Sea Kings extended their record to 28-0 and posted  their 20th shutout.  </P> <P> Despite playing the final three minutes with only four players because of  fouls, St. Mary's of Inglewood hung on to beat St. Bernard, 63-61, and gain  undisputed first place in the Camino Real League girls basketball race.  </P> <P> Who's Not  </P> <P> Prep basketball fans in San Pedro strayed from their seats to participate in  two brawls in recent weeks, leading administrators at San Pedro High and Mary  Star to bar spectators from games. Fans joined in a fracas between Mary Star  and Cathedral on Jan. 27, and last Friday spectators were emptied from San  Pedro's gym after joining a fight between the Pirates and Narbonne.  </P> <P> Officials of Friday's Torrance-Leuzinger basketball game were criticized for  allowing play to get too rough, then turning the game into a foul-shooting  contest. The teams attempted 70 free throws, including 38 in the fourth  quarter, as Torrance hung on for an 84-80 win. Said Torrance Coach Carl Strong:  "The officiating was atrocious."  </P> <P> South Torrance's girls basketball team lost to West Torrance, 63-41, to fall to  1-11 in the Ocean League.  </P></p>

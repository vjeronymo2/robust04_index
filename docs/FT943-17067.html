			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Pleasant surprise as shares go higher Traders at Nikko Securities, who started their morning with long faces yesterday on prospects of a plunge on the Tokyo stock market, were pleasantly surprised after Japanese shares closed moderately higher. Many analysts had expected financial markets to react negatively to the uncertainty posed by the new socialist leader, but investors chose to look on the bright side, seeing the new administration as fiscally expansive, supporting further cuts in income taxes, and discarding tax rises. After a brief plunge, the leading Nikkei index closed up 162.93, or 0.8 per cent, at 20,643.93, on hopes of a imminent recovery of corporate earnings and the economy. But investor confidence was virtually unaffected due to the belief that bureaucrats will continue running state affairs, including economic management. 'There is no socialist government, just a socialist prime minister within a coalition,' Mr Tom Hill, strategist at brokers SG Warburg in Tokyo, said. Favourable news for the economy, on the other hand, suggested higher interest rates, depressing the bond market. Currency traders were more unsure of the new regime as doubts over the prime minister's handling of trade talks with the US and the Naples summit kept the yen above Y99 to the dollar. It closed up Y0.32 at Y98.95.</p>

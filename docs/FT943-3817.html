			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / FT Guide to the week MONDAY 12 Quebec provincial election Opinion polls put the separatist Parti Quebecois well ahead of the ruling Liberal party, although the current Quebec premier Daniel Johnson is more popular than PQ leader Jacques Parizeau. If the PQ wins, it has promised to call a referendum on independence from Canada for the French-speaking territory within a year of taking office. Peacekeeping: Nato's first peacekeeping exercises on former Warsaw Pact soil start outside Poznan in western Poland as part of the Partnership for Peace programme. For four days, 920 troops from 13 countries including the US, Lithuania, the UK, Romania, Italy and the Ukraine will practise peacekeeping operations at a cost of 20bn zlotys (USDollars 900,000). Russia, a PfP member, declined to take part. Abiola trial: The treason trial of Moshood Abiola is scheduled to resume in the high court in the Nigerian capital, Abuja. Abiola is charged with declaring himself president in June, a year after his unofficial victory in the election which the army annulled. The trial was halted in mid-August when the previous judge withdrew, saying Abiola lacked confidence in his ability to conduct a fair hearing. However, the defence is asking for the trial to be adjourned on medical grounds. Non-proliferation: Delegates from more than 160 governments meet in Geneva (to Sep 16) to prepare for a conference next year to decide whether to extend the 1970 nuclear non-proliferation treaty and for how long. North Korea: US assistant secretary of state Robert Gallucci arrives in Japan for talks on North Korea's nuclear programme. He travels on to South Korea on Wednesday. Meanwhile, talks continue in Berlin between senior US and North Korean officials (until Sep 14). The US diplomats had intended to propose providing North Korea with light-water reactors and other technical assistance as an incentive for North Korea to start negotiating the reduction of its nuclear weapon capacity. Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, visits Thailand at the start of an Asian tour. English counties: The Local Government Commission gives its recommendations for future council structure in Gloucestershire - the final county to be covered. The commission now starts public consultation, with final recommendations for all of shire England due by the year-end. FT Surveys: The Philippines and Dutch Finance and Investment. Holidays: Switzerland (Zurich only). TUESDAY 13 BIS gains board members Alan Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve, joins the board of the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements. William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, also takes up a board position. As a founding member, the US has been entitled to two board seats since 1930 but has never taken them. Gordon Thiessen, Canadian central bank governor, and Yasushi Mieno, governor of the Bank of Japan, also become BIS board members today. The BIS hopes the moves, which bring to 11 the number of countries represented on the board, will strengthen international monetary co-operation. Japan and the UN: Boutros Boutros-Ghali, UN secretary-general, on a four-day visit to Japan, meets prime minister Tomiichi Murayama. They will discuss Japan's cautious moves towards a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Cabinet ministers will also meet separately to discuss the question. Savoy ahoy: The UK luxury hotel group, which includes Claridge's and the Connaught, as well as the Savoy itself, may have its future ownership decided at today's board meeting. Last week, the departure was predicted of Giles Shepard, Savoy managing director, who has bitterly resisted the advances of Britain's Forte group which has been stalking it for 13 years. The Savoy group announces its interim results on Wednesday. US economy: The main data for August are released this week, starting with the consumer price index today, with retail sales on Wednesday, and industrial production on Friday. Following last week's above-forecast increase in producer prices, inflation fears have increased and with them the prospect of a near-term rate rise. Today's price index is expected to rise by more than last month's 0.3 per cent. Washington DC mayoralty: The Democratic party holds the primary ballot for the position of mayor in the US capital. As the District of Columbia is idly Democratic, the outcome will probably determine the victor in November's ballot. Favourite to win the nomination is Washington's former mayor Marion Barry, who lost the job after 12 years in power when he was caught smoking crack cocaine in a city hotel in 1990. FT Survey: Sao Paolo. WEDNESDAY 14 Polish debt reduction Poland is due to sign a 49.5 per cent commercial debt reduction deal in Warsaw with the London Club Steering Group, representing about 450 creditors. The agreement, reducing USDollars 14bn worth of debt, comes after almost a year of talks and will, for the first time since 1981, regularise Poland's financial relations with all its western creditors. OECD leadership: The vexed question of who should lead the 25 nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is due for consideration by ambassadors of member states to the OECD. The chances of a consensus are unclear. Over the weekend, EU ministers rallied behind Jean-Claude Paye, the present incumbent, who is seeking a new term from the end of this month. But the US has stepped up its opposition to Paye. The Clinton administration has been supporting Donald Johnston, a Canadian politician, with support from other non-European countries. Lloyd's of London is due to decide details of its strategy to collect several hundred million pounds in debt from loss-making Names, the individuals whose assets traditionally support the insurance market. Lloyd's authorities said last month they were poised to hire commercial debt collectors. The European Parliament begins a two-day plenary session. British Coal privatisation: Bidders for mining assets must submit tenders by 5pm today. The five regions are each likely to attract at least three bids. Some of seven recently closed stand-alone pits will also attract interest. UK economy: The retail price index and average earnings data will be scrutinised for signs on whether the downward trend in UK inflation will continue into the autumn. The annual rate of RPI is expected to have fallen further in August, highlighting the low inflationary pressures in the UK economy. Saleroom: The costume that Charlie Chaplin wore in his 1940 film satire on the rise of Hitler, The Great Dictator, is on offer, complete with swastika armbands, at Sotheby's. It is expected to sell for about Pounds 30,000. Key questions: The second World Piano Competition begins in London (to Sep 27). It is open to pianists of all nationalities under the age of 29. Holidays: Israel (Eve of Yom Kippur). THURSDAY 15 Ukraine's parliament meets Ukraine's parliament opens its autumn session with economic reform at the top of the agenda. Over the past month, President Leonid Kuchma has worked behind the scenes to push Ukraine to meet conditions for international assistance. The efforts to cut the deficit, liberalise prices and reform the currency face tough opposition in a parliament dominated by anti-reformers. If Mr Kuchma wants reform, he must court, or push out, the conservative prime minister and parliamentary chairman, who make up the governing troika. Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, arrives in Hong Kong. His visit comes at a time when Sino-British co-operation over the colony appears to have worsened. Hopes that Beijing would soon approve airport financing and an extension of Hong Kong's container port have all but evaporated. Saleroom: A recording of John Lennon playing with his first band, The Quarry Men, at a church social in Liverpool in 1957 is expected to sell for more than Pounds 100,000 at Sotheby's. It is the star lot in a pop memorabilia sale which also includes Paul McCartney's manuscript lyrics of 'When I'm Sixty-Four', which could make Pounds 38,000. An original Beatles bass drumskin is expected to fetch up to Pounds 40,000. FT Survey: Northern Ireland. Holidays: Israel (Yom Kippur), Japan (Respect-for-the-aged Day). FRIDAY 16 Hurd visits Japan Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, arrives in Japan for a three-day visit. He will meet prime minister Tomiichi Murayama, foreign minister Yohei Kono, and a cross-section of senior officials and businessmen to talk about international, regional and bilateral issues, including trade and political relations. Germany's Bundnis 90/Green Party starts a two-day meeting in Munich, one week before Bavaria's state elections and less than a month from the federal elections. The Greens, which merged with Bundnis 90 last year, got 3.8 per cent of the vote in the 1990 federal elections. Scot FM, a radio station for central Scotland, comes on air. It will be the fifth regional station to be launched in the UK within a fortnight. The new stations should boost commercial radio's 47.4 per cent share of total listening. UK economy: With the UK public sector's borrowing requirement now expected to come below the Treasury's forecast of Pounds 36bn in 1994-1995, the release of the monthly PSBR figure on Friday will be watched in the markets for indications that the government's borrowing requirements are falling further. Although July's PSBR of Pounds 1.1bn was sharply lower than the City's expectations, August's PSBR is expected to rise to Pounds 2.1bn. Holidays: Mexico (Independence Day). WEEKEND 17-18 Swedes go to the polls Sweden's Social Democratic Party, architect of the country's ubiquitous welfare state, expects to return to government in Sunday's general election after three years in opposition to a reformist right-centre coalition led by the energetic prime minister Carl Bildt. Opinion polls over the past two weeks suggest the party will fall short of a majority, raising the question of where its leader Ingvar Carlsson will look for support in tackling Sweden's budget deficit and 14 per cent unemployment. Hong Kong goes to the polls on Saturday in its first fully democratic election in 150 years of British rule. Voters will be choosing from 757 candidates to fill 346 seats in 18 district boards. These are the least powerful of the colony's three tiers of government. The Liberal Democrats, Britain's second opposition party, open their conference at Brighton on Sunday (to Sep 22). Appearances by both the head of the employers' organisation, the CBI, and the general secretary of the trade union movement will underline its intention to remain distinctive. So should debates on a top tax rate of 60 per cent for those earning more than Pounds 100,000 a year, and a proposal to abolish the monarchy after the present Queen's reign.

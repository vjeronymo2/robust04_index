			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 1 Jun (INA) -- Iraq has called on the  Non-Aligned Movement [NAM] countries to activate economic,  political, and trade cooperation among its membership and to  take an interest in collective coordination in all fields in  order to serve their vital interests in the world and to face  current challenges. Addressing the NAM conference today,  Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf, Iraq's foreign minister and head of  the Iraqi delegation to the conference, said that Iraq proposes  laying a foundation for cooperation and coordination among the  NAM countries and called on NAM to study practical proposals  through which the movement could contribute to reorganizing the  United Nations as it currently exists.    Al-Sahhaf said: Reorganizing the United Nations should be  based on objective grounds that guarantees equality and respect  for state's sovereignty, independence, and free choice. This,  he added, would produce a new formula that prevents a few rich  states from exploiting this organization for their own interests  and imposing hegemony over the world.    The foreign minister called on NAM to study the possibility  of activating cooperation among its member states in specific  fields, particularly with regard to trade and economic relations  with industrialized countries. This cooperation, he added,  would give NAM countries greater power because they would share  interests with other countries.    Responding to the speech delivered by the representative of  the Kuwaiti rulers -- who issued a host of allegations and  slanders that are not in harmony with the general spirit of the  conference represented by the call for dialogue, reconciliation,  and solving problems through peaceful means -- Muhammad Sa'id  al-Sahhaf said: The Government of Iraq has fulfilled all  measures requested by the Security Council in accordance with  Security Council Resolutions 686 and 687. He added that this  was documented in four letters circulated as official documents  at the Security Council. He said: The position of the Iraqi  Government vis-a-vis these resolutions still exists as  stipulated by these letters, which were accepted by the Security  Council, which established a permanent cease-fire on the basis  of these letters. The minister noted that anything contrary to  this means the existence of a contradiction between what is  required by Security Council Resolution 686 and the  establishment of a permanent cease-fire in accordance with  Resolution 687.    The Iraqi foreign minister noted in his speech that the  United Nations and the UN Special Commission have admitted that  Iraq has implemented all the requirements of disarmament, which  is considered an important chapter of Resolution 687. He added  that Iraq's fulfillment of its commitments, as stipulated by  this chapter, requires that the Security Council so far because  of the intransigence of one country that imposes its opinion and  hegemony over the council thereby constituting a political  blackmail to achieve its personal interests. [sentence as  received]    Regarding the issue of missing Kuwaitis, the foreign  minister  reiterated that Iraq has no interest in keeping a single Kuwaiti  in prison and that there is not one prisoner in Iraq. He said:  We released all prisoners, including members of the ruling  Kuwaiti family. The issue of missing persons was fabricated by  the other party, which has turned it into a political, not a  humanitarian, problem.    Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said: Foreign interests represent a  major factor in maintaining instability in the region so as to  justify their military and political presence, to make big  profits from arms deals, and to impose trade deals and projects  so as to invigorate their economy at the expense of stability,  peace, and security in the region.    Al-Sahhaf said that, contrary to certain parties' claims,  Iraq is earnest and concerned about taking sound technical and  legal steps to implement the Security Council resolutions and to  take various initiatives so as to normalize the situation in the  region. He noted that the last initiative was declared by the  speaker of the Iraqi National Assembly in which he called on the  Kuwaiti parliament to embark on dialogue and resolve suspended  problems between the two countries. He added: However, the  Kuwaiti parliament rejected this call with arrogance.    Concluding his speech, the foreign minister welcomed the  Republic of South Africa for joining NAM as a full member state.</p>

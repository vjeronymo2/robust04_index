			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Santer declares himself ready to succeed Delors: Luxembourg PM not favoured in poll of MEPs Mr Jacques Santer, the Luxembourg prime minister who has risen from rank outsider to frontrunner to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission, yesterday declared himself available for the job. But as momentum behind the Santer candidacy appeared to be increasing, a Financial Times poll of newly-elected members of the European Parliament showed little enthusiasm. Euro MPs must vet the choice of Commission president next week. Mr Santer - viewed as a safe but uninspiring choice - said yesterday he would accept the post on condition that the other 11 member states reach a consensus on appointing him. However, an FT telephone survey of 150 members of the 567-strong European parliament showed he was well down the list of candidates favoured by the Strasbourg assembly. Under Article 158 of the Maastricht treaty, heads of government are allowed to nominate the Commission chief only 'after consulting the European parliament'. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany - current holder of the rotating EU presidency - meets parliamentary leaders tomorrow. Leading members of the Strasbourg assembly doubt that parliament would oppose Mr Santer. Since he represents the Social Democratic end of the Christian Democrat political spectrum, he is likely to gain support among the two main political groupings at Strasbourg. However, the lack of enthusiasm displayed for Mr Santer in the FT poll, conducted by telephone between July 8 and 13, indicates the possibility of setbacks next week. The survey, conducted among a sample of 59 Socialist MEPs, 52 Christian Democrat-leaning members, 11 Liberals, five Greens and 23 assorted and unattached members - puts Mr Santer in joint eighth place in the list of favoured candidates. Mr Delors and Mr Giuliano Amato, a former Italian prime minister, topped the poll. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Mr Ruud Lubbers and Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Belgian, Dutch and Spanish prime ministers, as well as Mr Peter Sutherland, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, also precede Mr Santer in the list. In London, most Conservative Euro-sceptics are quietly resigned to accepting Mr Santer as a candidate. Some Tory sceptics yesterday said they would ask Mr Bill Cash, leader of the anti-federalist European Movement, to mount a campaign to stop Mr Santer succeeding Mr Delors. However, Mr Cash said: 'The key thing is the policies not the personality.' Mr Santer is credited by the British government with drafting key passages in the Maastricht treat which allowed the UK an opt-out from the Social Chapter.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] In Algeria, the security forces have once again  struck a severe blow against the Armed Islamic Group, the GIA.  A few days ago, three close associates of the leader of this  terrorist movement were killed near Medea, some 100 km south of  Algiers. Jerome Bastion reports:    [Bastion] [passage omitted] We learned today that three  close associates of the leader of the GIA were killed by  security forces in bushland about 100 km to the south of  Algiers, in a region where a secret congress of clandestine  Islamic groups was taking place. The congress is said to have  discussed the unification of the armed resistance under the  banner of the GIA. It was after this meeting that Djamel  Zitouni, one of these warlords, was killed, and it seems that it  was in retaliation for this blow that the two French nationals  were executed on Tuesday evening.</p>

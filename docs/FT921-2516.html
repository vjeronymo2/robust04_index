			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Call to revoke a restricting rule HSBC shareholders will be asked to revoke the rule restricting shareholdings in the company to a maximum of 1 per cent if it proceeds with its proposed merger with Midland Bank, writes Simon Davies. Following the planned share swap, the Kuwaiti Investment Office's 10.2 per cent stake in Midland would make it the largest single shareholder of the enlarged bank - assuming it accepts the proposals; while under the existing regulations it would have been forced to sell down its stake. The 1 per cent restriction is entwined in Hongkong Bank's history. It was made part of the Hongkong Bank Ordinance to ensure a wide shareholder base and to protect the institution, Hong Kong's quasi-Central bank, from corporate piracy. But it would significantly complicate a merger/takeover of a bank where no such restrictions apply. The restriction was written into the articles of association of HSBC Holdings following the restructuring of the banking group in December 1990; but this can be overturned by a ruling from the board of directors. HSBC sources were adamant it would be put to the shareholders. The colony's banking commissioner Mr David Carse said 'this move would not concern us as supervisors, as it is too low a threshold'. He pointed out that under the existing banking legislation, anyone purchasing stakes in the bank beyond 10 per cent and 50 per cent thresholds would require the permission of the commissioner. Asia Equity's research director, Mr Barry Yates, described the restriction as 'an archaic regulation'. 'It is particularly inappropriate for an international bank to have a restrictive limit on share holdings', he said. The removal of the restriction would pave the way for stake-building in the enlarged bank, potentially boosting its stock market rating. And although it might open the company to greater influence from shareholders, the banking group, which still acts as note issuer and manager of bank clearing in Hong Kong, would remain protected from aggressors.</p>

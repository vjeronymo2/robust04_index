			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Berlusconi on the brink The end of the beginning, or the beginning of the end? Just a week after the Italian government issued a signal of hope by agreeing tough action on pensions and health reform in the 1995 budget, new and darker clouds are starting to gather around the figure of Mr Silvio Berlusconi. Yesterday's row between the Italian prime minister and Mr Francesco Saverio Borrelli, a senior Milan anti-corruption magistrate, brings to a head five months of simmering discord between Mr Berlusconi's government and an independent-minded judiciary. It exposes anew some of the contradictions in Italy's attempts to produce judicial solutions to deeply entrenched problems of corruption. On a wider level, the clash raises fresh doubts about the credibility of the country's efforts to establish a stronger and less self-serving political system. Against the background of rising anxiety on international financial markets about Italy's public debt mountain, the prime minister's hold on power appears increasingly uncertain even though his election triumph was as recent as last March. And there is no sign of a successor better qualified to deliver the stability Italy requires. Mr Berlusconi took office with a strong mandate to improve the standards of Italian leadership as a means of putting the country's political and economic structures on to a sounder footing. Although his objectives may have been worthy, his execution so far has been poor. He has failed to bring about the most elementary, and arguably the most important, precondition for accomplishing his goal: clearing up the conflicts of interest inherent in his position as head of the Fininvest media group. Extraordinary criticism In his interview with the Corriere della Sera newspaper yesterday, Mr Borrelli dropped a broad hint that one trail being followed by corruption investigators may lead to Mr Berlusconi's own door. The Milan prosecutor said an investigation into alleged irregularities at a pay TV company in which Fininvest is a shareholder risked reaching 'high levels in financial and political circles'. Mr Borrelli's extraordinary criticism both of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Alfredo Biondi, the justice minister, may have been ill-judged. The episode will add momentum to growing complaints in Rome of the politicisation of the judiciary. However, when Fininvest is the subject of at least seven lines of judicial inquiry, the prime minister cannot pretend that strong language from the magistrates comes as a surprise. Unpredictable outcomes The forcefulness of the intervention from Milan leaves Mr Berlusconi with two broad avenues for action, both of them unpalatable, and with unpredictable outcomes. The first would be to raise the stakes still further in the battle with the magistrates, a consequence that would certainly stem from realisation of yesterday's government threat to take legal action against Mr Borrelli. Given the passions already aroused by more than two years of corruption scandals, turning Mr Borrelli into a martyr would not only heighten the danger of a break-up of Mr Berlusconi's coalition. It could also deliver a fatal blow to the chances of bringing to a just and even-handed conclusion the many judicial corruption inquiries dogging a large number of senior Italian corporate and public figures. The second option would be for Mr Berlusconi at last to take convincing steps to clarify the questions surrounding his stewardship of Fininvest. He could offer investigating magistrates full help in clearing his name from any suspicions of impropriety, and at the same time adopt decisive measures to separate his activities in government from those of his media company. Last weekend's move by president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to forestall the government's attempt to increase fees paid by the Rai state broadcasting group reinforced the widespread impression that the government's decisions are not always impartial. Mr Berlusconi must now act to show that he places the interests of his country above those of his business. Unless he assuages these doubts, Italy's political and financial uncertainties will grow.</p>

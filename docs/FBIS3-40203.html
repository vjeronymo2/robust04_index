			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by RENMIN RIBAO reporter Yang Yong [2799 8673]: </F> "The Huaneng Group: An Attractive New Mechanism"]    [Text] Eight years ago, when the Huaneng organization was  first created, very few had high hopes for it; but its  organizers planned to use the excellent opportunity provided by  reform and opening to the outside, together with state funds for  replacing oil consumption by coal consumption, in an attempt to  take a new approach to power production. Top officials of the  State Council gave it their vigorous support.    In eight years, the organization has succeeded and has  snowballed into China's Huaneng Group, whose central activities  include the basic industries of electric power production and  coal.    After eight years, Minister of Electric Power Shi Dazhen  says  that the entire electric power industry should follow the  Huaneng Group's lead.  <H3>  The Huaneng Phenomenon: A High Starting Point, High Speed,  High Standards, and High Benefits, Exemplifying the Best, the  Most Successful, and the Most Valuable </H3>   The first stage of Huaneng's Shidongkou No. 2 power plant in  Shanghai, with two 600,000-kW supercritical fossil-fired  generating units, was imported from the United States and  Sweden. Eighteen large Chinese enterprises from various sectors  participated in its design, construction, installation and  adjustment, and the high degree of automation of generating set  operation and control and the overall high technological  standards not only make the plant a pace-setter in this country,  but put it on a par with the world state of the art. Its  high-efficiency operation and low coal consumption continue to  be astonishing. This exemplifies the high starting point of  Huaneng projects.    At Huaneng's Dezhou power plant, two domestically produced  300,000-kW generator sets were connected into the grid and  started producing power within a year; its Fuzhou and Dalian  power plants, with imported 350,000 kW generator sets, were  built and put into operation in only 24 months. In the past, the  domestic construction cycle for a power plant of this size was  usually about three years. This exemplifies the high speed of  Huaneng's construction projects.    According to previous state staffing standards, Huaneng's  Dalian power plant should have required a staff of about 1,200;  but Huaneng followed foreign management models and specified a  staff of 488. After the plant was commissioned, this staff was  decreased to 443 in 1991, and to 308 in 1992, and is now 280,  but safe, high-efficiency operation is maintained throughout the  plant, and it is a leader in many performance indicators. This  exemplifies Huaneng's high management standards. At Huaneng's  Shang'an power plant, the more than 150 persons who engaged in a  concurrent construction and modernization effort brought the  plant rapidly to full output and posted a high labor  productivity figure of 240,000 yuan for all personnel. This  exemplifies the high benefits obtained from Huaneng's operations.    Every one of Huaneng's power plants has some unusual  features.    This is the attractiveness of the Huaneng Group. It has  posted record after record for power plant construction and  management in China.    In addition, it has written a brilliant page in its own  history.    The organization of the group is as follows: it has 11  component corporations and nearly 200 component enterprises.    Its total capital has increased from less than 2 billion  yuan  at registration to a current value of 39.9 billion yuan.    The group's installed generating equipment includes a  completed or under-construction capacity of more than 17 million  kW, with 1.5 to 2 million kW of capacity commissioned each year;  this year it will contribute about a fifth of the country's  newly commissioned capacity. Over the course of three years, its  generating capacity has increased by a factor of 1.9.    Its profits were 270 million yuan in 1989, 480 million yuan  in 1990, 660 million yuan in 1991, and 1 billion yuan in 1992.    With the large and medium-size state-owned power companies  limping along, how is it that Huaneng is able to stand head and  shoulders above the rest?  <H3>  Huaneng's Advantage: Two Strong Legs from Birth, Use of  Investments and Financing Strength To Increase Its Vigor,  Rational Electricity Pricing that Moves It Rapidly Toward the  Market Economy </H3>   When head of the North China Power Industry Management  Office  Jiao Yi'an [3542 0310 1344] discussed the key factor responsible  for the difficulties that the large and medium-size state-owned  electric power enterprises are experiencing in stimulating their  vitality, he frowned: "They lack investment strength, financing  strength, and rational prices."    This is the common problem of all state-owned electric power  enterprises.    They all express interest in the Huaneng mechanism.    This is because Huaneng has taken a step forward. An  official  of the group stated: "We benefited from the policy of reform and  opening to the outside." There is no question that this policy  gave Huaneng vitality and provided it with two strong legs, so  that from the beginning it has been able to stride powerfully  ahead and advance toward the market-economy path.    To start, Huaneng created an operating mechanism which was  basically suited to the socialist market economy, and in the  course of its development, it has made use of special state loan  funds, relevant state policies, and its "four autonomies"  (independent operation, independent profit-and-loss operation,  self-development, and self-restraint) to strengthen itself  continuously, making itself a leader in China's reform of the  basic-industry investment system.    Huaneng has investment and financing strengths. It combines  the motivated character of local power generation, domestic  raising of funds, the accumulation of funding from a variety of  sources, and collective power generation, and it promotes safe  and effective project implementation and enterprise operation.  It can attract extensive foreign capital and can be selective on  international financial markets. It carries on combined  commercial, technical, credit and trade negotiations, thus  transacting a great deal of business at a small cost. We recall  that in the group's early days, a certain domestic power plant  paid US$199 million to import two 350,000-kW generator sets, but  Huaneng paid only $183 million, and in addition it bought $30  million worth of spare parts and obtained rather low loan rates.    The group charges electricity prices that are basically  consistent with the law of value: the state permits it to adjust  prices as necessary. Huaneng's main funding sources are state  special-project loans, foreign capital, and domestically raised  funds, in approximately equal proportions, all obtained on a  compensation basis: Huaneng is both the borrower and the  repayer, and it is the entity that enjoys the profits or bears  the losses. In its domestic construction loans, the interest  rate is in line with construction industry standards; its  foreign capital is borrowed at international financing interest  rates. In addition, the materials used on its construction  projects and the materials and fuels that it uses for power  production are mostly procured on the market at a negotiated  price. Were it not for Huaneng's relatively rational electricity  pricing, its enterprises would not be able to survive, to say  nothing of carrying on expanded reproduction. The formula is: a  loan and interest repayment component, a high-priced materials  component, and a fixed, rational profit. Ultimately, the group  must maintain a certain expanded reproduction capability to  provide it with staying power.    If these two strong legs could be grown by all state-owned  electric power enterprises, the power industry's growth rate  probably would be more than a mere 8%.  <H3>  The Huaneng Mechanism: A Strong Loan Repayment Orientation  and Close Ties of Each Individual to His Job as Prerequisites to  Overall Vitality </H3>   Huaneng's overall size is huge: its total worth is 39.9  billion yuan. But only about 10 percent, or slightly over 4  billion yuan, is the amount that actually belongs to the group:  more than 35 billion yuan represents debts, both foreign and  domestic. Thus Huaneng is operating under debt.    It is carrying an immense burden.    Although Huaneng's debt repayment capacity is already 3  billion yuan a year, its newly undertaken debt is also equal to  3 billion yuan.    Since it needs both to lighten its debt burden and to take  on  new burdens, Huaneng is developing dialectically and this way is  producing both benefits and electric power. Its characteristic  feature is that pressure and dynamism stimulate each other and  that interests and risks constrain each other.    Huaneng established a management model in which investment  and operations are integrated. Thus a situation in which "others  borrow the money and we have to pay off the debt" can never  occur under this model. Huaneng gives the onerous term  "repayment" a new interpretation: operation under debt and the  market risk mechanism prompt it to give top priority to  investment benefits, with forward and backward continuity of  borrowing, investment, construction and operations during each  step. Fortunately, Huaneng has an independent operations policy:  the state approves the projects and puts together the financing  package, but Huaneng calls the tune in all other respects; the  only requirement is that it produce benefits. Here are two  examples. When a coil failed at the Fuzhou power plant, the  company immediately contacted the civil aviation department and  rented an airplane to bring a replacement coil from Japan. Was  it worth the cost? Yes, because one day's stoppage of the power  plant meant a loss of 700,000 yuan, and the stoppage of a week  that is common practice would have been entirely intolerable.  Again, every day's delay in the commissioning of two 350,000-kW  generating sets means a loss of US $50,000 together with the  payment of 50,000 yuan in interest; thus, in order to shorten  the construction time and increase benefits, Huaneng has  instituted bonuses for completion of construction ahead of  schedule. For some plants, the construction organizations can  obtain a bonus of 100,000 yuan for each day that the  construction is completed ahead of schedule.    Huaneng has an effective and vigorous internal operating  mechanism whose unique property is that the group is bound  together by property relationships; the central company and the  component enterprises have a mother-daughter relationship or a  controlling-interest or partner relationship. Other than the  Huaneng International Electric Power Corporation, which is a  Chinese-foreign joint capital operation, the Huaneng group  guarantees a graduated rate of remitted profits to the higher  levels, in which the percentages of excess earnings that are  allocated to the total contract amount and to total wage are  linked to the amount of profits tax paid, the amount of  electricity generated, and the amount of coal transported, with  an effort to move into line with international practice. Each  year, the corporation pays a graduated rate of 10 percent of  profits to the government, higher than the 7.2 percent rate paid  by the Shougang Iron and Steel Works; the enterprise and the  state divide the remainder in 30:70 proportions. If the  company's profits increase by 1 percent, wages are increased by  0.7 percent. Close profit-and-loss relationships between the  company and the state, the enterprise and the group, and the  employee and the enterprise have been set up. The human factor  has been assigned a highly rational part in the development of  production. Production relations have been streamlined, thus  guaranteeing the group's strong market competitiveness.  <H3>  Huaneng's Path: Still Expanding, Standing the Test of the  Steadily Improving Socialist Market Economy, Continually  Improving Itself </H3>   Basic-industry projects involve large investments, long  construction times, low profit rates, and a slow return on  investment, and they must have a relatively stable source of  funding if smooth progress on the projects is to be assured. In  the eight years of Huaneng's operation, in addition to using  foreign capital and locally raised funds, it has relied for its  construction funds primarily on loans for the replacement of oil  by coal. Starting this year, because the state has decided to  "bring oil prices into line once and for all," these loans have  been greatly decreased, and many projects currently under  construction face the danger of suspension or stretching out of  the investments. This year, the size of the scheduled state loan  to Huaneng for replacement of oil by coal was 2 billion yuan.  Ultimately it will be able to disburse only 900 million yuan,  but the amount actually disbursed in the first half-year will be  only slightly more than 200 million yuan. Thus Huaneng too is  facing a funds shortage.    Huaneng therefore laid its emphasis on opening up direct and  indirect financing channels. It is now making arrangements for  the establishment of experimental joint-stock enterprises and is  arranging for the existing Huaneng Finance Corporation to have  expanded functions. It has vigorously sought cooperation with  international investment groups and has opened up more funding  avenues. In May of this year, the Russell 20/20 Group, which is  the largest retirement fund in the United States, visited China  and reached an agreement in principle to enter a  power-generation partnership with Huaneng. The Huaneng  International Electric Power Development Corporation has also  discussed joint-capital power generation with investment groups  in the United States and Hong Kong; it is currently organizing  some of its plants in Shandong into a joint-stock corporation  for entry into overseas markets; and it has opened new channels  that will allow it to utilize foreign capital.    Huaneng's new objective in power generation is to install 15  million kW of new generating capacity by the year 2000 and to  help the country free itself from its severe stagnation in  electric power, so that this vanguard sector can truly break out  of its bottleneck and move ahead.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Most Argentina unions ignore general strike ARGENTINA'S first general strike in over three years was less than a resounding success yesterday, with all but a few key unions largely ignoring the call for a one-day stoppage in protest at the government's economic policies. In Buenos Aires, the capital and largest city, shops were open, offices and banks worked normally, while public transport operated at about 70 per cent of its usual capacity. However, Mr Edmundo Soria, transport secretary, admitted that the city's train system, which normally transports between 1.3m and 1.4m people a day, was practically paralysed, as were bus services in working-class areas of southern Buenos Aires. The strike went off relatively peacefully, apart from a small bomb which exploded harmlessly outside the headquarters of the CGT union confederation. Pickets also attacked and burned several buses. Companies in the Buenos Aires industrial belt and other industrial centres said their factories were either brought to a complete halt or worked well below capacity. Reports from Cordoba, Argentina's third largest city, say the strike was 90 per cent effective. The CGT called the strike to protest against President Carlos Menem's plans to abolish union privileges and reform Argentina's rigid labour laws. Although the pro-Peronist unions called 13 general strikes to defeat economic reform under the previous government of President Raul Alfonsin, they have not resisted the privatisations and mass dismissals decreed by Mr Menem, a Peronist. However, they have drawn the line at the government's attempts to eliminate union control over welfare funds, estimated to be worth Dollars 5bn a year. Unions are also up in arms over a ban on wage indexation and plans to make it easier for companies to sack workers. Economists say that labour and social security reforms are vital to maintain the balance and momentum of the government's free market policies. Underlying the economic issues is a political struggle. Mr Menem needs union support to amend the constitution to allow him to stand for re-election when his term ends in 1995. Analysts say that is why he has so far shrunk from tackling labour reform. Union bosses are also attempting to recover their former political ascendancy. But yesterday's strike was hardly convincing as a show of union strength. Strikes under the previous government were much more disruptive, especially in the country's bigger cities, which nearly shut down. The traditionally powerful unions are slowly losing support in the country. Pollsters note that the unions have failed to capitalise on growing discontent caused by falling wages and collapsing social services, mainly because their leadership is widely viewed as bureaucratic and unrepresentative.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Aleksey Bryachikhin, prefect of Moscow's </F> Western Administrative District, by Nikolay Andreyev, under "Our  Life" rubric: "Fair and Square--Is That 50-50? How To Develop a  Formula To Make It Possible To Move Muscovites Out of  `Khrushchev Slums'"]    [Text] Another major problem has hit Moscow: many of  the "Khrushchev slums" have long exceeded their designated  lifetime and living in them is getting not only uncomfortable,  but simply dangerous. They should be torn down, but that is  easier said than done: where to get the trillions of rubles  needed to tear down old houses and build new ones to move people  into? The capital's lean treasury has no money for such a major  undertaking, and no help from the federal government is  forthcoming. Is there no way out? "There is," says A.  Bryachikhin, prefect of the Western Administrative District.    [Andreyev] What are your plans on this score, Aleksey  Mikheyevich?    [Bryachikhin] Why just plans? We try not to talk, but to do  at least something for real. We have already begun to move  people out of "Khrushchev slums." Their first occupants will  celebrate housewarmings in the first half of this year.    [Andreyev] Where will they celebrate their housewarmings  when, as I know, the district receives very little free  municipal housing, while the waiting list is huge?    [Bryachikhin] We are already building new apartment houses  to  resettle people from old houses on a commercial basis in the  Matveyevskoye, Mosfilmovskiy, Solntsevo, and several other  municipal districts. Twenty thousand square meters of housing  were built last year, and 200,000 are nearing completion this  year. I anticipate your next question: "Where do you get the  money?" We have only one solution: attract investors. Here is  one example of business cooperation. Construction of new housing  in a neighborhood in the Fili-Davydkovo municipal district,  where seventeen 22-story buildings will go up, will be financed  by the Russian company KONTI, the design was produced by  Mosproyekt-1 workshop No. 14, and the main subcontractor is the  Sokoliniye Gory Construction House joint-stock company. We are  carrying out reconstruction jobs in batches, block by block.    [Andreyev] On what terms did you contract the investors?    [Bryachikhin] Fair and square: fifty-fifty. The authorities  contribute land, the investors all the rest: financing, design,  construction, and ownership. For that the contract assigns them  half the property--apartments in the new houses, with the other  half going to us to resettle people from the "Khrushchev slums."    [Andreyev] Isn't the cost pretty steep?    [Bryachikhin] What can one do if there is no other way out?  Waiting for the old houses to start collapsing, and, God forbid,  with human casualties, is simply criminal.    [Andreyev] What do you plan to do with the old buildings:  tear them down or reconstruct or reinforce them?    [Bryachikhin] We will only tear them down, because many of  the buildings of that series simply cannot be reconstructed. As  for those houses where it might be possible, the cost would be  higher than new construction. And one more question: who would  undertake the reconstruction, and how? Builders would not come,  because new construction is continuous, with high productivity,  so they earn fairly well. It would hardly be possible to earn as  much in reconstruction.    [Andreyev] So you will just tear down the houses and dump  the  rubble?    [Bryachikhin] Not at all. We already have the experience of  the former Sevastopol rayon, where they had begun to tear down  old buildings. The bathroom fixtures were removed, the panels  were crushed into gravel, which can be used to build good roads  or cottages on garden plots. We will do likewise.    [Andreyev] I heard of your prefecture's conflict with the  municipal housing department regarding a new house on  Michurinskiy Prospekt avenue. Can you explain this?    [Bryachikhin] Indeed, our prefecture has filed a suit  against  the municipal housing department with the arbitration court.  Here is the issue: Jointly with the Sovtels firm we built an  apartment house in the 38th block of the avenue on the following  conditions: 45 percent of the apartments go to the company, 25  percent to the subcontractor, and 35 percent to us and the  district police. We worked together, built the house, and then  what? The municipal housing department, which had virtually  nothing to do with the house, took it over and began  distributing housing as it saw fit. Many want a share...    [Andreyev] But that is daytime robbery...    [Bryachikhin] There is nothing I can say. I appealed to  Yuriy  Mikhaylovich Luzhkov, he instructed the department to return the  housing. They returned the company's share, but the prefecture  has still received nothing. Many investors got concerned, and  one can understand them: is it worth risking, investing huge  sums, which then may go to the wind? Because of the municipal  housing department we could not only lose investors, but a vital  important undertaking may grind to a halt.    [Andreyev] Aleksey Mikheyevich, not long ago our paper  published an item that the mayor had dispatched some kind of  special commission to your prefecture to check abuses by heads  of municipal districts and services of the district. Is the  commission already "digging"?    [Bryachikhin] It is quite different. There is indeed a  commission from the mayor's office in the district, but it is  here on a regular basis. The government decided to have district  heads report on the resolution of strategic and current issues  of servicing the population. They began with us. As for the  arrest of three district executives, which did take place, only  the court can decide what violations they committed. The  investigation is continuing.</p>

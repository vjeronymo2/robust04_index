			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hartons losses double to Pounds 1.88m Hartons Group, engaged in plastic sheet and film, doubled its losses from Pounds 938,000 to Pounds 1.88m pre-tax for the half year ended June 30. Comparative figures were restated to conform with FRS 3. Turnover of continuing activities declined from Pounds 35.35m to Pounds 29.68m. Losses per share emerged at 2.8p (1.4p). The preference dividend is again being omitted. The directors said the depressed trading conditions in mainland Europe were likely to influence the overall results for the foreseeable future despite progress made in the UK.</p>

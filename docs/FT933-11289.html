			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Lloyd's attacks rival proposal LLOYD'S of London has written to all of its 20,000-plus Names condemning an alternative business plan as 'fundamentally flawed'. The plan, drawn up by Mr David Springbett, a Lloyd's broker, proposes that new corporate investors pay a portion of future profits to compensate loss-making Names, the individuals whose assets support the market. In the letter Lloyd's says the plan's aim to attract new capital amounts to 'wishful thinking' and will 'drive new members away'. Mr Springbett has advised Names to vote against a motion supporting the existing Lloyd's management in a ballot currently under way. The result is due on 10 August. Meanwhile, 372 Names taking legal action against the managers of Pulbrook syndicate have been told the case will be heard in December. Separately, Lloyd's has claimed victory in another US court case involving pollution. The New Jersey Supreme Court reaffirmed two lower court decisions in favour of insurers in a case involving Morton International, which sued its insurers for recovery of contamination clean-up costs at Berry's Creek in New Jersey. Costs of the clean-up were estimated at Dollars 100m (Pounds 67.1m). Insurers provided coverage between 1960 and 1975. The DTI has published long-awaited proposals allowing UK insurers to establish equalisation reserves. If the proposals are adopted US insurers will be able to set aside part of their non-life profits from good years to meet losses suffered in bad ones. Tax relief will be claimed on the amounts transferred.</p>

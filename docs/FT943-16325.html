			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Building materials Yesterday's sharp rise in many building material companies' share prices rests on rather flimsy foundations. The 13 per cent real increase in sales in May on a year-on-year basis, as recorded by the Builders Merchants Federation, is certainly good news. But the share price responses - Caradon up over 2 per cent, Redland and RMC up more than 3 per cent, and Wolseley and Blue Circle rising over 4 per cent - look overdone. Drawing conclusions about the future from monthly figures is always risky. It is doubly so when the indicator is a lagging one, as is the case with sales through building merchants. These reflect construction decisions made earlier in the year, principally by house-builders. The snag is that though the housing market started the year in fine fettle, the recovery has recently seemed to falter. Some of the market weakness is undoubtedly seasonal. Housing market activity and prices may perk up again in the autumn. But that remains to be seen. In the meantime, an important determinant of building material companies' share prices will be interest rate prospects. The best news for the housing market would be if long-term rates fell, bringing down those for fixed-rate mortgages in their trail. That could follow today's meeting of the Fed Open Market Committee and the G7 summit later this week. But it would be rash to count on it.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEWELRY DISTRICT'S SECURITY SYSTEMS ARE NOT FAIL-SAFE  </P> <P> In the multimillion-dollar jewelry district of downtown Los Angeles, security  precautions can range from armed guards and video cameras to alarms, sensitive  electronic entry and exit ways and even bullet-proof glass partitions or  security waiting rooms.  </P> <P> But a jeweler or manufacturer who pays top dollar for such protections may  never be completely safe, especially if a determined thief is willing to take  time to gain their confidence, according to security officials and others who  work in the jewelry district, which is concentrated on Hill Street and  Broadway.  </P> <P> "You can have cameras, (electronic alarm) buttons, armed guards -- even fire  escapes that are wired," said Marcell Mobley, security supervisor for the Von  Lewis Security Co., which protects the Los Angeles Jewelry Center in the 600  block of Hill Street.  </P> <P> If a jeweler decides to allow entry to strangers when he has substantial  amounts of gold or gems on hand -- as the owner of the Rope Mine Jewelry Co. at  610 S. Broadway did Wednesday morning -- "then we have no control over it,"  Mobley said. "That's one of the hazards of . . . being open to the public. It's  kind of hard to prevent this sort of thing."  </P> <P> In the case of Wednesday's brazen theft of nearly $1 million in 24-karat gold  grains and other gold products, the two robbers bound the owner and his  employees before they could push alarm buttons, and escaped before they could  alert authorities.  </P> <P> "It's a sad thing to have happen," said Moussa Hassid, business manager for the  Jewelry Center. "For a business owner, it is very difficult to know whether it  is a legitimate business person or not."  </P> <P> Some security company officials expressed confidence in their operations.  </P> <P> "The kind of thing that happened (at the Rope Mine Jewelry Co.) is not going to  happen here," said Clark Wilmoth, who handles security at the California  Jewelry Mart, which is home to numerous jewelers and jewelry manufacturers on  Hill Street. "We can't take any more drastic measures -- not unless we want to  spend a billion dollars and have an aircraft carrier sitting in the street."  </P> <P> Still, even the best measures are not foolproof, he said.  </P> <P> "Someone can come in and look at a certain diamond, will pass themselves off as  someone that knows the language of diamonds. They may come back two or three  times before they steal anything so they can gain the store owner's  confidence," Wilmoth said.  </P> <P> Detective Lou Boozell, who specializes in jewelry thefts for the Los Angeles  Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division, compared security systems to  insurance policies: "You can have too little or too much."  </P> <P> Some places within the jewelry district have very little in the way of  security, Boozell said. Others have "alarms, locked doors, double-locked  entrances" and security waiting rooms.  </P> <P> But even so, he added, many business owners don't check for identification.  "You've got to reach a happy medium between how much security is enough and how  much is so much that (it) would scare away the people."  </P> <P> Nelson Colton, president of A-Mark Precious Metals Inc. in Los Angeles, one of  the nation's leading wholesalers of precious metals, expressed surprise that  strangers were allowed entry where so much gold was on hand.  </P> <P> "I'd actually have a bullet-proof window between me and a customer if I had  that much (gold). . . . I would not let people in an office of that nature  unless I previously had identified them."  </P> <P> Colton, whose firm usually employs armored security guards to transport  precious metals and does not keep valuable material on the premises, added that  Wednesday's gold theft was somewhat unusual in his experience.  </P> <P> "Very rarely are you actually hit for gold," he said. "Diamonds are robbed and  things of this kind. This obviously was well planned."  </P> <P> If nothing else, the gold theft serves as a reminder for others to be on their  guard, security experts said.  </P> <P> "The whole jewelry district is alerted about this now," Mobley said. "Once word  spreads . . . it will be more difficult to gain entry. . . . People will be  more cautious. They'll say, 'If you're a regular customer, I'll let you in. If  I don't know you, I won't.'

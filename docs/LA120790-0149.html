			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION;  </P> <P> CANVASSING ARTY-GOERS  </P> <P> Art by Henry Matisse, Robert Longo and Andy Warhol may have been on the walls.  </P> <P> But guests attending the ART/LA '90 preview party Wednesday night opted for art  of the wearable kind by such fashion designers as Jean Paul Gautier, Valentino,  Betsy Johnson and Commes des Garcons.  </P> <P> Although the event was billed around an Earth theme, few party-goers taking in  the fifth international contemporary art fair got the message.  </P> <P> About the only thing green at the Los Angeles Convention Center was a  smattering of velvet party dresses, an occasional man's suit and a few floppy  hats.  </P> <P> Some men accented otherwise uninspired navy or gray pin-striped suits with  "rain forest" floral-printed neckwear.  </P> <P> However, many of the artists and/or art lovers took a more, well, artistic  approach.  </P> <P> Engineer-striped blazers, stirrup pants, leather jackets, baggy jeans and  vintage sharkskin suits were among the most inspirational.  </P> <P> Designer Michele Lamy, wearing a prison-striped leggings and fishing for "art  that will fit in my pocket," set the costume tone for many of the women.  </P> <P> Several guests appeared to have gotten lost in a sequin supply house.  </P> <P> Others opted for leggy party dresses, fitted jackets, wraparound bustiers and,  in one instance, a cocktail dress complete with hat and feather boa.  </P> <P> "Are you an artist?" one guest inquired. "No," another replied.  </P> <P> "Artistic?"  </P> <P> Yes!" WILLIAM KISSEL  </P></p>

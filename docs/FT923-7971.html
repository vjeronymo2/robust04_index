			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy The economic news has been filled with such unremitting gloom of late that yesterday's figures for manufacturing output stand out a little more than they deserve. An 0.2 per cent increase in June together with small upward revisions for April and May were better than financial markets had expected. Output actually rose by 0.4 per cent in the second quarter over the first, raising the possibility that GDP may have been flat during the period instead of falling as the City had begun to assume. But if that means the scribblers may be spared the trouble of downgrading their 1992 forecasts yet again, it does not allow them to revise them upwards either. It is not as if CBI survey evidence points to a further rise in manufacturing output during the current quarter. Nor is there much consolation in a 29,100 monthly increase in July unemployment which is above the quarterly trend in recent months. The good news might be that average earnings growth has fallen to 6 per cent, but that also is a measure of the extent to which the economy is still under pressure. So it is not the ideal moment for sterling to close at just DM2.8170. Though still some four pfennigs above its absolute D-Mark floor, sterling is painfully close to the point where the government must raise interest rates or lose the market's trust in its determination to defend the parity.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> ASK THE INSPECTOR: UNBOLTED FOUNDATION INDICATES OLDER HOME  </P> <P> QUESTION: I have been informed that the foundation of my house is not bolted.  Is this a serious defect? Should I insist that my next home be bolted?  </P> <P> ANSWER: First of all, a "non-bolted" foundation is not necessarily a defect; it  primarily indicates that your home is older. After the 1933 Long Beach  earthquake, the Field Act went into effect in 1935. Most notably, the Field Act  called for improved concrete, the use of reinforcing steel and the joining of  structures and foundations by anchor bolts.  </P> <P> This makes homes built post-1935 more earthquake resistive, and by definition,  stronger. However, bear in mind that a pre-1935 house you may have been  considering has survived three significant earthquakes (1933, 1971 and 1987),  and the vast majority have come through in good stead.  </P> <P> I have inspected hundreds of pre-1935 houses, and while some have had problems,  I can recall fewer than five where the foundation system required wholesale  rehabilitation or replacement. While ultimately, a house with a bolted  foundation might be preferable, it would be a bit close-minded to exclude from  your plans an older home simply because the foundation is non-bolted. More  attention should be paid to an older foundation, however, particularly with  regard to area drainage (from the eaves and grounds) and trees directly  adjacent to the home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inspector Is Needed to Protect Investment  </P> <P> Q: Why do I need an inspector?  </P> <P> A: 1. You are making one of the most important investments in your life, and  you should have it inspected by a professional home inspector who is trained in  the home inspection industry.  </P> <P> 2. Each home has many idiosyncrasies. Some can be life threatening, costly or  very minor. A professionally trained, experienced inspector can evaluate these  problems and professionally report them to you in a written report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Get Bids From Licensed Contractors for Repairs  </P> <P> Q: I want to make repairs on my new home. Will the inspector tell me costs of  repairs?  </P> <P> A: If the inspector is a general contractor, he should be qualified to give you  approximate costs. However, these costs will vary depending on who is giving  them. For actual costs, it is always recommended that you get three bids and  always get them from a qualified, licensed contractor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Insulation Required in Houses Built After 1975  </P> <P> Q: My new home is not insulated. Is this a requirement?  </P> <P> A: No. It wasn't until about 1975 that new homes were required to be fully  insulated. This is a state law, Chapter 24 of the housing code.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Smoke Alarm Needed at Time of Home Sale  </P> <P> Q: Do I have to have smoke alarms in my home?  </P> <P> A: No. At the time of a sale of a home in California, the smoke alarm has to be  installed. The state requires one alarm in a home. Each city has its own codes.  </P> <P> The city of Los Angeles requires smoke alarms to be installed in bedrooms and  adjacent halls to the bedrooms. They are to be on the ceiling or within 12  inches of the ceiling. Alarms in single-family dwellings can be battery  operated, and all others shall be hard wired. In new construction, they will be  hard wired in all units. The homeowner may put in the alarms. If he doesn't,  then the buyer is required to. In apartments, they were required by law in  1983, and the owner is supposed to check them every six months. He is supposed  to keep a log on this.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Power Lines Will Tell Voltage of Wiring  </P> <P> Q: How can I tell if I have 240-volt wiring in my home?  </P> <P> A: If there are three wires from the power pole to the home, it is 240. On the  twisted cable drop lines the cable is the third wire. Any home built after  World War II will have 240.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inspector Should Act on Safety Hazards  </P> <P> Q: I am selling my house, and recently our house was professionally inspected  for a prospective buyer. We were gone at the time of the inspection. I think  the inspector hired by the buyer overstepped his bounds by turning off our gas  because he found a gas leak.  </P> <P> We returned that evening to a cold house with no gas and nothing to alert us  but a note to call a plumber or the gas company and a message on our telephone  recorder from our realtor with the same advice.  </P> <P> A: Come on now! Would you rather have returned to find your house filled with  gas -- or worse? While there are no rigorous guidelines for an inspector  detecting an unsafe condition, common sense (and probably common law) should  demand that the inspector take suitable action when an imminent hazard is  detected. It would appear that the inspector and realtor both did what they  could in your absence, and you should thank them both for their concern.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Upgrading Fuses Can Boost Electrical System  </P> <P> Q: My home has fuses. Should these be changed?  </P> <P> A: No. There is nothing wrong with fuses. They usually never fail to function.  However, a lot of them deteriorate with age. Some lose their ability to carry  their maximum volted amperage with each tripping of the breaker. Fuses will  date a home. Most homes built after 1950 will have circuit breaker panels. They  still use fuses for main electrical panels.  </P> <P> However, most older homes have upgraded the electrical systems to meet today's  electrical needs. Older service panels were 50 or 70 amps. With all of our  modern appliances, these usually will not be large enough to carry the load  required by today's electrical needs. Panels are required to be a minimum of  100 amps or larger on all homes today.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plan Home Inspection at Beginning of Escrow  </P> <P> Q: I am preparing to buy a house. Different people give me conflicting advice  on scheduling a home inspection. Some say, wait until near the close of escrow  so any problems that develop during the escrow period will be spotted. Others  say, have it done right away. Any suggestions?  </P> <P> A: Most sales contracts will require you to have the inspection early rather  than late, because it is a contingency that "clouds" the sale until completed.  But there are good reasons why you, too, should prefer an early inspection.  </P> <P> The risk of new problems developing during escrow is small compared to the risk  that you will have to make a hasty decision if you wait. Bear in mind that the  inspector is a generalist, and may very well advise you to consult a specialist  on a specific problem.  </P> <P> For example, a furnace may show suspicious symptoms that the inspector flags.  He or she will likely advise you to consult a heating contractor for further  analysis. If that advice does not come until the day before escrow is to close,  you're left in the lurch between assuming the risky furnace or delaying  closing.  </P> <P> Ross is the public relations chairman for the California Real Estate Inspection  Assn.

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Mortgage broker 'preyed on greed' A mortgage broker 'preyed on the greed' of investors and conned them out of Pounds 43m in a mortgage lending fraud, Oxford Crown Court heard yesterday. Mr Roy Wharton persuaded retired couples and businesses to hand over cash for his schemes and transferred money between different accounts so the extent of his company's financial difficulties could not be traced, said Mr Philip Mott QC, prosecuting. Mr Wharton denies two counts of fraudulent trading and two of using a false instrument, the latter referring to a charge on a house and a lending agreement.</p>

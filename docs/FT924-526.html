			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Court suspends Moi candidates Kenya's High Court yesterday suspended the nominations of nine candidates from Kenya's ruling Kanu party - the party of President Daniel arap Moi - after opposition parties alleged foul play in next week's general elections, Reuter reports from Nairobi. The ruling temporarily stopped the automatic election of nine Kanu candidates who were declared unopposed in Kenya's first multi-party polls for 26 years. Opposition parties alleged their candidates were prevented from handing in nomination papers.</p>

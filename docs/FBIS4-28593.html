			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Most villagers living in the vicinity of the  so-called "safe area" for dissident Burmese students in Rat  Buri's Pak Tho district are disgusted with the behaviour of the  students, saying they are unruly, aggressive and arrogant, with  a distinct bent for the bottle.    The villagers say they would rather see the Burmese Students  Centre, as the designated safe area is officially called,  relocated elsewhere so that peace can once again return to their  community.    Relations between the villagers and the students worsened  recently when four Burmese at the centre were injured in attacks  by Thai villagers, with each side blaming the other for the  escalating tension.    The incident sparked an outcry from the students who duly  filed through their representatives complaints with the Interior  Ministry, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),  and foreign embassies in Bangkok, and also used the media to  highlight their plight.    The students say they have been targets of constant attack  by  villagers and since their so-called "safe area" was no longer  secure they didn't want to continue living there.    There are a total of 183 Burmese housed at the Rat Buri  centre, also called Ban Maniloi, according to the latest count.    The students told the media of the stress they were going  through stemming from the constant fear of another attack by  Thai villagers since the security guards at the entrance of the  centre not only didn't help them but tended to side with the  villagers.    "We want to live with the Thai villagers like brothers and  sisters, but we do not know why the villagers do not like us and  want to hurt us," one of them said.    But according to the villagers the Burmese are the  trouble-makers, a fact confirmed by camp officials, who  requested anonymity.    Samruai Kaenkut, the headman of Ban Maniloi, was less  critical, saying as far as he knew only 16 students had acted in  an arrogant and irresponsible manner, causing trouble not only  to their colleagues but also to the villagers.    Police have to be careful in dealing with them because the  students being foreigners, any legal action against them may  entail intervention from foreign missions in Bangkok, including  the UNHCR.    The alleged rape of a seven-year-old schoolgirl of Wat  Maniloi School by a Burmese student is believed to have sparked  the local anger and subsequent attacks on the Burmese.    Police have said they will take action but after consulting  their superiors and after they have gathered more evidence.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / LA law reignites a smouldering resentment: The eruption of violence in one of America's biggest cities shows deep - rooted and long ignored racial tensions Nobody could have anticipated this verdict.' Tom Bradley, Mayor of Los Angeles and a black man, was probably expressing the visceral reaction of the great majority of Americans of all races when four white Los Angeles police officers were acquitted on Wednesday of savagely beating Rodney King, also black, after a high-speed car chase. It was an horrific incident captured on amateur video and replayed endlessly on the nation's television screens over the 13 months since it took place. But a lot of people had anticipated or feared what followed in mostly black south central Los Angeles. Again live, and this time in full colour, the nation watched aghast as blocks erupted in flames and as innocent motorists were dragged from cars and trucks and beaten with a savagery equivalent to that visited on Rodney King. 'I steal a Twinkie (a snack cake) and get six months, they nearly kill a black man and get off,' said a young black. 'What's going on here?' What is going on is an issue that this country has been ducking for years. It embraces race, ethnicity, inner-city decay and the administration of justice. Some of the circumstances may be peculiar to Los Angeles - in particular the behaviour of its police department - but most are universal. Another Bradley, Bill, the Democratic Senator from New Jersey, took to the Senate floor a month ago in a powerful speech. Having made his name first as a professional basketball player, a white man in a black sport who learned, as he put it, to see the city 'through the eyes of my black teammates', his words carried some authority. 'In politics for the last 25 years, silence or distortion has shaped the issue of race and urban America. Both political parties have contributed to the problem. Republicans have played the race card in a divisive way to get votes - remember Willie Horton - and Democrats have suffocated discussion of self-destructive behaviour among the minority population in a cloak of silence and denial. The result is that yet another generation has been lost. 'The divide among races in our cities deepens, with white Americans more and more unwilling to spend the money necessary to ameliorate the physical conditions or to see why the absence of meaning in the lives of many urban children threatens the future of their own children.' It is a precise and brave analysis. The general flight to the suburbs, including by middle-class blacks, has rendered the country politically more indifferent to the plight of inner cities. The relative economic success of the new wave of immigrants from Asia and Cuba has increased tensions between minorities, as seen in the disturbances in Miami two years ago, Washington last year and in Japan Town in Los Angeles on Wednesday night. The Asian success, in particular, has certainly been taken by Republicans as a vindication of free market philosophy. The Reagan and Bush administrations, and the courts they have appointed, have sought to reverse the classic affirmative action approach of the 1960s, which was designed to practice, if necessary, reverse discrimination in order to increase the educational, social and job prospects of blacks. Thus President Bush nearly vetoed last year's civil rights legislation because he saw it as being 'a quota bill'. This year, Mr Bill Clinton, who has run well among those blacks who do vote, has a programme for inner-city regeneration, centering on public works, incentives to private sector investment and job training. But he, too, has sensed that it might not be politically advantageous to go beyond that. If black Americans did feel 25 years ago that past injustices were being redressed, they cannot today. But Senator Bradley is also right to point to the 'self-destructive' behaviour of some minorities, and there are plenty of statistics to back this up. Consider a recent study on Washington, DC, which is about three-quarters black. The non-profit National Center on Institutions and Alternatives found that, on any given day last year, no less than 42 per cent of all black males aged between 18 and 35 were somehow involved with the criminal justice system. As many as 70 per cent had been arrested by the time they reached 35. There are other figures, too. Infant mortality among blacks is double the national average, more than 40 per cent of all black children live below the official poverty line, blacks account for nearly 30 per cent of all Aids cases, while nearly half all US murder victims are black. The depradations wrought by disease, drugs, other crime and the lack of economic opportunity are all reflected in these numbers. If political indifference and manipulation among whites is an exacerbating factor, it also exists on the other side of the racial divide. For the national black political leadership is now a shadow of what it was before, and even for some time after, Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968. Only the Rev Jesse Jackson stands as a man of substance, and his political power is in decline, though not irreversibly. It was especially ironic that Los Angeles should erupt the night before the final TV showing of the Bill Cosby programme. For the comedian's black middle-class situation comedy family, literate, prosperous and caring, represented in many respects an ideal of an integrated America. Black role models now are very different; Mike Tyson, the boxer seen by many blacks as a victim of injustice, Marion Barry, the former mayor of Washington, released last week after serving time for cocaine possession and also seen as a victim; Los Angeles gang leaders, fighting crime, according to popular culture, but not exactly playing by the rules of the book. Equally, Clarence Thomas, the new Supreme Court justice, is seen more as a white pawn, which would never have been said of his black predecessor on the court, Thurgood Marshall. But the failings, and the alienation of blacks, are also institutional. The Los Angeles police department may be an extreme case. Last summer, after the Rodney King beating, a special commission, put together by Mayor Bradley and headed by Warren Christopher, the former undersecretary of state, reported, devastatingly, on the degree of racism and brutality in the department. It urged that Daryl F Gates, 13 years the LA police chief and a fierce defender of his troops, be replaced. Last month this happened; his job was handed to Willie Williams, a black with a progressive record running the police in Philadelphia. But Mr Williams has not moved west yet and it was Mr Gates who has been on the airwaves constantly in the past 24 hours, defending the acquittals and condemning the violence afflicting the city. That the trial took place in neighbouring, affluent Ventura County, and in front of a jury of 10 whites, an Asian American and an Hispanic, may be explained by the difficulty of getting a fair hearing in front of an inner-city jury in Los Angeles itself. But to many blacks that is white legal sophistry and a further indication of double standards in the practice of justice. No wonder the country is tense today; no wonder there are so many appeals for calm, from the president on down. For what is happening in Los Angeles could spread, and no one wants a re-run of 1968.</p>

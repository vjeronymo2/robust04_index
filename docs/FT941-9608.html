			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / A reality check on healthcare reform: America There was something of the doctor's reassuring bedside manner in the Clinton administration's presentation of its healthcare reform proposal. The plan would end uncertainty about health insurance by guaranteeing all Americans access to care that 'could never be taken away'. Yet it would not involve a large extension of government because employers would continue to finance most care. The proposed regional alliances or purchasing co-operatives would simply 'manage' competition between private sector providers. In presenting their plan this way, Bill and Hillary Clinton were bending the truth. Under their scheme, people would remain insured even if they or their employers failed to pay the required premiums. They would remain insured even if the health plan they joined went bankrupt. But there is only one entity that can provide such an absolute guarantee: government. As the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) - an independent fiscal watchdog - ruled last week, the Clinton reform is essentially a public-sector plan dressed in private clothing. 'It would,' said the CBO, 'establish both a federal entitlement to health benefits and a system of mandatory payments to finance those benefits that represents an exercise of sovereign power. In administering the proposed program, regional alliances, corporate alliances and state single-payer plans (if any) would operate primarily as agents of the federal government.' The CBO concluded that health alliances should be treated in the same way as Social Security, the federally-run pension scheme. The transactions of alliances would be 'off-budget' - treated separately from other federal accounts. But premium payments would count as federal revenue. The CBO's logic is hard to fault. Under the White House plan, all individuals would have to purchase insurance and all employers would have to pay 80 per cent of the average cost of health premiums. The federal government, moreover, would largely determine the level of those premiums and the nature of the benefits they purchased. A new agency, the National Health Board, would control the rate of growth of premiums; and the net financial burden on companies and individuals would depend on the level of subsidies voted by Congress. The way certain financial flows are classified ought not to matter a great deal. But in practice the CBO report is political dynamite because it implies the Clinton plan would result in a huge expansion of the public sector. Within a decade, alliances would be collecting more than Dollars 500bn in premium payments from companies and individuals (as well as nearly Dollars 250bn in direct federal subsidies). The Clinton scheme would thus supplant social security as the largest federal entitlement programme and dwarf such minor enterprises as the Pentagon. If enacted, the reform would eventually raise federal spending by perhaps six to seven percentage points as a share of gross domestic product, bringing the US into line with other industrial countries. The CBO carefully avoided the dreaded 'T' word; but the compulsory health premiums would obviously represent a correspondingly large increase in the federal tax base. As a final blow, the CBO rejected the White House's optimistic claims that healthcare reform would reduce the budget deficit by Dollars 60bn over the next five years, claiming it would, instead, raise the deficit by Dollars 70bn. Indeed, it would act as a budgetary drain at least until 2004. The politically damaging CBO report follows public rejection of the White House proposals by three leading business groups and a blizzard of negative TV ads financed by the private health insurance industry. The Clintons thus face a Sisyphean struggle in negotiations with congressional leaders. Yet they still hold some cards. Who can deny the moral force in Mr Clinton's claim that a civilised country should guarantee universal health cover? Under the present regime, private insurance is beyond the means of many working people. A chronic illness or an uninsurable 'existing condition' can bankrupt even the affluent. No other developed country countenances such barbarism. By insisting on a honest presentation of the Clinton plan as a public sector solution to this acute social problem, the CBO has performed a valuable public service. But in doing so it has not demolished the plan; on the contrary it says the White House proposals will guarantee universal cover and will, eventually, reduce the growth of healthcare spending, in the process saving US industry billions of dollars. The US now faces a painful choice. There are plenty of piecemeal ways to improve access to healthcare and reduce upward pressure on costs. Congress can pass laws to prevent insurance companies discriminating against the ill, to provide cash subsidies toward the cost of insurance for poor families, to cap the tax deductibility of premiums, and to facilitate the creation of private purchasing co-operatives for small business. This, essentially, is the approach favoured by Republicans and conservative Democrats. But it is no use pretending that such incremental changes can provide the absolute guarantee of health cover sought by Mr Clinton and long delivered in Europe, Japan and Canada. Government alone can provide this guarantee and only the American people can decide whether the goal is important enough to warrant an historic extension of the public sector's role in society.</p>

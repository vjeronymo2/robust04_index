			<p><P> September 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPER INDUSTRY DISPUTES U.S. DATA ON DIOXIN  </P> <P> Paper companies on Thursday strongly disputed EPA findings that their mills are  contaminating fish with hazardous dioxin at levels posing a serious health risk  to local fishermen who eat their catch.  </P> <P> Industry spokesmen charged that the Environmental Protection Agency relied on  outdated information in assessing the health risk from dioxin residues that are  released into streams from bleaching processes used to make white paper  products.  </P> <P> In particular, they said the agency had relied on fish tissue samples taken in  1988 that did not reflect recent improvements in the bleaching process that the  companies say have greatly reduced dioxin discharges.  </P> <P> "The EPA ignored more recent data that calls into serious question the basis of  their risk assessments," said Richard Phillips, vice president and director of  process technology for the International Paper Co., whose Georgetown, S.C.,  plant was cited as posing the highest dioxin risks of any U.S. paper mill.  </P> <P> The EPA said people eating two quarter-pound meals a month of fish caught  downstream from the Georgetown plant faced a lifetime cancer risk of 1 in 100.  The agency said sport or subsistence fishermen who eat larger amounts were  exposed to a cancer risk of 1 in 10.  </P> <P> Altogether, the EPA said 20 paper mills nationwide expose local fishermen to a  lifetime cancer risk greater than 1 in 10,000. In contrast, the EPA considers a  cancer risk of 1 in a million a permissible level of dioxin risk.  </P> <P> The industry already has pledged cooperation with EPA efforts to reduce dioxin  discharges by improving its bleaching process.  </P> <P> Phillips said International Paper offered EPA data on fish contamination levels  compiled by South Carolina officials in April, 1990, but the EPA refused to  accept the new information.  </P></p>

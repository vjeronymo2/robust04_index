Morning newspapers alleged three Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of  the Nation; ANC military wing] commanders were shot and burnt to  death by members of the ANC's self-defence unit [SDU] in  Katlehong on Sunday in what was claimed to be an ongoing "war"  between the two groups.    The reports claimed members of the police's internal  stability division [ISD] broke up the fighting, which continued  from 11 AM to 6 PM. However, East Rand police spokesman Lt Deon  Peens said no such deaths had been reported from the area on  Sunday. Furthermore, the ISD was not called out and detectives  at local police stations knew nothing about the fighting, Lt  Peens said.    Law and Order Ministry spokesman Capt Craig Kotze said it  was  worrying that "out-of-control" ANC self-defence units,  especially on the volatile East Rand, had once again been  exposed as the root cause of political violence. "It is the  height of hypocrisy for the ANC to blame the SAP [South African  Police] for the violence when killer ANC SDU's are not only  deeply implicated in murdering policemen and eliminating  political opponents, but are involved in bloody internal  feuding," Capt Kotze said. He urged the ANC to co- operate with  police to bring the perpetrators of SDU crimes to justice.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement to the press by Prime Minister Tansu Ciller </F> following her meeting with President Bill Clinton at the White  House -- live]    [Text] [Ciller] I reviewed Turkish-U.S. relations with  President Clinton. We particularly discussed the recent  incident. I want to take this opportunity to extend my  condolences to the families of the brave soldiers who lost their  lives. It is a very regrettable incident. We will study the  details more closely. Other than that... [pauses] May they  rest in peace.    We discussed other issues as well. We reviewed Turkish-U.S.  relations. I explained the economic stability program. Mr.  Clinton clearly said that he will support it. Naturally, we are  pleased about that. Other than that, we had the opportunity to  discuss in detail other aspects of Turkey's relations with the  United States, as well as Bosnia-Herzegovina and Azerbaijan. It  was a very fruitful meeting. Thank you.    [Unidentified reporter] Did you discuss the latest political  developments in Turkey?    [Ciller] Yes, a short assessment of the latest election  results was made. It was a very fruitful meeting. May it be  auspicious for our country.</p>

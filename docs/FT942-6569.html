			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Overgrazing penalties run into rough pasture: Why farmers and conservationists are attacking the change in subsidy rules Withdrawing subsidies from farmers who wreak havoc with the countryside might seem to be a popular measure for a government to adopt when it is having a rough ride with the electorate. But the government's plans for the 'greening' of sheep and cattle subsidies  -reducing or withholding them if land is being grazed too heavily - have run into difficulties, not just with farmers but also with conservationists. The proposals, on which a government decision is expected soon, are the biggest attempt so far to attach environmental conditions to agricultural payments. They would apply to Pounds 690m in annual subsidies to livestock farmers for 19m sheep and 3.2m cattle and would take effect between July and January. Government officials, following a tricky path through the thicket of objections, insist that subsidies will only be withheld in extreme cases and that only about 2 per cent of farmers 'causing serious environmental damage' are likely to be affected. But in a nod to the environmentalists they say the measures should halt damage to heather moorland by making it uneconomic for farmers to crowd too many animals on their land. The National Farmers' Union opposes the plans on the grounds that farm businesses will bear the brunt of a potentially open-ended measure to protect the environment that costs the Treasury nothing. It argues that farmers will be put at a competitive disadvantage to their European counterparts who do not face similar restrictions. The regulations, agreed by EU agriculture ministers in December and January, are optional and the government admits that other member states are unlikely to adopt them. A further problem, according to the union, is the imprecise definition of overgrazing. Mr Andrew Clark, countryside and forestry policy adviser, said: 'Environmental groups claim that 60 per cent to 70 per cent of heather moorland is overgrazed, while the government claims overgrazing is very rare. For farmers this gives great uncertainty for such an important state aid.' Previous experience appears to support the government's claim that few farmers will be affected by the new rules. Restrictions on overgrazing were attached in 1992 for the first time to special payments of slightly more than Pounds 100m to livestock farmers in particularly difficult upland country. The problem of ascertaining that overgrazing is persistent means that only 15 farmers, mainly in the south-west, have so far had payments withheld. Nonetheless, the union argues that farmers should not be penalised for a change in policy in favour of the environment. Mr Clark said: 'Farmers have been told for years that keeping more sheep is good. Now they're being told they'll be punished for keeping so many sheep.' He said that rather than withdrawing subsidies for every excess sheep or bullock the government should convert the money into payments based on the size of the farm and make these payments conditional on the farmer 'looking after the countryside'. He added: 'We're looking for a more sustainable agricultural system, and this debate is a small part of how we achieve that. The question is, who pays and is it possible for farmers to take environmental requirements on board in a profitable manner?' The government's move follows its pledge in January to integrate environmental considerations into agricultural policy. Environmental groups praise the government for leading the way in the EU but argue the measures will do little to reverse the damage caused by intensive farming. Mr Paul Wynne of the Council for the Protection of Rural England, said the livestock proposals were 'a totally inadequate response to the environmental problems in the countryside'. The environmental pressure group wants the Pounds 1.4bn in annual production subsidies to arable and livestock farmers to be converted into payments for positive management of the countryside. The Worldwide Fund for Nature argues that paying subsidies to livestock farmers according to the size of their land rather than the number of animals would encourage less intensive farming. It also wants damage to woodlands to be included in the definition of overgrazing. Ms Gail Murray, the lobby group's countryside officer, said: 'The implementation of the regulation should be refocused, with the financial penalties made far stronger, to ensure environmental protection rather than to limit environmental damage once it has occurred.'</p>

			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / G7 warns embattled Yeltsin to maintain reforms Russia's rulers floundered in angry embarrassment yesterday as the freed leaders of last October's bloody parliamentary uprising taunted the president who thought he had put them in jail for years. Under severe political pressure following the release of his enemies, President Boris Yeltsin was also given a blunt warning by his western allies at the weekend to maintain the pace of economic reform in Russia despite the recent departure of leading reformers from government. The Group of Seven industrialised states, meeting near Frankfurt at the weekend, warned Moscow it must reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund on stabilising inflation and the government deficit before any further debt rescheduling could be negotiated. In Moscow, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's press spokesman, described the decision to free the leaders of the October uprising as 'sacrilege' and the parliament which made it as 'an accomplice in lawlessness'. Mr Kostikov, who is prone to make threats exceeding the Russian leader's appetite for action, said Mr Yeltsin 'reserved the right to act in accordance with the constitutional powers he is entrusted with' - a possible reference to his right to impose a state of emergency in situations of national danger. Mr Alexander Rutskoi, the former vice-president, who came out of jail wearing his full general's uniform despite the fact that he was stripped of his rank for leading the uprising, has given himself two weeks to decide whether he plans to run for president in 1996. The tough G7 line on insisting that Russia agree with the IMF before any new round of official debt rescheduling in the Paris Club emerged from Saturday's meeting between the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, and a Russian delegation headed by Mr Sergei Dubinin, the acting finance minister. It will put the new Russian government under pressure to reach a deal with the IMF on the conditions for the release of a second Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) tranche of its special transformation facility and a Dollars 4.1bn stand-by credit. Philip Stephens adds: Arriving in Washington early this morning, Mr John Major, the prime minister, emphasised that the west must continue to support Mr Yeltsin. In talks today with President Bill Clinton, he will urge Washington to speed plans to offer Mr Yeltsin a stronger partnership with Nato and a formal role in G7 summits.

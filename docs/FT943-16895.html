			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Bonds: Italy plans Dollars 4bn global floating-rate note offering Italy yesterday announced that it planned to launch an ambitious Dollars 4bn global offering of multi-currency floating-rate notes, an unusual structure designed to capitalise on broad demand for floating-rate paper in the current bear market. The notes will all have a maturity of five years, and will pay the same margin over the London interbank offered rate, though they may not have the same issue price, according to global co-ordinator Merrill Lynch. This is designed to allow investors to switch between different tranches. The size of the tranches will be set according to demand. The pricing of the tranches has not yet been decided, but dealers said yesterday that a discounted margin of around 10 basis points over Libor is likely, the same as for Portugal's D-Mark offering earlier this week, according to traders. The Italy transaction is expected to be launched in mid-July. While the unusual structure - it is the first global multi-currency offering  -may help attract investor interest, there could also be some drawbacks. 'It's a lot of money to raise in a difficult market and the deals will potentially compete with each other,' said one trader. The initial response suggested that demand for the yen tranche will be the strongest, due to lack of supply in that sector. 'I think the problem with the yen tranche will be one of rationing rather than selling,' said one underwriter involved in the transaction. The yen FRN market is currently underdeveloped, but the Japanese domestic market for floating rate instruments has recently been deregulated, encouraging a number of issues. However, liquid yen-denominated FRNs are still 'a very rare animal' in Tokyo and London, one dealer said. However, some dealers said that both the dollar and D-Mark FRN sectors appear to be afflicted by oversupply. In the fixed-rate dollar market, General Electric Capital Corporation launched its second recent retail-targetted offering, a Dollars 150m three-year deal arranged by BZW. The deal was priced to yield 10 basis points over the comparable US Treasury. In the sterling market, Gracechurch Mortgage Finance launched a Pounds 300m issue of securities backed by Barclays mortgages on residential properties in England, the bank's third mortgage securitisation. The notes are priced to offer a discounted margin of 23 basis points over Libor, assuming an expected average life of 3.8 years. The pricing reflects the tightening of margins on mortgage-backed paper in the sterling sector this year, according to lead manager BZW. The second securitisation of residential mortgages in France, a FFr2bn offering for Titrimmo 06 94, backed by Credit Lyonnais mortgages, has been completed. The deal was guaranteed by MBIA Assurance.</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Imro to weigh use of derivatives and emerging markets Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund-management industry, is to look at fund managers which invest in emerging markets and those which use derivatives. The watchdog's aim is to ensure that investors are not being put at risk. Mr Philip Thorpe, Imro chief executive, said that while there was no evidence that investor protection was being compromised, 'we are always concerned where there is a bandwagon effect'. The performance of emerging markets relative to domestic or developed stock markets had led to keen investor interest in this sector, he said. He added: 'We are just taking a look and seeing if there is cause for concern.' He was particularly concerned to see that investors understood the risks both of emerging markets and of derivatives. Mr Thorpe's remarks came as Imro unveiled its first quarterly 'performance indicators' report, detailing the extent to which the watchdog is meeting its performance objectives. The report showed that 152 separate complaints had been received, of which 71 related to 'unsuitable' advice given to clients. Of these, about one-third relate to individuals who had been encouraged to transfer out of their occupational pension scheme and into a personal pension. Most of these complaints are against Imro member companies which are large chains of independent financial advisers who will soon join the Personal Investment Authority. Separately, Mr Thorpe said that regulators might eventually review their rules relating to 'soft commissions' - the procedure by which fund managers accept services from brokers in exchange for agreeing to transact minimum amounts of trades through them. One Imro member, Abbey Unit Trust Managers, recently became the first group to be disciplined for abuse of the rules by accepting free foreign travel for its fund managers.</p>

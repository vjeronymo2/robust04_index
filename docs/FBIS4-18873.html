			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Kigali/Cologne -- About 120 Germans who fled  from the East African country of Rwanda, which is torn apart by  a civil war, arrived safely in Germany last night. After an  eight-and-a-half-hour flight, they landed aboard a Bundeswehr  aircraft at the military section of the Cologne/Bonn airport 10  minutes after midnight. They were welcomed by relatives and  friends. The plane also carried 20 Swiss citizens. The  Bundeswehr airbus took off from the capital of Burundi,  Bujumbura, yesterday afternoon. The Germans had escaped there  in convoys.    According to the Foreign Ministry, German Ambassador Dieter  Hilscher, his wife, and 11 Germans who are trapped in the relay  station of Deutsche Welle are still in the Rwandan capital. The  evacuation was difficult because hostile troops control the  access roads. However, the Germans are to be evacuated from  Kigali and gotten to safety as soon as possible. It is still  unclear whether the German ambassador will remain in Kigali.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, May 13 (TANJUG) -- Senior Russian Foreign  Ministry representative on Friday assessed as a `premature step'  the decision of the state Duma, lower house of the Russian  Parliament, to recommend the lifting of anti-Yugoslav sanctions.    He told TANJUG in Moscow that Duma's move was emotional, and  as such was no different from Thursday's proposal of the U.S.  Senate to exempt the Bosnian Moslems from the arms embargo for  the territory of the Former Yugoslavia.    `Both Russian and U.S. parliamentarians were hasty,' the  Russian diplomat said, adding that both Duma and the U.S. Senate  should have waited for the outcome of the ministerial meeting on  Bosnia- Herzegovina currently underway in Geneva which gathers  representatives of Russia, the United States, the European Union  and the United Nations.    The diplomat said that both Russia and the United States  were  civilized countries and that they should act accordingly, that  is to consider international law above the national. This  practically means that the sanctions against Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) and the arms embargo including the Moslems  should remain in force until the U.N. Security Council decides  differently.    The ministry representative said that Moscow's stand towards  the sanctions against Yugoslavia remains unchanged. The  sanctions should be lifted totally, depending on the peace  settlement in Bosnia, he said.    The U.N. Security Council in late May 1992 introduced  comprehensive and mandatory sanctions against Yugoslavia due to  its alleged involvement in the war in Bosnia among the local  Serbs, Moslems and Croats.    The Duma on Thursday passed a bill to unilaterally lift the  sanctions against Yugoslavia, and the U.S. Senate adopted a  resolution which recommends the exemption of Moslems from the  arms embargo for the former Yugoslavia, which has been in force  since spring 1991.    In order to become valid, both documents need to pass two  more steps, including obtaining the signatures of presidents of  Russia and the United States.</p>

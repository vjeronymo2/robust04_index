K. Kozlov, candidate of physical and </F> mathematical sciences, and V. L. Filippov, doctor of physical  and mathematical sciences; UDC 535.372:621.892]    [Abstract] A study was made of the absorption spectra of  some motor oils in the range 25...0.25 m, fluorescence  spectra, excitation of the fluorescence of oils and their change  in the course of their use in internal combustion engines. For  the identification of these products it was necessary to define  those spectral intervals in which considerable differences are  observed in the spectra. There are no significant spectral  differences for used and unused oils in the range 25...0.6  m.  Several types of spectrometers were used in studying the  fluorescence spectra of different oil samples. Substantial  differences in the absorption spectra of oils begin to be  manifested only in the visible and near-IR spectral ranges. The  fluorescence spectra of oils are very highly dependent on the  wavelength of the exciting radiation. There also is a change in  the form of the fluorescence spectra for used oil in comparison  with pure oil. The greater the wavelength of the exciting  radiation, the more are the fluorescence spectra shifted into  the shorter-range region. A design of an instrument for  determining the total quantity of petroleum products in water,  accompanied by a block diagram, is briefly described. It is  based on a nitrogen laser operating at a wavelength 337.1 nm.  Figures 4; references: 3 Russian.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, June 4 (AFP) -- A group of 158 officers and  officials of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) left  here Friday [3 June] night aboard a special flight to Cairo  en-route for the autonomous Gaza Strip.    It was the first large contingent of Palestinian exiles  based  in Tunis to return to the territories vacated by Israel to be  placed under Palestinian self-rule .    The 158 who are officially part the Palestine Liberation  Army, the PLO's military arm, were mainly officials who had  served for the last few years in the PLO's various civilian  departments.    Some who had never worn a uniform seemed ill at ease in the  green military fatigues offered by the Tunisian authorities.    The group included six Palestinian journalists, some of whom  will man the first bureau in Gaza of the Palestinian news agency  WAFA. Others will join the Palestinian television service now  under construction.    The contingent left for Cairo on a Tunisian aircraft  chartered by Saudi Arabia. The group will travel by bus from  Cairo to the border and will cross over into Gaza at Rafah on  Sunday.    Several senior Palestinian officials, including the  Palestinian ambassador in Tunis Hakam Bal'awi and Ahmad Quray'  (Abu-'Ala'), economics "minister" of the new Palestinian  Authority took part in a farewell ceremony at Tunis airport.    A Palestinian source said 20 security agents trained in  Tunisia or in other countries had left Tunis since Thursday for  the Gaza Strip and the other autonomous territory of Jericho on  the West Bank.    So far, 3,500 Palestinian policemen have been deployed in  the  two territories which PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is scheduled to  visit in the middle of June.    "The next step is to repatriate the political cadres to Gaza  and Jericho," a senior PLO official told AFP Friday.    Abu-'Ala' told journalists that promised funds from  international donors must be forthcoming quickly, saying the  lack of resources was causing serious anxiety to Palestinians.    "Without the means there can be no security," he said.    Thirty-one of the officials' family members had left earlier  Friday by a scheduled flight to Cairo.    The leader of the contingent, Colonel Samih Nasr, 46, said  he  hoped to have the means "to defend the dignity and institutions"  of the new Palestinian authority.    He denied that the Palestinian police would be repressive,  saying "that is not our aim."</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON THE OFFBEAT;  </P> <P> THRIVING ON A COLLISION OF CULTURES  </P> <P> Pop music thrives on the collisions of cultures. Look what happened when the  Mississippi Delta blues was transplanted to Chicago. Consider the myriad of  ingredients that spiced New Orleans R&amp;B. A geographic area may spawn music  with common elements -- particularly rhythmic -- but it's the  cross-fertilization of different styles that creates the most heady hybrids.  </P> <P> Take the sweep of music found around the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean --  the focus of this edition of On the Offbeat, a periodic review of roots,  international and non-mainstream pop. The music from those coastal regions has  made its home in nortenas cantinas and sweaty Jamaican dance halls, in swank  jazz clubs and high-tech Parisian recording studios.  </P> <P> STEVE JORDAN  </P> <P> "The Return of El Parche." Rounder.  </P> <P> Jordan is a one-eyed Tex-Mex performer who has been dubbed the Jimi Hendrix of  the accordion. This compilation of material recorded from 1976 to 1984 is the  first of his 34 albums to be released on a label with easy access for Anglos.  It's a good introduction to this wild and woolly talent, who appeared briefly  in the films "True Stories" and "Born in East L.A." You can hear why Jordan has  made purists cringe. His solos and the arrangements spin off on unexpected  tangents, and his tone is tart, florid and vaguely European ("Oaxaca" even  recalls Argentine tango maestro Astor Piazzolla). The Spanish version of  "Yakity Yak" is fun, but it's Jordan's flair and unpredictability that make him  special.  </P> <P> MOSE ALLISON  </P> <P> "Greatest Hits -- The Prestige Collection." Prestige.  </P> <P> Wildness is not part of Mose Allison's game plan. The Mississippi-born pianist  is all understatement, his gently funky piano and weathered, soft-spoken drawl  putting a lazy jazz tinge to material often drawn from the songbooks of Delta  bluesmen. Allison has mined the same vein for more than 30 years, which makes  him the kind of musician a casual fan can explore through a greatest-hits  collection . . . like this one, where some 1957-59 classics -- "Parchman Farm,"  "Lost Mind," "The Seventh Son," "Young Man Blues" -- are given the quietly  insinuating Allison treatment.  </P> <P> TIGER  </P> <P> "Bam Bam." RAS.  </P> <P> Quietly insinuating definitely doesn't apply to Tiger, a young Jamaican toaster  with a harsh, raspy voice and a taste for ferociously up-tempo dance-hall  rhythms. Tiger's intense energy on selections like "Do It Any Way" forces you  to take notice, but the best moments on his second album come when he slows  down a bit and settles into the high-stepping grooves of "Decent Man" and the  title track. The combination of his rasp, his high-speed delivery and his  accent makes it hard to understand what he's raving on about, but he makes you  pay attention.  </P> <P> VARIOUS ARTISTS  </P> <P> "When the Time Comes: Rebel Soca." Shanachie.  </P> <P> This compilation spotlights a period when the popular Caribbean music known as  soca -- short for soul calypso -- was heavily influenced by reggae. Calypso  lyrics are often political, but the focus here falls too heavily on message  over melody. And it's even hard to make out some of the lyrics. Nelson's "When  De Time Comes" and Johnny King's "War Mongers" cut through the murky  production, but the opening song -- Safi Abdullah's "Afrika Is Burning" -- sets  such a high standard with its majestic, reggae-tinged arrangement and barbed  lyrics that the remainder of "Rebel Soca" pales in comparison.  </P> <P> GAZOLINN  </P> <P> "Gazolinn." Rhythmo-Disc (French import).  </P> <P> While Kassav' is the most visible of the bands working in the exciting new zouk  style, this unit is often credited as the most musically challenging. That  assessment doesn't sound far-fetched on "Gazolinn," a successful marriage of  tropical dance pulses and sophisticated arrangements.  </P> <P> "Machann' Lanmou" moves without a hitch from hard funk to pure salsa;  "C.B.W.I." follows a jazzy blues harmonica solo with an excursion to carnival  time down at percussion junction. Best of all is "Tchie Moin Pa Pare," which  opens with upscale Euro-pop before shifting gears as a synthesizer melody  ushers in massed vocal harmonies playing so smoothly off the horn lines that  you instinctively realize that this is elemental, primal zouk from the islands.  The big drawback: only 30 minutes of music.  </P> <P> QUATRE ETOILES  </P> <P> "Dance." Tangent (French import).  </P> <P> One fascinating development in international music has been the collaborations  between French-speaking African and Antillean musicians in Parisian recording  studios. Zouk or soca elements have been popping up more frequently in African  pop records, and "Dance" is a marvelous example by this "supergroup" of  prominent musicians from Zaire. The guitar drive and gentle lilt are Zairian  traits, while the crackling horn lines and contemporary synthesizer squiggles  inject Caribbean color. The vocal harmonies mesh beautifully, but the star  among these four stars is lead guitarist Syran M'benza, who brings a feathery,  bluesy touch (that shouldn't sound foreign to Mark Knopfler fans) to solos on  "Mayanga" and "Ba Relations." Imaginative arrangements and fine performances  add up to a great record.  </P></p>

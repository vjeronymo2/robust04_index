			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lazard to manage Crown funds CROWN FINANCIAL Services said yesterday that Lazard Investors would become the fund manager for its Pounds 680m in assets because it had decided that it was not able to offer customers the quality of performance they required. The move comes at a time of rising pressure for consolidation in the fund management industry as firms struggle to build sufficient 'critical mass' to offer services profitably. Charges for existing clients are based on a percentage of funds under management and managers must either pare costs or increase the size of their portfolio in order to improve profitability. 'Our performance had been hurting a bit, but with a portfolio of only Pounds 700m, we just couldn't afford the quality of fund management necessary,' said Mr Herb Beiles, managing director at Crown, the UK life, pensions and unit trust subsidiary of Crown Life of Canada. Crown had been having difficulty retaining existing clients and attracting new ones because it could not offer a sufficiently attractive investment track record or access to investments in overseas markets, he said. The funds under management are too small to allow the company to hire the kind of expertise needed to both expand and improve the quality of service. 'We want to provide our sales team with an A-1 product,' Mr Beiles said. 'We just didn't have the critical mass.' Life insurers need to have at least Pounds 1bn to Pounds 2bn under management in order to offer high-quality investment services, he said. Lazard Investors already manages Pounds 3.2bn for a range of clients including international pension funds.</p>

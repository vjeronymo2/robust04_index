			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (8): Futures gain respectability - US funds are beginning to diversify A WIND of change is blowing through the huge pension fund industry in the US. For years, there has been much talk of portfolio diversification, particularly into international stocks and bonds, and correspondingly little action. Now, industry observers believe some real developments are taking place. For example, Greenwich Associates, the Connecticut-based consultancy, has noted recently* that 'the proportion of funds using smaller capitalisation stocks, international stocks and international bonds is up sharply'. Extrapolating from its annual survey of the 2,000 largest tax-exempt pension funds and endowments, with a projected Dollars 2,200bn in plan assets, the firm suggests that the percentage of funds using small capitalisation stocks last year was up from 48 to 54 per cent; for international stocks, from 38 to 44 per cent; and for international bonds, from 15 to 17 per cent. This, adds Greenwich Consultants, may only be the beginning. Its consultant, Joe Purcell, notes that an additional 6 per cent of pension funds plan to start using small cap stocks in 1992; another 13 per cent plan to start using international stocks; and another 5 per cent plan to start using international bonds. The figures in last category, he says, represent 'a particularly large leap relative to the proportion already using such bonds'. The last point is pertinent. The use of international equities, say, in US pension fund portfolios may be on the rise, but it still accounts for a very small proportion of total assets - perhaps 4.4 per cent among all funds, with a rather higher 5.8 per cent in corporate funds and under 3 per cent in public funds. Still, boldness seems to be becoming fairly endemic. A good deal of attention has focused recently on the increasing willingness of large public pension funds to commit funds to the often-volatile futures market. This is progressive thinking, by anyone's reckoning. Convention dictates that futures are a risky game for large public pension funds. Some states, including New York, even go so far as to prohibit the investment of public pension money in futures contracts. But, such prudence notwithstanding, there is a growing school of thought within the industry which believes that forays into the financial futures arena at least, will become commonplace for public pension funds in the decade ahead, and that funds which reject this notion will be denying their beneficiaries the chance of significant additional returns. Still, no matter how advanced a pension fund trustee's thinking, the road to diversification can be littered with all kinds of problems. For example, much attention centred on the hiccups encountered by the Californian State Teachers Retirement System, the Dollars 34bn state teachers' pension fund, as it tried to invest Dollars 1.5bn in foreign stocks last spring. California has particularly tough affirmative-action laws. Among other things, these require state contractors - including money managers  - to set goals of subcontracting with women and minority-owned firms for goods and services equal to one-fifth of the fees which they receive from the state. When the state pension fund invited money managers to submit applications to handle the international diversification, it found that only 36 of the 91 firms chasing the contract had met the affirmative-action law requirements. Indeed, to a money management business based overseas the affirmative-action requirements might seem almost impossible to fulfil. Such hassles aside, the current move towards more diversified portfolios contrasts sharply with the demand for passive equity management, or indexation. In 1990, the proportion of total funds using passive equities stood at 41 per cent. Last year, the figure fell to 36 per cent. Total funds which expect to start using passive equities in 1991 stood at 6 per cent, unchanged from the previous year. Overall, it is currently reckoned that index funds account for about one quarter of US pension funds total assets. Finally, it is interesting to note that the proportion of US employees actually covered by corporate pension funds is steadily declining, although assets handled by such funds have tripled over the past decade, thanks largely to the rise in market levels. It has been estimated, for instance, that only 43 per cent of workers participated in US company pension plans last year, compared with a peak of 49 per cent in 1979. This receding coverage has been variously attributed to the anti-union climate, a declining role for low-paid blue-collar workers who would have had pension coverage in the past, and the associated expansion of small business jobs. But whatever the cause, it is scarcely a comforting development - for employees or fund managers. *Greenwich Reports: Strengthening Relationships, Improving Performance.</p>

			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / International Company News: Wal-Mart's Mexican plans extended WAL-MART Stores, the fast-growing US retailer, is stepping up its Latin American expansion. Wal-Mart, which now outsells the likes of Sears, Roebuck and K mart, said yesterday it would extend a previously-announced joint venture arrangement with Cifra, the largest Mexican retailer, to include Wal-Mart Supercenter combination stores, distribution centre operations, McLane wholesale operations and more Club Aurrera outlets. The initial joint venture between the two companies, announced in July, concentrated on the development of wholesale clubs around Mexico City, under the Club Aurrera name. Wal-Mart is an important operator of warehouse clubs  -which sell limited product ranges at rock-bottom prices to a membership customer base - in the US. Wal-Mart says the first Mexican 'Supercenter', where both general merchandise and food are sold, should open next year in Monterrey. Another six to eight Club Aurrera units should also open in the Mexico City area in 1992-1993.</p>

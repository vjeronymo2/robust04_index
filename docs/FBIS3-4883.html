			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Nationwide Debates Needed for Defense Policy </F> Review"]    [Text] Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's advisory  "Defense Policy Council" will hold its first meeting on 28  February. The council's main objective is to review the 1976  "National Defense Program Outline [NDPO]," Japan's defense  policy guideline, for the first time in 18 years. To compile a  new guideline of national defense in the post-Cold War period,  it is necessary to promote nationwide debates. The council may  become the starting point of public debates.    To say nothing of the international situation, the Hosokawa  administration's future is becoming uncertain. Under such  circumstances, it is questionable if the prime minister can  afford to really devote himself to this issue.    Yet, review of the NDPO has been a major pending issue since  the conclusion of the Cold War five years ago. However, the  issue has been left untouched by two Liberal Democratic Party  prime ministers -- Toshiki Kaifu and Kiichi Miyazawa. So, we  would like to frankly welcome Prime Minister Hosokawa's  initiative.    Nine council members, led by Asahi Breweries Chairman Kotaro  Higuchi, are expected to promote wide-ranging discussions. They  should provide answers on questions on such subjects as Japan's  perception of the post-Cold War period, a new direction for  security policy and the Self-Defense Forces' [SDF] position, and  roles in UN peace activities as well as the defense alliance  with the United States.    The council should deal with varied and deep questions. If  the final report should be prepared "by summer," as Prime  Minister Hosokawa once noted, the members would have to carry on  very intensive debates.    Meanwhile, we are anxious about the Defense Agency's [DA]  attitude on this issue. From the beginning, the agency has been  voicing its frustration with Prime Minister's decision to  advance the review of the NDPO by a year. Also, the agency is  wary of the prime minister's remarks on possibilities of arms  reduction. To reflect its opinions in the council, the DA has  established a special study group. Also, the agency reportedly  has great expectations for former Joint Staff Council Chairman  Hajime Sakuma's participation in the Defense Policy Council.    It is natural that the defense authorities have an interest  in debates on the foundation of the nation's defense policy, and  it is necessary for them to offer opinions as experts. However,  the policy review would lose its significance if they take  actions to prevent any scaledown of the SDF. Therefore, the  council must promote discussions from a free standpoint.    Another concern is the fact that some defense officials  still  say the policy review is unnecessary. They say that the NDPO is  appropriate even in the post-Cold War period because it was  compiled during detente between the United States and the Soviet  Union, and that it is unnecessary to revise its basic concept of  "the minimum defense force in peace."    The NDPO's basic concept is also called "basic defense  concept." This aims at maintaining the capability to conduct  adequate security missions and cope with limited and small-scale  invasion without support from foreign forces. However, we  should not forget the "basic" defense force is designed to  prepare for "smooth expansion" in case of emergency.    In other words, the basic concept has no consideration for  the limitation of defense buildup or rationalization of  effective strength. In quantity, Japan's defense force has  already reached the level advocated in the NDPO. Defense  expenditures are currently emphasizing improvement of the SDF's  equipment quality.    Why do we have to keep building up defense forces for  "exclusively defense only" while possibilities of direct  invasion against Japan have become much lower? The defense  policy review should start with this question.    There are great gaps among coalition parties concerning the  concept of national defense, the SDF's legal position, and the  Japan-U.S. alliance. The Defense Policy Council must not be  used as a tool for a power struggle among them.</p>

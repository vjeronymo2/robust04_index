			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 21 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Tsutomu Hata reiterated on Monday [21 March] he was "gravely  concerned" over the issue of North Korea's suspected development  of nuclear weapons.    At a press conference in Moscow prior to his departure to  Tokyo, Hata requested North Korea to accept full inspections of  its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA).    He said he was "gravely concerned" that the IAEA could not  confirm North Korea was not converting nuclear material for  military use.    In Vienna, the IAEA adopted a resolution on Monday to refer  North Korea's refusal to allow full inspections of its nuclear  facilities to the United Nations Security Council.    Hata also said if the United Nations decides any sanctions  against North Korea, Japan would like "to take a responsible  action as a nation which regards the UN as most important."</p>

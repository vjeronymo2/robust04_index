Another cut could follow. 'The key message to heed is that the Fed has strongly signalled its concerns about the economy and thus further easing cannot yet be ruled out,' said Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, the securities wing of the Japanese bank. The Fed's move was also an uncomfortable reminder to UK markets that interest rates in Britain remain extremely high and that the government has lost the flexibility, enjoyed by the US authorities, to cut rates when it desires. By the end of last week, the US move had sparked speculation that pressure would now grow for Germany to cut its rates, allowing other European countries in the ERM to reduce theirs. Although the Group of Seven leading industrial nations are likely to try to redress global trade imbalances by talking up the yen at this week's Munich summit, they are unlikely to bring about a general cut in European rates. Indeed, any hopes of a rate cut, amid much speculation at the end of last week, were dashed when British government officials said they did not expect there would be any immediate commitments to reduce interest rates arising from the meeting. Rumours of a realignment of the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System were also dismissed by UK officials.

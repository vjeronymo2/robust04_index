			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Guenter Verheugen, the Social  Democratic Party's [SPD] federal business manager, has described  the result of the state elections in Saxony-Anhalt as a  "brilliant success" for the Social Democrats. The race for  victory in the federal elections on 16 October is "wide open  again," Verheugen said in Bonn this evening. Anyone who thinks  that the SPD is already down and out has now been "taught a  lesson," he said.    Verheugen stressed that the SPD is the "clear victor" of the  election in Saxony-Anhalt. The government of Minister-President  Christoph Bergner [Christian Democratic Union -- CDU] has been  "voted out," he said. Verheugen pointed to the "dramatic  losses" of the coalition partners CDU and Free Democratic Party  [FDP]. SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping was also pleased that the  Social Democrats in Saxony-Anhalt have achieved such a brilliant  result. [passage omitted]    Commenting on the FDP's losses, Verheugen said the party is  paying the price for its "fraternization" with the CDU.</p>

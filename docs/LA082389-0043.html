			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Bulgarian government accused Turkey of playing "a dirty political game"  with its decision requiring that ethnic Turks immigrating from Bulgaria first  obtain visas. However, the semiofficial Turkish news agency Anatolia said 522  ethnic Turks were allowed to cross without visas. The refugees say they are  fleeing a harsh assimilation campaign. The Turkish government announced its  move Monday, saying it would require the visas because Bulgaria's Communist  leaders have refused to start talks on an accord to protect the emigrants.  Turkish officials said the border will stay closed until Sofia signs an  emigration pact with Ankara safeguarding the rights of ethnic Turks wanting to  emigrate and of those staying behind.  </P></p>

This  is because he feels that 1994 will be quite a difficult year as  far as interethnic relations are concerned. He voiced  confidence that he would be able "to at least minimize" the  consequences of interethnic conflicts and help resolve them.    Sergey Shakhray expressed the wish that, even if he does  lose  the post of deputy prime minister, he should at least be able to  have direct access to the prime minister and deputy prime  minister.    Asked by an ITAR-TASS correspondent about the prospects for  his joining the new government, Deputy Aleksandr Shokhin said:  "I cannot tell you anything new. I have not yet decided. The  number of offers I am getting is increasing."</p>

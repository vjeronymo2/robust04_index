			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CITY REMAP PLAN IN DOUBT AFTER COUNCIL DISSENT;  </P> <P> REDISTRICTING: COMPROMISE ON LAWSUIT OVER POLITICAL BOUNDARIES MAY BE HEADED  FOR FAILURE NOW THAT THREE COUNCIL MEMBERS FEAR PROPOSAL MAY LEAD TO RACIAL  STRIFE.  </P> <P> A compromise settlement to the long-running San Diego City Council  redistricting dispute over Latino voting rights teetered near collapse Thursday  after three council members said new proposed boundaries in the South Bay could  lead to racial strife.  </P> <P> The reversal came one day after the parties in the class-action suit filed by  the Chicano Federation of San Diego County Inc. appeared on the verge of  settling the 1988 lawsuit, which has had more twists and turns than a carnival  fun house.  </P> <P> If the proposed settlement is formally rejected -- the City Council is  scheduled to vote on the plan in closed session Tuesday -- preparations for  what all sides say will be a long and expensive trial will move forward. The  first step in that direction began late Wednesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Subpoenas from Chicano Federation lawyers were to be issued to five council  members and their staffs for production of various redistricting documents and  appearances at sworn interrogations.  </P> <P> The first such deposition is scheduled for next Wednesday morning, and the  first witness is to be the secretary for Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt. By order  of the court, the depositions will be conducted in public.  </P> <P> Bernhardt is part of a five-member majority bloc that last week gave final  approval to a redistricting map following weeks of bitter debate. The Chicano  Federation opposed the map, which made the critical 8th District, stretching  from downtown to San Ysidro, 51.9% Latino.  </P> <P> Among several objections, including the contention that the proposed new  district unconstitutionally dilutes Latino voting rights and violates the terms  of a previous settlement, the federation claims the five-member bloc met in  private and agreed to endorse the map without any involvement from the public  or the federation.  </P> <P> One member of the bloc is Bob Filner, who represents the 8th District.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Chicano Federation attorney Michael Aguirre made a new  proposal that called for changing district boundaries yet again to give  District 8 nearly a 55% Latino population.  </P> <P> To accomplish that, two precincts totaling about 8,000 combined residents in  the South Bay community of Nestor, the majority of them white, were transferred  from the 8th District and placed in District 2, which is composed mainly of  Point Loma and Mission Hills.  </P> <P> To make the connection, the federation drew a line down San Diego Bay.  </P> <P> After weeks of acrimonious rhetoric, charges and countercharges, lawyers in the  dispute Tuesday and Wednesday deliberately toned down their talk and said an  accord was near, pending resolution of how much the city would pay Aguirre for  his legal work on the federation's behalf.  </P> <P> The first indication things were amiss again occurred during a hearing before  U.S. District Judge John Rhoades on Thursday afternoon. The hearing -- attended  by six lawyers representing the city and various individual council members --  was supposed to be a routine review of where settlement negotiations stood with  U.S. Magistrate Harry McCue, who is handling the compromise discussions.  </P> <P> "None of us seem to be happy . . . so (that must mean) we're very close to  settlement," Aguirre said. He told Rhoades that a settlement agreement would be  presented in McCue's chambers later in the afternoon.  </P> <P> Senior Chief Deputy City Atty. Jack Katz said the proposed settlement will be  taken to the City Council for a vote Tuesday.  </P> <P> But then attorney David Lundin, representing 8th District Filner, Bernhardt and  Councilman John Hartley, spoke and said his clients didn't like the idea of  dividing Nestor along "harsh racial lines," with Latinos on one side and whites  on the other "going to Point Loma and Mission Hills."  </P> <P> He told the judge he couldn't say whether his clients would approve the  proposed settlement. Later in the day, after the compromise settlement appeared  scuttled, Lundin told reporters that Filner, Hartley and Bernhardt will reject  the plan Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rhoades, who said he will leave in the middle of next week for a temporary  assignment in another judicial district, responded by saying that  "gerrymandering is American as apple pie" and that it is not wrong unless it  violates the Constitution, the Voting Rights Act or some other law.  </P> <P> "I can't (and) won't participate in where the lines are drawn," the judge said.  "Where the lines go is a legislative decision, not a judicial decision."  </P> <P> The attorney representing Councilman Bruce Henderson, who is not a member of  the majority bloc, told the judge that other council members will disagree with  the proposed settlement and that "very likely" it will not be approved.  </P> <P> The attorney, Pat McCormick, said the proposed map "creates havoc with the rest  of the city." He has vowed to file a lawsuit contesting the City Council  majority's redistricting plans.  </P> <P> Another lawyer, representing Council Members Ron Roberts and Judy McCarty, said  his clients had not participated in drafting the proposed new map and had not  seen it.  </P> <P> At the end of the hearing, the attorneys hastily beat a path to McCue's  chambers. Meanwhile, Filner, who attending the hearing, told reporters the  proposed dividing of Nestor contains "the seeds" of potential racial strife and  would be "extremely harmful to this city."  </P> <P> "The biggest problem is drawing a line across the South Bay . . . that says a  side is Hispanic and (the other) one Anglo."  </P> <P> "I'm not going to support it. . . . I don't think the gain outweighs the loss."  </P> <P> He said his office was flooded with calls Thursday from Nestor residents upset  about the possibility of being divided and placed in a district they are  neither geographically nor politically aligned with.  </P> <P> "We've been completely misled by negotiations at this point," Aguirre said  afterward. "Yesterday we were down to legal fees. Today it's a whole new ball  game."  </P> <P> "The council completely misled us," he said. "We think . . . the Latino  community's best chance is with the integrity of Judge Rhoades . . . making  decisions."  </P> <P> Jess Haro, head of the Chicano Federation, said it was hypocritical and  duplicitous of Filner to oppose the proposed compromise because of the  potential racial strife it might engender.  </P> <P> "He's only concerned about his own selfish reelection," Haro said. "He is the  impediment, the biggest impediment to the Latino community's (effort) to  redress 40 years of municipal history."  </P> <P> Haro said that "Filner wants to keep the whites (in Nestor) because that  improves his chances for reelection."  </P> <P> Later, in an interview with reporters in his office, lawyer Lundin said his  three City Council clients always had some problems with the proposed  settlement map.  </P> <P> Lundin said he told Filner, Bernhardt and Hartley on Wednesday -- when a  compromise appeared at hand -- to "think about it overnight." On Thursday  morning, the three told Lundin they wouldn't support the compromise because of  the splitting of Nestor.  </P> <P> Lundin said he and his clients have prepared yet another map that increases the  Latino population in the 8th District without dividing the South Bay.  </P> <P> The proposal, he said, would place the Latino population between the 51.9%  approved last week by the council majority and the nearly 55% Aguirre said is  contained in his proposal.  </P> <P> Lundin said he and Aguirre were supposed to talk about the new map Thursday  afternoon, but that because of the developments in the courtroom, they never  met. Lundin said he will attempt to talk to Aguirre about the new map.  </P></p>

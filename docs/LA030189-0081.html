			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORUM URGES GLOBAL DEFENSE OF ART HERITAGE  </P> <P> From pollution problems of global proportions to regional concern with  crumbling adobe, from the effects of tourism on ancient monuments to the  ravages of sunlight on contemporary murals, a high-level forum on art  conservation, held Monday at the County Museum of Art, hammered away on threats  to the world's cultural heritage.  </P> <P> Ignorance, indifference, technology, pollution, ideological fervor, mass  tourism, armed conflict and a misguided "zeal for knowledge" that wipes out the  past in the course of studying it -- these were the culprits ticked off by  Federico Mayor Zaragoza, director general of UNESCO, in his introductory speech  at "Collections, Monuments and Architecture at Risk: A Forum for Southern  California Decision Makers."  </P> <P> Architect Frank Gehry added urban development to the list of villains as he  flashed a rapid succession of slides of historic Los Angeles buildings that  have been demolished.  </P> <P> Natural disasters have also done their part to destroy bastions of culture, as  Luis Monreal, director of the Getty Conservation Institute, pointed out in  slides of the 1966 flood in Florence that damaged museums and ruined artworks  throughout the city. Monreal also spoke of the fire set by an unknown arsonist  in 1986 that devastated the Los Angeles Public Library.  </P> <P> Impermanent pigments, too much light and general neglect have ruined a set of  Mark Rothko's paintings at a Harvard University faculty center, said Richard  Koshalek, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art, in his presentation to  the 100 or so cultural and corporate leaders who gathered at the conference.  </P> <P> Frank Preusser, program director for scientific research at the Getty  Conservation Institute, delivered the depressing news that Los Angeles' air  contains more than 140 pollutants. And, according to a recent survey, Southern  California museums filter out as little as 20% of these impurities.  </P> <P> Most of the trouble is man-made, the speakers repeatedly emphasized. The  species that "fouls its nest most successfully is man," concluded Franklin D.  Murphy, director emeritus and former chairman and chief executive officer of  Times Mirror Co., parent company of The Times.  </P> <P> The message was grim, but the mood was determinedly hopeful. Far from  proclaiming "Apocalypse Now," the speakers sounded an alarm that amounted to a  call for action.  </P> <P> "The question today is, can we save our cultural heritage?" Monreal asked,  early in the conference. Considering the quickening pace of destruction cited  by Monreal -- some cultural monuments such as Greece's Parthenon or Egypt's  Sphinx have suffered more damage in the 20th Century than in the previous  millennium -- the response to his query seemed inevitably negative.  </P> <P> But after 10 speakers had addressed various aspects of the issue, the  collective answer was, "We must."  </P> <P> The problem is enormous, the speakers agreed. Even in the United States, the  world's richest country, the majority of museums don't have professional  conservators and there are only about 70 scientists working on art conservation  in the entire nation, Preusser noted.  </P> <P> In developing countries the situation is much worse. "Priorities necessarily  lie elsewhere when a square meal and a roof are still uncertain for millions of  people," Mayor said.  </P> <P> How, then, does a group of 100 "decision makers" convened in Los Angeles effect  solutions?  </P> <P> Americans can do two things: contribute money and "clean up the mess they  make," Murphy said.  </P> <P> Mayor pointed out that UNESCO has been "at the forefront of the worldwide  conservation movement." It has "mustered international support" for major  conservation projects at Abu Simbel, Egypt; Venice, Italy and Carthage,  Tunisia, he said, and it has established practical "doctrines" in the World  Heritage Convention, an agreement on environmental protection and cultural  preservation signed by 109 countries.  </P> <P> Working both with governments and private organizations such as the Getty  Conservation Institute in Malibu, UNESCO is "a facilitator," "an experimenter,"  "a clearinghouse," "an innovator," "a bridge" and "a catalyst" for  conservation, Mayor said.  </P> <P> Giovanni Agnelli, keynote speaker and chairman of the Italian auto-making giant  Fiat, argued for corporate responsibility and provided an impressive example of  "private initiative" when he showed slides of Fiat's $12-million conversion of  Palazzo Grassi, an 18th-Century residence in Venice, into an art museum.  </P> <P> Asked how he justified such a large expenditure to shareholders who would  prefer a dividend, Agnelli said it was easy to argue in favor of such long-term  cultural "investments." In the case of Palazzo Grassi, Fiat revitalized part of  Italy's "monumental legacy" to serve "artistic objectives" and promote the  nation's "cultural activities," he said.  </P> <P> Mayor said that conservation projects are a special joy to UNESCO, in part  because they are "visible." But the benefits go deeper than newspaper pictures  of restored monuments that illustrate UNESCO's work. In the poorest, most  hopeless countries, "magnificent masterpieces bring self-esteem" to people who  are desperate for it, he said.  </P> <P> Few of the participants have large corporate or government resources at their  disposal, but they were called together in the belief that a few committed,  well-placed people can make a difference. The event was organized by the  National Committee to Save America's Cultural Collections and funded by the  Ahmanson Foundation, AT&amp;T and the Times Mirror Foundation.  </P> <P> Forum chairman Lloyd E. Cotsen said he called the meeting "to create a sense of  awareness of the problem" and "set up a network of people who will allocate  resources to it." Introducing himself as a "soap salesman," Cotsen, the  president of Neutrogena Corp., asked participants to fill out questionnaires to  be compiled in a sort of "white-collar pages" of resources for conservation.  "We want you to be available when you are needed. Be an advocate," he urged.  </P> <P> As the meeting wound down, the clearest theme that had emerged was the need for  a cooperative effort -- one that involves public and private sectors, ignores  national boundaries and persuades the haves to help the have-nots.  </P> <P> "We are a global village. More than that, we are a global culture. The  Renaissance didn't advantage Italians only," said Murphy. "We owe much to  Greece, to Rome, to Egypt, to China, and we have an obligation to pay something  back."  </P> <P> "Our cultural heritage is the most vivid record of how people lived and died,"  Monreal said. "If we don't take our cultural heritage out of the twilight zone,  if we don't move quickly, tomorrow will be too late and there will be no future  for our past."  </P></p>

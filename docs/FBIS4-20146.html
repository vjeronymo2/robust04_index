			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Wolfgang Koydl commentary: "What Will Come After Saddam?"] </F>   [Text] Sometimes, in silent hours of self-knowledge, even  George Bush must begin to see that his fantastic Desert Storm  made quite a stir, but moved little in the Gulf: The oil  emirate of Kuwait has slid back into its authoritarian  feudalism, and arch-rogue Saddam Husayn is still in office. The  former U.S. President has to look for the mistake in his own  quarters, because he always said one thing, did the second, and  wanted the third.    This changeling of a U.S. policy for the Persian Gulf was  inherited by Bill Clinton, to whom not many new things for this  region, where 65 percent of the world's known oil reserves are  deposited, have occurred since that time. On the whole,  Washington limits itself to sticking to the regime of sanctions  that the United Nations imposed against Iraq more than three  years ago.    However, this embargo has had few effects, at any rate fewer  than the West had hoped for at first. In Baghdad there is no  indication of a broad opposition to the regime of Saddam that  has developed from need, rather of a certain solidarity.  Moreover, the sanctions had an effect to the contrary. On the  one hand, a dangerous diplomatic vacuum developed in  Mesopotamia. Iraq was declared a leper to whom nobody talks --  and of whom, therefore, nobody knows anything. On the other  hand, the sanctions are preventing the West from considering a  political strategy for the Gulf because they lead one to believe  in sham stability: As long as Saddam Husayn rules, he  guarantees Iraq's cohesion and, at the same time, justifies the  international quarantine that, on its part, is defusing  Baghdad's potential threat. In this way, the embargo is  degenerating into a comfortable control instrument that seems to  make any crisis planning superfluous.    However, it would be appropriate to think about the time  following the lifting of the sanctions. After all, several  scenarios are conceivable, if not probable: 1) The gradual  softening of the embargo. This would enable Saddam to rearm  himself secretly. 2) Increased international pressure that  leads to the lifting of the sanctions by the United Nations. In  that case, Saddam would remain in power and would have won all  along the line. 3) The overthrow of the despot by people from  his clan or the military (of which there are indications in  Baghdad). In that case, the successor would have another name,  but he would have the same moustache or would pursue more or  less the same policy as Saddam. 4) The overthrow of the regime  by a popular uprising. This might lead to a civil war, in which  Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and above all Iran would probably be  involved.    The West, particularly Washington, is not prepared for any  of  these variants. The reason is alarmingly banal: The United  States does not know what it wants. Personal revenge on Saddam?  This is desirable because the man is a criminal, but it is not  necessarily the guideline of a rational foreign policy. The  overthrow of the ruling class in Iraq? This is understandable,  but hardly feasible in view of the economic and political power  and the sheer will to survive of Saddam's courtiers and  officers. The punishment of the 18 million people of Iraq?  What for, perhaps because they did not get rid of the  dictatorship long ago? Leading Iraq back to the community of  civilized states? Not even Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the United  States' closest partners in the Gulf, are fulfilling this  criterion.    The latest attempt by U.S. [National] Security Adviser  Anthony Lake to outline a new Gulf policy was an excuse rather  than an answer to these questions: Accordingly, the times when  Washington alternately supported Iran and Iraq as a regional  policeman are said to be over; the new magic word is dual  containment [preceding two words in English], of both Tehran and  Baghdad.    If only the United States did not hurt itself in this tour  de  force. If Washington really wants to keep these two historical  Gulf superpowers in check, it has to ensure alone the security  of one of the most important and dangerous regions of the world  -- with its permanent troop presence and permanent bases. It  would be pure self-deception to rely on Saudi Arabia. This  artificial product of a state is highly unstable and might  completely break down under the pressure of a close U.S.  embrace: One can easily slip on oil.    A responsible policy for the Gulf must be the exact opposite  of dual containment, that is, dual involvement. That means that  the United States recognizes the historical, economic,  political, and military role of Tehran and Baghdad in this  region. Both states have to be involved in a comprehensive  political concept where everything, from oil prices via  disarmament to joint security, can be discussed. The United  States wants a stable Gulf, so that the flow of oil does not  come to a standstill. The neighboring states have exactly the  same interest. This is not a bad basis for a Gulf policy.</p>

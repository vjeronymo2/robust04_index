			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WEST VIRGINIA;  </P> <P> TEACHERS VOTE ON RETURN TO CLASSES  </P> <P> Striking teachers were voting on a proposal to return to classrooms while  negotiators try again to settle a pay dispute that led to their 3-day-old  walkout. Gov. Gaston Caperton offered to refrain from docking teachers' pay and  benefits for days they missed since the walkout began last Wednesday if they  return to work Monday. Voting was scheduled to continue in some counties today.  Teachers say the average West Virginia teacher salary of $21,904 ranks the  state 49th in the nation, ahead of only Mississippi.  </P></p>

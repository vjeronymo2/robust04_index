			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "SSBN Le Triomphant Launched"] </F>   [Text] Cherbourg--The SSBN [nuclear powered ballistic  missile submarine] Le Triomphant was launched on 27 March "in  perfect technical conditions," according to an announcement on  the 29th by the Directorate of Naval Shipbuilding and the  Maritime Prefecture.    A military source explained that the launching consisted of  filling the dock where the submarine had been built. The  submarine will soon leave the dock and submerge at sea to a  depth that may reach 70 meters, the same source added.    Following a brief cruise off Cherbourg, it will go to  Brest--the site of the French SSBN base--early in May to begin  its sea trials, which will last about a year. At that point it  will be declared operational, according to the same source.    The cost of the Triomphant program--a total of four  submarines are planned--is estimated at some 80 billion French  francs.</p>

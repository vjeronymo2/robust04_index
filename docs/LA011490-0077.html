			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION  </P> <P> Your claim that the National Rifle Assn. does not truly represent the interests  of its members is entirely spurious.  </P> <P> I am a life member, and I have yet to meet another member -- or even non-member  shooter -- who agrees with the gun control measures promoted recently in  Sacramento and endorsed by you.  </P> <P> I also find it interesting that you take the NRA to task for devoting itself to  the one issue (gun ownership) it exists to address, yet you don't find anything  wrong with Pete Shields and Handgun Control Inc. doing the same thing on the  other side of the issue. Your double standard is showing.  </P> <P> BRIAN BAKER  </P> <P> Saugus  </P></p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / International Company News: Former Banesto director sues JP Morgan A former deputy chairman of Banco Espanol de Credito Banesto (Banesto) is suing the US bank JP Morgan, which was the Spanish banking group's financial adviser when the Bank of Spain dismissed the Banesto board a year ago. A claim filed against JP Morgan by Mr Ricardo Gomez-Acebo, a member of Banesto's board for 23 years up to the end of 1993, alleges that the US bank breached its fiduciary duties to Banesto by giving negligent advice. Mr Gomez-Acebo's suit alleges that Morgan, as Banesto's adviser, withheld information from the board after the completion, in the summer of 1993, of the first two tranches of a three-part equity raising programme. Morgan began to advise the Spanish bank early last year, and it became a Banesto investor in the spring and summer of 1993 when it led international equity issues that raised nearly Dollars 700m for the bank. JP Morgan said yesterday that the suit had been filed several months ago, and there had been no significant changes since then. The bank described the action as 'frivolous' and said all allegations in it were groundless. Banesto was the first target of the Dollars 1.1bn Corsair fund, a portfolio set up by Morgan to invest in undervalued banks. Corsair took a Dollars 175m stake in Banesto to hold nearly 8 per cent of equity and become its largest shareholder. Included in documentary evidence is a 15-page letter from Morgan's chairman Sir Dennis Weatherstone to the US Congress committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs last February, concerning Morgan's relationship with Banesto. Sir Dennis wrote that after due diligence of Banesto in the autumn of 1993, Morgan learnt of 'certain problems related to troubled equity investments . . . and asset quality'. This led to the postponment of a Dollars 400m debt issue. The statement of claim filed by Mr Gomez-Acebo says that this information was not made available to Banesto's board when it met during that period. Mr Gomez-Acebo's lawyer said that Morgan Espana, Morgan's Spanish arm, had said the statement had not followed procedural rules because the only party which could bring a suit against it would be Banesto. Separately, Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's former chairman, was being questioned yesterday for the fourth successive day by a Madrid high court judge on charges of defrauding Banesto's shareholders. Last week the judge, who is investigating a criminal fraud accusation brought in November against Mr Conde and former Banesto executives by the court's public prosecutor, indicted and committed to prison Mr Arturo Romani, a former board member.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tamaz Mchedlidze: "The Parliamentary Majority Is </F> a Pro-Russian Force"]    [Text] Irakli Tsereteli, chairman of the National  Independence Party, has assessed 1993 as a year characterized by  failures of every kind, beginning with the loss of Abkhazia and  ending with entry into the CIS. In his view, a coalition  government has to be formed, which will unite forces opposed to  the CIS. Tsereteli believes that it is impermissible to hold  elections without Abkhazia. Therefore, a new government has to  be formed on the basis of its attitude toward the CIS.    "The present parliamentary majority is a pro-Russian force  and consequently did not block the illegal decision of the head  of state. Joining the CIS contradicts the acts of 26 May 1918  and 9 April 1991 [on the declaration of Georgia's independence].  In this way, the present government has abolished itself."    In the view of Irakli Tsereteli, there is no party existing  in Georgia today that can form a government. Therefore,  national forces should govern the state together.    Tsereteli assessed the Geneva negotiations [on settlement of  the Abkhazian conflict] as fruitless and a shameful fact.</p>

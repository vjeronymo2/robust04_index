			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Arts: Paris-orientated pleasures - Records / Ronald Crichton makes his choice for sophisticated stockings For choosy, sophisticated stockings here are three one-composer packs of transfers to CD, each Paris-orientated, promising hours of pleasure. The 'Tresors Phonographiques de Jacques Offenbach' MM 34016, 3 CDs (British distributor Discovery Records, overseas Virgin France SA) contain excerpts from 21 Offenbach operettas by some 30 artists. They come from a private collection, spanning the time of wax cylinders up to the outbreak of the second world war. A feast, then, of humour, satire, irresistible rhythm and some of the best tunes ever written. Of course the sound varies, but transfers are well made - there is little of the old hiss-and-scratch. Among the performers are opera stars like Emma Calve sailing serenely through the Letter Song in La Perichole and Jussi Bjoerling, superbly carolling (in Swedish) Paris's song about the three goddesses from La Belle Helene. Mireille Berthon is in top form as the Grand Duchess of Gerolstein, gleefully confessing her weakness for the military, and as the bogus Colonel's widow in La Vie parisienne. Old favourites include Yvonne Printemps, sending up operatic sopranos who hold on to their notes too long (in 'Dites-lui', another of the Grand Duchess's indiscretions) and Reynaldo Hahn, inimitably narrating two numbers from La Boulangere a des ecus to his own accompaniment. As for the lighter stage, some of whose bright lights have little or no claim to singing voices, they excel when it comes to putting a point number across - Dranem, as the impenitent official in Les Brigands who has blown a large sum of public money on women and admits he has every intention of doing so again if opportunity occurs. Some cover both worlds, like the Opera-Comique baritone Louis Musy, who with his wife so deftly and crisp projects another excerpt from Les Brigands, describing the tramp, tramp of the approaching carabinieri, late as usual. I must not forget two eminent visitors from the legitimate stage, Madeleine Renaud and Pierre Bertin, in an Alsatian-dialect duet from Lischen et Fritzchen. Some knowledge of the colourful background of the collapse of the Second Empire and the beginnings of the Third Republic after the war of 1870 will help. So, frankly, will knowledge of French. Imagine a non-English-speaking French listener landed with the lyrics in Iolanthe or Patience. But you couldn't want more agreeable teachers. Absolutely right for those fascinated by the musico-dramatic byways in Paris from the mid-1890s to the mid-1920s is 'Les Inspirations insolites d'Erik Satie' (French EMI, CZS 7 62877 2, 2 CDs). The 'unusual inspirations' include some of the most remarkable products of the most unusual and eccentric of leading French composers, the little man with a bowler hat, beard, pince-nez, overcoat and fetish-umbrella. He played the piano in bars but was, in the words of his teacher Roussel, 'prodigiously musical'. His short, satirically or mystifyingly named pieces still tease, perplex and delight in about equal measure. Not all the works here transferred from recordings of the 1970s are unfamiliar - the dreamy, almost motionless, well-loved Gymnopedies orchestrated by Debussy, for example. Two I did not know, the doleful Les Pantins Dansent (Puppets dancing) and the Choses vues for violin and piano are delightful. Three longer, more demanding works, literally extraordinary are worth getting to know in these high-definition performances. Satie called his Socrate a 'symphonic drama' but the description would hardly have occurred to anyone else. It is a deliberately plain, unemotional, evenly-paced setting of Plato's account of the end of Socrates' life, given here in the version for four female voices (Danielle Millet, Andrea Guiot, Andree Esposito, Mady Mesple) and orchestra. Genevieve de Brabant is a miniature drama (with songs) intended for puppets. Mady Mesple sings poor, suffering Genevieve's songs sweetly. Strangest of all is Le Piege de Meduse (Medusa's trap) a 'one-act comedy with songs' about a Baron Medusa and his entourage, included a stuffed mechanical monkey which dances and an insolent servant, Polycarp. Genevieve and Le Piege are graced by the distinguished actor-musician Pierre Bertin whose virtuoso speaking almost makes up for the absence of texts in the notes. All three major works are conducted by Pierre Dervaux. There is a useful note on Satie in the new Viking Opera Guide. Further information and vivid background material will be found in James Harding's book Erik Satie. Among the most devoted of Satie's colleagues was Milhaud, one of a group who, at the family's request, penetrated the humble room where Satie had lived for years and where no-one was invited. Genevieve de Brabant was among the unknown works they found There. Two of Satie's songs are included as a tribute in Darius Milhaud enregistrement historiques 1928-1948 (The Classical Collector 150 122, 3 CDs.). Riches indeed - the bitter-sweet Saudades for piano, once so strange-sounding now is so natural, and Le Boeuf sur le toit, both deriving from Milhaud's time in Brazil; La Creation du monde, surely de most successful mating of jazz and classical; the three tiny 'operas-minute' opera on classical subjects (complete); not least, the popular Scaramouche for two pianos played by the composer and Marcelle Meyer. Other distinguished performers are the conductor Desormieres, the pianist Marguerite Long and, among the singers, the baritone Martial Singher and the invaluable Jane Bathori, - a soprano who gave innumerable first performances for the younger composers in those years.</p>

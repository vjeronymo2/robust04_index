As a result, the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources  reported 134 sites where industrial deposits of minerals were  discovered or confirmed.    The raw materials are oil, natural gas, uranium, coal, gold,  lead and zinc, copper and bauxite.    In the meantime, a major breakthrough was made in  prospecting  for 56 known deposits of gold, copper, lead and zinc, tin,  silver, uranium, oil and natural gas.    An official with the ministry's geological exploration  department disclosed big increases in the proven reserves of 31  kinds of minerals.    Last year's oil and gas prospecting plan was fulfilled.  Also, 800 million tons of coal reserves were verified, 150  million tons of iron ore, 20 million tons of manganese ore, 2.5  million tons of copper, 76 million tons of bauxite and 20,000  tons of antimony.    The results of the oil and gas survey sharpened China's  picture of its energy resources, the official said.    The prospecting teams evaluated a legion of oil traps in the  remote Tarim and Junggar basins in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region where many wells are highly productive.    In the East China Sea, offshore oil departments drilled a  high- yield well that can extract 646 cubic metres of crude oil  and 226,600 cubic metres of natural gas a day.    A 30-kilometre-long copper belt was uncovered in Yunnan  Province in Southwestern China while a batch of gold mines was  found in Northeast and Northwest China.    In addition, geological workers have prospected eight  groundwater sources in Tianjin, Shandong, Guangxi, Sichuan and  Shaanxi with total explorable reserves of 600,000 tons.    And the discovery of huge water sources in coal-rich Shanxi  Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has also  allayed acute water shortages in these energy bases and  permitted further development.    In the Tibet Autonomous Region, a 262-centigrade geothermal  well was dug to a depth of 2,006 metres. The well, the hottest  of China's high-temperature geothermal wells, lays a solid  foundation for installation of lO,OOO-kilowatt electricity  generators.</p>

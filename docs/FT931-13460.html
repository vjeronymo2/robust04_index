			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Eddie George - resolute achiever at the top CAPABLE, honest, straightforward and very sound. These words appear on the school report of the 11-year-old Eddie George, at the end of his first year at secondary school in south London. Such descriptions of Mr George's character have stayed with him during his 30-year career at the Bank of England, which culminated yesterday in his appointment to take over at the end of June as the Bank's next governor. Mr Don Gilbert, an old school friend, said yesterday: 'I am delighted by the news. But to be truthful I was amazed to see how he got on so quickly. He never struck me as a high flyer.' Largely because of his qualities of determination and reliability, Mr George has been on an upward path at Threadneedle Street almost from the day he arrived. His ruggedness of character has enabled him to overcome the occasional high-profile setback, such as the controversy over bank supervision arising from the BCCI affair, and Black Wednesday last September, when Britain was forced out of the European exchange rate mechanism. While he is largely known in the financial community as a 'central bankers' banker' - hard on inflation, somewhat introverted and more than a little dour - Mr George has a lighter side to his character. He is known as a highly entertaining after-dinner speaker in small, intimate gatherings. Sir Geoffrey Littler, a former Treasury official who knew Mr George well during the 1980s, said: 'In private, he can be an absolute delight. He likes a drink, knows how to relax and he's got wit, understanding and depth of character.' Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, who is a member of the Bank's court, or board of directors, said: 'Eddie would never make TV personality of the year. But he has a quiet sense of humour and he's interested in people.' Like Mr John Major, the man who chose him for the new job at the pinnacle of the British establishment, the 54-year-old Mr George grew up in unfashionable south-west London suburbia. His childhood home was in Carshalton, Surrey, near the Beddington sewage works. His father was a postman. The young Eddie attended Hackbridge primary school, gaining a scholarship to the more upmarket Dulwich College, a public school in south London. His fees were paid by Surrey County Council. At Dulwich he was noticed more for his qualities of resolution than for any feeling that he was destined for great things. Mr Terry Walsh, who taught him, remembers him as 'an extremely nifty rugby scrum half. Whatever he did, he was an achiever. He just got on with things.' During his national service in the army he learned Russian, in which he is still fluent, then studied economics at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, collecting his BA in 1962. He went straight to the Bank, starting in the economics department. He gained international experience during a three-year stint at the Bank for International Settlements in Basle in the late 1960s, and became assistant director in change of markets in 1980. He was appointed deputy governor nearly three years ago. Among Bank insiders, Mr George has a reputation for toughness. One former official said: 'He's very good at handling financial markets. That means he has to be a bit devious. But I have never known him to tell an outright lie or to mislead. He doesn't mind people disagreeing with him, unless it turns out they cannot substantiate their views.' Another former official says: 'Eddie likes to dominate things. He is a very forceful character. If he thinks he's right and you think differently, you're in for a hard time.' Mr Major, who worked closely with Mr George during his spell as chancellor before becoming prime minister, admires the new governor's grasp of the mood of financial markets and of the complexities of City regulation. His appointment confirmed that the prime minister did not blame the Bank's technicians for failing to anticipate the tide of speculation which forced sterling's withdrawal from the ERM. Senior Whitehall officials say that Mr George was among those who advocated an earlier rise in interest rates to defend the pound. But in any event Mr Major's judgment was that it would have been impossible to save the pound. Their personal relationship has been helped by the new governor's relaxed and down-to-earth style. One Downing Street insider said last night that Mr George's combination of an astute mind and lack of pretension had made him a 'natural choice' for the prime minister. Mr George, however, will be disappointed by Mr Major's refusal to contemplate granting the Bank independence. The new governor believes that it would be possible to combine Bank control of monetary policy with a new statutory framework to make it accountable to parliament. For his part Mr George has been impressed by Mr Major's careful and detailed approach to policy-making. After dealing with him at the Treasury he told friends that Mr Major was the 'clearest-thinking politician I have ever met'.</p>

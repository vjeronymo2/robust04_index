			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, deputy prime </F> minister and minister of justice, by Piotr Gabryel and Marek  Krol; place and date not given: "A Country of Anarchists"]    [Excerpts] [WPROST] Is there such a thing as an SLD-PSL  [Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party] coalition?    [Cimoszewicz] Yes. If we are to survive in politics, we  have to accept the coalition. But show me a government in  recent years that did not have any internal conflicts. There is  nothing unusual about the fact that, after several months in  office, there is a need to reexamine various issues, which we do  at meetings of the so-called directorate--in other words, an  informal gathering of coalition representatives. We do not mind  the fact that PSL and SLD politicians hold various views,  including on the subject of forming a government and the kind of  information policy it should pursue.    [WPROST] Can one describe this government as Pawlak's "own"  government?    [Cimoszewicz] According to the Constitution, the prime  minister has the power to reach the kind of decisions he has  just reached in relation to the deputy prime minister [Pawlak  fired him]. On the other hand, the present government is based  on two parties and that determines its method of functioning.  Unfortunately, the Constitution does not envisage such a thing  as a Government Presidium. Providing the government leadership  with prestige is quite another matter.    [WPROST] But an absence of detailed regulations make it  easier to mollify coalition members and turn the entire  coalition into an illusory body.    [Cimoszewicz] That depends on the way one interprets events.  I think it is too soon to say that the coalition is illusory.  Our coalition requires a consolidation of its structures. We  want certain political provisions to be set in writing so that  we might know who is responsible for what. Only if we prove  incapable of creating proper mechanisms for the functioning of  the coalition will there be a danger that the coalition is  incapable of functioning efficiently.    [WPROST] A danger for whom?    [Cimoszewicz] If the coalition experienced problems with  trying to survive, the SLD would be in a difficult situation  because, on its own, it might not be able to act effectively and  implement its preelection pledges. [passage omitted]    [WPROST] Is Poland a democratic country, as the Constitution  says it is?    [Cimoszewicz] It is trying to become one. We will succeed  in turning it into a democratic country, but the day that  happens is a very long way off. This involves not so much  legislation as social consciousness and the attitudes of  politicians. The law is still regarded as a means to an end.  Even in recent years, violations of the law have been excused  on grounds of so-called necessity. The civic ombudsman says  that, in 1993, there were more violations of civic rights than  before. [passage omitted]    [WPROST] Do you agree that the establishment of a  law-governed state will be very difficult without a new  constitution?    [Cimoszewicz] Unfortunately, even the present parliament  might have problems with it, and even if it satisfies the formal  requirements. If Lech Walesa were to put into practice some of  the things members of the Presidential Chancellery have been  saying, he would be playing a destructive role. Nothing can  justify using the Constitution for the purpose of pursuing a  political contest. I would be happier if the government  concentrated on social and economic policy this year because  that is the main source of conflict. [passage omitted]    [WPROST] Either we have a law-governed country or one ruled  by the fist of stronger groups who win privileges for themselves  at society's expense.    [Cimoszewicz] I am very upset about what I would describe as  an anarchistic, unimaginative approach toward the affairs of  one's own country. We are observing increasing egoism among  professional groups that are convinced that they have to reap  maximum benefits for the state. Frequently, we encounter the  snowball effect--one group stages a demonstration for the sake  of some benefit or concession and another sees this  demonstration and follows suit. At the same time, we as a  society fail to see that actions like this are suicidal for the  state. We should consider which is better--a disintegration of  what little resources we have, or the creation of a chance for  the future.    [WPROST] How about a few examples?    [Cimoszewicz] Several years ago, a law on compensation for  Stalinist persecution was passed. The lawmakers assumed that  all affected persons would behave honorably and not make undue  demands on the state's finances. But this year alone, 1.5  trillion zlotys has had to be allocated for compensation. It is  the same with reprivatization. It costs trillions of zlotys  just to restore property that was misappropriated in pursuance  of the previous legislation. Every single claim involves  material or legal interests. But the sum total of these  interests is ruining the state.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Shooting for new heights: Pain-killers are improving but the search is slow, says Clive Cookson in a series on drug discoveries No other pharm-aceutical sector is so dependent on two such ancient families of drugs as the Dollars 5bn-a-year (Pounds 3.2bn) pain-killer market. For severe pain doctors can do no better than stupefy patients with chemicals derived from the opium poppy, notably morphine and diamorphine (the pharmaceutical name for heroin). For mild pain the standard is still aspirin, based on a simple compound found in willow bark and developed industrially in 19th-century Germany. It is the model for a large family known as Nsaids (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) which combine analgesia - the medical term for pain relief - with a tendency to reduce inflammation. The only radically new drug in the sector is sumatriptan (trade name Imigran) launched by Glaxo of the UK in 1991 to relieve migraine headaches. It works by reducing the swelling of blood vessels in the head, which is a primary cause of migraine. Sumatriptan is on its way to becoming a blockbuster, with analysts predicting sales of more than Dollars 1bn a year in the late 1990s, because migraines are quite common, affecting 10 per cent of young adults, and the drug commands a high patent-protected price (Pounds 7 per tablet or Pounds 17 per injection in the UK). But sumatriptan is designed only to treat one specific cause of pain. There is no immediate prospect of such innovative drugs being introduced for other important causes of pain or for general analgesia. Looking further ahead, scientists are much more optimistic, as they make progress in understanding exactly how people feel pain. Once the biological mechanisms are understood, pharmaceutical researchers can design drugs to block pain. 'This is an extremely lively time in pain research,' says Clifford Woolf, professor of neurobiology at University College London. 'The research could lead to major new pain therapies, after a long period in the doldrums when we essentially relied on aspirin-type drugs, morphine and local anaesthetics.' Pain evolved as the brain's warning signal to the body. It may be a warning to get out of harm's way or to protect a limb or organ that is suffering from injury, disease or over-exertion. There are pain receptors throughout the body, which fire signals via the nervous system to the brain where they are translated to feelings of pain at the appropriate site. In principle, therefore, pain-killers can either act peripherally at the site of the painful stimulus or centrally on the brain and central nervous system. In practice, researchers are only just beginning to disentangle the central and peripheral effects. The conventional idea that morphine and opiates act centrally, while aspirin and Nsaids act peripherally, turns out to be an oversimplification. 'One of the most important developments recently is the realisation that all clinical pain has a large central component - and that is changing the whole pharmacological approach to the management of pain,' Woolf says. The phenomenon, discovered at UCL and other universities, is called 'central sensitisation'. Nerve cells in the spinal cord become unusually sensitive in response to painful tissue damage; they then react in an exaggerated way to ordinary sensations of touch and pressure, which may produce further pain over a long period. In other words, far from getting used to pain, our nervous system becomes more sensitive to it. This discovery has implications for the use of existing pain-killers. In particular, it suggests that 'pre-emptive analgesia' is sensible if the doctor knows in advance that the patient is about to undergo a painful experience such as surgery. Clinical evidence supports this strategy: patients given morphine before an operation suffered less post-operative pain than those receiving the same dose immediately afterwards, even though both groups were anaesthetised during the operation itself. Apparently pre-operative morphine reduced the sensitisation. Two neurotransmitter (chemical messenger) systems seem to be involved in the sensitisation effect. Both are potential targets for new drugs. In one system, glutamate transmitters act on the NMDA receptor. Chemicals that block the NMDA receptor would be powerful pain-killers but would probably have side-effects, since NMDA performs many other roles in the brain. The other system, in which a transmitter called Substance P acts on the tachykinin receptor, is a more active field for pharmaceutical research. Glaxo, Pfizer, Merck, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and other companies are working on it. If they succeed in developing drugs to prevent sensitisation, patients will retain normal feelings while avoiding severe pain. At the same time, pharmaceutical researchers are working to improve the performance of Nsaids. As Sir John Vane, the British pharmacologist, showed in 1971, aspirin-like drugs work by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, hormones which make nerve endings sensitive to painful sensations. Recent experiments have shown that an enzyme called cyclo-oxygenase plays a leading role in this interaction. It comes in two forms, Cox-1 and Cox-2, which have different effects on prostaglandin synthesis. Existing Nsaids act on both forms. But their action on Cox-1 produces the side-effects for which Nsaids are known, such as bleeding and stomach ulcers, while action on Cox-2 causes the desired analgesia and anti-inflammatory effects. Many drug companies are now using this information in the search for more selective Nsaids that act only on Cox-2. Success would be an important advance because, although the risk of serious side-effects for any individual patient is low (one in 10,000 prescriptions), millions of Nsaids are prescribed every year and the total number of complications is high. Michael Langman and colleagues at Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, estimate that in the UK alone 2,000 people are admitted to hospital every year as a direct result of Nsaid side-effects. While the research goes on behind the scenes, the most visible activity in the pain-killer market is the growing range of drugs available without a prescription. In the UK, for example, Napp Laboratories recently launched Paramol, an over-the-counter analgesic containing dihydrocodeine, a mild opiate previously available only on prescription. It was the first pain-killing ingredient approved for OTC sale in the UK since ibuprofen in the 1980s. An event of greater significance for the world pharmaceutical industry was this month's launch in the US of Aleve, a new OTC pain-killer, by Procter &amp; Gamble, the consumer goods giant, in a joint venture with Syntex, the leading analgesics manufacturer. (Syntex was taken over last month by Roche of Switzerland for Dollars 5.3bn.) Aleve is based on naproxen, Syntex's best-selling Nsaid, whose patent expired in December. According to Linc Bynum, who is responsible for the company's clinical research on pain-killers, Syntex carried out four years of trials, involving several thousand patients, to pave the way for Aleve. Its analgesic effects were compared extensively with ibuprofen and paracetamol (known as acetominophen in the US) in people whose wisdom teeth had just been extracted. All the data had failed to persuade the US Food and Drug Administration advisory committees last year that Aleve should be given an OTC licence, but in January the full FDA approved the product after Syntex agreed to reduce recommended doses and add warnings on the label for children and the elderly. One feature of Aleve that worried the FDA committees was the fact that it remains active in the body for longer than existing OTC pain-killers. They believed this could lead people to take excessive doses by accident. But Aleve's long life - pain relief lasting eight to 12 hours - will give it a marketing advantage over rivals that need to be taken more frequently. The series continues next month with a look at treatments for stroke.

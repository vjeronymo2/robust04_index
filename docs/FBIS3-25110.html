[passage omitted]    ANC President Nelson Mandela on Monday welcomed the arrests,  expressing the hope that police investigations would be thorough  and the perpetrators brought to justice. "Such action, if  properly pursued, can only serve the process of restoring the  image of the SA [South African] Police as a force capable of  impartial and effective action on behalf of all South Africans.  We can only hope that these arrests signal the beginning of a  comprehensive strategy designed to bring to justice those  elements that wish to frustrate non-racialism, peace and  democracy," he said in a statement.

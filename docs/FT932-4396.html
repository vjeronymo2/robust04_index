			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / International Company News: Hilger to leave Hoechst next year - Controversial chairman obeys unwritten law on retirement THE HEAD of Hoechst, Germany's biggest chemicals group, and recently the focus of a fierce controversy over industrial safety, will be replaced next year by the group's finance director, Mr Jurgen Dormann. Mr Wolfgang Hilger, 63, will obey the company's 'unwritten law' on retirement age and hand over at the annual meeting next May, a spokesman said yesterday. He will be 65 in November next year. A decision on whether he will follow the customary route for retiring top managers and join the group's supervisory board will not be taken until next spring. Mr Dormann, 53, has worked at Hoechst for his entire career of almost 30 years. He joined the group immediately from university, where he studied economics. His promotion marks an interruption of a long tradition of scientifically-trained chairmen in the group. He staked his claim for the top post in the mid-1980s, when he was the driving force behind Hoechst's purchase of Celanese of the US, which not only widened the company's presence in fibres, but greatly improved its standing in North America. Mr Dormann is also credited with strengthening the group's anti-takeover defences. His appointment was believed to be stoutly supported by the banking representatives on the supervisory board, including Mr Wolfgang Roller, chairman of Dresdner Bank. The bank, together with an insurance group, has held 10 per cent of the stock since 1991. Hoechst was forced to slash its dividend for 1992 to DM9 from DM12 after an 18 per cent drop in pre-tax profits. Earnings fell a further 28 per cent in the first quarter of the current year as the German recession deepened and foreign markets remained depressed. A series of 15 accidents, mostly in Frankfurt, in which one man was killed, redoubled Mr Hilger's difficulties earlier this year. Despite charges that he responded too little and too late to the events, he put their 'statistical frequency' down to 'fate', and claimed a job in a Hoechst factory was safer than one in a shop.</p>

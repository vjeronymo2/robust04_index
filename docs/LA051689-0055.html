			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOTERS BOLSTER GORBACHEV'S REFORM BID;  </P> <P> SETBACK FOR CONSERVATIVES SEEN IN RUNOFF BALLOTING FOR ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's chances for pushing through political and  economic changes were strengthened Monday by election results giving social  reformers seats in runoff balloting for a newly created Soviet assembly.  </P> <P> A crusading prosecutor who accused conservative Politburo member Yegor K.  Ligachev of blocking an inquiry into high-level corruption defeated more than  two dozen other candidates in Leningrad.  </P> <P> The editor of the taboo-breaking Ogonyok magazine and some reformers from the  Baltic states also were on the winners' list after Sunday's balloting for the  Congress of People's Deputies.  </P> <P> Balloting took place in nearly 200 districts where voters in March refused to  elect the candidates listed on their ballots, showing their displeasure by  crossing the names off their ballots. In many cases, the defeated candidates  initially ran unopposed. For Sunday's balloting, in contrast, there was an  average of six candidates for each seat.  </P> <P> In Leningrad, the Soviet Union's second-largest city, police investigator  Nikolai Ivanov swept to victory with 60% of the vote, defeating 27 other  candidates to claim the city's seat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kremlin's 'Right Turn'  </P> <P> Ivanov told Leningrad television in a two-minute campaign speech Friday that  Ligachev had ordered a corruption probe to be dropped. He criticized what he  called the Kremlin's "right turn" and "Comrade Ligachev's increasing  influence."  </P> <P> Last year, Ligachev, the former ideology chief, was ousted from his No. 2 spot  and given the agriculture portfolio in a Politburo shake-up.  </P> <P> Ivanov and his partner, Telman Gdlyan, are something of heroes throughout the  Soviet Union for spearheading a lengthy corruption investigation in the  republic of Uzbekistan that led to the conviction of former Soviet leader  Leonid I. Brezhnev's son-in-law, Yuri M. Churbanov.  </P> <P> Gdlyan won a parliamentary seat in the March 26 voting, receiving more than 85%  of the vote in a Moscow district.  </P> <P> Leningrad officials said that Ivanov, a Muscovite, got last-minute backing from  some undecided Leningrad voters who took issue with criticism of the  prosecutor, which was published Saturday in the Communist Party daily Pravda.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Interference in Probe  </P> <P> The newspaper accused Ivanov and Gdlyan of trying to interfere with the work of  a special commission that has been formed to look into complaints about the  methods used by the two investigators.  </P> <P> Ogonyok editor Vitaly A. Korotich, a populist who compares himself in style to  U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, won 84% of the vote to  claim a seat in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkov.  </P> <P> "It's a conservative city of more than a million and a half people, but even  the conservatives are tired of the old ways," Korotich said in an interview in  his magazine office Monday. "The local party officials opposed me, but the more  they tried to discredit me, the more support I got."  </P> <P> Korotich said he plans to help the community start a local newspaper to publish  complaints and to try to get more supplies into the city's stores.  </P> <P> "I cannot be god for them, but they are counting on me. We in the Congress of  People's Deputies must insist on having real power," he said.  </P> <P> The Congress of People's Deputies is to meet on May 25 to elect a president and  members to a new Supreme Soviet, the nation's national Parliament, which is to  replace the previous rubber-stamp body.  </P> <P> It is not yet clear how often the Congress will meet and what its other  functions may be. But Gorbachev is expected to use the body to help generate  grass-roots support for his reforms.  </P> <P> The 2,250-member Congress is the centerpiece of Gorbachev's efforts to bring  political reform to the Soviet Union. Elections to the Congress in March marked  the first time most voters ever had a choice at the polls and was preceded by  unprecedented campaigning.  </P> <P> In Estonia, Klara Hallik, who was backed by the nationalist Estonian People's  Front, won just over 50% of the vote. A lecturer, she is an expert on ethnic  relations at Tallinn Polytechnical Institute.  </P> <P> In neighboring Latvia, People's Front officials said their candidates won five  of the six races.  </P> <P> The People's Front movements seek independence from the Kremlin.  </P> <P> In some of the runoff elections, no single candidate gained more than half the  votes needed to win a seat, and the Soviet news agency Tass reported that  elections between finalists will be held May 21.  </P></p>

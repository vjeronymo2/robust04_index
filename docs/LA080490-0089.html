			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRACING FOR AN OIL SHOCK;  </P> <P> EMPLOYERS ;  </P> <P> U.S. FIRMS ARE UNABLE TO AID STAFF IN KUWAIT  </P> <P> The fast-moving Iraqi invasion of Kuwait caught many American firms with  operations in the tiny country off guard, foiling corporate contingency plans  to evacuate employees and leaving firms powerless to help.  </P> <P> With the airports and seaports in Kuwait shut down, executives familiar with  crisis management said there is little that U.S. companies can do at the moment  to get their employees out. They advised the companies to work with the State  Department.  </P> <P> "If companies haven't gone through the simulations that explore the  consequences of various options in a crisis like this, any evacuation plans  like the one pulled off by Ross Perot in Iran will not work," said Brian  Jenkins, managing director of Kroll Associates, an international corporate  investigation and consulting firm in New York.  </P> <P> Jenkins was referring to the famous incident in which Texas businessman Perot  hired a retired Vietnam veteran to direct the rescue of two of his employees  from an Iranian jail in 1979.  </P> <P> "In my view, if you haven't made preparations in advance, you don't have those  options, and the evacuation can become perilous to the employees," Jenkins  said.  </P> <P> Dealing with overseas turmoil is nothing new for many American multinational  companies, which have often had to act quickly to protect their employees and  interests abroad. In 1981, Exxon was forced to evacuate dependents of its  employees in Libya after U.S. Navy fighter planes shot down two Libyan planes.  </P> <P> Last year, many firms were forced to airlift employees out of China in the wake  of the Beijing government's bloody clampdown on student demonstrations.  </P> <P> However, the Kuwait "situation is not at all similar to the crisis in Tien An  Men Square in China," said David Samuel, a political risk consultant in New  York. "The risk is far greater here because the Iraqis are organized, and  they're a battle-tested group."  </P> <P> Mammoth corporations often find themselves powerless when it comes to aiding  their employees overseas. "There is nothing we can do," said Mike Libbey, a  spokesman for San Francisco-based energy giant Chevron, which has two chemical  engineers stranded but reportedly safe in a hotel 20 miles outside Kuwait City.  </P> <P> Recent diplomatic efforts to ease tension between Iraq and Kuwait left many  firms believing that it was safe to keep their employees in the country.  </P> <P> "We did not expect this level of conflict," said Debra Williams, spokeswoman  for Pasadena-based Parsons Corp., an engineering firm with about 100 employees  and dependents in Kuwait. "If we knew if there was any threat to any of our  employees, they would have left the country."  </P> <P> Officials in the State Department's Kuwaiti Task Force said U.S. Embassy  officials in Kuwait have reached about 1,000 of the estimated 3,000 Americans  since Iraq's lightning invasion of the Middle Eastern kingdom.  </P> <P> Contingency plans and experience abroad have helped firms cope with emergencies  ranging from earthquakes to coups d'etat. "We have been in the Middle East for  30 years, and we have seen many political problems," said Williams at Parsons,  which has worked on water supply and transportation projects in oil-rich Kuwait  since the early 1960s.  </P> <P> Parsons' contingency plans called for employees to remain inside their homes or  office in case of a natural disaster or military attack, and employees have  done so, Williams said. But some of the company's plans have fallen apart in  the face of the sweeping Iraqi invasion.  </P> <P> When they were notified at their homes, employees were supposed to immediately  head to the airport for evacuation. That plan was rendered useless when the  Iraqis shut down the international air terminal shortly after their attack.  </P> <P> The last contact the Pasadena firm had with its Kuwait office was shortly after  the invasion. At the time, Williams said, several employees were unharmed and  still at work. "We have not heard from them in over a day," Williams said  Friday afternoon. "We have been trying phones, fax, Telexes, everything."  </P> <P> Lockheed Corp. was able to reach two of its employees conducting field work on  military transport planes that the aerospace firm had sold to Kuwait. "We were  in contact with them yesterday," a company spokesman. "They are safe and  believe they are in no danger."  </P></p>

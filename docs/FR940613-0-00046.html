			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The exclusion information is codified by this final rule at &sect;658.23(b)(1) through (b)(5). The list of exempted vehicles by State included in the SNPRM has not been codified, however, because of the likelihood that it is not a complete list. The original instruction to the States about these vehicles was to submit anything they thought might be covered by the freeze. Since the effect of ATA's comment would be to exempt only those vehicle combinations listed, some States could be penalized in terms of allowing certain vehicles simply because they reviewed the guidelines and made a decision that certain vehicles were not involved in the freeze coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of LCV used throughout this proceeding is that established in the ISTEA. In the interest of avoiding confusion with respect to terminology, the FHWA will not amend the LCV definition at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Documentation of Actual Operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the terms of ISTEA section 1023, an LCV may continue to operate only if on or before June 1, 1991, the specific configuration was (1) legally allowed in the State and (2) was in actual lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis. Under section 4006, the overall length of two or more cargo-carrying units used in a specific configuration may not exceed the length allowed by State law, and in actual lawful operation on a regular or periodic basis, on or before June 1, 1991. If a specific multi-trailer configuration was authorized by State statute or regulation, but  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in actual lawful operation on a regular basis on or before June 1, 1991, it may  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  now be put into service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the vehicles listed in appendix C meet the requirements for continued operation set forth in ISTEA sections 1023 and 4006.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information on these vehicles which the States supplied in response to the ISTEA, the March 20, 1992, NPRM and the February 25, 1993, SNPRM, satisfies the legal requirement for operation, i.e., authorized by State law. In a similar manner, various commenters, responding to a request contained in the SNPRM, have documented the actual operation on a regular or periodic basis of the vehicle combinations listed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SNPRM requested information, from any source, to show the actual operation of vehicles described in appendix C. While a copy of the special permit under which operations occurred was listed as the preferred means of satisfying the documentation requirement, any item which could support operation of these vehicles would be considered as acceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an early response to the docket, the ATA expressed concern that the FHWA was placing a ``tremendous burden on State DOT's and the trucking industry to satisfy a totally new requirement in a very short time period.'' The SNPRM allowed for a 45-day comment period with April 12, 1993, as the docket closing date. The ATA also stated that ``(i)t is unlikely that two year old copies of the actual permit will be available,'' and that working with the permit issuing offices in each State to locate these records would ``no doubt be a very time consuming and cumbersome process.'' As an alternative, the ATA suggested that the FHWA allow the submission of an affidavit from a carrier and/or State agency to satisfy the documentation requirement, and further that a time extension be granted to allow appropriate review and certification of these documents, if allowed. A request for a time extension for the docket was also received from the WTA and Coastal Chem Sales Company of Cheyenne, Wyoming. The need to accurately comply with the actual operation documentation requirement was given as the reason for the request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its comments, the CRASH stated that the proof requirement contained in the SNPRM was ``far too broad, and (could) easily lead to mistake or fraud.'' That organization argued that anything less than ``verifiable documentary evidence created and dated on or before June 1, 1991, specifically detailing the vehicle length, weight, configuration and routes traveled'' would fail to comply with ISTEA requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In reviewing the time extension requests, the FHWA agreed that more time was needed to help assure that accurate and complete documentation information, including affidavits, was submitted to the docket. On April 14, 1993, a 45-day extension of the comment period, to May 27, 1993, was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 58 FR 19367. The type of information the CRASH argued the FHWA should require appears to exceed the documentation most States demand of LCV operators. It would distort the purpose of the ISTEA freeze to ban certain vehicles or routes simply because the States lacked the foresight to issue permits that met the maximum possible data requirements of a Federal law not yet enacted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

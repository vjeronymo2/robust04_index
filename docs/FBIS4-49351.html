			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Provincial News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] A provincial conference on urban vegetable work was  held in Hefei from 2 to 3 April. It conveyed and implemented  the guidelines of the two national meetings on vegetable basket  work convened by the State Council, and drew up an overall plan  for vegetable work this year. The conference called on  governments at all levels, especially city governments, to  strengthen leadership, see to it that the vegetable basket  project is well carried out, and make unremitting efforts to  ensure ample market supply, stabilize prices, and stabilize  society.    Governor Fu Xishou and Vice Governor Zhang Runxia attended  the conference. Each made an important speech.    In the past six years since the implementation of the  vegetable basket project in Anhui, the provincial government has  appropriated 17 million yuan to support and encourage cities to  grow vegetables under the program of replacing subsidies with  rewards. Marked results have been achieved thanks to the great  deal of work done by the governments at all levels. At present,  a large number of bases for growing vegetables have been  established throughout the province. In 1993, the province's  per capita consumption of vegetable, meat, and eggs approached  the level of economically developed areas in the country, but  some existing problems should not be overlooked. From the  middle of November last year to the beginning of this year, the  prices of major staple food such as popular vegetables and pork  in urban areas rose considerably, thus pushing up the general  price index.    Analyzing the causes for the price rises, Vice Governor  Zhang  Runxia said: The rise of vegetable prices at the end of last  year was related to natural disasters, but it also exposed the  problems in the areas of production and commodity circulation.  The main problems are: In the past two years, the supply of  vegetables and other nonstaple food has been relatively good.  As a result, there has been a relaxation of investment in and  service in connection with the vegetable basket project.  Furthermore, as the pace of urban construction was accelerated,  fine and high-yield vegetable- growing plots in suburban areas  have been used for construction purposes. In the past two years  urban vegetable-growing plots throughout the province decreased  by 30,000 mu. The building of new vegetable-growing plots  failed to meet demand due to a lack of investment. As there was  a shortage of labor for growing vegetables in urban and suburban  areas, some vegetable plots were abandoned or badly managed.    Vice Governor Zhang Runxia pointed out: We should  conscientiously sum up experiences and lessons and carry out the  vegetable basket project successfully with a high sense of  responsibility to the people.    In his speech, after briefing the participants on the  guidelines of the recently held central conference on rural  work, Governor Fu Xishou stressed: Carrying out the vegetable  basket project well is an important measure for checking  inflation. This year is vital for us to establish a socialist  market economic structure. If we fail to stabilize the supply  of vegetables and rice and allow prices to rise considerably,  social stability will be affected, and our reform and  development will be affected. Therefore, it is the bounden duty  of governments at all levels to solve the problem of vegetable  supply. They should continue to implement the system of placing  the responsibility on city mayors and make the vegetable basket  work an important criterion for evaluating city mayors. Before  its term expires, the provincial government will continue to  pursue the policy of replacing subsidies with rewards. It has  been decided at an executive meeting of the provincial  government that this year the provincial government will  appropriate a sum of fund to commend and reward cities that have  done exceptionally well in carrying out the vegetable basket  project.    Fu Xishou pointed out: At present, we should strive to solve  the few outstanding problems regarding the vegetable basket  project. First, we should stabilize the area for growing  vegetables and strictly ban indiscriminate requisitioning of  vegetable plots for use for other purposes. Second, we should  establish markets for agricultural and sideline products.  Third, we should grasp the means of macroeconomic regulation  and control; establish a reserve system for meat, vegetables,  sugar, and other major staple food; establish a risk fund for  nonstaple food and a system for monitoring the prices of  agricultural and sideline products. Fourth, we should  effectively strengthen market management and concentrate on  resolutely punishing such illegal acts as manipulating the  markets, jacking up prices, producing and selling faked and  shoddy goods, and swindling the masses so as to safeguard the  interests of producers and consumers. Fifth, all departments  should coordinate in carrying out the vegetable basket project  well.</p>

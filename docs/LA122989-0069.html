			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHAMINADE TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> BENCH PICKS UP THE SLACK IN SIMI VALLEY VICTORY  </P> <P> With two starters slowed by illness, Simi Valley High needed a lift from its  bench Thursday in the Chaminade tournament. And the Pioneers received one from  James Krevitz and Mike Baity en route to a 67-48 win over Chatsworth.  </P> <P> The victory gave Simi Valley (7-4) a 2-0 record in its pool and a berth in the  championship bracket, where it will meet Chaminade at 6 p.m. today.  </P> <P> Simi Valley starters Steve Carnes and Mike Wawryk were slowed by the flu, but  the Pioneers' bench provided help that allowed the pair some time of their own  on the bench for much-needed rest.  </P> <P> "They (the reserves) have to produce right now," Coach Dean Bradshaw said.  "They can't come into a game and turn the ball over or miss two or three  shots."  </P> <P> That wasn't a problem Thursday.  </P> <P> Krevitz, who finished with eight points, contributed two three-point baskets in  the second quarter that helped loosen Chatsworth's zone defense. Baity  contributed 10 points and five rebounds.  </P> <P> Carnes still managed to finish with 18 points, seven rebounds and five assists.  Kenny Hood scored 12 points and grabbed 12 rebounds -- including six offensive  boards.  </P> <P> Chris Dunbar scored 16 points and Delvon Hardaway added 11 for Chatsworth  (3-5), which lost both of its pool games and was eliminated.  </P> <P> In other tournament games:  </P> <P> Fairfax 91, Burbank 38 -- Fairfax bombed Burbank, 20-4, in the first quarter  and never looked back in a second-round game in pool play.  </P> <P> Paul Tapp led Burbank (1-9), which was eliminated, with 12 points. Senior  center Ryan Hickman of Fairfax led all scorers with 21 points.  </P> <P> Chaminade 88, Camp Kilpatrick 43 -- All five Chaminade starters scored in  double figures, led by Charlie Fei (19 points) and Mark Mirkovich (15).  </P> <P> Santa Monica 69, Granada Hills 64 -- Granada Hills was held to nine points in  the first quarter and never recovered, despite 20 points from senior guard  Jermoine Brantley.  </P> <P> Aaron Lattimore added 16 points for Granada Hills (6-6).  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 9 May (PL) -- The process of rendering  accounts to voters -- the backbone of the people's government of  Cuba -- is currently being carried out on the island, a process  that will continue through June.    Neighborhood assemblies in the different voting precincts  are  analyzing the main problems affecting their communities as well  as the efforts of the delegates who represent them at different  government levels to solve the problems.    These plenary sessions have the power, according to the  organization and make-up of the people's government and the  existing laws, to dismiss delegates who, in the people's  opinion, have not fulfilled their obligations.    On this occasion, the assemblies are also debating different  aspects of the application of the economic measures adopted by  the parliament in an effort to improve the country's internal  finances.    Regarding the process of rendering accounts, Jaime Crombet,  vice president of the National Assembly of the People's  Government, said it is being carried out at a very opportune  moment to wage a political battle, under extremely difficult  economic conditions, and to advance solutions for local problems  more effectively.</p>

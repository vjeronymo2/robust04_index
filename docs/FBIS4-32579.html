			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Gyula Horn, prime minister-designate </F> and chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party, and Ivan Peto,  chairman of the Alliance of Free Democrats, by correspondent  Evelyn Forro; from the "Extra" program -- live]    [Excerpts] [Forro] [passage omitted] A lot of things are  being talked about--no doubt you also heard--first and foremost  about the coming and going of the monies of foundations. It is  being said that the corruption revealed to date is only the tip  of the iceberg. Will you be launching any kind of investigation?    [Horn] People are talking a lot about this, and it is not  certain that all of it is true. But it is true that there is a  huge amount of corrupt deals, or suspected corruption. Just  take a look at the press. Not a day passes without a report  about some kind of scandal or a report about suspected corrupt  deals. The MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] has committed  itself to reexamining the privatization decisions made during  the period between 1 April and the formation of the new  government. The coalition agreement also contains things  relating to this. There is the exact text, here is the exact  text relating to this.    What I would like to stipulate is this: We do not have any  intention of initiating any kind of calling to account vis-a-vis  the present administration or government officials. But when  there is a well-founded suspicion, a report, or anything else of  that kind, in other words, if it becomes necessary for us to  investigate, or to order the investigation of some kind of  suspected corruption or illegal deal, then I do not think that  the government, or the organs belonging to the government, will  for a single minute hesitate to investigate it.    These things have to be investigated. If need be, in given  cases, ad hoc investigating committees will have to be set up.  This is demanded not only by a sense of justice, but also  because there is a need once and for all to create order. A  government that does not declare war on corruption, on abuses,  is not a government. [passage omitted]    [Forro] There has been a huge amount of speculation about  where changes will take place. [passage omitted] When will you  decide about these, and what kind of changes have you in mind?    [Horn] Excuse me, let us take them in order.    [Forro] The Hungarian National Bank [MNB].    [Horn] Yes. Here we will consider necessary a change at the  head of the MNB.    [Forro] Incidentally, let me ask if you have already had  discussions with people, have requests been made, or has the  person already been found?    [Horn] Yes, we have held discussions, we have held  discussions, yes, we do have our nominee for this office.    [Forro] Can this be made public yet?    [Horn] It still has to be coordinated, but for the time  being  I do not want--I would not like....[sentence incomplete as heard]    [Forro] All right, then all I will ask is has there been  agreement on the nominee?    [Peto] Coordination will occur in every important personnel  issue. At the MNB, as is known, there is a legal problem, if  you like: The mandate of the present chairman of the MNB is no  longer the mandate of the government that appointed him. It is  also known that earlier he was a party politician. According to  some opinions--I would now hasten to distance myself from this  opinion--but there are opinions to the effect that if a  politician becomes the chairman of a bank, then in accordance  with the rules of political etiquette, if there is a change of  government then it would be seemly for him to resign.    [Forro] MNB Chairman Peter Akos Bod has said he will not  resign.    [Peto] Obviously, I also heard that was what he said.  [passage omitted]    [Forro] Institutions responsible for privatization?    [Horn] At any rate, our opinion is that the privatization  institutions have to be amalgamated because the present  situation cannot be maintained. What is more, if possible it  should be done on the basis of the Assets Handling joint-stock  company. As for how and in what way its form will be resolved,  that is the experts job. [passage omitted]    [Forro] Peter Boross has already announced that he will  shortly be dismissing--or that he will be proposing the  dismissal of -- Laszlo Csucs and Gabor Nahlik. Have you talked  about who are going to be the new leaders of radio and  television?    [Horn] Consultations were held about this between experts,  and also between Ivan Peto and myself. Several candidates came  into question. As far as my opinion is concerned--because it is  possible that consultations will continue about this in the  coming weeks-- well, the prime minister has announced that he is  dismissing the two deputy chairmen. I will add that after this  steps must be taken also in the matter of the dismissal of  Elemer Hankiss and Csaba Gombar. This falls within the  competence and sphere of authority of the president of the  Republic. What we would like is that afterward, during the  present extraordinary term, the committee hearings and  appointment of the leaders of the two media should take place.  Naturally, in coordination, in agreement between the two  parties, with regard to the people. [passage omitted]    I consider the following extremely important: The first  thing is that this coaltion will at all events like to give  greater weight and support to those areas--apart from the social  welfare areas--which are of fundamental importance from the  viewpoint of the country's situation, the population's  situation, such as culture, education, public education, in  strategic taskss, sport, and other areas. Here obviously, as  Ivan Peto also said, the financial resources could mean very  harsh restrictions. But at all events the situation has to be  improved. There is a possibility that we can lead and maintain  the differences of views in appropriate channels. By this I  mean that our intention from the outset has been--and the  coalition partners agreed on this--that the realization of the  most important tasks designated by the government will be  entrusted to the economic cabinet. So, we want to give the  economic cabinet a much more important role than it has played  up to now. The economic cabinet will have to decide on these  issues, and if that does not succeed, then there will be further  government forums where coordination can take place on these  issues.    What pains me is that the country's financial opportunities  are fairly narrow. Just one other thing -- I am sorry, forgive  me for going on -- I would just like to add one more thing: I  consider it extremely important, extraordinarily important, that  sometime in the autumn, let us say in September or October at  the latest, there should be concluded an economic-social  agreement in which the participants will be the government, the  employers, and the interest representation organs of employees.  In other words, a kind of economic-social pact that will  guarantee self-moderation and at the same time the realization,  the fulfillment of demands that are considered just and  fulfillable. This is a key issue from the viewpoint of the  coming period.    [Forro] [passage omitted] What sort of relationship will the  prime minister and the Foreign Ministry have? What I am  thinking is that former Prime Minister Jozsef Antall practically  directed foreign affairs himself.    [Horn] I do not expect any kind of conflict. The Foreign  Ministry must be given the opportunity for independence. We  also agreed that in the case of such a small country, a decisive  task of the Foreign Ministry is to promote the solution of  economic and social problems. So, in foreign affairs activity  we ascribe very great importance to economic diplomacy. It is  not with macroeconomics that we have to deal--beyond the  necessary limits--but above all with helping the country to be  able to step onto the path of modernization as soon as possible.    [Forro] Who will make up the team that will work directly  alongside the prime minister. Can we have the names?    [Horn] I have asked Elemer Kiss to lead the Prime Minister's  Office; he has experience in this area, he has already carried  out excellent work. [passage omitted] There is one more thing  that I consider very important, and that is that we should be  thrifty with numbers. This will have to be a cheaper government  and this applies equally to the ministries and the Prime  Minister's Office. [passage omitted]</p>

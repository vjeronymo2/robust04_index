			<p>BFN     [Text] As has already been reported, a NATO delegation  visited Almaty for three days, led by General Peter Heinrich  Carstens, chief of staff of the Supreme Headquarters [HQ] Allied  Powers of Europe. They met the leadership of the Supreme Kenges  and the Cabinet of Ministers, held talks at the Ministries of  Defense and Foreign Affairs, and visited military units.    A news conference was held today on the outcome of the visit  by Major General Alibek Kasymov, chief of staff of the main HQ  of the Kazakh Armed Forces and Peter Heinrich Karstens. The  NATO general told journalists that after the end of the Cold  War, NATO is facing many qualitatively new objectives. Foremost  is the expansion of the security area in the world,  establishment of friendship with the former USSR countries and  the Warsaw Pact. The Partnership for Peace program was  designed with this aim in mind. Kazakhstan has already joined.  One of the provisions of the program is cooperation in the  military field. Later this year joint training exercises for  ground troops will be held in Poland and Holland where Kazakh  observers are invited to participate. One of the aims of the  NATO delegation's visit to Kazakhstan is to establish links with  the Kazakh top brass and learn more about their routine work.    As Alibek Kasymov said, nobody dictates any conditions to  Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan itself now determines the degree of  intensity of its participation in the program, taking into  account realistic possibilities of the program's feasibility.  The NATO delegation's arrival became an important benchmark in  the establishment of cooperation between Kazakhstan and that  organization, Kasymov stressed.</p>

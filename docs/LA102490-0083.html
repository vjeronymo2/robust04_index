			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLANNERS BACK 1,000-ACRE COMMUNITY;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: THE COMMISSIONERS OVERRULED CONCERNS OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS IN  SUPPORTING THE PROJECT NEAR MISSION VIEJO.  </P> <P> Overruling concerns raised by environmental consultants, the Orange County  Planning Commission on Tuesday unanimously backed a proposed planned community  near Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> The proposal, which would allow as many as 2,500 homes and apartments to be  built on about 1,000 acres, came under fire from an array of environmental  organizations during a 4 1/2-hour meeting. But at its conclusion, the  commissioners held a straw vote in which they voiced some concerns but signaled  overall approval for the development.  </P> <P> The project, known as the Las Flores Planned Community, is being proposed by  the Santa Margarita Co., one of the county's largest and most influential  development firms.  </P> <P> "This project has support," commission Chairman Stephen A. Nordeck declared at  the conclusion of the grueling session. "We just need to get a couple of things  worked out."  </P> <P> Among the most hotly debated points was a corridor intended to protect nesting  birds in Arroyo Trabuco, a 5-mile stretch of canyon east of Mission Viejo. The  arroyo is home to a variety of birds, and several species could be threatened  by the development if steps are not taken to protect them, said Karlin Marsh, a  biologist who studied the area under contract with the county's Harbors,  Beaches and Parks division.  </P> <P> Marsh recommended that the county trim about nine more acres from the project  proposal, reserving it as buffer to protect the species inhabiting the arroyo.  On a 3-2 vote, however, the commissioners rejected that proposal.  </P> <P> Nordeck and Commissioner Thomas Moody voted in favor of the restriction, while  A. Earl Wooden, Roger D. Slates and C. Douglas Leavenworth opposed it.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Marsh said the commission had probably doomed the birds in  favor of the homes.  </P> <P> "We've shut down the area for nesting raptors," she said, adding that  red-tailed hawks and black-shouldered kites would be the most seriously  affected. "They will no longer be there. Period, end of discussion."  </P> <P> Although board members heard that argument during their session, many indicated  that they believed that the project's potential benefits -- in particular, the  construction of relatively low-cost housing in a county desperately short of it  -- outweighed potential damage to birds and other wildlife.  </P> <P> In addition, the county planning staff and the developer agreed to several  conditions that are expected to reduce some of the environmental damage caused  by the project.  </P> <P> The company, for instance, has agreed to delete so-called Planning Area 7, a  housing tract on the project's southern edge. Eliminating that area from the  plan could cost the company $2.5 million to $3 million in lost housing sales,  according to Dan Kelly, vice president of governmental relations for the Santa  Margarita Co.  </P> <P> The company also reconfigured other housing areas and eliminated a community  park that county officials said could crowd species living in the arroyo.  </P> <P> Although much discussion centered on environmental issues, commissioners also  raised concerns about the amount and type of affordable housing that the  project will include. Kelly, however, reassured commissioners by providing them  with a proposed condition committing the company to providing 60% of its  housing for less than $250,000.  </P> <P> Included in that will be housing units classified as "affordable" to people  earning about 80% of the county's median income, a figure that varies along  with average salaries of county residents.  </P> <P> Kelly described himself as "gratified" by the commission's vote Tuesday but  cautioned that final Planning Commission approval is still at least a week  away. The commission will meet again Tuesday and is expected to approve the  project at that session.  </P> <P> The commission will then forward it to the Board of Supervisors, which will  make the final determination on the project.  </P></p>

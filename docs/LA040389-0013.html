			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW UCLA CENTER TO STUDY REGIONAL URBAN PROBLEMS  </P> <P> Reflecting a desire to play a more visible role in the region's policy-making  arena, UCLA today announced the creation of a center to focus on many of the  urban problems -- from transportation to land use -- facing local governments  in Southern California.  </P> <P> A UCLA official said that the new Center for Regional Policy Studies will  coordinate independent study on urban issues now under way at UCLA and provide  a resource for community leaders who are trying to find new strategies for  solving social and environmental problems.  </P> <P> "We feel the university should have an expanded role in helping to frame the  public debates which are central to the process of regional renewal," said  Richard Weinstein, dean of UCLA's Graduate School of Architecture and Urban  Planning, where the center will be based.  </P> <P> Weinstein said a goal of the center is to solve "the policy gridlock" -- the  inability of the region's many governments to work together. Pursuit of that  goal could put the center in the thick of a growing debate about the  effectiveness of local government as it is now constituted.  </P> <P> Weinstein does not shy away from expressing his skepticism of the current local  government system.  </P> <P> "With 162 separate political jurisdictions (in the five-county region around  Los Angeles), we have the most balkanized political geography in the country,  if not the world," he said. "At the same time, we confront issues like air  pollution, traffic congestion, jobs and housing that do not respect the  artificial political boundaries that we have created over the years."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Poverty, Land Use  </P> <P> Weinstein said the center also will focus on regional poverty, on "the link  between transportation, land use and environmental degradation" and on the  structure of the region's economy.  </P> <P> The center is being created with a $5-million endowment from UCLA alumni and  home builders Ralph and Goldy Lewis. Weinstein said the facility, to be called  the Lewis Center, will draw on more than 80 faculty members and 115 departments  and professional schools at UCLA. A director for the center has yet to be  chosen.  </P> <P> With the center, UCLA becomes one of 95 universities throughout the country,  including Cal State Long Beach, to establish a local research institute for  urban policy studies.  </P></p>

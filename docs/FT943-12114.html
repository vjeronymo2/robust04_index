			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Adams case goes to Euro court Two High Court judges yesterday referred the government ban on Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, visiting mainland Britain to the European Court of Justice. European judges will be asked to lay down legal guidelines on the competing interests of Mr Adams' right to move freely within the European Union, including the UK, and the government's right under European law to take action against him in the interests of national security. A central issue is whether the exclusion order made last October under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989 was 'disproportionate' when Mr Adams wanted to pay a brief visit to discuss the political situation in Northern Ireland with MPs.</p>

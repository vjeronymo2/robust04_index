			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Philip Morris pegs dividend PHILIP MORRIS, the food and tobacco group which set off a price war in the US cigarette industry last April by slashing the price of its Marlboro brand, yesterday disappointed Wall Street by not increasing its quarterly dividend. It declared it would pay its existing 65 cents-a-share dividend to investors on October 12, dashing analysts' hopes of an increase of up to 7 or 8 per cent. Philip Morris shares fell Dollars 3 on the news, to stand at Dollars 48 1/8 in lunchtime trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

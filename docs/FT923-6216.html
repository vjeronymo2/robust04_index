			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Big cuts in Danish spending proposed DENMARK'S minority government yesterday proposed heavy spending cuts in a draft 1993 state budget designed to reduce deficits and keep the country's economic revival on course. It unveiled a budget with a DKr33.9bn (Pounds 3.1bn) deficit, lower than the expected shortfall for 1992 of DKr38.3bn. The budget, proposing savings of DKr7.5bn to leave real expenditure unchanged, is likely to face a stormy passage in political negotiations this autumn. While the ruling centre-right government is bent on austerity, left-wing and centrist opposition parties say they want increased public spending to get the more than 300,000 unemployed people in Denmark back to work. In his budget statement, the finance minister, Mr Henning Dyremose, said the balance of payments surplus was expected to rise to DKr23.5bn next year from an estimated DKr21bn surplus this year. But two problems for the Danish economy were high unemployment and the large state budget deficit. The government forecasts that unemployment at the end of 1992 will be around 10.25 per cent, dropping to 10 per cent in 1993. 'The state budget deficit has as yet shown no sign of falling, hence the need for austerity policies. . . . We must pursue policies to stabilise the Danish economy and prevent overseas confidence in Denmark from further declining due to our as yet unclarified position on Europe following the 'no' to Maastricht in the June referendum,' Mr Dyremose said. Appealing for support for tight austerity policies, to get the state budget back into surplus, he called for privatisation, rationalisation and efficiency programmes, coupled with reductions in state subsidies to industry and commerce and benefits to the unemployed. 'Unemployment is still far too high, it is of major importance to make lasting cuts in the huge jobless rate,' the minister said.</p>

			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Donors agree Dollars 825m in aid to Sri Lanka SRI LANKA'S donors and the World Bank have pledged Dollars 825m (Pounds 456m) in aid for 1992. 'We requested Dollars 800m,' said Mr D G Wijetunge, the prime minister, who is also the minister of finance, after his return from the annual Paris meeting of donors. Japan led the league of donors, followed by the World Bank and the US. Three EC countries and Canada in particular were critical of the government's human rights record. After the visit of a Canadian parliamentary team, Canada had argued for a cut or suspension of aid as in the case of Kenya, where aid has been deferred for six months. However, the World Bank's view that the government has made a serious attempt to address human rights issues was endorsed by the leading donors, the IMF and the Asian Development Bank. The World Bank report stressed that an end to the decade-long war against separatist Tamil rebels was crucial for economic growth. Sri Lankan growth, which exceeded 6 per cent in 1990 was 5 per cent last year. This compares to 2 per cent growth in the previous three years. Recent policy reforms have yielded results, the report added. Inflation has fallen from 20 per cent in 1990 to 9 per cent. The rapid growth of non-traditional exports has offset the impact of lower tea prices. Garments and gem stones are now top exchange earners. While commending the government on its privatisation programme and cuts in the budget of a huge civil service, the report urges reforms in the plantation sector (tea, mainly) and two large state banks. Opposition and trade union protest on both issues is mounting.</p>

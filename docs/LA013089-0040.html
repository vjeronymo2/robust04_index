			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMING OF AGE;  </P> <P> MATER DEI HIGH COACH FINDS WINNING ISN'T EVERYTHING  </P> <P> Gary McKnight, the Empire Builder, stands with his hands thrust in the pockets  of his gray trousers surveying his latest masterpiece.  </P> <P> It's nearly 8 o'clock one evening and 18 boys clad in the red-and-white colors  of Santa Ana Mater Dei High School shoot layups inside the Orange Coast College  gymnasium at Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> McKnight, dressed in a brilliant red sweater with "M.D. basketball" emblazoned  over his heart, is stationed near the end of the Mater Dei bench.  </P> <P> After 6 seasons -- some filled with controversy -- McKnight, 36, is a portrait  of success. He's a 5-foot 10-inch, chubby genius of a basketball coach, having  transformed a very good Mater Dei program into a juggernaut, the likes of which  has never been seen in the Southern Section.  </P> <P> He has won five Southern Section and Angelus League championships and a state  championship at Mater Dei.  </P> <P> McKnight has a 189-17 record, including 21-2 this season. The Monarchs are 64-2  in Angelus League play. Despite a 21-8 record (McKnight's worst) and losing the  league title to Bishop Amat last season, McKnight rallied the Monarchs to a  fourth consecutive 5-A championship. He's the only coach in the 76-year history  of the Southern Section to win four straight titles.  </P> <P> McKnight has turned out more top-flight players than any other coach in Orange  County. He has sent players to California, Brigham Young, Kentucky, Loyola  Marymount, Pepperdine and Syracuse.  </P> <P> McKnight, his wife, Judy, and their young sons, Bryan, Clay, Geoffrey and  Matthew, live in a spacious 2-story home in Mission Viejo. The McKnights have  two basketball hoops in the backyard.  </P> <P> All is bliss for McKnight these days.  </P> <P> But it wasn't always that way. There were times in his early days at Mater Dei  that McKnight was miserable, which was directly tied to winning.  </P> <P> As Mater Dei won, McKnight and the school became the target of accusations and  innuendo.  </P> <P>  -- Mater Dei recruits players, which McKnight denies.  </P> <P>  -- McKnight keeps his star players in lopsided games so they can pad scoring  averages.  </P> <P>  -- All McKnight cares about is winning, regardless of the consequences.  </P> <P> McKnight, 29 when he was hired at Mater Dei, his first head coaching position,  admits he made mistakes.  </P> <P> In his zeal to make Mater Dei a powerhouse, his teams often won games by 40 or  50 points, when he could have given his reserves more playing time and still  won by 20.  </P> <P> Mater Dei won its first Southern Section championship in his first season, its  second 2 years later.  </P> <P> But after 3 heady seasons full of victories, McKnight found himself with few  friends and no respect among his peers.  </P> <P> It was then he knew he had to make peace. He knew he had to mature.  </P> <P> "I was young and heading the most powerful athletic program in Orange County in  the largest Catholic high school west of Chicago," McKnight said.  </P> <P> McKnight knew how to win. He just needed to know how to handle winning more  gracefully.  </P> <P> He has since learned that sometimes it pays to be nice, to show a little  compassion for the other team, to be humble in victory, to be graceful in  defeat.  </P> <P> McKnight has mellowed and matured as time has passed. He said he has made  overtures to make friends with other coaches.  </P> <P> And because he has, he has taken his rightful place as one of the Southern  Section's most respected coaches.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE WONDER YEARS  </P> <P> Tony Sisca had no doubts that Gary McKnight would be a success.  </P> <P> In 1969, Sisca coached baseball at San Clemente High School when McKnight was a  hard-nosed sophomore catcher trying to make an impression.  </P> <P> "You could see he wanted to learn as much as he could about the game," said  Sisca, a government and economics teacher at San Clemente. "I thought he was  very, very serious. I remember remarking that I hope this kid makes our team  because he's so serious.  </P> <P> "When he took batting practice, he didn't joke around. He tried to hit the ball  hard every time and was deeply disappointed if he didn't."  </P> <P> McKnight made varsity that season, but an injury limited his playing time. He  also played varsity football.  </P> <P> But when it came to basketball, McKnight was cut from the junior varsity.  </P> <P> "He was a good kid, but baseball was his best sport," said Stan DeMaggio,  former San Clemente basketball coach.  </P> <P> McKnight continued playing baseball at Saddleback College, under the late  Marshall Adair. By then, McKnight knew he wanted to be a coach.  </P> <P> McKnight's interest in coaching began when he was a junior in high school. He  coached baseball, basketball and football in San Clemente youth leagues. He  graduated to coach traveling all-star youth basketball teams, something he  continued to do until he took the Mater Dei job in 1982.  </P> <P> In 1973, DeMaggio hired McKnight as freshman coach and varsity assistant.  McKnight jumped at the chance, though it wasn't everything he expected it to  be.  </P> <P> "Actually, I started working for him as a volunteer the year before," McKnight  said. "All I did was take the last five down to the other end of the court and  teach them the other team's offense."  </P> <P> DeMaggio, who now coaches the Capistrano Valley High School girls' basketball  team, quit in 1976 and McKnight, newly graduated from Cal State Fullerton,  became an assistant to Bill Mulligan at Saddleback College. McKnight had  coached Mulligan's son, Brian, on the freshman team at San Clemente.  </P> <P> "I first saw him when my sons were playing on a Riverside traveling team," said  Mulligan, UC Irvine's coach. "There was this little fat guy coaching Mission  Viejo. And they were beating everybody by 50 points. My first reaction was not  to like the guy."  </P> <P> That changed as Mulligan got to know McKnight.  </P> <P> "The guy can coach," Mulligan said. "Above all, he can coach."  </P> <P> Mulligan introduced McKnight to Jim Harris, who had just been named the coach  at a new high school in Huntington Beach called Ocean View.  </P> <P> Harris had met McKnight a few years earlier when McKnight was coaching a youth  team that played a game at Ocean View.  </P> <P> "He was very quiet, very gentlemanly and very young," said Harris, who  officiated the game.  </P> <P> Harris remains McKnight's closest friend. Their families take summer vacations  together and make a point of attending the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.  Final Four each year.  </P> <P> It was at Ocean View that McKnight got a taste of winning and winning big on  the high school level.  </P> <P> He coached the freshman and junior varsity teams to a combined 82-11 record and  won a league championship in each of his 4 seasons.  </P> <P> In 1981, McKnight, who taught science at Ocean View, was laid off by the  Huntington Beach Union High School District and a subsequent job search yielded  a teaching position at Mater Dei. He continued to coach at Ocean View and was  one of the finalists for a vacancy as the Seahawks' varsity baseball coach.  </P> <P> He didn't get the job -- "It's funny how things work out," he said -- and 2  months later, he was named to succeed Bill Alexander, who was asked to resign,  as Mater Dei varsity basketball coach.  </P> <P> McKnight came to Mater Dei with no varsity experience. But with Adair, Harris  and Mulligan as his mentors and a gymnasium full of talented players awaiting  him, he was seemingly headed straight to the big time.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE BLUNDER YEARS  </P> <P> "I thought, 'Is this how easy it is?' " McKnight said of his first few seasons  at Mater Dei.  </P> <P> The answer appeared to be a resounding yes.  </P> <P> McKnight had Tom Lewis (now at Pepperdine), Matt Beeuwsaert (California) and  Chris Jackson (UC Riverside). The Monarchs clobbered their opponents.  </P> <P> His first season, Mater Dei was 29-3 and won the 4-A title -- then the large  school division. In his second, the Monarchs were 28-2 and were the 4-A  runners-up.  </P> <P> But at a time when Mater Dei was bringing new-found respect to Orange County  high school basketball, McKnight was lonely. At a time when he should have been  hailed for his efforts, he was assailed for being overzealous.  </P> <P> Other coaches despised him for his tactics: for allegedly recruiting Lewis  (though it has never been proven), for running up scores, for keeping the  starters in long after games were decided to pad his stars' statistics.  </P> <P> And they hated him for winning.  </P> <P> "It's hard not to have a little arrogance when you win all the time," said Mark  Ramstack, last season's point guard. "A lot of that comes from people's  perception because you win. A lot of people judge you because you win."  </P> <P> As Mater Dei continued to win, McKnight continued to lose friends.  </P> <P> "He called me at that time, and said, 'You're the only friend I've got,' "  Harris said.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of pressures and mistakes," McKnight said. "We ran up a lot  of scores. We had a lot of false values, it seems now as the years have  passed."  </P> <P> Former Dana Hills Coach Steve Thornton was particularly critical.  </P> <P> "McKnight says that Mater Dei is great for Orange County basketball," Thornton  was quoted as saying in a 1984 Times story on the ethics of the Monarch  basketball program. "I think it's terrible for Orange County basketball myself.  It makes a mockery of what high school sports is supposed to be."  </P> <P> Countered McKnight in the same article:  </P> <P> "I think it comes with winning. It's part of the territory. We're 51-4 in 2  years. I wonder if some of these people would be upset if we were 4-51. If we  need to have a mediocre program for me to have some of these people who are  jealous as my friends, I guess I won't have them as friends."  </P> <P> Now, McKnight said he could have been more diplomatic.  </P> <P> "I don't think I had the right attitude," McKnight said. "I don't think I  handled some things very well then. I didn't have the maturity at the time. It  bothered me that coaches in the county didn't like me, that I was alienating  them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE YEARS AHEAD  </P> <P> Clay McKnight, 12, jogged out to the backyard, scooped up one of what seemed to  be 3 dozen basketballs lying about, took a couple of dribbles and unloaded a  two-handed dunk on one of the two hoops. This one is only 7 feet high, but it  still was impressive.  </P> <P> Marv Marinovich built it for his son, Todd, a former Capistrano Valley and  Mater Dei football quarterback and basketball player, now at USC. He passed it  on to McKnight when Todd outgrew it.  </P> <P> The other basket is regulation 10 feet. The pole is set into a 5-foot deep  block of cement to ensure it weathers jamming by McKnight's other kids -- the  varsity players at Mater Dei.  </P> <P> Clay is quickly followed by Bryan, 8, Geoffrey, 7. Matthew, 5, lags behind.  </P> <P> "He only looks like an angel," Judy McKnight said rolling her eyes.  </P> <P> Each boy had a ball in hand, dribbling and shooting in a mini-Monarch shoot  around.  </P> <P> Despite the pounding of the basketballs, it's an idyllic scene.  </P> <P> The McKnight family is highly visible at every Mater Dei game. Judy stands with  Gary for a few moments in front of the bench before the game starts. After a  few quiet words and a peck on the cheek, she's off to take her seat in the  stands. The McKnight children are ballboys.  </P> <P> But to get the full effect, to find McKnight at his happiest you have to come  here, to see him and his family at home.  </P> <P> "My family gets cheated," McKnight said. "Especially during the season. It  would be nice if my home was closer to school. My sons could come to practice  every day.  </P> <P> "It's kind of fun. They're starting to understand now what dad does. I'm  looking forward to the day Clay is a freshman. It's not just the basketball,  but riding to school together in the mornings."  </P> <P> His devotion to family life is one of the reasons McKnight said he would not  accept a college assistant coaching position. Though it seems to be the next  logical step in McKnight's rising career, he says he can't bear the thought of  flying around the country scouting and visiting recruits without the company of  his family.  </P> <P> Nor can he fathom the idea of knocking down doors to get a head coaching  position at a college.  </P> <P> "I've been offered several assistant jobs, usually it's to nail a recruit,"  McKnight said. "I'm very content. I'm very happy at Mater Dei."  </P> <P> With that contentment and happiness, a new Gary McKnight has emerged. The  brashness of the angry young McKnight has faded. What remains is simply the  most successful coach of the most successful basketball program in the Southern  Section.  </P></p>

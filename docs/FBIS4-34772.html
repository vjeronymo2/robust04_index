			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Division General Rigoberto Garcia by Caridad </F> Carrobello; place and date not given; first two paragraphs are  BOHEMIA introduction]    [Text] Although he is 60 years old, he acts as if he has  been drinking from the fountain of youth. Maybe the source of  that miracle water is the over 50,000 troops, most of whom are  between 18 and 20, in the EJT [Youth Labor Army], which he has  commanded since 1977.    Division General Rigoberto Garcia cannot only take credit  for  training these young men, but he has also added more luster to  the stars on his shoulders by producing 632,000 tons of food for  the Cuban people, as the EJT tends over 15,000 "caballerias" of  land planted in crops as important as sugarcane, coffee,  tobacco, citrus fruits, and a variety of other crops.    [Carrobello] Will these officers and soldiers propose a new  method of agricultural work? (I am addressing this and other  questions to the man whom some people now call "The General of  the Fields.")    [Garcia] The EJT, founded in 1973, was conceived at first as  only a support force. They had no permanent presence in the  areas where they worked. Their constant transfers created  problems and a great deal of disorganization. So we established  ties with the areas where the troops stayed, and tried to create  stability.    With sugarcane, for example, where in the beginning we only  worked on cutting the cane, we began to get involved from the  beginning, starting with plowing the fields and working through  the harvest. When a man is involved in all aspects of the crop,  he begins to feel more committed.    There was also a dual structure handling the same mission,  the state farm system and our organization. We tried to work  this out, and then we took over full responsibility for the work.    [Carrobello] And the organizational transformations?    [Garcia] In the past, as I told you, our forces were  scattered, and they worked in different areas at the same time.  We set up a bloc system. This means concentrating resources and  labor on the first job, and then moving on to another. This made  the farm leadership council, composed of both civilians and  military, remain fully involved in the field of action, seeing  the needs and handling the forces in an operational manner.    [Carrobello] Is this the integral farms method?    [Garcia] Yes, we have over 90 all over Cuba.    (The general takes out a pocket diary listing all the  production units the EJT has working. They are classified by  municipality, and full information on the farms is provided.)    They work according to a weekly schedule where we list  normal, additional, and preventive work. The additional work is  to be done if the normal and preventive jobs are completed. So  if fuel shortages, problems with rain, or if any other  complications arise, they will know what to do.    We have also eliminated quotas. With quotas, there was a  tendency to slack off. When the quota was met, nothing else was  done. I have often found soldiers sitting down because they had  finished. Now we talk of possibilities. There are many  possibilities for young men between 18 and 20 to do more.    [Carrobello] Do you think all these features make the EJT  the  most productive force in the fields?    [Garcia] We are not the most productive in everything. There  are agricultural groups that outpace us. But looking at our work  in a general way, we are not being immodest in considering  ourselves in the forefront.    Some people think we achieve this because we are military.  There is no question that a military structure and the ages of  our soldiers are two fundamental reasons why we are more  efficient. But there are also factors like discipline, stringent  requirements, and organization. These are not solely military  attributes; these are qualities within the reach of anyone who  wants to improve.    Our soldiers now harvest between 80 and 90 quintals of  potatoes and our working tools also have an impact on that  performance. We have found that if the right equipment is not  used to hold the bag open properly, a man can harvest only 50  quintals and it takes up to 13 minutes to fill a bag, which  otherwise would be filled in three.    I emphasize the preparation of the tools we use. If a  cutting  tool does not have a shielded tip, a soldier's hands get hurt  more and he cuts less cane. Without the right tools in good  condition, there is no reliable productivity.    [Carrobello] Like any battle, a "green battle" also has its  obstacles. What are they?    [Garcia] One difficulty is with the minimum amount of fuel  we  are supposed to get, that is assigned to us, but that does not  reach us. That does not allow me to establish a systematic fuel  conservation plan, as should be done. But without a doubt, our  major problem is the collection system for our harvested crops.  I know this issue is controversial, but I take full  responsibility for what I am saying.    We have been hurt by late collections of our produce. That  happened with potatoes, cabbage, carrots, and plantains, which  were left out in the sun too long. The collection system has all  kinds of mechanisms that cause damage to meats and vegetables; I  will give you an example. Plantains are picked and then taken to  a storage area; from there they are taken to be weighed, and  then sent to the wholesale market, then another truck takes them  on to other destinations.    That item is loaded and unloaded no less than seven to eight  times. It takes a long time to get it to the people, and during  its lengthy and cumbersome trip, it runs the risk of being  stolen.    If we had responsibility for direct deliveries, I would not  steal my own products. I would make sure they got to the markets  fresh so they would be top-quality produce, and so people would  have the quality they deserve in the products they are buying.    [Carrobello] So far we have talked about the virtues of the  EJT. What are its defects?    [Garcia] The young men's complaints are primarily related to  not getting enough passes. That upsets them because they work  hard, and there are leadership personnel who are incapable of  providing adequate answers, arguments they can understand.    In general, the food is accepted. They understand the  existing situation and see the efforts we are making to improve  it by producing our own food and exchanging products with other  farms.    But we do have difficulties with recreation. There are not  enough resources and equipment, and the cultural brigades are  late in getting to the camps. And there are also shortages of  clothing and shoes for the soldiers.    [Carrobello] Prospects, goals?    [Garcia] We will increase our sugarcane, citrus, and coffee  production. But our main goal is to consolidate this new system  of agricultural work, which demonstrates how much more can be  accomplished when people are willing and organized.</p>

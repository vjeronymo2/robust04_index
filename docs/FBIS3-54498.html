			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 26 Jan (INA) -- The Foreign Ministry  tonight categorically dismissed western and American news media  allegations of chemicals used in the manufacture of fuels for  missiles being found aboard a German ship docking in Saudi  Arabia. Following is the text of the statement:    Western and American news media have attributed a statement  to Dieter Vogel, a German government official, in which he said  that German intelligence services have had access to information  from Saudi Arabia to the effect that a search of a German  freighter, docked at the Port of Jeddah, by Saudi and German  inspectors on 28 December 1993 turned up two containers  including hundreds of tonnes of a chemical stuff, used in the  manufacture of fuels for missiles.    The statement added that this ship had transported chemicals  from China and then unloaded part of its freight in Hong Kong.  The vessel's travel plan called for it to dock in Cyprus before  proceeding to Beirut, its final destination. The German official  then claimed that the chemicals consignment was to have been  transported from Beirut to Iraq.    The Foreign Ministry hereby categorically denies these  allegations. The fabrication of lies has become a hackneyed  tactic resorted to by certain quarters known for their hostility  toward Iraq and the Iraqi people, among them the Saudi regime.  The idea is to level baseless accusations against Iraq, spread  lies, and cast doubt with the object of keeping the wicked  blockade in place. This is because more and more circles and  nations within and outside the UN Security Council are demanding  the removal of the blockade.    The Foreign Ministry hereby condemns these groundless  allegations and the role of the guileful Saudi regime in making  up such lies.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS OK $2.3 MILLION FOR AIDS HOSPICES  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors has committed another $2.38 million over three  years to AIDS hospices, voting to support new shelters in Pomona and  Willowbrook and to back existing ones in Van Nuys and central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The supervisors withheld long-term support, however, from the hospice that  serves the coastal area.  </P> <P> The new three-year commitments, approved last week amid complaints that the  county's AIDS program is moving too slowly, extend hospice funding to mid-1992.  The action comes close to fulfilling pledges by the supervisors a year ago to  spend $2 million annually on shelters for patients with acquired immune  deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Beds Increased by 16  </P> <P> The funding package increases the number of county-supported hospice beds from  21 to 37 at a cost of about $50,000 each per year, or $1.85 million for 37.  </P> <P> In all, there are about 100 beds in AIDS hospices countywide, most of them paid  for by private contributions or the patients themselves. About 6,900 AIDS cases  have been confirmed in the county, including almost 4,500 that ended in death,  since the county began keeping statistics on the disease.  </P> <P> While increasing its support last week, the board extended for only two months  its contract with the Padua House hospice in downtown Long Beach. It also  withdrew funding from Hughes House in the West Hollywood area, which ran out of  money and closed recently.  </P> <P> Though both facilities are run by the same organization, the county withheld  long-term support for different reasons, said John Schunhoff, assistant  director of the County AIDS Office.  </P> <P> A management shake-up at Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach has left in doubt who  holds the lease for the Padua House, so that contract will not be renewed,  Schunhoff said. Under a formula that sets aside eight hospice beds -- or  $400,000 a year -- for each of five supervisorial districts, the Padua House is  now receiving the full eight-bed allotment for the 4th District, a coastal  strip between Orange and Ventura counties.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lost Its Contract  </P> <P> Hospices will be asked to bid for the 4th District funds in June, Schunhoff  said. County payments should begin a month or two after that, he said.  </P> <P> The Hughes House lost its $100,000-a-year contract because the county chose to  award the full $400,000 allocation for the 3rd District to a 25-bed regional  facility at Barlow Hospital in Elysian Park. However, the Hughes House is in  line for state funds and could reopen as a shelter for AIDS patients who are  not near death, he said.  </P> <P> AIDS activists, while pleased with increased hospice funding from the county,  cite the withdrawal of support for Hughes House as an example of the  shortcomings of the county's policy of district-by-district allocations. They  say it does not take into account the concentration of most AIDS cases in a few  areas, especially West Hollywood and Long Beach.  </P> <P> John Maceri, president of Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach, and others have asked  that hospice money set aside for one district but not spent, be placed in a  pool to provide care in other districts where hospice beds already exist.  </P> <P> That point was made by members of the county AIDS Commission when it asked  Chief Administrative Officer Richard Dixon to find out how much hospice money  in this year's budget has not been spent.  </P> <P> "I understand the (political) reason for the distribution," Maceri said. "The  problem is . . . that Supervisor (Ed) Edelman's district has the highest  concentration of cases in the county, but he has the same amount of money that  (Supervisor) Pete Schabarum has."  </P> <P> Schunhoff said -- counting last week's allocations -- $1.1 million of the  $2-million hospice budget will have been spent for beds when the 1988-89 fiscal  year ends June 30. Another $550,000 is being spent for other AIDS services,  such as setting up an AIDS ward at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center and  providing anti-AIDS drugs to area clinics and hospitals.  </P> <P> About $350,000, or 18% of the $2 million, will not be spent this year, he said.  </P> <P> "A lot of this delay has to do with getting new programs up and running,"  Schunhoff said. "There has to be a lead time."  </P> <P> Schunhoff also said Schabarum has responded to the uneven distribution of AIDS  cases by allowing money for six of the eight beds for his San Gabriel Valley  district to be spent at a hospice in central Los Angeles. Patients treated  there must be from Schabarum's district, however, Schunhoff said.  </P> <P> Under the contracts awarded last week, the three organizations that will  receive funding through June, 1992 are:  </P> <P> * Hospice/Los Angeles-Long Beach. It will get about $94,000 a year for two beds  at a shelter being set up in Pomona and about $235,000 a year for five beds at  Pioneer House in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> * Serra Ancillary Care Corp. It will get about $271,000 a year for six beds at  an existing facility west of downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> * AIDS Hospice Foundation. The agency, which also operates the Barlow Hospital  hospice, will get about $158,000 a year for three beds in a new shelter near  Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center in Willowbrook, north of Compton.  </P></p>

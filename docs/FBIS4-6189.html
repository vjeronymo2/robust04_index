			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 19 (YONHAP) -- Nearly 30 members of  Chongukyonhap, an alliance of dissident activists for "democracy  and national unification," demonstrated in front of the U.S.  Embassy in central Seoul Tuesday morning to protest U.S. Defense  Secretary William Perry's visit.    They delivered to the American Embassy a letter addressed to  Perry, accusing Washington of "intentionally aggravating"  tension on the Korean peninsula to benefit the U.S. defense  industry and to sustain its world hegemony as the sole military  power even though the Cold War is over.    They also called on Perry to drop his earlier remark warning  of a war against North Korea, to withdraw immediately all  Patriot missiles from South Korea and to suspend the "Team  Spirit" military exercise permanently.    Meanwhile, Secretary Perry is slated to arrive here late  Tuesday night, the Defense Ministry said.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / TUC drafts radical blueprint for overhaul of labour laws A radical plan for a new system of employee rights involving the creation of workplace committees at large and medium-sized British companies has been drawn up by the TUC. Union leaders believe the blueprint, representing a sharp break in TUC attitudes towards labour law, is likely to win the backing of Labour leader Mr Tony Blair, and could form the basis for a new industrial relations framework promised by the party if it wins the next election. Drafted by a TUC task group chaired by Mr Bill Morris, the TGWU general secretary, it will be presented tomorrow to the TUC's executive committee which is expected to approve it. The move towards continental European practices follows a visit to Norway, Sweden and Germany last month by union leaders led by Mr Morris. In the past, the TUC has been mainly concerned that only workers belonging to trade unions could enjoy full legal representation and it opposed over-regulation in workplace organisation. It relied on voluntary agreement through bargaining between employers and unions. Unions will be asked for their views on the proposals, which will be discussed at a special TUC conference on March 2. Each union will have to decide its position at its summer conference. Leaders hope the changes can be agreed at next autumn's Trades Union Congress. The task group's proposals appear to have united union leaders from the left and right. They include: The legal right to workplace representation for all employees, through an independent trade union or workplace committee, and the right to elect such a committee. The establishment of elected negotiating bodies responsible for creating, if possible through agreement with employers, the new workplace committees. If employers refuse to co-operate, the law would provide a back-up election procedure compelling workplace representation. A legal obligation on employers to consult employees - not just union members - on issues such as redundancies, equal opportunities, training, hours, new work or production methods. Companies would also have to inform employees over corporate strategy, financial matters, production, sales and employment and any restructuring plans. The introduction of legal protection for union members and officials against employer victimisation. Employer blacklists of workers would be outlawed. Safeguards would prevent discrimination against an individual for previous union activities. The creation of new trade union legal rights, including the calling of meetings in the workplace and provision of outside officials to recruit and campaign inside companies. Employers would be required to provide facilities for workplace representatives and give time off for their duties. The creation of a public agency to enforce the legislation.

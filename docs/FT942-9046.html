			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Yemenis in battle for control of key airbase Fighting intensified in Yemen yesterday around the strategic southern airbase of al-Anad, 40km north of Aden, with northern forces again claiming victory and southern troops insisting that they retained control. The battle for al-Anad could decide the fate of Aden, according to military analysts. Although the southern air force could deploy to other bases, the fall of al-Anad would open the way for a direct assault on Aden, or enable northern forces to lay siege to the city. President Ali Abdullah Saleh would have to decide whether to use the threat posed to Aden as a bargaining lever with southern leaders, or face the inevitably high casualties resulting from an attempt to take the city. Southern aircraft were reported to have flown repeated sorties yesterday against northern troops on the approach to al-Anad. Captain Abdul Rahim Qassem, speaking from a new rear southern defence line 18km south of the base, claimed that the northern forces were being held up outside al-Anad. 'We have control of the base. They have not entered,' he said. Southern military officials also said that fighting was raging on the Zingibar front, 55km north-east of Aden. Northern forces appeared to be preparing for an offensive from al-Anad and Zingibar. A correspondent for Reuters reported southern soldiers as saying that the northern troops were attacking in waves. 'They come like human waves. We spray them with our guns but they keep coming back. They look like as if they are drugged. They do not stop when we fire, they keep coming,' said one soldier. Northern shells were hitting areas 22km north of Aden, the closest so far to the city. Arab League mediators said on their return to Cairo from Yemen that northern leaders had rejected their calls for a ceasefire and insisted that their southern rivals should surrender. Mr Mohammad Said al-Bereqdar, the league's assistant secretary-general, said Mr Saleh opposed any ceasefire which allowed his southern opponents to regroup and reinforce their armies. The north was also demanding the surrender of southern leader Ali Salem al-Baidh and seven of his senior officials. The Arab League delegation had been unable to visit southern Yemen during its four-day visit to the country because of the fierce fighting which has raged since war broke out on May 4.</p>

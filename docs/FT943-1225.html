			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (3): A clear exit route is vital - Outsourcing / Disadvantages It is easy to view outsourcing as a panacea, the means to shrug off the tiresome responsibility of running an IT operation parallel to the core business. But hiving off a critical business function can have serious drawbacks, writes Michael Dempsey. Data is an important asset and the value of this asset often depends on confidentiality. Virgin Airways discovered to its cost that a third party cannot always be trusted to play by the book. British Airways maintained Virgin's computer booking system and BA staff accessed the Virgin data to poach customers and analyse sensitive information on route profitability. Then there is the risk of over-reliance. It is absolutely vital to ensure that any outsourcing or facilities management (FM) contract contains a clear exit route. This should be one that suits the customer, not the supplier. Lawyers practising in the area recommend regular review periods and caution against contracts that lock the customer in for five or 10 years. Jane Rawlings is a solicitor specialising in computer law at City law firm Charles Russell. She wrote the FM contract that retail giant Next used to employ IBM. She is adamant that outsourcing contracts only make sense if the customer enters into the deal with his eyes open. 'You must set up exit plans; describe the responsibilities of the outsourcing provider.' Employees are a potential pitfall. If the IT operation is taken back in-house, the customer can wind up gaining staff it never wanted in the first place. 'If you can't use them, then you've got to make them redundant, and that involves more costs.' Rawlings notes that some outsourcing companies insist on the transfer of software licences. Getting the legal licence to use commercial software reassigned when the outsourcing contract ends can be a nightmare. 'You should be reluctant to assign software licences to a third party. 'Most software licences prohibit sub-licencing.' PA Consulting has questioned a large number of businesses on their views about outsourcing. The companies responding to the IT Sourcing Survey, due to be published in October, represent Pounds 500m of outsourcing contracts. It emerges that worries about the impact on personnel who are transferred from the customer to the outsourcing client abound. Of the respondents, 43 per cent are very concerned about possible damage to staff morale. This dilemma has eclipsed the question of over-dependence on the supplier. Maintaining the quality of the service came next, with 38 per cent of respondents citing this as a negative factor in the outsourcing equation. Then there is lack of flexibility. John Little, an IT partner at PA who compiled the survey, notes that among the 25 per cent of companies who are determined to reject outsourcing and bring IT back in-house, one lesson was clear. 'The message coming out is that companies are willing to consider abandoning outsourcing because suppliers are failing to deliver on the partnership.'</p>

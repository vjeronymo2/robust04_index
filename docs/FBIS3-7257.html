Not only does the action completely undermine the Thai  military's contention that it no longer supports the reviled  guerrilla group but it has also exposed the country to  accusations of human rights abuses and international  condemnation.    The reaction from Phnom Penh, with which ties are already  strained, was swift and not surprisingly bitter.    "It is a human rights abuse from some people or Thai  authorities, and I would like to say clearly that (Cambodia is)  not happy about this," Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut  stated on Saturday.    Sirivut, who is due in Bangkok today to discuss the  repatriation, hinted that Phnom Penh would now review earlier  pledges to extend timber and gem contracts in the Pailin area  and return seized mining and logging equipment.    The foreign minister also called on the "international  community to look very carefully" at the Thai action and  Bangkok's refusal to allow the UN or other aid organizations to  go to the sites where the refugees are being held.    The world community, which just last month pledged an  additional $770 million to rebuild Cambodia, can only be  expected to react with disapproval to a move that will be  perceived as prolonging the fighting.    The Cambodian army's attack on the former Khmer Rouge  stronghold coincided with a propaganda offensive by the Thai  military to convince a skeptic world that it no longer supports  the guerrillas. Thai military officers who built up close  contacts with the Khmer Rouge during the resistance war against  the Vietnamese-backed government in the 1980s, have been accused  of maintaining and profiting from the relationship after the  guerrilla group took over the gem and timber-rich border zones  around Pailin in 1989.    Following a call from the United States for Thailand to show  it had cut its links with the group, the military arranged for  journalists to tour the border two weeks ago. A second press  tour of the villages where the refugees had taken shelter was  arranged on Friday but then abruptly cancelled. Instead, the  army sealed off the area, denying diplomats, journalists and  officials from the UN and International Red Cross access to the  refugees. At the same time reports began to emerge that the  military had begun repatriating refugees, many against their  will, despite an agreement with Phnom Penh to discuss and plan  the return of the Cambodians.    In the ensuing news black out, unconfirmed reports claimed  that the military may have culled out the young and able-bodied  men among the refugees and repatriated them first by truck, to  the Khmer Rouge-controlled zone of Phnum Malai.    Asked to explain the government's actions, spokesman Aphisit  Wetchachiwa, cited the long refugee burden Thailand had carried  and told AFP "we think what we have done is appropriate."    If denying refugees, many of whom were not only fleeing the  fighting but also the Khmer Rouge, international security  guarantees and forcing them back to areas they fear, can be  considered "appropriate" neighbourly behaviour it is obviously  going to take a long time before relations between Thailand and  Cambodia reach a level of mutual respect.    Ever since 1979 when more than 30,000 Cambodians died after  the Thai military forced them off steep cliffs along the border  and into mine fields, the lack of respect officials have shown  for the lives and welfare of Cambodia refugees has been a  national shame.    In a small but telling irony, while independent observers  and  international aid agencies were denied access to the refugees  over the weekend, Thai traders were allowed to profit handsomely  selling food supplies to the refugees in return for jewellery  and gold.    Once again, the image Thailand has presented to the world  has  been of conspicuously sleazy border traders enriching themselves  under the administration of the military and off Cambodian  refugees caught up in a murky political game.    As of yesterday, many of the refugees were still waiting to  be sent home. There is still time to admit that the  repatriation was undertaken with undue haste and to negotiate  for the Cambodians to return under conditions that are  acceptable to Thailand, Phnom Penh and the United Nations. The  decision to send the refugees back was most likely taken under a  dated Cold War reflex that seems to afflict many of our senior  foreign ministry and security officials and not out of avarice  or any intention to keep the Khme Rouge alive.    But while some people in Bangkok may believe that as long as  refugees are being involuntarily pushed into Khmer Rouge-held  areas, Thailand's blighted international reputation is not going  to improve.</p>

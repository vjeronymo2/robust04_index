			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Recovery 'falling into place' Conditions for a Japanese recovery are falling into place, but considerable adjustments are still needed, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the central bank, said yesterday. Mr Mieno, the latest of several senior officials to suggest Japan's worst post-war recession has reached its trough, said private consumption was improving and industrial output was expected to recover in the first quarter of this year, breaking a 28-month decline. Many private-sector economists believe the economy touched bottom in the final quarter of last year, when gross domestic product fell 2.2 per cent compared with the same period in 1992. Government forecasters are more cautious, saying an improvement early last year only proved to herald a double-dip recession. Mr Mieno warned that encouraging statistics, such as an upturn in business confidence, might be merely seasonal and heavy industrial overcapacity would slow growth for some time. Continuing labour market weakness, highlighted by yesterday's low wage offers, was another dampener on demand, he said.</p>

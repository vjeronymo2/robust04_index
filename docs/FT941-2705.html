			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Washington's new ticket avoids showdown / Plotting a route through what is still challenging turbulence between American and foreign air carriers The US government has averted a showdown with two of its main European allies on aviation policy by renewing British Airways' ticket code-sharing rights with USAir and approving a similar agreement between Lufthansa of Germany and United Airlines, But the decisions, taken after a week of hectic meetings in Washington, have failed to resolve the underlying tensions in aviation relations between the US and other industrialised countries. As a reminder of the continuing difficulties and tensions in international aviation, Japan yesterday said it would shorten the licence period for US airlines on trans-Pacific routes to Japan from one year to six months, in retaliation for a US decision to postpone approval for a Japan Airlines service to Honolulu. The US is also in dispute with Australia over airline services and continues to have no bilateral air service agreement with France, following the French government's earlier decision to renounce its aviation pact with the US. South-east Asian carriers have also warned the US they are considering formation of their own airline bloc to protect their aviation interests, unless they can secure similar rights to US airlines both in the Asia-Pacific regional market and the US domestic market. Mr Cheong Choong Kong, chairman of the Orient Airlines Association and managing director of Singapore Airlines, recently called for fairer conditions in US aviation relations with Asia, especially since the Asian market was expected to overtake the domestic US market in size by the end of the century. 'It seems to be the US against the rest', one US airline executive said. The heightened tensions between the US and other industrialised countries are in large part the result of a new breed of big US carriers seeking to exploit far more vigorously the historical aviation rights which the US had secured, in both the European and Asian markets, after the second world war. These traditional rights had been held by the now defunct Pan American Airlines and TWA. These airlines have now been superseded by American Airlines, United and Delta Airlines, which have been aggressively seeking to expand their international reach, using existing US international aviation traffic rights as well as pressing their government to negotiate even greater access to foreign markets. In an increasingly global and liberalised airline market, both European and Asian flag carriers have in return asked for more access to the US market. The most significant dispute, however, has involved the bilateral aviation relations between the US and the UK, whose trans-Atlantic routes are the busiest in the world. The ultimate outcome of the protracted negotiations between Washington and London is seen as likely to set a pattern for other aviation agreements with the US, which now accounts for about 40 per cent of the western air travel market. Both the US and the UK are committed to airline liberalisation. But, while advocating 'open skies' and open trade relations, the governments of both countries have had to contend with the conflicting interests of their respective airlines and have been reluctant to make any significant concessions to break the current deadlock. The issue has been further complicated by the two countries' different interpretations of what 'open skies' entails. Simply put, the US has offered the UK 'open skies' across the Atlantic but not in its domestic market. The UK, in turn, has offered the US more access into the UK market but not at Heathrow in London, the world's busiest international airport. In return for allowing United Airlines and American Airlines to replace Pan American and TWA at Heathrow in 1991, the UK secured code-sharing rights for British carriers in the US. BA subsequently exercised these rights after forging a partnership with USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier, in which it invested Dollars 400m (Pounds 268m) via a 24 per cent stake. The US airlines claimed that this was, in the words of American, 'a lousy deal' for them in that it gave BA access to their market without similar benefits for US carriers at Heathrow. The UK has insisted, though, that any additional access for US carriers to Heathrow would depend on the US granting more opportunities for UK airlines in the US market, either by allowing them to acquire bigger stakes in US carriers or by possibilities to serve additional US domestic destinations. Some US airlines then pressed Washington to renounce the existing aviation agreement with the UK and withdraw BA's code-sharing rights with USAir. At the end of the day, the US administration decided to avoid an all-out confrontation by renewing, on Thursday night, BA's existing code-sharing rights for a full year, while expressing extreme disappointment with the lack of progress in the negotiations. The two countries last year had hoped to reach a broad agreement on liberalisation by the end of April 1994. It seems highly unlikely that they will meet this target. Both sides yesterday said they had no plans to resume talks. In their absence, the stand-off continues, with the rest of the air transport industry anxiously watching. The ultimate stakes are significant. An agreement would pave the way for even broader liberalisation in international air transport. Failure would fuel all the old protectionist instincts of the airline industry.</p>

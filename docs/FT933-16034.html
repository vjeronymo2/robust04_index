			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Observer: Clark versus Clarke The debate over the rundown of Britain's coal industry seems to be getting rather personal. Neil Clarke, British Coal's chairman, has fallen out with one-time ally Michael Clark, Tory MP for Rochford who used to chair the now-disbanded energy committee. The tiff dates back to a previous parliamentary coal debate at the end of March when the MP made some controversial comments about the motivations of some British Coal managers in the run-up to privatisation. The suggestion was that some of them were out to make the corporation as profitable as possible in the hope of benefiting personally in the event of it being privatised through a management buy-out. Hardly, a life and death matter. But letters were exchanged with chairman Clarke threatening to sue if the suggestions were repeated outside parliament. With MP Clark apparently unrepentant, the situation has since escalated with the chairman vetoing the MP's presence on a proposed day out to the Selby coalfield next September by the all party energy studies group. 'The chairman was concerned that Dr Clark might not be given the best of receptions in the coalfield,' British Coal said yesterday. Not good enough, say the MP's fellow energy students, who are now refusing to visit Selby without him.</p>

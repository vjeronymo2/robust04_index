			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / World Commodities Prices: Coffee futures break resistance to reach three-month highs - Market report London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures climbed to the highest levels since mid-December yesterday and some traders suggested a test of resistance at last year's highs might be on the cards. The May position broke through resistance at Dollars 1,250 a tonne early on and that attracted fresh speculative purchases, notably by investment funds. 'The buying came from all over this afternoon,' said one dealer. 'It's all looking quite positive.' He did not rule out an assault on the Dollars 1,300 level. Others were less bullish, confining their short term projections to a test of the next band of resistance between Dollars 1,280 and Dollars 1,288 a tonne, where fresh producer sales of coffee were thought likely. COCOA futures also ended the day firm, although they still showed little sign of breaking free of the recent trading range. Base metal prices were largely on the defensive at the London Metal Exchange. Sellers had the upper hand, dealers said, and downside chart points were coming under threat by the close. COPPER'S retreat from Dollars 1,920 in the morning left the market vulnerable after lunch, and although signs of nearby supply tightness remained the three months delivery price closed Dollars 6.25 down at Dollars 1,908.50 a tonne.

The bulk of earnings growth came from property sales, which contributed HKDollars 951m to operating profit, up from HKDollars 645m in 1991. Rental income showed a slight decline, due to the sale of several floors of the Convention and Exhibition Centre, in Wanchai. However, average occupancy stood at 95 per cent. The company declared an interim dividend of 25 cents per share, up from 21 cents in 1991.</p>

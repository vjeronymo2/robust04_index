			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on interview with Jan Eliasson, </F> chairman of the CSCE Minsk Conference on Nagorno-Karabakh, by  unidentified ITAR-TASS correspondent: "J. Eliasson in Favor of  Joint Actions"]    [Text] Jan Eliasson (Sweden), chairman of the CSCE Minsk  conference on Nagorno-Karabakh, has expressed support for close  collaboration between the CSCE and the CIS in settling the  Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.    "At the present stage, I think it is essential to  consolidate  the state of cease-fire in accordance with the commitments,  which the sides have undertaken," he stated in an interview with  an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the eve of his trip to the crisis  region, which begins this week. The cease-fire, J. Eliasson  believes, should be accompanied by specific measures. It is  necessary to try to form an observer group with the  participation of both the CSCE and the CIS, so that the  observers can work together as closely as possible.    "I hope that we will be able to take other steps too,  including the withdrawal of troops, the removal of obstacles to  transportation, the return of refugees, and the establishment of  military and political guarantees," the chairman of the Minsk  conference noted. "It is exceptionally important that we take  measures now, otherwise the risk of an escalation of the  conflict will be great. Joint actions on our part are extremely  important."    J. Eliasson sees the task of his forthcoming trip to the  conflict zone as trying to "stabilize" as far as possible the  cease-fire situation, which is to be monitored by CSCE and CIS  representatives. He intends to hold meetings with "all  leaders." It is proposed that the visit will last one week.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Brussels stands by to repel boarders THE European Community should be tougher towards foreigners wanting to enter the EC, but tenderer to immigrants already settled there, according to a Brussels document for discussion by foreign ministers later this month. The paper, which the Commission is expected to approve formally next week, talks of a rising tide of immigration from the Mediterranean and eastern Europe. But its recommendations hardly amount to the Fortress Europe policy feared by human right groups. 'The question is no longer how to stop immigration, but rather to influence it in a positive way,' it says. Apart from suggesting that the 12 EC states should harmonise their controls on illegal immigration and procedures for dealing with people 'shopping' around the Community for asylum, the thrust of the Commission's external policy recommendations is to increase the economic incentives for neighbouring populations to stay put. Aid from the EC budget and individual member states should be targeted at providing work for those most likely to migrate to the EC - the illiterate poor in the cities of the south, and the professionals who create a brain drain from developing countries by moving to the EC. The association agreements that are being re-negotiated with Mediterranean and east European countries this year should deal specifically with migration policy. On the internal front, the Commission suggests that immigrants who retain third country nationality, but are legally established in the Community, should no longer be denied the freedom to travel or the access to national or EC social benefits that EC citizens have. The Twelve are shortly expected to ratify a convention that will pave the way for a common tourist visa for third country nationals. This will create a ridiculous situation, said an EC official yesterday, in which 'an Ethiopian visitor, for instance, will be able to swan around the Community on one visa, whereas a longtime, legal Algerian resident of France will continue to need a visa for each of the other 11 EC countries he might want to visit'.</p>

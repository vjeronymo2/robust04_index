			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Management: Creating a ship shape industry - How a Norwegian shipbuilder plans to bring the Warnow yard in east Germany back to life Towering over the Warnow shipyard in the east German state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern stands a large cable crane, a monument to the big is beautiful school of communist management. Driven by up to 24 women operators in cabins suspended across the Baltic skyline, the crane can hoist 50,000 tonnes of steel. Workers still marvel at its size and power, though the truth is that its technology was out of date the day it arrived in 1955. For Otto Soberg, the cable crane is a reminder of the scale of his management challenge. A well-groomed, confident, 36-year-old, he is the new chief executive installed by Kvaerner, the Norwegian shipbuilder, to turn round Warnow, near the town of Rostock. Shipbuilding is the sole industry in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a rural region which ranks among the poorest in Germany. Largely created in 1945 to build ships for the former Soviet Union as part of war reparations, the industry was left to fend for itself after the initial post-second world war investment. For Kvaerner, Warnow offers a chance to take advantage of cheap labour costs, consolidate its position in the Baltic and place a long-term bet on Germany pulling off unification. In his spartan office near the shipyard gates - 'The old management wasn't close enough to the workforce,' he says, apparently without irony - Soberg spent two hours last month spelling out his company's plans. In the process, he is clearly trying to develop management techniques appropriate to a post-Communist society. The first step, he says, is to do the 'dirty work'. In 1993, he intends to cut the labour force by 70 per cent. From a peak of 5,900 workers in 1990, Kvaerner aims to employ 1,900 plus 250 apprentices by 1995. The plan, agreed with Treuhand, the German government-backed investment agency, and consistent with a union agreement, aims to eliminate morale-sapping uncertainty. Kvaerner swept out the former East German management team on the day they moved in last October - a contrast with the softly-softly approach which the Norwegians adopted when it purchased the Govan shipyard in Scotland in 1988. At Govan, Kvaerner left the old management intact, appointing a technical director. Six months later, they realised their mistake and had to clean house. At Warnow, Kvaerner has retained two of the old East German management team, one in personnel and one in administration. The 'admin' post is critical in ensuring new executive orders are executed on the old shopfloor. 'Management has to establish contacts with the workforce rather than floating around in a fog,' says Soberg. The next step is to phase in the new technology which is vital to lift productivity levels. Soberg notes with satisfaction that much of the Warnow workforce is highly skilled, even by western standards: some 220 are university-educated engineers, while a further 330 are trained engineers. Kvaerner has excellent raw material, but the Norwegians are under no illusion about the time it will take for workers to cope with new computerised technology. 'If you give your grandmother a new Porsche, she will drive off the road,' says Soberg. Once again, there are hints of a different approach to Govan, where a large amount has been invested since 1988. At Warnow, Soberg is adamant there is no sense in pouring in at least DM400m (Pounds 166.6m) in new equipment until the workforce is properly trained. He jokes that sooner or later he expects his bosses in Norway to ask why little appears to be happening inside the yard in the first few months. During a stroll round the 900,000 sq ft shipyard, Soberg points with satisfaction to workers wearing the yellow Kvaerner hard-hats and operating western welding technology with unbridled enthusiasm. 'These people have pride in their job,' he says. Yet the physical challenge in making Warnow work is daunting. Some 1,700 tonnes of scrap was recovered in the yard in the first few weeks; energy costs are four times higher than at Govan and most of the equipment has not been replaced in 40 years. The proportion of administration to production is more than three-to-one, rather than the western equivalent of one-to-one. Inefficiency has run riot. A generous Treuhand aid package provides the cushion for Kvaerner to restructure, while waiting for the investment in plant to pay off. Kvaerner  -which ranks in the world's top five companies in terms of capacity - has received DM900m alone: DM500m to cover expected losses between 1992 and 1996 and a further DM400m to finance modern technology. Still, the state aid has drawn criticism from the rest of Europe, where shipbuilding is still suffering from overcapacity. The European Commission in Brussels is watching closely to check whether the Norwegians fulfil their commitment to reduce capacity which is the pre-condition for the EC supporting the state-aid package. Soberg explains that Warnow is fundamentally changing its business. In future, ships will be fitted together in separate steel chunks or 'modules' in dock, rather than in berth - the older, inefficient method of shipbuilding. No more building in berth means no more monster cable crane. 'It is a bit of shame to tear it down,' says Soberg, 'it really ought to be a historical monument.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview granted to Chisinau television, the  ambassador of the Republic of Moldova in Moscow, Mr. Anatol  Taranu, said that the Russian Federation is promoting a  two-faced policy toward the Republic of Moldova and that the  withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army from the territory of his  country is being postponed deliberately, our correspondent  Mircea Dascaliuc reported.    The eighth round of negotiations on the terms and conditions  of the 14th Army withdrawal will not take place very soon, Mr.  Taranu also said, for the simple reason that the Russian  Federation hopes that after the 27 February elections in the  Republic of Moldova, the Chisinau Parliament will include forces  prepared to yield more easily and thus concessions may be  obtained.</p>

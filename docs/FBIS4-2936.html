			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Xianxun (1327 6343 6598)] </F>   [Text] Fuzhou, 14 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- Jia  Qinglin, secretary of the Fujian CPC Committee, today resigned  his position as governor.    The Second Session of the Eighth Fujian People's Congress  held a meeting this morning, accepting Jia Qinglin's resignation.    Jia Qinglin, 54, ssumed the offices of standing committee  member and deputy secretary of the Fujian CPC Committee when he  was transferred to Fujian in 1985. Replacing Wang Zhaoguo in  November 1990, Jia took charge of the work of the Fujian  Government and successively assumed the office of vice governor,  acting governor, and then governor in April 1991. When party  secretary Chen Guangyi was transferred to the post of Civil  Aviation Administration of China chief at the end of last year,  the CPC Central Committee appointed Jia Qinglin as party  secretary. At the meeting of leading cadres held at that time,  Jia urged his subordinates to "regard wholeheartedly serving the  people as their fundamental purpose and working for the  interests of the people as their motto." Local people say that  Jia Qinglin is honest, kind, upright, and prudent. He sets  strict demands on himself and enjoys a high reputation.    The Fujian People's Congress Standing Committee accepted  Chen  Guangyi's resignation from the office of chairman of the  people's congress on 6 April. It has been reported that the  Second Session of the Eighth Fujian People's Congress will hold  a meeting on 16 April to elect a member and chairman of the  Standing Committee of the Fujian People's Government.</p>

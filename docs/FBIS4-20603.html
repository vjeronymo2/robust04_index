			<p>System   (VIBES): Thermally Driven Flow Under Microgravity   <F P=102> 43070038C Tokyo NASDA REPORT in English Summer 1993 pp 16-17  -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY </F>  <F P=103> 43070038C </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo NASDA REPORT </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Principal Investigator Masao Furukawa, general </F> manager, Thermal and Structural Laboratory, Tsukuba Space  Center, NASDA]    [Text] Fundamental research on thermally driven gas flow;  on liquid separation technology utilizing surface tension,  evaporation and condensation technology; and on liquid transport  technology utilizing vapor pressure change in the space  environment will be conducted. Experiments to verify the  principles of these technologies are conducted in the Spacelab.    Since electric power used for spacecraft operation is  eventually converted to unnecessary heat, it is necessary to  remove the heat from the spacecraft to space through radiators.  The size and electric power consumption of future spacecraft are  expected to enlarge significantly. The distance between the heat  source and the radiators will then lengthen, and unnecessary  heat to be radiated will also increase.    Accordingly, fluid loops (called two-phase fluid loops)  utilizing latent heat of vaporization of liquid (heat absorbed  from the surroundings when a matter changes its phase from  liquid to vapor; the heat is ejected when the phase changes from  vapor to liquid) have been proposed for the temperature control  inside spacecraft and heat transport from the heat sources  inside spacecraft to radiators. Japan, Europe, and the U.S.  started to conduct fluid loop research since 1980's. A two-phase  fluid loop is outlined in Figure 1. The two-phase fluid loop  consists of the following components:    (1) Cold Plate (CP) for absorbing heat and vaporizing the  fluid;    (2) Pump to send the liquid to Radiator CP in order to emit  the heat to space and condense the vapor;    (3) Accumulator to control the inner pressure of the  two-phase fluid loop;    (4) Liquid and vapor paths connecting the above;    (5) Control system.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-58A>      Figure 1. Flow Pattern in Residual Gravity </FIG>     The CP receives heat from the equipment installed on it from  a pump and uses the heat to vaporize the liquid sent to it. The  vapor absorbs unnecessary heat as latent heat of vaporization,  is transported to the radiator, and condensed by radiating heat  to space. The vapor then returns to the liquid phase. The CP  temperature approaches the liquid vaporization temperature which  in turn depends on the inner pressure of the two-phase fluid  loop. Accordingly, the CP temperature can be managed by  controlling the inner pressure of the loop with the accumulator.  The accumulator controls the inner pressure of the two-phase  fluid loop by transferring the liquid to or from the two-phase  fluid loop.    A thermally driven accumulator will be used in the two-phase  fluid loop undergoing research by the National Space Development  Agency of Japan (NASDA). The liquid inlet and outlet section  have a capillary structure and are designed to collect only  liquid there. Fine grooves are engraved on the accumulator's  inner wall to help form a thin liquid film. Vaporization of the  liquid film or condensation of the vapor on the grooved section  can be accomplished by heating or cooling the accumulator. This  controls the inner pressure of the accumulator, and the liquid  in the accumulator is driven. The experiment in IML-2 is to  verify the principle of thermal drive using the principle model  of the accumulator called the Thermally Driven Flow Unit (TDFU).    The principle of the TDFU is shown in Figure 2. The TDFU  consists of two steel vessels with an observation window, two  thermoelectric elements (elements for converting electric energy  to thermal energy and vice versa; they are heated or cooled  depending on the direction of electric current) for heating and  cooling the vessels, and a heat sink which smooths heat input to  and output from the thermoelectric elements. The inner wall of  each vessel is grooved, and the two vessels are connected with a  tube to facilitate liquid movement. The inner part of the vessel  consists of two sections. One section is the capillary structure  on the connecting tube side of the vessel; the other is the  hollow section on the opposite side. Distilled water is used as  the working fluid. The gas and liquid in the vessel are  separated due to the higher affinity of the vessel inner surface  for gas than for liquid (difference of wettability) and tendency  of liquid of larger surface tension to collect in the capillary  structure section. In microgravity, wettability and capillary  force play important roles in controlling liquids in gas-liquid  separation.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-59A>      Figure 2. Experiment Vessel of CDU </FIG>     When an electric current is applied to the thermoelectric  elements, one vessel is heated while the other is cooled. The  inner pressure of the vessel heated increases due to the  vaporization of liquid, and the inner pressure of the vessel  cooled decreases due to the condensation of the vapor. The  liquid moves from the heated side to the cooled side due to the  pressure difference thus produced.    The experiment is conducted with the VIBES's vibration  isolation mechanism on and off. The gas and liquid conditions in  the vessels are observed and recorded to understand and confirm  the principle of thermally driven flow.    The results obtained from this experiment will not only be  reflected in the design of two-phase fluid loop accumulators but  is also expected to be applicable to fundamental technology for  space development, such as energy technology, thermal control  technology, environmental control technology, and liquid  transport.</p>

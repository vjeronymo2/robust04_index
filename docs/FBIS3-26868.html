In the areas  affected by arsenical poisoning, the incidences of ascites due  to cirrhosis, skin cancer, and lung cancer are very high.  Patients suffering from chronic arsenical poisoning mainly live  in Jiaole Village (formerly Jiaole Township), Yuzhang Town,  Xingren County; and Dadi Village, Bayou Village, and Xiaogeduo  Village under Xingyi City; as well as Anlong County's Haizi  Township and Getang Town. The incidence of disease in Xingyi  City and Xingren County has reached 17.28 percent, whereas in  Anlong County a new affected area was discovered in the second  half of 1993, and experts estimated that the incidence of  disease there would surpass 17.28 percent.    Over the past few years, governments at various levels and  the relevant departments have adopted measures time and again:  Closing down some coal pits, banning coal mining in some  districts, distributing medicine to people, and modifying their  cooking stoves, thereby controlling arsenical poisoning to  certain extent. However, the problem is still a very serious,  as well as urgent one, which merits further attention from the  authorities and various quarters of society.</p>

The  elections went ahead despite various rumors and propaganda by  extreme nationalists against participation in the vote.  According to preliminary information, the voters of  Almetyevskiy and Nizhnekamskiy electoral okrugs demonstrated the  greatest turnout -- over 59 percent of those entered on the  lists.    Speaking on republic television last Friday, Mintimer  Shaymiyev stated that the situation has changed sharply since  the day of the previous elections to the Russian parliament, in  which only 13.8 percent of the republic's adult population  participated. "Russia and Tatarstan have concluded an  interstate treaty which has been approved by the people," he  stressed. "And the republic must have its representatives in  the Russian parliament."

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "m.t.l.": "Italian Social Movement Attacks </F> `Nullified Osimo'"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- There is uncertainty and concern among  the forces of the majority and accusations of "irresponsibility"  from the opposition. Mirko Tremaglia's loud remarks about the  "nullification" of the Osimo Treaty and the review of the  eastern borders caused a bit of a storm. [passage omitted]    On Wednesday [27 April], the European Commission will  discuss  the framework within which the negotiations for Slovenia's  association are to be approached. This is only the beginning of  the procedure, but Tremaglia took the opportunity to ask that:  1) the government intervene vis-a-vis the Italian commissioners  in Brussels; 2) Osimo be rediscussed, including the borders  issue.    "I believe that the move from historic revisionism to border  revisionism is a particularly harmful game of chance," said  Beniamino Andreatta, who yesterday handed over the job of  foreign minister to Leopoldo Elia. "Revisionism concerning  Italy's eastern borders also includes an inducement for  revisionism concerning the eastern borders of Germany. My line  has been to accelerate the process of integrating Central Europe  into the European Union. To now put ourselves forward like the  bandits of Radicofani [medieval border between Grand Duchy of  Tuscany, Papal States] laying in wait for Slovenia's passage  into Europe seems to me to be a little rough."    [Correspondent] However, you too made it understood that  Italian consent...    [Andreatta] I too used the European prospect to induce  Slovenia to abandon its protectionist laws. However, trying to  link the revision of borders to the question of our veto, which  is technically possible, means condemning Italy to complete  isolation. Italy would then become a sort of Greece, which has a  problem with Macedonia that no one understands.    [Correspondent] What would you propose for the immediate  situation?    [Andreatta] I think that the European Commission's attention  could be drawn to the fact that negotiations are under way  (between Italy and Slovenia -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note), and  it could ask the parties to reach a conclusion, especially one  which respects minorities. However, these are people who want  to show that they have arrived, and so they now have to make a  big fuss. I wonder whether Europe can survive the arrival on  the scene of new parties which do not have the patience or sense  to make compromises on the foundations upon which Europe is  built. [Andreatta ends]    The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] has also attacked the  proposal with the person responsible for foreign affairs, Piero  Fassino ("the right has thrown down the mask") and with  Secretary Achille Occhetto, according to whom Tremaglia's  proposals are "evidence of just how irresponsible this majority  is."    There are also problems within the alliance. Forza Italia's  official for foreign affairs, Livio Caputo, is putting a hold on  the border issue and reiterating the need to have the matter  "tackled together vis-a-vis the Community partners."    League floor leader Roberto Maroni played down the matter:  "This is an issue that does not concern me."    [Correspondent] However, your allies have talked about it.    [Maroni] The question of government action is not being  raised. Everyone is free to think what they want. There are  those who support Inter and those who support Milan [soccer  teams]. Within five or 10 years we will have the Europe of  regions, and the border issue will be irrelevant. [Maroni ends]    However, the "critical League member," Franco Rocchetta,  feels that the Osimo Treaty "must surely be revised, since it  was drafted when Italy was in a period of psychological and  political subjection." What about borders? "Any border can be  changed, even though the price is always high or extremely  high." Decidedly critical, Marco Taradash (of the Pannella  List) said: "Any desire to review borders is an anachronism."  As for the veto, "the decision will have to be entrusted to the  next foreign minister and left up to his discretion."</p>

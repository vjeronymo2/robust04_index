			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Serbian President  Slobodan Milosevic today received the special envoy of Russian  President Boris Yeltsin and held lengthy and open talks with him.    According to the cabinet of President Milosevic, the latest  developments in the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina were discussed, as well as the positive  developments in the negotiations between Knin and Zagreb.    President Milosevic stressed that the bombardment of Serb  positions around Gorazde had shattered the delusion about the  international community's unbiased attitude to the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The so-called Bosnia-Herzegovina army's  offensive has been going on for weeks before the eyes of the  entire world public whereas the United Nations has done nothing  to stop this offensive except for placid warnings. On the  contrary, Gorazde as a protected zone has been used as a  bridgehead for an offensive against the Serb positions. By  intervening with its air force, the United Nations has  undoubtedly taken part in the civil war on the side of the  Muslims, something that should undoubtedly be condemned as it  seriously dents the reputation of the United Nations in its  capacity as a mediator in the peace process. In President  Milosevic's view, in order to overcome the crisis that has  emerged it is necessary to settle for peace without prejudicing  a political solution instead of escalating military operations  and then -- in a situation marked by the absence of armed  conflicts -- finish political negotiations.    As far as the negotiations between Knin and Zagreb are  concerned -- during the course of which the Russian side played  an undoubtedly constructive role -- President Milosevic  expressed support for further negotiations while expressing  satisfaction with the successful implementation of the agreement  on the cessation of all hostilities between the army of the  republic of Serb Krajina and the Croatian Army. President  Milosevic also stressed that his personal contacts with  President Martic of Krajina had convinced him of the Krajina  leadership's constructive attitude and their sincere desire to  overcome the crisis through negotiations. However, the next  phase of negotiations that should follow the normalization of  economic relations raises in itself the problem of sanctions,  which at the moment poses the largest obstacle to the success of  the negotiations.    It is beyond doubt that all factors interested in peace and  in ending the crisis want the economic and traffic links between  Knin and Zagreb to be reestablished through negotiations, but  that cannot be achieved as long as the international sanctions  -- which make such links impossible -- are being applied against  one (Serb) side. This is why the international community and the  world public will have to face the choice: Either they support  the normalization of relations and peace, or -- by keeping the  sanctions -- they insist on disrupted relations and  confrontations. In that event, the sanctions would be the  greatest obstacle to the peace process and the normalization of  relations, President Milosevic stressed, expressing his  expectance that the forces of peace and cooperation will  overpower the protagonists of the war option and of prolonging  the crisis.    Today's talks between President Milosevic and Vitaliy  Churkin  were also attended by Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav  Jovanovic and the Russian Ambassador to Belgrade Gennadiy Shikin.</p>

At a 24 December news conference, Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa apologized to the public for his  failure to enact the political reform bills before the end of  the year. Meanwhile, he failed to make clear-cut remarks on  economic measures and did not indicate a concrete vision for the  economy.    Most of the people understand that political reform and  economic measures are difficult issues which the Liberal  Democratic Party has left unsolved and the new coalition  administration cannot easily solve. Nevertheless, Prime  Minister Hosokawa's recent remarks were unclear and not as frank  as those made when he was inaugurated as prime minister.    If the prime minister cannot speak in his "own" words, the  public support rate for his administration will continue to  drop. Amid the economic recession, this is a chilly situation.    At the news conference, the prime minister first mentioned  economic pump-priming measures. Most of the people must have  strained their ears when the prime minister was explaining six  economic measures after stating that he "was seriously concerned  about the current economic situation." However, he did not  refer to income tax reduction -- which is considered to be the  most important issue at this point -- until the last of the six  measures. Moreover, the prime minister did not indicate a  concrete scale or timing for implementing income tax cuts.    As the first five measures, the prime minister cited the  following: promoting deregulation in areas that will produce  immediate results; compiling a third supplementary budget for  the current fiscal year in consideration of improvement of  living conditions as well as promotion of research and  development activities; helping those concerned with agriculture  or small industries; implementing a total employment assistance  program; and devising measures that will increase the liquidity  of land. All of these are nothing new. Moreover, a package of  those economic measures will have no great impact on the current  economy. We cannot help wondering whether the prime minister  has recognized the current situation of the worst post-war  recession in which the supply-and-demand gap has reached 30  trillion yen.    It has been said that the prime minister is considering a  plan to reduce income tax by more than 6 trillion yen. However,  at the news conference, the prime minister showed a cautious  stance, stating that income tax cuts will be decided "in  consideration of Tax Commission recommendations and the Hiraiwa  [chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations of Japan,  Keidanren] Economic Reform Council report," and that "the  decision should not be made hastily and the decision will be  made by the time the fiscal 1994 budget is compiled."    The prime minister's remarks made after fall seem to reflect  the complicated management of the coalition of seven parties and  one parliamentary group. It seems that in the field of economic  policies, the prime minister has been strongly influenced by the  Finance Ministry, which places importance on financial balance.  It is regrettable that the prime minister's lilting actions  have begun to make a poor show.    What we strongly hope for the prime minister is to  positively  fulfill the leadership from his position as the highest  politician. We hope the prime minister will play a more positive  role in coordinating opinions within the coalition  administration. When the leader serves as Kuroko [a Kabuki  stagehand dressed in black to be inconspicuous, who assists  actors in various ways during the performance], it is impossible  to consolidate the unity of the coalition administration. Under  the current circumstances, it is unforgivable to delay carrying  out political reform.    The serious, prolonged economic recession remains at the  bottom. All possible measures should be taken to pull the  sluggish economy from the bottom. The prime minister said: "We  cannot choose the easy way of issuing deficit-covering national  bonds." If that is the case, the prime minister should clarify  what measures can be taken to secure revenue sources for  implementing income tax cuts.    While the prime minister is considering ideas of "making  1994  the first year for promoting deregulation" or of "setting up an  economic measures council for dealing with revenue sources for  tax cuts," actual business activities are being conducted to  seek the way out of the recession. As a matter of course, the  political vacuum is unforgivable. We would like the prime  minister, in his capacity as the top politician, to clearly  indicate his own scenario for carrying out political reform and  revitalizing the economy.</p>

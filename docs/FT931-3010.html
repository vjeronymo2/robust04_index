			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Definition of beer and some wines to widen - Excise duties This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. AN EXTENSION of the definitions of beer and sparkling wine is among measures proposed to comply with European single market rules on excise duties. The definition of beer will be extended to cover all beer exceeding 0.5 per cent alcohol by volume (ABV) and any product containing a mixture of beer with non-alcoholic drinks, Customs and Excise said. However, for beer between 0.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent ABV no duty will be payable. All movements of beer within the EC, whatever strength, will be governed by the same control arrangements. The definition of sparkling wine will be extended to include wine in any bottle having a mushroom stopper held in place by ties or fastenings, regardless of the pressure. Previously, wine in mushroom stopper bottles was not dutied as sparkling wine if the pressure was below 1.5 bars. No known current products are affected. The limit up to which wine and made-wine may be strengthened by adding additional alcohol will be set at 22 per cent ABV. This proposal aligns the fortification levels for wine and made-wine. Previously it had been permissible for wine to be strengthened up to 23 per cent ABV but no known current products are affected. The blending or mixing of alcoholic products to produce a dutiable alcoholic product for sale is being restricted to taking place within premises approved as tax warehouses, unless Customs directs otherwise. The effect is to ensure that the correct rate of duty is paid on the finished product. This measure does not extend to drinks mixed at the point of sale, such as cocktails in pubs or cocktail bars. Wine and made-wine with a strength of more than 22 per cent ABV will be dutied at the same rate per degree of alcohol as spirits. The definition of methylated spirits, which are exempt from excise duty, will be extended to include spirits denatured to other member states' requirements, provided they have EC approval. With the exception of the change to duty payable on alcoholic drinks with a strength over 22 per cent (which takes effect from Budget day) all other provisions take effect from royal assent. The beer end-product duty rate will be Pounds 10.45 per hectolitre per one per cent of alcohol by volume when the new system is brought into effect on June 1 1993. The chancellor also proposed to repeal the provisions allowing drawback (refund of duty) on beer deposited in an excise warehouse. The repeal will come into effect on September 1 1993. With the introduction of beer end-product duty, these provisions are no longer necessary as it will be possible for beer to move to an excise warehouse without payment of excise duty. It is intended to repeal the existing drawback (refund of duty) arrangements for beer going to the Isle of Man. The provisions will be brought into effect when agreement is reached between the UK and Isle of Man governments on making beer duty a shared revenue.</p>

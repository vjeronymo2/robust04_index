			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PITT ENSURES BOSTON COLLEGE'S SHORT STAY;  </P> <P> BIG EAST: PANTHERS ROLL IN TOURNAMENT ELIMINATION GAME AND EARN RIGHT TO FACE  SYRACUSE IN TODAY'S QUARTERFINALS.  </P> <P> When the Big East tournament resumes today it will do so without ninth-seeded  Boston College, which played its elimination game Thursday night against  Pittsburgh as if the team bus was warmed, ready and conveniently parked near a  Madison Square Garden exit door.  </P> <P> This was a team in search of an off-season, not a victory. The Eagles began the  year with one conference victory, and they ended it that way, too, losing,  88-70, to a Pittsburgh team considered a dangerous underachiever.  </P> <P> "We're done," said Boston College Coach Jim O'Brien, as he dashed into the  chilly New York night. "And to be perfectly frank with you, I'm sure the kids  are happy it's over. Praise the Lord, see you later."  </P> <P> But before he left, O'Brien warned Syracuse -- Pitt's quarterfinal opponent  today -- and the rest of the Big East not to overlook the Panthers. And with  good reason.  </P> <P> Pitt's starting lineup includes four players with double-digit scoring averages  and another just two-tenths away. The Panthers finished first in the conference  in three-point percentage, second in scoring, third in free-throw percentage  and third in field goal percentage, which makes you wonder how they ended the  regular season 11-16 and 5-11 in the Big East.  </P> <P> "People will make a mistake if they underrate them," O'Brien said. "If they  don't get tired in four games, I think they can (win) it."  </P> <P> Pitt will need performances like those delivered Thursday night by guard Jason  Matthews, formerly of St. Monica High, and forward Brian Shorter, recently  named to his second consecutive all-Big East team. Matthews scored a  season-high 32 points, 24 in the second half. Shorter added 18 points and 11  rebounds.  </P> <P> "We know we need to fight like dogs," Matthews said.  </P> <P> As opposed to playing like them, which is what Pitt did for most of the season.  Picked to finish third in most Big East preseason polls, the Panthers dived  deep into the conference standings and never recovered.  </P> <P> "I think this helped us," Evans said. "We needed for our kids to get some  confidence."  </P> <P> Five Pitt players reached double figures against Boston College, which played  without leading scorer Doug Able, who was back in Boston with a suspected case  of mononucleosis. Also ailing was Eagle starting center David Hinton, who  scored 12 points while suffering from flu and an injured elbow.  </P> <P> It probably wouldn't have mattered. In their previous two meetings this season,  Pitt won by an average of 19 points.  </P> <P> Now on to the quarterfinals, where Pitt faces No. 1-seeded Syracuse, which  swept the Panthers this year. Pitt blew a late lead in the first game and lost  by two points and then was beaten by nine at Syracuse.  </P> <P> Also scheduled for today are games between Connecticut and Seton Hall, followed  by Georgetown and Providence and St. John's and Villanova.  </P></p>

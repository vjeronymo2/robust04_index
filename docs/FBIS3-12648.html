Sha'th told reporters before leaving he would talk to  British  Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd about ways to "protect the  Palestinian people and disarm Israeli settlers" after the Hebron  massacre.    He said he would travel on to Washington to meet US  Secretary  of State Warren Christopher on Friday and discuss "measures  which must be applied to guarantee security for Palestinians  before negotiations resume" with Israel.    Sha'th, an advisor to PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat, said he will  also ask the US administration to "adopt a serious position on  Jewish American groups which collect funds for extremist  settlers" to attack Palestinians.    Nabil Qassis, another PLO member involved in peace talks  with  Israel, will join Sha'th in his discussions with US officials.    A US official speaking on condition of anonymity said on  Wednesday that the United States hope the autonomy negotiations  will resume after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin visits  Washington from March 14-17.    The negotiations to launch self-rule in the Gaza Strip and  West Bank town of Jericho have been suspended since a Jewish  settler on Friday shot dead 52 Palestinian worshippers at a  mosque in the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>

Minutes before the Cuban foreign relations minister arrived  at the Protocol House of the Vietnamese Government, Cam told  PRENSA LATINA that the traditional ties of friendship and  cooperation between the Caribbean island and the Indochinese  nation received a major boost in the past 18 months.    The usually phlegmatic chief of Vietnamese diplomacy  displayed a big smile and gave Robaina a strong embrace upon his  arrival at Noi Bai Airport from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.    We know that your Asian tour has been exhausting, but we are  happy to have you here and are convinced that your stay in  Vietnam will further strengthen our bilateral ties in all areas,  Cam told Robaina.    Meanwhile, Robaina emphasized that visiting Vietnam was not  only an inescapable duty but an enormous pleasure, because it  involves an undying friendship and a mutual desire to further  advance collaboration and exchange in the economic, commercial,  and scientific-technical areas, as well as in all possible areas.    He pointed out that as a reflection of its indestructible  ties with the Asian nation, Cuba has in recent times felt the  love and solidarity from it through specific and very  significant actions.    Afterward, Robaina, accompanied by adviser Carlos Amores and  Cuban Ambassador to Vietnam Tania Maceira, started official  talks with his counterpart, Nguyen Manh Cam.    The visitor will also be greeted by Prime Minister Vo Van  Kiet, who visited Havana last July and is among the main  promoters of the expansion of ties between the two nations.    Tommorrow, the Cuban delegation will lay a wreath at the  mausoleum of national hero Ho Chi Minh and will hold a number of  meetings with Dau Ngoc Xuan, president of the State Committee  for Cooperation and Investments, and with Nguyen Cong Tan and Le  Van Triet, ministers of agriculture and food industry and of  commerce, respectively.    Robaina, a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of  Cuba, will meet with leaders of Vietnamese political and mass  organizations, which have promoted campaigns of solidarity with  the island in recent times to collect rice and school supplies.    The Cuban leader will also meet with Hong Ha, chief of the  Foreign Affairs Commission and secretary of the Communist Party  of Vietnam (CPV). On the same day Robaina will meet with CPV  Secretary General Do Muoi.    The visiting foreign minister will grant a news conference  before departing for Ho Chi Minh City on 23 March. In the  southern capital city, the delegation will meet with Vo Tran  Tri, CPV first secretary in that province, and Pham Chanh Truc,  vice president of that city's Parliament.    In Ho Chi Minh City Robaina will end his Asian tour that  started on 8 March and included Indonesia, Thailand, Laos,  Myanmar, Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam.</p>

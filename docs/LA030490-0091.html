			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> SAVING SEEDS CAN HELP PREVENT PLANT EXTINCTION  </P> <P> To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.  </P> <P>  -- Aldo Leopold  </P> <P> Ever since plants first sprouted from the primordial ooze, they have reproduced  themselves without interference from humans -- until, earlier in this century,  we started fiddling around.  </P> <P> We found that we could cross-pollinate, say, two different varieties of  cucumber -- two varieties that would never have mated on their own.  </P> <P> The hybrid children of this forced union would be unable to reproduce  themselves. Seed from the hybrid offspring would not grow up to be like the  parent plant, but would revert to one or the other grandparent -- or to  something else entirely. Its genetic code had been scrambled.  </P> <P> This tinkering proved irresistible, because we learned that these hybrids could  be made bigger and more predictable, with uniform size, color and ripening,  occasional disease resistance and even tough hides to endure transcontinental  shipping. This proved a boon to commercial farmers and home gardeners alike.  Suddenly we had dependable yields, although sometimes at the expense of taste.  </P> <P> The popularity of hybrids has made it difficult for today's home gardener to  find seeds that are open-pollinated -- those that will re-create themselves  year after year from seed produced by the plant that is gathered, saved and  sowed by the gardener. And some people feel that this is cause for alarm.  </P> <P> First, hybrid seeds are expensive, because they are often hand-pollinated. A  $1.25 packet of hybrid tomato seeds may net the gardener only 20 seeds, while a  $1.25 packet of non-hybrid seeds could yield hundreds of seeds. And since a  gardener cannot save seeds from hybrids, he must buy them again and again.  </P> <P> But the most serious objection to hybrids is that they are responsible for  reducing genetic diversity. Since a hybridizer will only use a few  open-pollinated varieties to perpetuate his hybrids, and since seed companies  like selling hybrids because they are so profitable -- recent legislation  permits them to copyright their hybrid inventions -- hundreds of varieties of  open-pollinated vegetables and fruits have disappeared.  </P> <P> According to Bill Bruneau, manager of Ecology Action's Bountiful Gardens, a  mail-order seed and gardening operation, "The more you get into hybrids, the  more you're losing that resource base you make hybrids from."  </P> <P> If a hybridizer uses open-pollinated Rutgers &amp; Pearson tomatoes to make his  hybrid, then he has no reason to grow Ace or Homestead or Beefsteak.  </P> <P> But, say the alarmists, what if Ace and Homestead and the others have  significant characteristics that will prove valuable to future food supplies?  What if, for instance, Ace is the perfect tomato for drought-stricken Ethiopia?  If we allow Ace to become extinct, those opportunities are also dead.  </P> <P> About 15 years ago, a few people began to combat this hybrid trend, and now  several organizations across the country are devoted to finding and saving  open-pollinated varieties.  </P> <P> The first, and certainly the most influential, is Seed Savers Exchange, founded  in 1975 by Kent Whealy in Decorah, Iowa.  </P> <P> Seed Savers Exchange members buy seeds from each other with the understanding  that the purchaser is then also responsible for preserving that variety. Seed  Savers Exchange is not a seed company.  </P> <P> This year, he said, "we had about 800 people that were listing varieties in our  1989 yearbook. It's made quite an impact."  </P> <P> But, Whealy added, "just because there's a listing doesn't mean that a variety  will stay around." Whealy notes that 1,271 varieties -- most perpetuated by  back-yard gardeners saving their seeds, sometimes for generations -- were  re-introduced into seed catalogues between 1984 and 1987, offsetting the 943  varieties lost in that period. But he is not complacent:  </P> <P> "I worry about commercial varieties that are being dropped." Many varieties are  carried by only one seed company and if the company discontinues a variety, it  could be lost.  </P> <P> Whealy's nonprofit organization publishes "Garden Seed Inventory," which lists,  often with descriptions, open-pollinated seeds that are available through  commercial U.S. and Canadian seed companies. It also issues an annual yearbook,  a hefty list of all the open-pollinated vegetables, fruits and herbs grown by  and available to its members.  </P> <P> There are several West Coast seed companies that sell open-pollinated seeds and  many of them specialize in old-fashioned varieties. Most of these companies are  owned by gardening missionaries. Their catalogues exhort customers to save  their own seed, to be self-reliant.  </P> <P> Still, says Bruneau, "very few gardeners grow their own seed; it's just too  easy to buy more." But by buying more seed every year, the gardener misses out  on an important step:  </P> <P> "Think how exciting it is if you are the one conservator of that plant,"  Bruneau said.  </P> <P> Craig Dremann of Redwood City Seed Co. sees an interesting parallel with Ray  Bradbury's futuristic "Fahrenheit 451," in which each individual memorized a  book in order to preserve it after the book itself was destroyed.  </P> <P> "With seeds and their preservation," Dremann says, "each individual makes a  significant contribution." It doesn't have to be a historically important  contribution. You may not be the solitary caretaker of the last Anasazi beans  (a Pueblo Indian variety that was feared lost until it was recently  rediscovered in New Mexico); you may only save Blue Lake bean seeds, a variety  far from extinct.  </P> <P> Once the process becomes familiar, most gardeners may be tempted to raise at  least one rarity, because no matter what the variety, gathering seeds casts a  spell all its own.  </P> <P> You hold the past and the future in the palm of your hand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sources of Seed  </P> <P> Nearly every seed catalogue will carry some open-pollinated seeds. If a seed is  a hybrid, a catalogue should say so. Here is a list of Western U.S. seed  companies that, except for one, carry only open-pollinated seeds:  </P> <P> Abundant Life Seed Foundation, P.O.

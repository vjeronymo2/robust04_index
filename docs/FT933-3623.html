			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Economics: UK braced for inflation indicators THIS WEEK brings a string of UK economic figures covering inflation, unemployment and manufacturing output. With many economists predicting that inflation has hit bottom, the retail prices index on Wednesday will be of particular interest. A commonly-held view among London-based analysts is that the headline rate reached a trough in June, when the inflation rose just 1.2 per cent year-on-year. In July it notched up to 1.4 per cent and the median forecast for August is 1.5 per cent. The more important underlying rate, excluding mortgage interest payments and which the Treasury aims to hold within a target range of 1 per cent to 4 per cent, is forecast to remain unchanged at 2.9 per cent. Other inflationary indicators include the producer prices index today and average earnings figures on Thursday, which are published with unemployment figures on Thursday. There are fewer figures of note in continental Europe although second quarter GDP figures for France, released on Friday, are expected to confirm that the French economy contracted, if marginally. Germany sees little action this week following the Bundesbank's move to lower key rates last Thursday. In the US the markets will spotlight August consumer prices, retail sales and industrial production. The most important economic statistics and events of the week follow.

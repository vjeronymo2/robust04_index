			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / German Greens in merger WESTERN Germany's Green party, once the strongest ecological movement in Europe, is to unite with Bundnis 90, a pro-environment group in the eastern part of the country, in a joint-party conference in May. The move is designed to regain a foothold in the federal parliament, which the west German Greens lost in the last elections after narrowly failing to get the required 5 per cent of the vote. Bundnis 90, a loose anti-communist movement allied with the east German Greens, won 5.6 per cent of the vote in eastern Germany. The marriage of convenience was welcomed by the opposition Social Democrats who hope to find a coalition partner if they gain power in Germany's next general elections, scheduled to take place at the end of 1994. But Mr Uwe Luhr, secretary-general of the liberal Free Democrats, the minority party in the government coalition, called the merger 'an act of desperation'.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LYNWOOD SCHOOLS OFFICIAL TO BE SENTENCED IN GRAND THEFT CASE  </P> <P> A Lynwood Unified School District official has pleaded no contest to felony  charges of grand theft and receiving stolen property from the school system.  </P> <P> Commodore Reid, 53, is scheduled to be sentenced April 10 by Los Angeles  Superior Court Judge J.D. Smith, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Herbert R. Lapin. The  charges carry a maximum four-year prison sentence, but under a plea agreement,  Reid can be sentenced to one year only, Lapin said.  </P> <P> Reid also will be required to make restitution to the district in an amount  still to be determined. Lapin estimated that the district lost at least $2,000  in supplies and employee time.  </P> <P> Embezzlement and conflict-of-interest charges against Reid will be dropped in  exchange for the plea agreement, Lapin said.  </P> <P> Reid, the district's director of maintenance, operations and transportation,  was accused of having on-duty school employees renovate and repair his personal  property, having a district water heater installed on his property and of  obtaining a $15,500 loan from a vendor who was doing business with the  district.  </P> <P> Reid, a nine-year district employee, was suspended after charges were filed  last April. Supt. LaVoneia C. Steele was unavailable for comment on Reid's  current status, a spokeswoman said.  </P></p>

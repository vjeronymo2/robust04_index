			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Finance and the Family: BES gets a Footsie link IT WAS only a matter of time before the fashion for linking returns to the stock market should reach the business expansion scheme. Sponsors had been talking about the idea for some time but, this week, Close Brothers was the first to launch a BES linked to the FT-SE 100 index. Like many of the recent issues, it is an assured tenancy scheme providing university accomodation. BESSA Christ's College Companies gives investors a choice of two companies in which to invest. The first offers a fixed price after five years of 115p for every 100p invested; this equates to a return of 12.8 per cent a year to a higher-rate taxpayer and 8.5 per cent to a lower rate-payer. The return is backed by cash deposits. The second will give a fixed return of 60p for each 100p invested after five years - the original net investment for a higher-rate taxpayer - with a variable return which depends on a rise in the FT-SE 100 index up to June 1998. Investors can divide their money between the two companies. Is it a good idea to choose the stock market option? The fixed return is not as competitive as similar BES assured tenancies schemes, and Close Brothers says the main attraction is the stock market link. Investors will be paid 1.85p for every 1 per cent rise in the Footsie between July 30 and June 29 1998, so the index would have to rise by at least 30 per cent over that period to better the fixed price. The average annual rise in the Footsie in the five years to July 8 was 8.7 per cent, and 11.7 per cent on a 10-year scale, so this past performance would exceed the 30 per cent rise. Gains are tax-free - but this is also true of shares held within a personal equity plan. What if the Footsie were to slide just before June 29 1998? The sponsors will take an average of the index for the previous 10 days, but that is the limit of your protection. Other issues this week include: Aegis III, a buy-back scheme sponsored by Matrix Securities which plans to raise Pounds 9m for accomodation for Coventry University. The exit price is 118p after five years. Bank of Scotland is acting as guarantor up to a maximum of Pounds 11m. Lancaster University Residences III, sponsored by Noble &amp; Co., plans to raise Pounds 3.5m for residential accommodation. The contracted exit price is 120p and the scheme carries a guarantee from the Royal Bank of Scotland. The Enlightened Tobacco Company, sponsored by Nabarro Wells, is a cigarette company dedicated to truthful tobacco marketing. The company is selling a new brand of cigarettes called 'Death' which carries a skull and crossbones against a black background on the packet. This is a highly speculative investment.</p>

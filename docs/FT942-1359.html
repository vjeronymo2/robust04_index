			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Securing Goode returns Yesterday's pensions white paper strikes a sensible balance between the security of occupational pensions and the cost to industry of providing them. The minimum solvency test will probably lead to some shift of pension fund assets from UK and overseas equities into gilts. If lower investment returns result, companies will end up contributing more to their schemes over time. Companies also have to consider the potential cost of falling foul of the solvency test, since employers will be obliged to make up the shortfall within three months of the threshold being breached. But that should not cause companies to walk away from occupational schemes. The government has defended the right of employers to claw back pension fund surpluses where schemes are over-funded. The solvency test proposed is far less stringent than the original Goode Committee proposal. Due to nifty footwork by the actuarial profession, there is no reason to expect a stampede out of equities and into gilts. Some fund managers will doubtless argue that schemes should be entirely free to pursue high-growth investment strategies in the interests of both members and employers. There is nothing in yesterday's proposals to stop younger, wealthier schemes from doing just that. But less well-endowed schemes cannot afford to take such investment risks. Heavy weightings towards UK and overseas equities are not always consistent with the degree of certainty sought by scheme members. If the balance can be righted in these cases without causing turbulence in financial markets - or driving companies away from occupational schemes - the white paper will have done its job.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Peter Csermely: "Both Fewer and Broken"] </F>   [Text] At the time of writing, we still have no final data  on the exact election results. Therefore, what I am writing now  is only valid if the quick summaries presented to us on Sunday  evening at least slightly reflect the future official results.  Thus, let us stay in the realm of supposition -- namely that the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] has achieved a landslide  victory.    Starting from this premise, and also avoiding any special  pathetic formulation, let me say quite dryly that we cannot find  an independently chosen step backward of similar proportions in  Hungarian history. By electing the MSZP, the Hungarian  population has proven that they do not deserve freedom. They do  not know what to do with it; or if they do, this is the result.  The coalition has not brought a Canaan to Hungary in four years  and, therefore, it fell due to something that it often mentioned  as inevitable -- namely that the first steps of restructuring  will be a burden to everyone. Our society did not understand  that dealing with the debt inherited from those who are now  delighted in mischief was not an empty slogan, that it is  impossible to extricate the country in one or two years from 40  years of mud, and that the long debates in Parliament, which  everyone was fed up with in the end, are natural things in a  democracy and not something that proves the inadequacy of the  legislators. No: Hungary's citizens turned away from genuine  politics and gave up the luxury of thinking, and they voted in a  way in which it appeared to them in some of their sober moments,  namely that things were better then. The MSZP deserves to  celebrate. Their deputies not only return but are brought back  on the shoulders of the dissatisfied masses. We do not need  Europe, and we spit on 1956; if one is a former policeman, so be  it. Hungary voluntarily returned to the feet of its former  masters.    This gesture shows an immeasurable moral distortion: From  its own will, our society absolved the socialists from their  moral burden of destroying this country. There are responsible  people and victims of this act. And there are people who are  both responsible and victims: the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF]. The MDF is a victim because it was unable to get closer  to the society in four years; it is also a victim because the  dream of Western European integration and NATO membership proved  to be at an unattainable distance; the MDF is a victim because  the coalition engaged in politics on a moral basis and failed;  it is a victim because it counted on the people's common sense  and, disregarding the mass media, it tried to influence the  people in a weak election campaign. I do not want to write all  this in detail again, although I should do so because the MDF is  also responsible for all of this.    The overwhelming majority of deputies in Hungary's second  freely elected Parliament will be communists. One does not yet  know much about the strategy of the old-new masters, but one can  presume that they will maintain the playful formalities of  democracy. For example, there will be other parties there: an  MDF that will succumb to the defeat and rapidly disintegrate  from within; the Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz], a party  forced to continue on a wild goose chase for another four years,  at least; the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP], a  party unable to break out of mediocrity; the Independent  Smallholders Party [FKGP], a party that so often used the  anti-communist rhetoric, with which it discredited both this  rhetoric and itself; and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ],  a party that, well, always falls on its feet. There will also  be a free press: It will not be able to cause half as much  damage as it has already caused. In view of the statements made  in the last four years, there will be no unemployment, price  increases, strikes, inflation, privatization, national  minorities living beyond our borders; and the Hungarian soccer  will flourish again. This is only natural; this is why we  reelected them.    Three out of the four Visegrad countries have collapsed. The  Czech Republic no longer has an opponent in the race to catch up  with Europe. It is true that capital -- or, using the old-new  terminology, the robbing imperialist capital -- will continue to  trickle for a while, then it will stop. We will then take up  loans -- some 22 billion, for example. And before the House  collapses on our heads, we will again hand over the government  helm and the bills to others; there will always be honest and  romantic people. Then we will again be able to relax for four  years while they play democracy. What problems could we have?    In its often-mentioned former electoral slogan, the MDF  promised a thorough cleanup. This has failed to materialize  ever since. We will get it now for sure.</p>

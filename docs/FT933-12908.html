			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / LDP rivalfactions start to move in for the kill RIVAL faction leaders are circling above Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, who is supposed to resign at a meeting today of his Liberal Democratic party to take responsibility for its loss of a parliamentary majority. The rush to replace Mr Miyazawa, who has refused to admit that he will resign, became particularly unseemly yesterday, as the ailing Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, announced that he would 'stake my life' on leading the party and the country. His comment had eerie overtones, as Mr Watanabe, whose health has clearly deteriorated in recent months, was hospitalised twice in the past year, once for a 'gallstone' problem and again for a 'cold'. He is widely reported to be suffering a far more serious illness. The bickering among the LDP's five factions suggests that the party does not realise that it has lost its grip on power and must find a coalition partner to ensure that its candidate for prime minister is chosen at an extraordinary session of parliament early next month. Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the head of the party's largest faction, also wants to be the next leader, although both he and Mr Watanabe have opposed the reform of the political system and are likely to be unacceptable to most of the LDP's potential coalition partners. Newer parties such as the Japan New party and the Japan Renewal party, itself a former LDP faction, will face criticism from members if a deal is done with an old-style LDP faction head. A more acceptable candidate would be Mr Toshiki Kaifu, who was dumped by the LDP as prime minister two years ago after proposing political reforms similar to those now being debated. An opinion poll conducted by Jiji, the Japanese news agency, found that 19 per cent of respondents preferred Mr Kaifu as the next prime minister, topping the 12.7 per cent of Mr Tsutomu Hata, the JRP leader, and the 9 per cent of Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the former finance minister. However, Mr Mitsuzuka was thought a 'desirable' prime minister by only 0.2 per cent of those surveyed, and the outspoken Mr Watanabe did a little better at 1.6 per cent. Apart from his health problems, Mr Watanabe is generally viewed as too erratic to be prime minister. See Editorial Comment</p>

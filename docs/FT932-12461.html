			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Irish Company News: Acquisitions lift Waterford Foods ACQUISITIONS pushed pre-tax profits strongly ahead for the second year running at Waterford Foods, the Irish dairy group. For 1992 profits rose 29 per cent, from IPounds 15.9m to IPounds 20.4m (Pounds 20m). Included was a five-month contribution from three dairy processing companies of Express Foods Ireland, acquired last August from Grand Metropolitan for IPounds 63m. Turnover moved up 30 per cent to IPounds 551.4m (IPounds 423.8m). Mr Stephen O'Connor, managing director, described the result as the group's 'best year ever'. He said further profits growth was anticipated for 1993, as a result of a full year's contribution from the Express acquisitions and new investments made in plant which would bring improved margins. Profit margin in 1992 improved to 5.3 per cent and that would further widen 'towards 10 per cent' as the group's focus shifted away from 'commodity products to ones with greater value-added', he said. Group borrowings more than doubled to IPounds 106m as a result of the acquisitions. Gearing now stood at 78 per cent (56 per cent), although interest cover remained at 3.3 times. Priorities for 1993 would be the consolidation of the new businesses within the group and the use of cash flow to improve gearing. On a longer time-frame of three to four years, Mr O'Connor said the group would continue to expand 'through organic growth and acquisition . . . there is substantial scope to expand in the UK and the US'. Earnings per share, before goodwill amortisation equal to 1.04p, rose 8 per cent to 10.04p (9.27p). The dividend is raised 4 per cent; a final of 1.58p makes a total of 2.73p (2.625p) on increased capital.</p>

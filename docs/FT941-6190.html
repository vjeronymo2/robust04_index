			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / 'We will regret it if we do not do something' The west will live to regret it if it lets Ukraine go down the drain, says Mr Percy Barnevik, chief executive of the international engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich. Mr Barnevik has just returned from a visit to Kiev where he held meetings with government and industry leaders. ABB, a leading supplier of energy production distribution equipment, is involved in two modest joint ventures in Ukraine and has more ambitious projects planned. The impending collapse of Ukraine's economy, now suffering hyperinflation of 50 per cent per month, presents an immense threat to the west, says Mr Barnevik. This is because Ukraine is the world's third largest nuclear power with more than 170 nuclear weapons and has the second largest standing army in Europe. He denied that his view was special pleading for contracts for ABB. 'I talk about energy not because it is ABB's business but because it is what is driving the collapse of Ukraine's economy. The cost of importing oil and gas is double the size of foreign currency earnings.' He added: 'Ukraine is not a priority country for ABB. But because of ABB, I have been able to see the situation and, as a person, I felt I should stand up and say something.' Ukraine relies on imported oil and gas for 80 per cent of its energy. But it can no longer afford to buy fuel. Two weeks ago Turkmenistan cut off supplies because Kiev had not paid an outstanding Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) bill. Earlier this week Russia threatened to do the same. Mr Barnevik said catastrophe might be averted with an immediate injection of Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn to revive the country's crippled energy supply sector plus a similarly sized fund to stabilise the currency.</p>

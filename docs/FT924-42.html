			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Banks aim for stability and a level playing field: Capital adequacy ratios The playing field for international banks is now fairly level, although there are still bumps and potholes. However, most players are too exhausted to chase the ball. That is how one senior banker described the implementation of the Basle accord on bank capital ratios, which was intended to strengthen banks' balance sheets and remove competitive disadvantages between banks from different countries. Agreed by central bankers from the Group of Ten countries in December 1987, the Basle accord on bank capital takes effect tomorrow. The field is still not completely flat, because regulators from different countries have interpreted the Basle rules differently. French banks, for example, can incorporate provisions for third world debt in their capital. Even the implementation timetable is not the same everywhere. For Japanese banks, the guidelines take effect at the end of their financial year in March. However, implementation comes when competitive distortions are less of a concern to banks than for many years - because so many banks have been forced by recession and losses in overseas markets to concentrate on domestic businesses and shy away from international competition. The origin of the accord was an informal chat in the summer of 1986 between Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, and Mr Paul Volcker, then chairman of the US Federal Reserve. They felt the internationalisation of banking created a need for common capital standards for two reasons: The collapse of one bank could infect banks across the world. If all banks had strong balance sheets and a sound capital base, the risk of serious damage to the worldwide banking system would be reduced. Capital is a scarce and expensive resource. Any banks permitted by their regulators to operate with relatively little capital therefore had a competitive advantage, which was seen in some countries as unfair. UK and US banks resented the ability of French and Japanese banks to operate with low minimum capital ratios, since these were taking an increasing share of the international loan market. Mr Volcker and Mr Leigh-Pemberton felt there was a need for a common method for measuring bank capital and an agreement that all banks should maintain a minimum 8 per cent ratio of capital to assets. By early 1987 the Japanese authorities joined the discussions, being steered by a former Bank of England associate director, Mr Peter Cooke, under the auspices of the Basle Committee on banking supervision. Pretty soon all the G10 countries were involved and the guidelines adopted have since been taken up by many banking regulators around the world. 'There is nothing legally binding about the accord,' said a central banker. 'We rely on peer pressure among central bankers to make sure that all regulators implement the standards.' But harmonisation has been impressive. The Basle agreement had a rapid and profound effect on the psychology of senior bankers. Being at or close to the minimum ratio was regarded as a sign of weakness. 'Anyone who wanted to hold themselves out as a serious international bank had to show they were there (long before tomorrow's deadline),' said a Bank of England official. Indeed, most big international banks attempt to maintain far more than the minimum ratios. Those close to the minimum, such as Citicorp of the US and some big Japanese banks, are making strenuous efforts to raise their ratios. Even so, the biggest complaints from banks today about the playing field is that regulators in some countries, such as the US and the UK, are insisting banks have ratios far higher than the minimum - so US and UK banks feel they are still at something of a disadvantage. Under the accord, there are two broad definitions of capital, called tier 1 or core capital and tier 2 (see illustration). Banks must maintain a tier 1 ratio of at least 4 per cent. However, the definition of capital does vary from country to country. Under a derogation included in the accord, Japanese banks alone can count 45 per cent of their hidden reserves (principally unrealised gains on shareholdings) towards tier two capital. When the Tokyo stock market was riding high, this accounted for a substantial proportion of their capital - although with the Nikkei average at its current level, several Japanese City banks are close to the 8 per cent minimum. There have also been differences of interpretation over the types of financial instrument that banks can count towards capital. The definition of tier one capital was extended at the outset to include certain types of preference share, a concession to US banks which had been heavy issuers of such paper. Preference stock has since become a mainstay of bank financing in many financial centres. Legal restrictions, however, prevent banks in France, Spain and Japan from issuing such shares. Banks from the first two countries at least have got around the problem by issuing stock through subsidiaries located abroad - which has drawn protests from UK and US institutions. Under the accord, a bank's assets are weighted according to riskiness. Thus if a bank makes a loan to an OECD government - normally by buying government bonds - it need carry no capital in respect of that loan, since these loans are not seen as risky. If, on the other hand, it makes a commercial loan, then it must have capital equal to 8 per cent of the value of that loan. When lending to other banks, the bank need have only a fifth of the capital required for a commercial loan. The implementation of these weightings has had a significant effect on banks' behaviour. US banks, for example, have been using more of their resources to buy government bonds and have cut back on corporate lending. Critics of the accord, such as Mr Richard Breeden, the chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, complain it has distorted the US economy, by stifling the willingness of banks to lend to businesses. Some bankers have also complained that the weightings make no distinction between a loan to a blue-chip company and one to a vulnerable small business. So in theory banks might be encouraged to make riskier loans to small businesses, since the interest rate on these loans is higher. However regulators say there is no evidence that the accord is encouraging risk-taking.</p>

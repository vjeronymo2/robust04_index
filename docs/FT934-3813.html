			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Banks concerned at EU adequacy rules Banks and securities houses are likely to have to spend more on technology and management improvements to comply with new rules governing securities trading than on allocating more capital to cover risks, according to a report*. The study by Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, based on interviews with 35 banks, investment firms and regulators, found that they were most worried about systems adjustments needed to comply with European Union (EU) capital adequacy directive. The capital adequacy directive and proposals on market risk from the Basle committee of banking supervisors' have raised concerns that banks will have to set aside more capital to cover securities trading and underwriting risks. But the study, led by Mr Peter Cooke, former chairman of the Basle committee, concludes that investments in systems to monitor both risk and allocation of capital are likely to exceed the cost of new capital in many cases. It found that large firms which had already invested in risk pricing models for their securities and derivatives trading businesses tended to welcome the directive because they believed it would give them an advantage. The study says firms becoming subject to consolidated supervision for the first time, and must collect data from around the world on trading relationships with counterparties, will find it 'particularly onerous'. Mr Cooke said the systems costs might 'force some of the smaller players out of the market' although regulators were likely to discourage concentration in derivatives activities to limit systemic risks. * The Regulation of Market Risk; Price Waterhouse, Southwark Towers, 32 London Bridge Street, London SE1 9SY; Pounds 120.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> A headline in the Metro section on Feb. 16 read: "Gates Reprimands Aide for  Using LAPD Files for Political Research." As noted in the story, the "files"  were not actual police files, but were newspaper articles and other publicly  available documents stored in a commonly used computer data base. The material  was retrieved for Assistant Chief Robert L. Vernon via a computer at police  headquarters.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, when swearing in the Presidential  Commission for Industrial Policy, President Rafael Caldera said  the creation of this panel is evidence of the executive branch's  awareness that it is urgent to plan and implement an  industrialization policy capable of meeting the new challenges  of the world's economy.    Luis Eduardo Paul Bello, Simon Nobile Olivo, Lino Clemente,  Eduardo Gomez Sigala, Pedro Carmona Estanga, Phillip Erard, and  Lopez Mendoza are the members appointed by the Presidency of the  Republic. The other members are Agriculture Minister Ciro  Fonseca Anez; Labor Minister Juan Nepomuceno Garrido Mendoza;  Alberto Poletto of the Foreign Trade Institute; Abdon Vivas  Teran of the Investments Fund; Policarpo Rodriguez, vice  president of Finexpo [expansion unknown]; Ignacio Avalos  Gutierrez, president of Conicit [expansion unknown]; Francisco  Layrisse, of the Venezuelan Guayana Corporation; Luis Giusti,  president of Venezuelan Petroleum; Angel Gutierrez, president of  the Federation of Industries; Jorge Redmond of the Venezuelan  Council of Industry; Berend Roosen of the National Council of  Commerce and Services; and Hans Neumann.    President Caldera said: The opening of trade, as well as the  nation's commitments to international organizations, conditions  established by the Andean Pact, and other circumstances,  constitute a challenge Venezuela must overcome with basis on  competitiveness and ability.    With the creation of this commission we want to make evident  the commitment the government has made to the country with  regard to the future of the Venezuelan economy and also to open  roads for intense and effective cooperation between the public  and private sectors. We have invited representatives from the  private sector to share with us this great responsibility. Its  representation in this commission will be a permanent driving  force and provide encouragement so that the goals that have led  us to the creation of this important commission may be  satisfactorily reached.    At this time I would like to express my special thanks to  the  representatives of the private sector who have accepted this  task. This is a commitment with Venezuela, and the government  understands it as such. Therefore, it feels obliged to publicly  express its recognition of those who have decided to take part  in the efforts we have undertaken to benefit our people.    After addressing several issues that had previously been  discussed on numerous occasions during the government's first  three months in office, Minister Ciro Anez Fonseca listed  several basic points of his agricultural policy:     -  Legal  security in all of its forms regarding the agricultural  sector;    -  Heightened production and productivity;    -  Incentives for  farmers, livestock breeders, fishing, and lumber workers, using  all resources available to the ministry;    -  Guarantees that the  local market will be reserved for local production only, while  respecting agreements such as GATT, the Andean Pact, and other  entities with whom we have signed similar multilateral  agreements;    -  Radical changes in domestic agricultural marketing  policies to bring producers and consumers closer for their  mutual benefit;    -  Broad support for agricultural exports;    -  Defining  priority agricultural items and crop zoning strategies directed  at diversification and increased productivity;    -  And the inclusion  of new technology, such as biotechnology, minimal labor  techniques, and organic farming.    A compulsory agricultural insurance system will be  established. Education and training programs will be mainly  based on new productive structures. The transfer and  application of technology, particularly crop extension methods,  will be based on scientific and practical results provided by  Fonalap [expansion unknown]. Fonalap will also be the subject of  a complete revision.    Some small-scale farmers are complaining about the  agreements reached with the banks. I want to point out  something, however, with regard to the small producers who  receive special treatment from the Institute of Agriculture  Credit. They are not being hurt by the problem because they  continue to receive the benefits of financial facilities; there  are no problems there. The problem lies with the medium-sized  farmers -- the medium-sized producers -- and not with the large  producers who have guaranteed finances. There is a large number  of farmers who are not adversely affected by the financial and  refinancing problem. I would say that only about 20 percent are  severely affected.  <H5>  Economic Turbulence </H5>   Development Minister Luis Carlos Palacios referred to the  commitment to social unity. He said: Today, we are experiencing  economic turbulence caused by special circumstances in which  there are imbalances in the monetary and foreign exchange  sectors. It is obvious that these imbalances and higher  currency prices have a bearing on imports required by the the  nation's producers. Overall, the nation's producers import  about 30 percent of their production-related supplies. This is  a cost that in some way is reflected in the prices. In this  regard, I would say this does not go against the national  agreement, and even though we have this problem, the national  agreement must be advanced. That national agreement outlines  what can be done when there is instability, which is different  from what can be done when there is more stability and balance.    At the same time, significant efforts are being made in the  productive sectors to prevent prices from rising above levels  that can reasonably result from increased costs of imports at a  higher rate of exchange.    In response to a reporter's question, Labor Minister Juan  Nepomuceno Garrido said judicial branch workers had agreed to  work toward reconciliation. Yesterday, he noted, the Labor  Ministry had accepted the controversial list of petitions while  the Board of Conciliation is being organized. The minister  added: The 120-hour deadline will be over at the beginning of  next week, and we have agreed to continue providing essential  justice services. This is something that should be highlighted,  because strikes should not be designed to do harm; instead, they  are to pressure employers to take certain measures.    The labor minister recalled that the workers are not  demanding better salaries as such; rather, they want what they  were granted by a court decision late last year to be upgraded.  When reporters told the minister that the CTV [Confederation of  Venezuelan Workers] had appealed to the court for salary  increases to be taken into account in the benefits, he replied  smiling: "This has about as much chance as a snowball in hell."    President Caldera will travel to Margarita on Saturday to  attend the closing of the Venezuelan Press Association's  conference in the province. This will be at 1900.</p>

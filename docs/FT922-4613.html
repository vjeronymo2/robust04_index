			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Dollars 19.7m: and that includes the disco IT WAS built as a favourite toy for a brother of arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. Then Robert Maxwell bought it and it became his favourite toy until his death in November. Now a glossy 12-page brochure for the yacht the Lady Ghislaine is being distributed by international shipbrokers Camper Nicholsons in an attempt to whet the appetite of as yet unenthusiastic buyers. Although ship brokers originally mooted a price of Dollars 24m for the 180ft yacht, Camper Nicholsons, with the agreement of Maxwell administrators Arthur Andersen, has settled for the 'negotiable' price of Dollars 19.7m (Pounds 10.8m). The cost of the brochure is being kept secret, in apparent deference to pensioners who lost money through Maxwell pension funds. 'Marketing expenses are a complicated arrangement between broker and seller. In this case us and the administrators,' said Mr Nicholas Baker, Camper Nicholsons' chief London representative, yesterday. In its introductory promotion blurb, the brochure tells us that the yacht, built by the Dutch Amels shipyard, 'has it all'. It is in fact the largest private yacht in the UK after the Royal yacht Britannia and Gerald Ronson's My Gail III. There is no mention in the brochure of Robert Maxwell. However, Mr Baker conceded yesterday that the boat's association with the one-time media magnate had 'helped' fuel market interest. The Lady Ghislaine's special characteristics include a glass-bottomed whirlpool bath, a sumptuous owner's bedroom and 'staterooms', and a main saloon with a discotheque area including state-of-the art hi-fi equipment, strobe lights and an octagonal mahogany dance floor. We have been asked to point out by Oxford United Football Club that Mr Kevin Maxwell resigned from the board on May 14, 1992. Parliament, Page 14</p>

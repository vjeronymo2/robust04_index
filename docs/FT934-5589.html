			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (13): Firefighters' key to quickest route - User view, Emergency services / Claire Gooding looks at a pioneering GIS in Wales 'The more information we have, the better prepared we are if there's a fire'  -Andrew Marles, senior divisional officer at the Gwent Fire Brigade in Pontypool, sums up the problem facing his emergency service and others. 'It's a matter of whether to send one or multiple appliances, and whether there might be specific risks, chemical danger or hazardous materials.' Inspired by Terry Glossop, the chief fire officer, Gwent's approach to GIS is an original one, comparable with some of the on-board tracking systems used by commercial courier and security companies. To make all the relevant information available at point of need, a mobile control unit on the appliance is updated from a land-based system. The information includes the quickest route to the scene, available water sources and, when available, detailed notes on the building, including likely location of occupants and hazardous materials. Gwent has made imaginative use of the information available from companies - in some cases garnered from fire prevention inspectors in the course of their duty. Digitised 'walk throughs' of the internal layout of a building will be a great help to firefighters once they are inside - they can take a print-out with them. Loading such data has not proved a problem, especially where building plans exist in Computer Aided Design formats. 'By loading plans of premises, a firefighter can have a hard copy of the plan, and see which doors to open, which corridors to go down, and have that in their hand,' says SDO Marles. Something as specialised as the Gwent system demanded a custom-built GIS - and something that would be easy to use for everyone, including people with no experience of computers. An enormous amount of data storage - estimated at 1.7 gigabytes - and fast retrieval were also important considerations. Gwent chose the Pafec product as its base, at a cost of Pounds 50,000 or so. PafecGIS is not an 'off-the-shelf' GIS, and this implementation is designed to integrate with the Brigade's call mobilising system. After initial customisation by Pafec, Gwent is doing the application development in-house, even employing radio technicians for the specialised communications. The system runs on two Sun SPARC stations, chosen on the grounds of ruggedness and price-performance; one at headquarters, one on a mobile control unit which attends large incidents. 'It's all about improving the service,' says SDO Marles. 'If the GIS helps us to save a life, or save property, by being able to form a fire-stop, so that the company can go back into production quickly, then that's better service.' At present the system is not in full use, but future plans include the analysis of incidents, and useful statistics, presented graphically, on events such as car fires.</p>

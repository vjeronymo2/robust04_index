			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Success that comes with a smaller role: US banks have made hard reappraisals of their European operations Recalling how many US banks used to operate in Europe, Mr Herb Aspbury smiles. 'Colonial Bank of Waterbury, Connecticut was a Dollars 1bn asset bank, and it had a London branch. It was insanity,' says the man who is rebuilding Chemical Banking's European arm from the attrition it suffered in the early 1990s. There are many fewer US banks in Europe now, but those that remain earn far more. As the big money centre banks such as Chase Manhattan, Citicorp and Chemical have reported half-year results, they have shown the transformation of European operations which used to be ill-focused and provide low returns. It is not possible to tell the exact contribution of Europe to results such as Chase's 32 per cent leap in second quarter post-tax profits to Dollars 307m. Most banks report their results for operations such as clearing and settlement on a global basis. But Europe clearly gives more than adequate returns. Both Chemical Bank and Manufacturers Hanover cut their European presences during their years of crisis before they merged in 1991 to form Chemical Banking. The combined bank's assets are 60 per cent of their peak; staff numbers have fallen from 3,400 to 2,000 and European offices been reduced from 42 to 23 since 1985. Its return on capital employed in Europe is now above 50 per cent - more than 10 times the 1985 figure. 'There used to be a tendency to be everywhere, even if we were not sure what we were doing there,' says Mr Aspbury. 'We discovered it was as important to define what we weren't, as what we were.' Other banks also made hard reappraisals at the turn of the decade, as US operations were suffering from over-expansion in the 1980s. 'We had to face painfully what we were good at, and how we could make our operations more efficient,' says Mr Tom Swayne, Chase's area executive for Europe. The result has been more than a recovery from lacklustre profits. Although US banks have struggled to break into protected and profitable investment banking activities in north Europe - such as advising companies and underwriting equity issues - they now dominate some corporate banking businesses. The US banks have focused operations in several ways: Only Citicorp retains ambitions in retail banking - with 304 branches in its largest operation in Germany - in spite of having cut costs by an estimated Dollars 300m. Chase sold its 16 branches in Spain in 1991 and closed a UK credit card operation, while Chemical sold its UK mortgage arm in 1988. They have scaled down in countries where they were weak. Mr Swayne says Chase is active in south European capital markets and project finance, and needs outlets in countries such as Spain and Italy. But it is more selective in northern Europe, relying more on distributing products from London. They have concentrated on a few industries. Citicorp opted to focus on financial institutions such as merchant banks and insurers. It decided that it had more opportunities there, because cross-border financial flows were becoming far bigger than output and trade in individual countries. 'Financial flows are 50 times gross domestic product. The margins are lower, but the volume is tremendous,' says Mr Ian Cormack, Citicorp's managing director. The bank now provides services such as securities settlement and clearing, and foreign exchange to 1,900 financial institutions. They have cut the number of corporate customers and tried to sell more complex products and services to the remaining ones. Mr Swayne says Chase's return on equity from companies that regard it as one of their leading banks is three times the level of cases where it only sells one product. They have built on their strength in services where European banks have been weak. An example is clearing and settlement of cash and securities, which US banks have tended to centralise at UK centres. Chase spends Dollars 45m a year on software upgrades for its Infoserve operation in Bournemouth. The US banks gain advantages of scale because they can cut costs, and so prices. They can also control operational risks better. Finally, by tailoring transactions services for their customers, they can create what Mr Cormack calls 'a series of webs' that make it harder for them to switch banks. Yet in spite of their successes in the past three years, the US banks still have some way to go. One thing that has held them back is the fall in credit ratings which made some companies reluctant to buy services from them. The problem is now easing as their earnings recover and they are upgraded. A greater difficulty is that the US banks have relatively poor contact with institutional investors in Europe. They have made private debt placements for European companies in the US, but would find it hard to replicate the feat in reverse. This restricts their role as financial intermediaries. Building their profits in more sophisticated financial markets in northern Europe will require them to make deeper inroads into securities. For the moment, even the achievements of the past few years may not be enough for head offices to view Europe as a growth region to rival Asia. 'If I went back to New York now, and said I want Dollars 100m of equity to invest in a product line, it would probably not be top of the list,' says Mr Aspbury. Even with Europe once again making decent profits, the days when all US banks had to have a branch in London or Paris are unlikely to return.</p>

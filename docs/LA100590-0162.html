			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY EXTENDS CREDIT TO EXPAND MALL  </P> <P> In their first declared action to expand the Glendale Galleria, city officials  on Tuesday endorsed a bookkeeping move to extend an additional $4.16 million in  credit in city funds to the Redevelopment Agency to purchase downtown property.  </P> <P> The money will be used by the agency to buy three properties south of the  shopping mall, between Broadway and Colorado Street, Central Avenue and Orange  Street, said Jeanne Armstrong, redevelopment director.  </P> <P> The agency already owns about half of the property in the area, but had not  announced plans for any specific development. Armstrong said a comprehensive  report on expanding the Galleria will be presented to the agency within six  weeks.  </P> <P> Major stores reportedly contemplating locations in the expanded Galleria  include Robinson's and May Co., and possibly a new and larger Nordstrom.  </P> <P> Historically, the city has loaned funds to the Redevelopment Agency to purchase  property and make improvements downtown, such as street and sidewalk  renovations along Brand Boulevard. The money is repaid to the city from the $8  million to $9 million in property taxes earned annually by the agency from new  development. The five City Council members also serve as agency directors.  </P> <P> The latest loan brings the agency's indebtedness to the city to a record $27.5  million.  </P></p>

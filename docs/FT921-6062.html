			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / International Company News: Norway moves to counter DnB reports NORWAY'S finance ministry yesterday moved quickly to counter reports it is considering erasing the shares of Den norske Bank (DnB), Norway's biggest bank, and putting it under full state control. Trading in DnB's shares, bonds and options were suspended on the Oslo bourse for several hours yesterday after plunging by NKr1.70 to NKr5.30 on concerns over its capital adequacy. A local news agency had quoted Mr Svein Aasmundstad, the controversial head of the Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission (BISC), as saying the government was about to consider writing down the value of DnB's shares to zero. In October, Christiania Bank, the second biggest bank, declared its equity had been wiped out and was delisted from the bourse and taken over by the state. Christiania is due to report 1991 figures on March 5, but local media has speculated that the bank will report net losses of NKr10bn (Dollars 1.56bn). Last December, Fokus Bank, the third biggest bank, was taken over by the state and nearly doubled 1991 net losses to NKr2.1bn. Earlier this month DnB reported 1991 net losses nearly trebled to NKr4.32bn after credit losses of NKr5.58bn. However, in December Norwegian finance officials orchestrated a complex rescue action for DnB, to keep it from falling into the hands of the state in a deal in which the bank was forced to write down the face value of its shares to NKr10 from NKr100. The finance ministry yesterday issued a statement confirming DnB's equity amounted to 7.7 per cent of risk-weighted balance sheet items following the state rescue, compared with a legal minimum of 5.6 per cent. For its part, DnB has no plans to seek extra state funding or change plans to expand its capital later this year. DnB's A-shares closed NKr0.60 down at NKr6.40 yesterday.</p>

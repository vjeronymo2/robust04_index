			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Whistle-blowers win friendly ear EMPLOYEES worried about fraud or malpractice in the workplace have been offered legal advice from a new charity. The organisation believes it could help expose corporate frauds or avert disasters by advising 'whistle-blowers' in the workplace. Public Concern at Work, which was launched yesterday, is offering advice for employees worried about being victimised if they take concerns to their employers. The group hopes that its work will help alert companies or regulators to problems much earlier. Sir Gordon Borrie, former director-general of fair trading and chairman of the charity's trustees, said it would provide confidential legal advice which would be protected by lawyer-client privilege. He said: 'Time and again official inquiries into scandals, disasters and tragedies show they could have been avoided if employees had spoken up in time, or if those in charge had addressed the concerns of staff when they were raised.' He cited the multi-billion dollar fraud at the Bank of Credit and Commerce International, The Herald of Free Enterprise ferry disaster and the Leicestershire child abuse case involving Mr Frank Beck, the children's homes director, as cases which might have been avoided had the concerns of employees been recognised. Sir Gordon stressed that clients would 'remain in the driving seat' and the charity would advise them of their legal positions and the most effective way of raising an issue. The charity, he said, 'should make it less likely that employees will turn a blind eye to serious malpractice and more likely that employers will be able to address real problems before damage is done'. The organisation, which will also provide advice and research reports for employers, arose out of research by Ms Marlene Winfield, one of the trustees, whose book, Minding Your Own Business, advocated the role of whistle-blowers. She said that of 53 British companies asked, only two had a fixed procedure that assured employees of either confidentiality or protection against retaliation. Yet most had felt that there were circumstances where whistle-blowing would be justified. 'The gap between belief and practice was yawning, and still is,' she said. 'Speak to the boss and possibly lose your job, your pension, your mortgage, the trust of your colleagues.'</p>

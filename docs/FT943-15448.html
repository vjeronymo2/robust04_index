			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / Venezuela nears the economic void The day after Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera announced a series of drastic economic measures last week, a Caracas newspaper, Economia Hoy, ran a cartoon on its front page depicting the president and his minister of finance, Mr Julio Sosa, walking confidently along a plank that ended in a great void after one more step. 'How are we doing?' the president asks. 'We're doing just fine,' replies the minister, who is the government's economic policy chief. Although the Caldera administration may not have found the cartoon amusing, it summed up the feelings of many Venezuelan and foreign businessmen. The measures announced by Mr Caldera on June 27 included controls on all foreign exchange transactions and a temporary halt to foreign exchange trading. Many importers are frantic and business people, but not the government, are predicting that there will be shortages of manufactured items and finished products from overseas. The administration decreed exchange controls in an effort to halt a rapid decline in foreign reserves that began early this year. Mr Antonio Casas, president of the central bank, said monetary reserves at the end of June were Dollars 8.9bn (Pounds 5.9bn), or down 29.6 per cent from the end of December 1993 and now equivalent to around 11 months of imports. The government plans to set the single, official exchange rate at 170 Venezuelan bolivars per dollar next week, down from 200:Dollars 1 on the last day of open trading. Businesses desperate for dollars during the week paid as high as 270, according to one press report. At 200 per dollar, the bolivar has been devalued by 47 per cent since the beginning of this year, compared with a 25 per cent devaluation for all of 1993. If that were not bad enough, delays in establishing the new control system have meant that, as of yesterday, the entire country - with more than 20m inhabitants and an economy that depends heavily on imports - has been without any normal foreign exchange activities at banks and exchange houses for two weeks. 'The economy will be on crutches in a few months unless the government gets imports moving again quickly,' commented one foreign executive in Caracas. 'Government officials are trying to keep everyone calm, promising that there will be no shortages. But with this administration's record, it looks like we'll be in real trouble.' Economists say the country's recession, already in its second year, will be worsened this year by import delays. In 1993, Venezuela had merchandise imports of over Dollars 11bn, compared with exports of Dollars 14.2bn. Imports during the first four months of this year were already down by 32 per cent over the same period in 1993. This is serious for an economy that imports nearly half of its food for humans and farm animals, and whose manufacturing plant relies more on imported raw materials and intermediate goods than some of its neighbours do. Inventories of some industrial inputs are already running low, and one of the country's largest vehicle assemblers has not sold any vehicles to dealers since exchange controls were announced. The company, and others that rely on a high percentage of imported components, simply does not know what exchange rate it can legally apply to a unit that costs, for example, Dollars 20,000. Mr Jorge Redmond, president of Conindustria, Venezuela's largest association of manufacturers, warned that government delays in laying out the exchange control plan would create serious problems for industry and for the supply of goods to the public. 'Exchange controls are fine for the government, since it can replenish its international reserves,' an American banker commented. 'But while the government is counting its reserves, the private sector and the economy are suffering.' The real delay in resuming foreign exchange transactions may last even longer - perhaps a month. The central bank plans to resume US dollar sales under the new control system on July 11. Moreover, officials say that it will take around 10 days (presumably, 10 business days) between the time a qualified importer applies for dollars and the time he actually receives them. This is an optimistic projection for a traditionally sluggish bureaucracy. To make things worse, one press report yesterday warned that the official re-initiation of dollar sales might be delayed beyond next Monday. Foreign exchange trading, suspended on June 28, was supposed to have been resumed on July 6. This failed to happen, however, because the government and the central bank had not yet worked out the details of the new foreign exchange control programme.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, June 5 (AFP) -- Jordan is ready to sign an  accord with Israel on defining their common border, a senior  Jordanian official told AFP on Sunday.    Jordan "is determined to recover territory occupied by  Israel  and will not hesitate to sign a bilateral accord on this issue  with the Hebrew state before there is a peace treaty," the  official said on condition he not be named.    Israel and Jordan are due to meet in Washington on Monday to  discuss the border issue which dates back to 1922 and the  outlines drawn up during the British mandate over Palestine.    Jordan is claiming from Israel a strip of about 320 square  kilometres (128 square miles) along their border from the Gulf  of Aqaba to the Dead Sea, as well as 1.3 square kilometres (half  a square mile) south of Lake Tiberias in the Jordan Valley.    Jordan has so far refused to sign a separate peace treaty  with Israel before all outstanding issues have been resolved,  and until there is a comprehensive settlement with other Arab  countries.    The official said that any such accord on their common  border  "would not prejudice our commitment to a global peace"  settlement, but added that the "return of our territories is the  top priority."    So far Israel has evaded any mention of the border issue in  bilateral talks.    But Jordanian Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani told  reporters Saturday that Jordan had received signs that Israel  "was ready to discuss these border questions."    A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Jerusalem confirmed that the  two delegations were to meet Monday in Washington to discuss the  border dispute.    Bilateral Arab-Israeli talks have been suspended since a  Jewish settler killed 30 Arab worshippers in a mosque in Hebron  on February 25.</p>

Addressing the first rally of the Young Democrats' election  campaign, Orban said, "Over the past few years the Fidesz proved  that it could represent the ideas of political and national  unity in an authentic way."    "The Fidesz was perhaps the first party in the 20th-century  history of Hungarian liberalism which could reconcile liberalism  with national commitment," he said.    The Fidesz chairman said the country needs a government  which  helps stabilize democarcy and is committed to Hungary's soonest  possible membership in the European Union and NATO. "A liberal  government has the best chance to cope with the tasks the  country will face in the coming years," Orban said.    Concerning the strengthening of the Socialist Party, Orban  said most people wish calm, security and a better life rather  than a return to the past.</p>

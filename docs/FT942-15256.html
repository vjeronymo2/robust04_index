			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Go-ahead for privatisation of Pharmacia Pharmacia, the Swedish pharmaceuticals group, yesterday scotched rumours of a possible delay in its privatisation, saying the industry ministry had given the go-ahead for the sale of the state's 46 per cent holding in June. The move could raise as much as SKr14bn (Dollars 1.8bn), making it Sweden's biggest privatisation. Around half the shares are expected to be offered to foreign institutions. Mr Jan Ekberg, chief executive, said the mode of privatisation had not been finalised, leaving open the possibility that the state might issue warrants or options to buy shares. The prospectus will be issued on May 24. Mr Ekberg said the company, one of the world's top 20 drugs groups with 1993 pro-forma sales of SKr27.4bn, would also be seeking a listing in the US. There had been talk of the sell-off being postponed due to worries about the size of the offer, and unsettled market conditions. Volvo is Pharmacia's other main shareholder, with a 28 per cent stake. Antonia Sharpe adds: Pharmacia plans to access the syndicated loan market with a Dollars 500m five-year revolving credit facility. JP Morgan and Union Bank of Switzerland will act as joint arrangers.</p>

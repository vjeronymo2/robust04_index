Mun Ik-hwan.    The message says:    We are inexpressively sad to hear the news that Rev. Mun  Ik-hwan suddenly passed away.    Expressing deep condolences over his death, the North side  headquarters of Pomminnyon has decided to send a mourners' group  to join personages of various strata in the South in paying  homage to the deceased and consoling the bereaved family so that  we can share painful sorrow with the Southern brothers and  sisters.    We inform you that a five-member group led by the chairman  of  the North side headquarters of Pomminnyon plans to pass through  Panmunjom at 8 AM January 22 [2300 GMT 21 January] (Saturday) to  attend the funeral of Rev. Mun Ik-hwan and leave Seoul for home  in the afternoon.    We have already asked the minister of the "Unification  Board"  of your side to hold a working contact to discuss the passage  through Panmunjom of our mourners' group and the provision of  convenience and personal safety during its stay. We hope for  your cooperation.</p>

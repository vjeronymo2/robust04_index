			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Advance payment bond binds insurer THE MERCERS COMPANY v NEW HAMPSHIRE INSURANCE CO Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Parker, Lord Justice Nolan and Lord Justice Scott): May 12 1992 A NON-REPUDIATORY and unsubstantial breach of a building contract by the employers does not wholly or partly discharge a surety from his joint and several liability under an advance payment bond to repay to the employers unearned advance payments made by them to the contractor. The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the plaintiffs, the Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery of Mercers of the City of London, from Mr Justice Phillips's decision that the defendant, the New Hampshire Insurance Company, was not liable for monies allegedly due to the Mercers under a bond. LORD JUSTICE PARKER said Mercers claimed against New Hampshire for monies allegedly due under an advance payment bond. The bond related to an advance payment of Pounds 4.5m made by Mercers to Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd in respect of a building contract for works to be carried out by Rush &amp; Tompkins for Pounds 5m. The contract provided for Mercers to give possession of the site in mid-May 1989, but the date could be deferred until about the end of June. Possession was not given until July 24. From July 24 Rush &amp; Tompkins proceeded with the works. On April 26 1990 it went into receivership and the contract was automatically terminated. At that time only Pounds 1m of the advance payment had been applied. On June 29 Mr Justice Hobhouse granted an application by Mercers for interim payment by New Hampshire. The payment was made and the action proceeded to trial. On January 13 1991 Mr Justice Phillips held that New Hampshire was under no liability under the bond. He dismissed the claim and ordered repayment of the interim payment. On March 21 he held that interest should be paid for the period in which Mercers had use of the money. New Hampshire appealed against Mr Justice Hobhouse's order for interim payment. Mercers appealed against Mr Justice Phillips's judgments on liability and interest. New Hampshire's contention that it was under no liability rested solely on the fact that Mercers failed to give possession of the site in mid-May or within six weeks. The first issue was as to the nature of the bond - whether it was a guarantee, and if so, of what. That depended on its construction. Under the bond Rush &amp; Tompkins as 'principal', and New Hampshire as 'surety', were bound 'jointly and severally' to Mercers for Pounds 4.5m. The bond recited that it was given 'to save' Mercers 'against any and all losses' which might result from Rush &amp; Tompkins's failure 'to faithfully employ for the purpose of the contract and liquidate . . . all or any portion of the advance payments'. New Hampshire contended that the bond on its true construction constituted a guarantee of performance of the contract, and that the terms of the contract were embodied in the bond by reference. Mercers contended that the bond was simply a promise to pay a specific sum on a contingency which had happened. The description of Rush &amp; Tompkins as principal and New Hampshire as surety was consistent with a guarantee, but was followed by a joint and several promise to pay. That was not consistent with an ordinary guarantee, where the creditor would have a cause of action against the principal debtor for the debt, and a separate cause of action against the guarantor under the contract of guarantee. Nothing in the document could be construed as a performance guarantee. Its plain purpose was to ensure that if Rush &amp; Tompkins did not earn the amount of the advance payment, both Rush &amp; Tompkins and New Hampshire should be jointly and severally liable to Mercers for the balance. New Hampshire's suretyship consisted in no more than making itself jointly and severally liable for unearned balance. The contention that the bond was a performance guarantee was rejected. Nor was it a guarantee of Rush &amp; Tompkins's liability to repay unearned balance. Mercers simply wanted the protection given by New Hampshire's joining in the liability. The second issue was whether Mercers' breach of the building contract discharged New Hampshire from liability under the bond. National Westminster Bank v Riley (1986) BCLC 268 established that a breach of contract not amounting to a repudiation would not discharge a guarantor unless it amounted to a 'not unsubstantial' departure from a term of the principal contract embodied in the guarantee, either expressly or by implication. Here, the breach was not repudiatory and the terms as to date for possession were not expressly nor impliedly embodied in the bond. Furthermore, in the context of a two-year building contract, a four-week delay in giving possession could not be regarded as a 'not unsubstantial' breach. New Hampshire was not discharged by the breach. The next question was whether there was partial discharge. There was considerable force in the contention that New Hampshire's prima facie liability to pay unearned balance should be reduced by the extra amount which Rush &amp; Tompkins would have earned had possession of the site been given according to contract. However, that could not be accepted. The obligation under the bond was a simple one, to pay unearned balance. Accordingly, New Hampshire was not discharged in whole or in part. The appeal on liability was allowed. Mr Justice Phillips's order was set aside. Judgment was given for Mercers for Pounds 3.4m. Mercers' appeal as to interest was no longer a reality. New Hampshire's appeal against Mr Justice Hobhouse's judgment was dismissed. LORD JUSTICE NOLAN said Riley was concerned with a bank guarantee, but the principle applied equally to the bond. The breach of contract was not repudiatory. Just as the four week delay was insufficient to discharge the building contract, so it was insufficient to discharge the bond. The effect of delay on Rush &amp; Tompkins's ability to satisfy the condition of the bond was, however, substantial. The judge said the evidence suggested that, had the work commenced when it should have done, approximately Pounds 500,000 worth of additional work would have been carried out before the group failed. That was not accepted by Mercers, which put forward calculations leading to figures in the region of Pounds 100,000. Even that was a substantial sum. New Hampshire was not asked to consent to possession being granted four weeks late. There was no justification for saddling it with responsibility for a loss which arose outside the contract and which was due to Mercers' failure. For those reasons, his Lordship would have allowed the main appeal in part only , and would have remitted the matter to the judge for determination of the amount by which Mercers' loss was due to its delay in giving possession of the site. In all other respects he agreed with Lord Justice Parker. LORD JUSTICE SCOTT agreeing that the appeal should be allowed, said there was a sense in which the bond was a guarantee. It imposed on Rush &amp; Tompkins and New Hampshire a joint and several liability to repay Mercers unliquidated advance payment. It would not however be accurate to describe the bond as a guarantee of Rush &amp; Tompkins's obligations under the building contract. The bond resisted tidy categorisation. New Hampshire's participation was in substance as guarantor, the obligation guaranteed being the obligation of Rush &amp; Tompkins to pay the unliquidated part of the advance payment. Postponement for four weeks of the date on which possession was given did not affect New Hampshire's liability. For Mercers: Michael Beloff QC and Susan Prevezer (Masons). For New Hampshire: Rupert Jackson QC and Richard Wilmot-Smith (Davis Blank Furniss, Manchester).</p>

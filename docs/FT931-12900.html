			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / The Base Rate Cut: Mortgage lenders concerned about savers SAVERS rather than borrow-ers seemed to be the main concern of banks and building societies after yesterday's base rate cut. Instead of greeting the rate with optimistic forecasts of the effect on the housing market, lenders emphasised the consequences for savers. Bristol &amp; West, the tenth-largest building society, did not even mention the housing market in its comments. It said: 'Today's fall in base rates will be disappointing for savers who have seen their returns fall dramatically over the past 12 months.' Those lenders that announced new mortgage rates are not passing on the full cut to borrowers. The new market rate appears to be 7.99 per cent, down from the previous industry standard of 8.55 per cent. Halifax, the largest society, was the first to signal to the market that it would be cutting its mortgage rate by just over half a percentage point. This would result in a monthly saving of Pounds 19.83 for someone with a Pounds 50,000 endowment mortgage. The society, which has 15m savings accounts and 1.8m borrowers, said it had given 'special consideration' to its savers in setting the new mortgage rate of 7.99 per cent (down from 8.55 per cent). The rate would apply immediately for new borrowers and from March 1 for existing loans. The new rate will be taken into account for the 1.3m of its borrowers who are on annual review. They will see a reduction in their mortgage rate from 10.95 per cent to 7.99 per cent after Halifax's year end on Sunday. Halifax will cut savings rates but was not yet ready to announce by how much. Reductions in savings rates contributed to building societies suffering net outflows in five months last year. Net building society receipts for the year totalled only Pounds 295m last year compared with Pounds 5.8bn in 1991 and Pounds 6.6bn in 1990. The Consumers' Association said yesterday that while it was disappointed that mortgage rates had not been cut more, it was more concerned with the delay in implementation of the new rates for existing borrowers. Mr Grame Jacobs of the association said: 'We believe they could implement the cuts sooner than six weeks whatever the administrative problems. If they are delaying doing so to widen their margins, they should come clean and say so.' Abbey National, Lloyds Bank, Nationwide, Northern Rock, Chelsea and TSB all announced cuts in their mortgage rates to 7.99 per cent. Abbey National and Nationwide have made mortgages cheaper on larger loans. The new rates take effect at Abbey National from today for new borrowers and from March 1 for existing borrowers. Abbey National said it had not passed on the full reduction because it was bearing the interests of savers in mind. Cuts in savings rates are likely to take effect well before the implementation of the new rate for existing borrowers at most societies on March 1. Nationwide, however, promised savers that they would not see a reduction in rates until March 1, when its mortgage rate falls for existing borrowers. The lower rate will come into effect for new borrowers tomorrow. Lloyds Bank said its new rates would apply to all borrowers from February 26. Alliance and Leicester, the fourth largest society, welcomed the cut but said its timing was a surprise. Mr Peter White, chief executive, said: 'We are looking at the effect this cut will have on rates for our customers, remembering that there are around six times as many savers as borrowers.' Woolwich said new savings rates would have to be 'very carefully balanced' to ensure a competitive return.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LOWEST BASE RATE FOR MORE THAN 15 YEARS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- . . .WILL CUT MONTHLY MORTGAGE COSTS. . .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly repayments                          Endownments*           Repayments**  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       8.55%       7.99%      8.55%       7.99%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds  30,000       160.33      149.83     201.31      195.44 Pounds  50,000       302.83      283.00     355.41      340.08 Pounds  80,000       516.58      482.75     600.71      574.07 Pounds 100,000       659.08      615.91     764.24      730.07 Pounds 120,000       801.58      749.08     927.77      886.07 Pounds 150,000     1,015.33      948.83   1,173.06    1,120.07 Pounds 200,000     1,371.58    1,281.75   1,581.89    1,510.06 Pounds 250,000     1,727.83    1,614.66   1,990.72    1,900.06  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on male aged 30 next birthday               ** 25 year-term  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Halifax Building Society  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

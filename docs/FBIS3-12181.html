In the cabinet session today, Meretz ministers will demand  that all the extreme settlers who advocate murder be arrested at  once; that extremists be taken out of Tal al-Rumaydah, Hadassah  House, and Romano House in the heart of Hebron; that the Army be  instructed not to shoot at Palestinians in the territories; and  that all that has so far been agreed on in the talks with the  PLO be implemented at once.    Minister Shulamit Aloni told our correspondent Sheli  Yehimovich that Meretz will also demand that the Kakh Movement  be outlawed. According to her, we should make a distinction  between idiots who speak out of their stupidity, and real  instigators. She added that the remarks by Police Minister  Moshe Shahal that the police are dealing with Arab and Jewish  murderers along the same criteria are not true, and there is  discrimination.    At the same time, she opposes the demand that the house of  Barukh Goldstein be sealed, just as she opposes sealing the  homes of Arabs. Minister Aloni added that the reserved  condemnation of the Hebron massacre by the settler leaders  borders on racism and viciousness. She added that Goldstein was  not operating in a vacuum. In Israel, there is a nursery of  Arab-hating racists who are after Arabs' lives and property, she  said.</p>

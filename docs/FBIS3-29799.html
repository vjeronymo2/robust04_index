Opposition Vanuaaku Pati (VP) coordinator Peter  Taurakoto announced the group was considering forming a new  political coalition with the Union of Moderate Parties (UMP),  which heads the coalition government. The new coalition would  help elect a new president of the republic next March 2, when  the electoral college meets for the third time, he said.    Last week, the island state's electoral college, which  consists of 46 MPs and 10 local government council presidents  failed twice to elect the country's third head of state. No one  party had a sufficient majority to meet the college's two-thirds  -- 38-vote -- requirement.    Taurakoto explained the opposition's decision followed  failure to reach an agreement with former prime minister Walter  Lini's National United Party (NUP), which considers itself an  "independent opposition" group.    Vanuatu Prime Minister Maxime Carlot said last Thursday it  was "time to talk" for his government majority and the  opposition in order to fill the presidential post.    The opposition parties formed an alliance in 1992 that  includes the four parties, the VP, led by Kalpokas, Barak Sope's  Melanesian Progressive Party, the Tan Union, headed by Vincent  Boulekone and Nagriamel, led by Franky Steven.    The alliance had planned to vote for a no-confidence motion  against Prime Minister Maxime Carlot's coalition government.    Taurakoto said earlier that if the coalition agreement was  reached with the UMP, the new coalition would leave out the two  NUP factions -- Lini's "opposition" and minister Sethy  Regenvanu's pro- government group.    Carlot's government consists of a majority of eight  ministers  from the ruling UMP and three NUP ministers, who decided not to  follow Lini when he withdrew last August from the UMP-NUP  coalition government.    Regenvanu, the deputy prime minister and NUP minister for  justice, culture and women's affairs issued a statement Monday  saying that the opposition's decision to join the government was  an "indication of desperation." It is an "180-degree  turnaround" from an opposition group which, he said, wanted to  bring down the government.    Regenvanu, who now heads a group of three dissident NUP  members of parliament who hold ministers' portfolios, called for  the opposition to end its "futile struggle".</p>

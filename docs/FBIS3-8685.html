			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article in two installments by Iulia Rosca and Cristian </F> Anghelache on the opinions of members of parliament on the 6  March government reshuffle: "The Government Reshuffle--A  Weekend Surprise"]  <H5>  [8 Mar p 3] </H5>   [Text] We immediately wanted to know what members of  parliament think about the government reshuffle, which they  learned about from the press, and about how it was carried out.  The answers given seem to show that the members of parliament  chosen have not yet recovered from their surprise:    Lucian Avramescu, vice president of the Socialist Democracy  Party of Romania [PDSR]: "It was expected, although it was not  known who would be changed. If we are discussing the people in  question, I cannot say what my opinion is. I do not know them.  It was natural to change Paul Teodoru [former transportation  minister], after all that had happened; it was an obligation.  As for Niculae Spiroiu [former defense minister], they were too  hasty. True, it seemed necessary to replace the leadership of  the Ministries of the Interior and Defense with civilians.  Returning to Spiroiu, taking into consideration the accusations  brought against him by Vadim Tudor [Greater Romania Party  leader], they should have waited and not given the latter such  satisfaction. It is positive that the interior minister has  been changed, because I had the impression that a Greater  Romania swarm had formed in that ministry."    Gheorghe Raducanu, deputy of minorities and quaestor of the  Chamber of Deputies: "This was the second reshuffle, and I view  it as opportune. In any case, Mr. Petre Ninosu [former justice  minister] was not changed because of any professional  incompetence. I do not know whether Mr. Spiroiu was necessarily  changed because of the founded or unfounded accusations  regarding the structure in the leadership of the Ministries of  the Interior and Defense. The replacement of the minister of  transportation may be due to failings in his work."    Ion Ratiu, deputy, vice president of the National Peasant  Christian Democratic Party and of the Chamber of Deputies: "What  reshuffle?! Things are standing still; there is no real or  comprehensive change. I am convinced that Mr. Spiroiu's change  is not based on the accusations brought against him. I am  surprised that he has been changed. This could have been done  later. The excuse is that NATO demands that a civilian control  the Armed Forces in all democracies. It seems to me that this  is merely a justification, an excuse. In my opinion, Mr.  Spiroiu had an equidistant and democratic attitude; he made  important changes to remove some personnel. It seems that this  attitude of his was fatal. I think that the changes in the  Ministries of Justice and the Interior confirm the desire of the  current executive authority to maintain complete control in the  hands of the majority party--the PDSR."    Mihai Viziru, deputy of the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM]:  "I learned about the government reshuffle last night on  television and today from the press. I understood that it was a  problem of the ruling party and that Mr. Nicolae Vacaroiu was  completing his team with professional people. We do not have  any merit in this change, except that we told the government to  take a stand on the so-called Tigareta affair [cigarette  smuggling affair in which the army was allegedly involved]. The  minister of defense was--or seemed to be--involved in it; his  change, however, is not the consequence of these accusations.  Mr. Ninosu was replaced because of his parliamentary group. Mr.  Novac is the minister of transportation because he has worked in  this area and has been present during all the labor actions in  this ministry."    Varujan Vosganian, president of the parliamentary group of  minorities: "This reshuffle once again demonstrates that the  entire political game of late has not been based on any serious  intention to change the political aspect of the government  apparatus. It is a show of force, if not of defiance of the  other parliamentary parties by the PDSR. What remains to be  seen is whether the parties within the leftist coalition will  put up with being defied. Insofar as the opposition, especially  the Democratic Convention, is concerned, the same problem  arises. Developments in parliamentary political activity show  that, from an ideological point of view, a conciliation with the  ruling party is ruled out. We are not talking of an ideological  conflict of yesterday, today, or four years ago, but of a  conflict dating back 50 years; it has been brought back into the  political arena of today. The differences are too great between  the partners in the `negotiations' to permit a viable coalition.  While in the Elisabeta Palace, handshakes were exchanged or  nonaggression pacts were concluded, the political struggle was  being waged more fiercely than ever. Thus, any understanding  between the two parliamentary camps becomes a naivete."    Alexandru Nicolae, deputy of the Democratic Party (National  Salvation Front) [PD-FSN]: "This is a custom of the government.  It is not the first time that it has reshuffled the cabinet.  To me, however, it seems unconstitutional. This reshuffle is a  tremendous gaffe made by those in power by replacing Minister  Spiroiu at a time of conflict launched by Vadim Tudor, this  mini-Zhirinovskiy of Romania, who has created so many problems  not only for Spiroiu as a man, but especially for the Ministry  of National Defense, both at home and abroad. This Vadim Tudor  has succeeded in creating a harmful atmosphere in the arms  industry. As for the other ministries, I am of the opinion that  if something has to be changed, it has to be in the economics  ministries in order to invigorate industry and to speed up the  reform and transition process."    Vasile Popovici, deputy for the Civic Alliance Party [PAC]:  "It seems to me normal that three of the four ministers have  been changed: Ninosu, Danescu [former interior minister], and  Teodoru. What seems, however, intolerable is to change the  general in the context of a dispute between a political crook  and the Army general. Given that this dispute has not been  clarified, the message to the population is that the army is  being accused. In this situation, it is urgently necessary to  unblock the `Vadim Tudor files,' which are to be discussed by  the bodies of justice. It is a very serious thing that in the  Vadim Tudor-Spiroiu dispute, the Army was defeated and  subjugated to a Securitate man, while the current minister  [Gheorghe Tinca] is a former collaborator of that Securitate  viper's nest SAPTAMANA, a former version of the weekly ROMANIA  MARE."    Dan Cristian Popovici, deputy and president of the  parliamentary group of the Greater Romania Party [PRM]: "This  reshuffling is a constitutional right which the president of  Romania has exercised. I personally think that the legal  implications were clarified last time. We will probably witness  other such government reshuffles brought about primarily by  mental exhaustion caused by the very tiring activity of  ministers. Normally, a man who has already become used to the  vicissitudes in the life of a minister does not rapidly realize  what solutions are needed to unblock the mechanism, while a new  member who joins the team may do so."    Ion Dobrescu, deputy of the Liberal Party '93 [PL '93]:  "What reshuffle, my dear fellow?! This is not what I call a  government reshuffle. Four notorious ministers have been  replaced by another four ministers, who may be even more  notorious, or not at all. In any case, the reshuffle was to be  expected and this hoax may work with some people, but not with  ourselves. The Defense Ministry has been infiltrated by  Securitate people."    Dumitru Buzatu, PDSR deputy: "I think that this reshuffle  has surprised a large proportion of the members of parliament,  because it took place unexpectedly. Essentially, it follows  certain demands made some time ago, namely to have civilians at  the helm of the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of  the Interior. I personally do not know the people who have been  appointed, except for the Senate vice president, and so I cannot  express my opinion about their competence."    Nicolae Octavian Daramus, deputy of the Romanian National  Unity Party [PUNR]: "This government reshuffle has come at the  right time. The government's work was somehow being blocked  from both sides of the political arena. The ruling party wanted  to unblock it; it is a temporary thing and in the not too  distant future a new government formula will be tried."    Gyula Vida, deputy, president of the UDMR [Democratic Union  of Hungarians in Romania] parliamentary group: "I expressed my  opinion in connection with this issue on 17 December 1993 when  the discussion on the censure motion took place. I think that  the current government is not capable of taking action; it does  not have the necessary support and political performance; and it  does not enjoy international credibility in managing  socioeconomic policy, which is deteriorating with every passing  day. I think that the essence of the problem will not be changed  through this reshuffle. It is just a cosmetic operation, an  attempt to calm down the public, but the government is actually  the same. In connection with the replacement of Lieutenant  General Spiroiu, I think it was not a measure that suited the  current political situation in our country."    Doru Viorel Ursu, PD(FSN) deputy: "Apparently, one can talk  of a government reshuffle by interpreting--in a very broad  sense--the constitutional dispositions, which, in turn, seem to  speak about a parliamentary republic. What do I think about  this simple replacement of people? From a political point of  view, President Iliescu has increasingly been assuming the role  of a single factor of power. Thus, we are not talking of a  change in concept or in the attitude of a government that has  not been functioning for a long time, but about painting one's  image. This way no one will notice that there is no more  interest in whether Bessarabia is slipping away toward the east  and that there are strikes and other problems. Neither strikes  nor reshuffles add anything new. We can also talk about the  inappropriate time when it happened, and that it was somewhat  hasty and covert. I do not want to hurt anyone, I have no  argument with these people, but insofar as the Ministry of  National Defense is concerned, the change does raise a question  mark."    "This change revealed the image of the defense minister the  moment the press noted that the offensive to sort out the  `affairs' in the ministry was under way. As far as Teodoru is  concerned, things are much simpler. Obviously, both Mr. Iliescu  and the ruling party did not take an absolutely necessary  measure when it was imperative, namely when the Petromin-Forum  Maritime contract [on the sale of Romanian fleet] was  sanctioned. To avoid the discovery of this serious mistake,  which would have entailed not only the dismissal of the minister  of transportation, but also that of the entire government, they  used this reshuffle."    Dinu Patriciu, deputy of the Liberal Party '93 [PL '93]:  "Instead of a parliamentary majority that supports a genuinely  reformist government, a minimal solution was preferred, namely a  change of ministers; again without respecting the Constitution,  that is without passing them through parliament. This proves  that the attitude of the PL '93 was justified and we hope that  our partners in the opposition have also understood that the  discussions with the PDSR are not serious, because all they try  to do is to delay and drag things out without any serious  results."    Sergiu Cunescu, PDSR deputy: "I appreciate that the  executive authority was convinced of the need to appoint  civilians to the Ministries of the Interior and Defense.  However, we regret that General Spiroiu, for whom we harbor  feelings of respect, has been replaces as head of the Army."    Corneliu Coposu, PNTCD [National Peasant Christian  Democratic  Party] senator: "The recent government reshuffle means nothing  more than a continuation of the crypto-communist policy of  rotating cadres," said PNTCD President Mr. Corneliu Coposu at a  weekly news conference held yesterday, 7 March. The replacement  of General Spiroiu at the head of the Ministry of National  Defense, under the pretext of observing the recommendations made  by the Council of Europe, has been assessed as a "serious  political mistake." Apart from the risk that the appointment of  a civilian to this position may not be well received by the  Army, the context within which it was made is regrettable. In  Mr. Coposu's opinion, additional proof is the fact that  "President Iliescu is under the influence of evil forces and is  susceptible to blackmail," because General Spiroiu's replacement  is tantamount to playing Corneliu Vadim Tudor's game. The  reshuffle means nothing more, the PNTCD leader believes, than  prolonging the government's agony for another two to three  months with the final aim of preparing early elections. "We do  not view this reshuffle as beneficial and we do not believe that  it has contributed to Romania's stability or credibility abroad.  Early elections cannot be avoided, but only delayed," Mr.  Corneliu Coposu concluded.    Ion Diaconescu, PNTCD deputy: "Nothing has changed in the  balance of power; there is no obvious modification in the  political arena. I was surprised by President Iliescu's words  justifying the reshuffle through economic objectives, while all  the ministers who were changed were responsible for sectors  other than economic ones; thus I do not see how they could  improve the political crisis. Minister Spiroiu's change is very  interesting. This move can be interpreted as an achievement by  Vadim Tudor, because no measures were taken against him, but  against General Spiroiu. Justifying this measure with the  demands of the Memorandum is not significant. The Council of  Europe recommended a civilian minister of defense, but we were  not obliged to take this measure. There is a tradition in  Romania in this respect: In the past 150 years, all defense  ministers were career military men."  <H5>  [9 Mar p 3] </H5>   [Text] Petre Roman, deputy and president of the Democratic  Party (National Salvation Front) [PD(FSN)]: ``No one contests  the right of a government to try to improve its work by  reshuffling the cabinet; however, the answers to the questions  why, how, and when in connection with the current government  reshuffle are disappointing. First, because no reasons were  given. It would have been normal, for instance, to learn why  those who held the respective positions were dismissed and what  is expected from those who have been appointed instead. As a  result of the way in which this reshuffle occurred--by once  again ignoring parliament--a third of the current government is  made up of people who have not been confirmed by parliament.  This government reshuffle seems inappropriate because  undoubtedly it raises questions such as how this fits in with  the open dialogue with all the opposition political forces in  order to conclude a national political pact and what it means  for the capital of trust with which we proceeded to achieve a  consensus to come out of this blockage. The surprise was very  great when on Friday, 4 March, that is 48 hours before  announcing the reshuffle, the country's president affirmed that  there was no intention to reshuffle the government.    ``We believe that, whenever a government reshuffle entails  changes in sensitive positions, which, to a great extent, regard  general national interests, such as defense, justice, and the  interior, consultations are needed to avoid useless tension and  keep the option for national consensus open. Unfortunately,  such consultations did not take place this time around either.''    Victor Babiuc, deputy and vice president of the PD(FSN):  ``The current government reshuffle suffers from the same faults  as the former one, faults which were not meant to be noticed.  Thus, they were eschewed both by the government and the other  authorities, which were supposed to make sure that the reshuffle  was carried out by abiding by the Constitution. When I say  this, I am referring to the fact that, in accordance with  Romania's Constitution, the appointment of government members  has to be ratified by parliament, contrary to what happens in  Western countries where parliament approves solely the prime  minister and the government's program. Our Constitution also  stipulates that the cabinet has to be voted on.    ``f there is no specific text available in this respect, a  move like this can be modified by observing the initial  procedure. I am talking of the so-called `principle of the  asymmetry of legal actions.' And this is not all. We cannot  have two kinds of ministers: some endorsed by parliament,  others not. Nothing can justify the conclusion that this is  something normal. In our Constitution, there is a very  important text, which has been overlooked, namely the one  regarding `interim' status. This part of the Constitution  stipulates that a person who is already a minister may be  appointed as an interim minister. This means that that person  starts from the status of a mandate previously ratified by  parliament. Within 45 days, the maximum duration of such an  interim status, it is necessary to have the appointment approved  by parliament. This holds all the more true when we talk about  appointments for a longer period, probably until the end of the  parliamentary term; the person in question has to be recognized  by the parliament of the time. And this requires discussions  within the permanent commissions and then within the plenary  session of the two parliamentary chambers.''    Stefan Radoff, senator of the Civic Alliance Party [PAC]:  "Much fuss is being made about political and social pacts. The  first step that should have demonstrated an opening toward them  would have been the proposal by our country's president that  these ministers be heard and not appointed by presidential  decree. Taking each of these figures separately, I think that  there are two matters at stake: The recommendations made by the  Council of Europe with regard to the appointment of civilians to  replace the military at the helm of strategic institutions were  not mandatory, specifically now with this Balkan conflict. Mr.  Spiroiu's replacement by a man who has nothing to do with the  Army or its policy, as I have nothing to do with things outside  my profession, is not welcome. Mr. Taracila's appointment as  Minister of the Interior--bearing in mind his performance in the  Senate, his honesty, and the competence that he has proved, is  beneficial. As for the transportation department, which is the  most vulnerable because this minister is firmly suspected of  being corrupt, Mr. Teodoru's replacement is welcome as is that  of Mr. Ninosu, which was necessary from a political point of  view because of the delays in restructuring the justice system."    Valer Suian, PUNR senator: "This was a political event,  which had been expected for a long time. It is a positive thing  that it took place at this time, but it would have been even  better had it taken place earlier. The various political games  between the majority party and the opposition, including the  PUNR, made this expected and necessary reshuffle a little late.  I think that through the importance of the portfolios affected  by this reshuffle, this change may have important consequences  for the progress of the reform process, at least in certain  respects, something that means decisive steps in the direction  of institutional democratization in Romania, and it is also in  keeping with the recommendations made by European bodies."    Ion Aurel Stoica, PD(FSN) senator: "The time of the  government reshuffle was uninspired considering the stage of  discussions between the parliamentary opposition parties and the  party holding a relative majority in parliament. You do not  need to be an analyst to ask whether a reshuffle at this time  does not jeopardize and question the honesty of this dialogue  and its outcome. Second, I cannot help noting the short circuit  in parliament; we are of the opinion that the ministers or the  candidates for the position of minister have to be heard by the  parliamentary commissions and approved by parliament before the  reshuffle takes place."</p>

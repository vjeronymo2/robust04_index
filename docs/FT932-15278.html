			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / International Company News: Suez confirms first loss in 135 years SUEZ, one of France's most prominent industrial and financial holding companies, yesterday confirmed that last year it made the first loss in its 135-year history with a FFr1.87bn (Dollars 346m) deficit, against net profits of FFr3.84bn in 1991. The group, with interests including the Indosuez bank and Victoire insurance group, has been the subject of takeover speculation since it disclosed its loss earlier this year. Suez made an operating loss of FFr610m last year, against an operating profit of FFr5.07bn in 1991. It also suffered a sharp fall in exceptional profits to FFr1.64bn from FFr2.16bn for the same period. The group earlier warned that its property losses and provisions for 1992 would amount to FFr4.2bn. In spite of the fall into the red it has held its dividend at FFr8.20.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Federal Deputy Aloizio Mercadante managed to undo  with just one phrase all the effort made by PT [Workers Party]  presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva during the past  five days to win the confidence of U.S. bankers and investors.  Lula invited Mercadante to go with him to the United States as  the PT's leading economist. During a lecture for 800 bankers,  Mercadante yesterday said that he would give "a big headache to  Bill Rhodes." In this he was alluding to William Rhodes, the  representative of the steering committee for Brazil's creditor  banks. The phrase caused great displeasure, and to the audience  sounded like a threat. Lula sought to minimize the issue, but  the U.S. investors still left the meeting fearing that a PT  government would eventually break the recent debt agreement.</p>

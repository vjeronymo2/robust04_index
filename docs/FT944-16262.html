			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / The Loyalist Ceasefire: Now to choose representatives for the negotiating table - Prospects for the paramilitaries In announcing yesterday a cessation of hostilities from midnight Ulster's loyalist hardliners were not merely responding to the challenge thrown down by the IRA's six-week-old ceasefire. By drawing a line under the era of violence loyalists - like the IRA in neighbouring West Belfast - were demanding a place at the negotiating table in any discussions on the future of the province, ahead of the expected agreement between London and Dublin on the long-awaited framework document. The main question remains if the loyalists are now to enter the democratic fray, who exactly will represent them? Mr David Irvine of the fringe Progressive Unionists (PUP) said: 'No section of our community should be left out of the discussions for our future.' He is said to have close links with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), the younger of the two paramilitary organisations represented at yesterday's press conference. The loyalist paramilitaries have no formal electoral backing - unlike the IRA which through Sinn Fein, its political wing, can claim a mandate - albeit a small one, with less than 10 per cent of votes in the province at the last election. Mr Irvine and the Ulster Democratic party's Mr Gary McMichael - as a Lisburn councillor the only person on the platform to hold elective office - projected themselves as sophisticated and well-suited politicians. Some believe that Mr Hugh Smyth of the PUP, the mayor of Belfast - said to be close to loyalist opinion - is keen to take a leading role. But one mainstream unionist politician said there would have to be elections before loyalist leaders could claim political legitimacy in the community. The prospect is that the emergence of this new radical force will cause further fragmentation in unionist ranks. Behind the loyalists' decision to seek a place in the negotiations is the sense of dissatisfaction in poorer protestant areas with the mainstream unionist parties - Mr James Molyneaux's Ulster Unionist party and the hardline Democratic Unionist party led by the Rev Ian Paisley. As one community leader put it: 'Gerry Adams is getting out and talking to people. When was the last time Jim Molyneaux came down this street?' Mr Irvine said yesterday: 'Both parties sitting at this table have proven that they are prepared to enter the future with less baggage than the other unionist parties.' By Northern Ireland hardliner standards yesterday's loyalist statement was almost a model of moderation and flexibility. In particular, it was at pains to make clear they would have nothing against talking with Sinn Fein, something Mr Paisley has said he will never countenance. Mr 'Gusty' Spence, one of the founders of the UVF, said: 'Of course the day will come when we will sit down with Sinn Fein. Everything will have to be in place. It will have to be right for them, for us, for everyone. And yes I think we'll do good business together.' Many of those representing the loyalist paramilitaries on yesterday's platform had done time in prison on terrorist-related offences, and it is easy to imagine the experience has been both chastening and educational. Younger men, who have taken command of the organisations in recent years, are understood to have driven a very hard bargain before agreeing to end the violence. But the fringe political parties which have persuaded them to enter the democratic process are convinced the ceasefire will hold. The murder campaigns of the two main loyalist terrorist organisations in Northern Ireland have surpassed the IRA in recent years. For that reason the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and UVF regard their ceasefire decision as having been taken from a position of strength. The decision also points to a long-term strategy to don the clothes of democratic politics and shelve the Armalite. Much has been made of the role of the loyalist leadership's consultations on Monday with loyalist prisoners in the Maze prison on the decision to call a halt to violence. The government's announcement, restated this week by Mr John Major, the prime minister, that any new arrangement for the province would have to be put to referendum, has also done much to calm fears of a sell-out of unionist interests. In spite of demands by the Combined Loyalist Military Command, most observers believe the delay in responding to the IRA move had as much to do with public relations as substantive issues.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Alpine tells employees trading has 'ceased' ALPINE (Double Glazing), one of the oldest names in the UK window industry, yesterday announced it had ceased trading. Alpine, purchased from administrators by a group of unnamed buyers in February 1992, sent a letter to staff stating it had suffered 'substantial bad debts'. Once owned by ADT, Alpine went into administration in August 1991. The administrators sold the business for Pounds 900,000 to a group backed by the Midlands entrepreneur Mr Clive Smith. Events at two companies once linked with Mr Smith, Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Butte, are being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office. Mr Smith, facing the threat of personal bankruptcy, is due to appear before creditors owed Pounds 20m next week with proposals for an individual voluntary arrangement. Yesterday there appeared to be confusion among Alpine's employees. Security guards at the Newcastle factory said the premises had been closed for a week's holiday. The chief executive Mr Robin Speirs refused to comment on events, although he confirmed Alpine had ceased trading. The group is thought to have defaulted on payments for services such as advertising and materials. Many of its employees have not been paid. The news comes just weeks after the group sponsored a horse race at substantial cost - the Alpine Double Glazing Derby Trial at Lingfield. Alpine's directors included Mr James Berry, associated with Mr Smith through his role at Corporate Broking Services, which collapsed in 1991. Mr Smith held a substantial stake in CBS.</p>

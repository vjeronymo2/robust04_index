In the process of developing democracy, China will not copy  from the modes of foreign countries, but should learn from  other's useful experiences according to its own national  conditions.    "This is the way that we have chosen," said Qiao Shi,  visiting chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC)  Standing Committee, at a meeting with President Alfred Gerstl  and Vice-Presidents Walter Strutzenberger and Herbert Schambeck,  of the Federal Council of Austria.    Qiao said China and Austria are in the different period of  development. There still exists a gap between the two countries  in economic growth.    However, "this does not affect our bilateral ties. On the  contrary, it makes us to place greater importance on promoting  our friendship and friendly ties," he said.    Gerstl thanked China for taking care of Jewish refugees in  Shanghai during World War II.    Meanwhile, he presented Qiao with a book which records the  history of Jewish nation.    Qiao said the Chinese people have always sympathized with  the  Jewish nation when it is struggling for its own subsistence.    Schambeck said he quite agreed with Qiao's view on the  development of democracy, adding that democracy must be linked  with a country's stability.    Strutzenberger said since the establishment of diplomatic  ties between the two countries 23 years ago, their relationship  has been developed very well.    Austria welcomes and appreciates China's successful policy  of  opening to the outside world, he said.    Cao Zhi, secretary-general of the NPC Standing Committee,  attended the meeting.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Nissan plant set to cut car output target NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is reviewing output levels at its UK plant and is expected to be forced to cut its present target of producing 270,000 cars this year. Production levels throughout the UK motor industry are under heavy pressure because of the continuing sharp decline in new car sales in continental Europe. Nissan had planned to raise output at its Pounds 900m car plant at Sunderland in north-east England by 51 per cent this year to 270,000 from the 179,000 cars produced last year. 'With the situation in Europe as it is, it is beginning to look as if we will not reach that target,' the company said yesterday. Around 88 per cent of production was exported last year, but this share has fallen in 1993, as the UK has emerged as the only market in west Europe where sales of new cars are growing. The Sunderland plant, which now has a capacity to produce up to 300,000 cars a year, has been under development since the mid-1980s. This is the first year that it has been able to produce two car ranges, the Primera large family car and the Micra small car, at full capacity following the launch of the Micra in the second half of last year. The start-up of Micra production has allowed Nissan to raise its output in the first half of 1993 by 90 per cent to 140,713 from 74,214 in the corresponding period a year ago. However, output at the plant was already coming under pressure from the sales decline in continental Europe in the early summer when Nissan was forced to lower planned Primera output by 15 per cent to 110,000 from the previous target of 130,000. This reduction was offset by the decision to raise the Micra production target from 140,000 to 160,000. Nissan was the first of the Japanese carmakers to establish a car assembly base in Europe, and it has now become the first to be caught up in the recession that is hitting all the established car producers in Europe. Ford, Vauxhall and Peugeot have all been forced to reduce production in the UK this year. Overall UK car output in the first seven months at 858,617 was 6.6 per cent higher than a year ago because of the higher output from Nissan and the start-up of the Honda and Toyota UK plants.</p>

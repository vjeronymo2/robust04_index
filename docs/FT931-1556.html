			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Auditors must restructure profession AUDITORS must restructure their profession radically or risk losing their monopoly on scrutinising financial reports, Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the UK's largest accountancy firm, warned yesterday. Unless auditors develop long-term plans they will fail to attract high-quality recruits and may lose their statutory monopoly on auditing to other consultants, the firm added. The conclusion comes in the firm's submission to the Auditing Practices Board about its consultative document on the future development of auditing. The submission's positive tone for reform is in stark contrast to many submissions to the board, which have been highly critical of the proposals for change. Shareholders need to take a more active role in improving the development of auditing, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said in its submission.</p>

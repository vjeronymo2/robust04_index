			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 27 May (MTI) -- After examining possible  complaints and granting legal redresses, the National Electoral  Committee is to announce the final result of the 1994  parliamentary elections in 10 to 14 days after the May 29 second  round, Ilona Palffy, deputy head of the Interior Ministry's  Electoral Office, told MTI.    Under the Constitution, the president of the Republic is to  convene the founding session of the new parliament in 30 days  after the elections. The session will mark the end of the  mandate of the government in office. In the subsequent 40 days,  parliament will pass a decision on the prime minister candidate  proposed by the president of the republic and on the program of  his government, Palffy said.    Should the prime minister candidate and his program be  accepted by a majority of deputies, the new prime minister will  make proposals for the ministers, who will then be appointed by  the president. This means that Hungary may have a new  government by late July, she said.</p>

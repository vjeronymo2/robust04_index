			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Arts: Controversy rages over Velazquez - Susan Moore ponders the fate of a questionable 'Immaculate Conception' / Saleroom When a painting by a major Old Master turns up on the market without provenance and undocumented in the literature on the artist, it is almost inevitable that the art world is riven in its opinion of the work's authenticity. In 1990, the French dealer Charles Bailly paid a sensational FFr18m - over Pounds 2m - for an 'Immaculate Conception' offered at auction in Paris as 'circle of Velazquez'. Convinced it was by the master himself - as, presumably, was the unknown underbidder - he set about trying to prove his case and tempt a buyer. Four years on, the picture's appearance at Sotheby's in London can be seen as a measure of his failure to date - and of the reluctance of some museums and art historians to involve themselves in attributing a picture that happens to belong to the trade. Relieved of its masking grime and x-rayed before the sale (almost unheard of auction-house practice), the painting is being offered on Wednesday with a Pounds 6m estimate as an autograph early Velazquez. The controversy raging around the picture highlights once again the power of experts to make or break a picture at auction. The world of Old Master connoisseurship offers few certainties, and the slightest scholarly reservation often freezes a collector's hand as it reaches for the cheque book. Museum trustees tend to be an even more cautious breed. The success of the auction may depend on whether any European or North American institution can steel its nerve to pay Pounds 6m or so (the reserve price has yet to be set) for a picture that perhaps half the relevant authorities believe to be by Alonso Cano, Velazquez's fellow apprentice in Seville. The second question looming large over the sale is whether anyone with the wherewithal to buy a Velazquez would want this one - not one of the master's earthy bodegones or late court portraits, but an austerely intellectual religious image? That said, Velazquezs likely to reach the market are hardly thick on the ground. Paris also turned up one of the highlights of the Old Master drawings show currently at Hazlitt, Gooden &amp; Fox. This unexpectedly delicate pen and brown ink study by Rubens was offered at the Drouot in 1992 as 'circle of Van Dyck' where it was bought in and later acquired by a French dealer for its frame. Subsequently bought by Hazlitts, the drawing was identified by Michael Jaffe as a study for Rubens's 'Le Christ a la Paille' in Antwerp. When the drawing was lifted from its mount, figure studies for another Rubens composition were discovered on its verso. The asking price for this double-sided sheet is around Pounds 200,000. Discoveries appear to be the theme of the week. On Wednesday, Christie's London offers an impressive Assyrian relief of a eunuch and a bearded winged divine from the Palace of Ashurnasirpal II at Nimrud of 883-859 BC. Part of the loot excavated by Sir Henry Layard in 1845-48, the bas relief remained at Canford Manor after the house became a public school. There, lining the tuck shop wall and covered in whitewash, it was thought to be one of a group of plaster casts. A figure in excess of Pounds 750,000 is expected. No less remarkable at Christie's on Tuesday is the previously unrecorded horn of a unicorn (produced, if truth be told, by the more prosaic narwhal, a small arctic whale), lovingly carved in mid 12th century England. Among the most prized of medieval and renaissance treasures, these horns commanded extravagant prices. Pope Clement VII paid 17,000 ducats to secure one; Michelangelo agreed to paint the Sistine Ceiling for 3,000.</p>

			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Hands across the ocean This year has so far seen two hostile bids fought simultaneously in Britain and America. The failed Enterprise/Lasmo bid and the current Browning-Ferris Industries/Attwoods battle have come under the jurisdiction of both the UK's Takeover Panel and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The reason is the large proportion of each target's shares held by US investors - over 20 per cent in Lasmo's case and about three-quarters in Attwoods' case. Though operating in two jurisdictions adds to the complexity and cost of takeovers, more bidders are likely to be driven down this route as US investors increasingly diversify their portfolios overseas. Acquirers may find it worth pursuing a US stake of as little as 5-10 per cent, given that they can only compulsorily purchase minority stakes if they win over 90 per cent acceptances. Such dual jurisdiction bids subtly change the nature of the takeover game. Bidders and targets have to appeal to two sets of shareholders, each with slightly different ways of valuing companies. In the Lasmo bid, much was made of the fact that US investors look at oil exploration companies on a cash-flow basis while UK investors are more concerned with assets. Meanwhile, BFI has argued that Attwoods' earnings should be converted to US accounting standards in order to decide how much the shares are worth. It will be no surprise that this turns what first looked like a mean offer into an apparently generous one. As more bids straddle the Atlantic, dreaming up similar wheezes should become a growth business for bankers.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / UK Company News: CCS at Pounds 1.5m after exceptional credit An exceptional credit of Pounds 1.49m, arising from restructuring, helped CCS Group report pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.53m in the year to October 31, against losses of Pounds 10,000. Trading profits at the USM-quoted builders' merchant fell from Pounds 146,000 to Pounds 118,000 as its G Blagg subsidiary suffered difficult conditions with recessionary pressures continuing. Turnover fell from Pounds 3.05m to Pounds 2.62m, reflecting the company's tightening of credit controls. Earnings per share were 9.61p (0.02p losses) or 0.26p (0.35p) if the effects of restructuring are taken out. The company intends changing its name to Blagg.</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Odessa's buses get privatisation on the road: Change in Ukraine often starts at local level, bypassing politicians in Kiev Sergei Mann used to produce movies at Odessa's renowned film studio. But it stood idle for years, like many Ukrainian concerns. So he started a private transport company this summer with the studio's ageing bus fleet, previously reserved for Soviet film stars. The local evening hot spot, Casino Richelieu, covered renovation costs with advertising. Painted a bright green, the buses brought beachcombers from Odessa's Bolshoi Fontane district to the Black Sea coast. Film Studio Transport, the company, lost money the first week, then never looked back. Disney characters and rubber beach ball promotions quickly brought customers and profits. 'That was all garbage,' says a raspy Mr Mann, aged 54, pointing to the buses on the studio lot. 'I wanted to use these old buses. And I'm not old, I still want to do a lot.' Now he plans five more routes and seeks funding for 50 more buses. With Ukraine only now bracing for nationwide reform, Odessa's pilot municipal transport privatisation scheme proves that change often occurs at the local level, bypassing unwilling politicians in Kiev. After less than a year, a fifth of the bus routes in Odessa are in private hands. The programme, already in place in 12 cities, will be expanded to 13 more throughout Ukraine this autumn. It works simply. Routes are advertised and owners picked by bidding. The US Agency for International Development, underwriter of the scheme, provides start-up expenses and legal work. The routes then pay for themselves. 'This is one of the few business opportunities where you can just walk in and start,' said Mr Jeff Martin, the US agency's co-ordinator. He claimed privatisation in the first five cities reduced government subsidies by Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.8m), off an initial Dollars 900,000 investment, and created up to 8,000 jobs for drivers, mechanics, and service supports such as coffee bars near bus stops. The vehicles usually come from such unlikely sources as collectives and large state companies which no longer use the buses because of layoffs and closures. US Aid hopes to expand the programme to link 1,200 small, isolated Ukrainian villages with private inter-city routes early next year. Privatisation also may include other inefficient municipal services such as waste collection and housing maintenance. In Odessa, a sprawling coastal city of 1.2m built by Catherine the Great just 200 years ago, the new choices relieve transport pressures for many who lack cars and live far from the historic centre in large Soviet apartment ghettos. Fares went up, but service improved. On one route that was deemed unprofitable by the state bus company, three separate companies today compete for the same customers. Independent mini-vans soon started to shadow official routes to lure away customers. Mr Anatoly Vitkovsky, who owns one of six private bus companies, said regulations remain unclear. But he added that imitation is the best form of flattery. A former bus driver, who makes Dollars 100 a month - five times a ministerial salary - Mr Vitkovsky explained that his friends at state garages also see the benefits. Many now lease the vehicles and run routes as freelances. Their daily take, he estimates, surged up from Dollars 3 to Dollars 14. Business is not painless. Rising competition, even talk of takeover attempts and bankruptcy, have worsened Mr Vitkovsky's ulcer condition. The owners lament that weak Ukrainian banks cannot finance new buses. Often they face simple but serious problems such as fuel shortages. With characteristic Odessan humour, Mr Mann deflects further queries: 'There is an old saying: 'Ask me about something easier than business'.' But Mr Vitkovsky has no regrets. 'Odessites used to joke: 'What is a bus terminal?'' he says. 'A place people were told there will be no bus.' They may no longer get it.</p>

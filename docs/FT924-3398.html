			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / UK Company News: South Wales Electricity jumps 43% to Pounds 29.7m THE comparative resilience of the local economy and the disposal of loss-making retail activities helped South Wales Electricity raise interim pre-tax profits by 43 per cent, from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 29.7m. The company expressed doubts about the possibility of signing one-year contracts for coal-fired electricity before the energy white paper, in spite of an apparent preference for this option by Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the Board of Trade. Mr David Jones, managing director, suggested that one way of increasing the market for coal would be to change the franchise non-competitive market limit from 1mw in 1994 to more than the planned 100kw. In the six months to September 30 turnover expanded from Pounds 256.5m to Pounds 260.5m. Domestic unit sales grew by 0.9 per cent and commercial by 4.3 per cent, but industrial sales declined by 0.4 per cent. The company became the first rec to become cash positive since privatisation. Interest contributed Pounds 400,000, against payments of Pounds 1.5m the first half of 1991. Although the company was helped by the sale of the retail arm, which lost Pounds 2.5m in the first half of 1991, Celtic Contracting incurred a loss of Pounds 1m this time. However, Mr Wynford Evans, chairman, said he expected Celtic to be back in profit next year, following a restructuring of terms and conditions of the 200 employees which will see weekly hours increase from 39 to 42 and the wage bill fall by 20 per cent. In the core business there was a reduction of 7.7 per cent in staffing during the period. Staffing across the whole group has fallen 14 per cent in the last 18 months. The interim dividend goes up to 6.6p (5.8p), payable from earnings of 20.5p (13.6p) per share. COMMENT South Wales could scarcely have hoped to recreate the impact of the full year results, when it became the first regional electricity company to cut prices since privatisation, but it did its best. Buoyed by becoming the first cash positive rec and by relatively impressive volume growth, it is increasing its dividend more than other recs so far and the shares rose 8p to 507p. Nonetheless, Celtic's losses are a reminder that contracting is a cyclical business even if it does make money next year. A full year distribution of 22p would give a prospective yield of 5.8 per cent, which is slightly below the average and leaves little room for the company to continue outperforming.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Conflicting influences move French equities - David Buchan explains the recent volatility in Paris Interest rates have given the Paris Bourse two nasty jolts this week, as well as raising some doubts about the pace of the undoubted recovery that is taking place in the French economy. The first jolt came on Tuesday, when French commercial banks, anxious to restore profitability sapped by fairly weak demand for credit as well as by continued property loan provisions, raised their base lending rate by a quarter of one per cent to 7.95. Since May it had been at 7.70 per cent, the lowest for two decades. The sharper jolt came two days later, with the French Treasury selling a new tranche of 10 year bonds (OATs) at 7.92 per cent, compared to 7.23 per cent only a month earlier. This led to a 1.65 per cent fall in the Bourse's CAC 40 index which closed on Thursday at 2,034.91; yesterday, eventually, it fell further to 2,020.37. it still ended xxx per cent lower on the week. In deciding between bonds or shares, 'most market operators compare the yield of OATS with the cash flow yield of companies', says Ms Monique Cohen, equity director at Paribas, and by this measure she says the Paris bourse is now overvalued by as much as 20 per cent. The significant correction of around 10 per cent in French shares in the second quarter of this year has been balanced by the fact that long-term rates are again heading upwards. All eyes, therefore, are on the first-half results which French companies are now beginning to report. 'We are at the stage of seeing whether companies really did perform this year as the bourse anticipated they would in the first half', says Mr Guillaume Beau, head of equity services at Cholet Dupont. The first signs have not been particularly promising, with such blue chip companies like Elf-Aquitaine, the oil group, and Danone, the food group, turning in first half decreases in net profits of 10 and 7.8 per cent respectively. But barring any further big disappointments that could cause a collapse in the market, Ms Cohen expects to see the CAC 40 index recover modestly to end this year at around the 2,100 level. It would be perverse for the stock market to continue to fall if the general economy continues to rise. Unshaken by the latest interest rate rises, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, confirmed this week that the government had revised its 1994 growth estimate up from 1.4 to 2 per cent in real terms, in line with international forecasts. In itself, this is not going to give a boost to the bourse which, as Mr Beau points out, built its anticipations of recovery into share prices last year. Nor does Prime Minister Edouard Balladur seem to set to give the economy the sort of fiscal stimulus that one might have expected eight months away from the presidential election in which he is a candidate. The 1995 budget which he is due to unveil on September 21 will be largely aimed at deficit reduction, using any margin provided by economic recovery to lower social security charges rather than income or corporate taxes. But corporate France is, for the most part, fairly flush with cash. A recent report by the Banque Nationale de Paris predicts that 'the return to a annual rate of GDP growth of 2 per cent should permit a cyclical rebound in productivity (almost 2 per cent a year) against a background of moderate growth in wages (2.5 per cent)'. Companies' cash positions have also benefited from 'the scissor effect' this year of steadily rising turnover and of continued destocking, the bank says. However, market analysts remain choosy. In very general terms, Mr Beau says that industrial stocks are to be preferred over financial institutions, many of which are still catching up on the bad loan provisions they should have made earlier. Among industrials, he shares with Ms Cohen a preference 'at this stage in the recovery' for makers of capital equipment and heavy industrial goods, in which French manufacturers are expected to increase their investment. These preferences also include the car sector. Yesterday's announcement by Renault that it had more than doubled its first-half pre-tax profits to FFr1.7bn clearly puts the vehicle group in pole position, at the start of its race to be privatised this autumn ahead of the AGF insurance group that had been scheduled to be sold first. Some observers, however, feel that a contributory reason for this year's bourse decline is that, recently, too much paper has been put on the market and that this, in turn, could hamper autumn privatisations. The level of new issues and capital increases in the first eight months of this year was FFr30.7bn, compared to FFr27bn in the whole of 1993. On the other hand, officials at the Paris bourse see this as reflecting the intrinsic health of their market, where average daily volume this year has been FFr4.64bn compared to FFr3.82bn last year. This is despite the fact that trading only averaged FFr3.3bn a day last month, or only about a quarter of what was traded a year ago in the immediate wake of the 1993 monetary crisis. Several measures, meanwhile, have now been taken to ensure that most French shares are henceforth traded in Paris. Following the abolition of the bourse tax for non-residents, and the placing of a FFr4,000 ceiling on that tax for residents, Paris is to provide instant quotes for trades in blocks of FFr1m shares or more in its 53 most international stocks from September 19. This, the bourse hopes, will repatriate most block trades in French shares from London.</p>

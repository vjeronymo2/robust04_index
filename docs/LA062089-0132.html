			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VATICAN PICKS 5 LAYMEN TO RUN TROUBLED BANK  </P> <P> The Vatican today turned over the management of its scandal-tainted bank to  financial experts not connected with the clergy, ending the 20-year presidency  of American Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus.  </P> <P> A U.S. businessman and bankers from Italy, Spain, Switzerland and West Germany  were named to the bank's supervisory board. They will select a director and  deputy director, also laymen.  </P> <P> "In principle, laymen should be more competent in financial affairs than  clerics," said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.  </P> <P> The appointments take effect immediately, Navarro said. They were the latest  step in a sweeping management reform announced in March that also established a  special commission of five cardinals for the bank, which is formally called the  Institute for Religious Works.  </P> <P> The reform abolished the post of president, which has been held since 1969 by  the 67-year-old Marcinkus, a native of Cicero, Ill.  </P> <P> Marcinkus, long a Vatican power, retains another post, the equivalent of deputy  governor of the Vatican city-state.  </P> <P> Warrants for the arrest of Marcinkus and two lay Vatican bank officials were  issued in 1987 after Italian prosecutors charged them with being accessories to  the fraudulent bankruptcy of Banco Ambrosiano, a Milan-based bank that  collapsed in 1982.  </P> <P> But the arrests never were carried out. Italy's Constitutional Court ruled that  a Vatican-Italian treaty precluded any interference by Italian authorities in  the affairs of the Vatican, an independent city-state.  </P> <P> The Vatican denied wrongdoing in the collapse of Banco Ambrosiano but agreed in  1984 to pay $250 million to its creditors.  </P> <P> Named to the supervisory board were Angelo Caloia, chairman of Italy's  Mediocredito Lombardo; Philippe De Weck, former chairman of Union Bank of  Switzerland; Jose A. Sanchez Asiain, co-chairman of Spain's Banco Bilbao  Vizcaya; Theodor E. Pietzcker, a director of West Germany's Deutsche Bank, and  Thomas M. Macioce, former chairman and chief executive officer of Allied Stores  Corp. in New York.  </P></p>

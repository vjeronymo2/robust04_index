			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / German printers win 5.8% rise WEST German publishers yesterday approved an arbitrator's 5.8 per cent pay award for 225,000 print workers. The increase went beyond what was economically justified, the employers said. They agreed only because they wanted to avoid increasing the damage already caused by a week of warning strikes which had disrupted production of many newspapers. Together with a simultaneous deal on the same terms for 2.7m retailing staff, the settlement in effect wound up this year's wages round, and spelt an end to industrial unrest - at least for 1992. Meanwhile, IG Chemie, the chemical industry union, agreed to ask in its impending negotiations for an increase above the current inflation rate of 4.6 per cent. The printing and retailing agreements further demonstrated the influence of the metal working industry over the whole of Germany's private sector. Three big industries have now settled since the IG Metall union accepted 5.8 per cent on behalf of almost 4m engineers this week. The IG Chemie claim suggests a more open-minded approach to negotiations than was apparent in the earlier rounds. Most other unions went into talks demanding increases of around 10 per cent. Settlements have been around 6 per cent. The only big strike, which paralysed many public services for 11 days earlier this month, ended with an average 5.4 per cent award for rubbish collection workers, public transport and postal staff. The oTV union leadership, which had demanded a package worth up to 11 per cent, has since come under heavy fire from members, who rejected the award in a subsequent ballot. The union council, which meets on Monday, is expected to override the ballot result and call off all action. Germany's money supply growth continued to exceed the Bundesbank's target range by a wide margin in April, but the rate of expansion showed a slight slowdown from the high March level, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. The German central bank said yesterday M3, the broad monetary aggregate, grew at an annualised rate of 8.8 per cent last month compared with 9.4 per cent in March (revised downwards from a preliminary 9.7 per cent) and 8.7 per cent in February.</p>

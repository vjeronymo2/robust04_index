Certain proposals cut no  ice with me, they leave me absolutely cold. Those putting them  forward should also be explaining where they are planning to get  the money to finance such a nonsensical operation." Luigi  Spaventa, one of our top economists, who is temporarily lending  the Ciampi government a hand in the capacity of budget minister,  displayed his habitual sense of fair play. He wanted to avoid  direct polemics with [Fininvest President] Silvio Berlusconi or  with any of the others who, over the past few days, have been  riding the idea of drastically reducing the tax burden on  citizens. However, he was unable to conceal his annoyance at  such facile demagoguery. As a good economist, he is used to  reasoning with figures and tables. He placed one of the latter  under our nose. It contained comparisons between several  different nations. The minister remarked: "A tax burden  equivalent to 47 percent of the GDP is mentioned. I do not know  where these figures come from. In fact, we are around 40  percent, a little below the EEC average. There will be no room  to maneuver," he added, "until we bring the public debt in line  with our GDP. The tax burden could only be reduced now through  unsustainable and unthinkable cuts in the benefits provided by  the government for families."    [Schettino] Minister, some proposals may perhaps have a very  demagogic flavor, but the tax burden has reached intolerable  levels in our country. Should the government not be more  courageous and reduce the taxes paid by citizens?    [Spaventa] I believe any and every taxpayer would like to  see  his tax bill reduced. There is a big gap, however, between what  is desirable and what is actually feasible. It is misleading to  make people believe that the tax burden can be eased without  saying how this would be offset. Those advocating a reduction  of the tax burden to 35 percent must clearly tell citizens that  this would require cutting expenditure by 6.7 percentage points.  Cuts would all have to center on child benefit since we have  already scraped the bottom of the barrel in the other sectors.  Expenditure on interest can be reduced only if we continue to  have a credible position on the financial markets, and this  implies interest rate cuts. Coercive measures to reduce public  expenditure are out of the question.    [Schettino] If a reduction is not possible, then at least a  tax burden ceiling could be set by amending the Constitution...    [Spaventa] Considering how Article 81 of the Constitution  (according to which government expenditure must always be  covered -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) has been implemented, I  am very skeptical about ceilings being decided on paper. I have  more faith in the thrust provided by movements, and such a  thrust makes any further increase of the tax burden impossible  at present.    [Schettino] In the meantime, however, every month employees  are forced to pay well over half their salaries in taxes and  social security contributions. Is this not too much, in your  view? Is it really unthinkable to grant a tax reduction?    [Spaventa] A reduction of direct taxation is certainly  appropriate. Taxation rates are too high in our country. We  must be clear, however, that any such reduction would have to be  funded through new taxes, possibly in the form of indirect  taxation, or through cuts in expenditure.    [Schettino] Nevertheless, in a period of recession such as  the present one, should tax payers not be getting a heavier pay  packet so as to stimulate consumer demand, and thus revive the  economy?    [Spaventa] Unless we close the gap between the public debt  and the GDP, fiscal policy cannot be used to sustain the  economic cycle. This gap between the mountain of accumulated  debts that we are carrying on our backs, and the country's  wealth, must be set at a sustainable level for the economy. If  we attempted to follow an expansion policy at present, this  would only have negative effects, and we would have to foot a  very high bill in terms of interest rates. I would like to  point out, however, that despite these binding limitations, the  government gave back over 1.1 trillion lire [L] under the  heading "fiscal drag." It reduced the tax burden for people  buying their first home by L1 trillion. In addition, despite  the fact that the income from certain sources, such as IVA  [value-added tax] and social contributions, fell short of  estimates by close to L3 trillion by the end of 1993, the  government decided not to decree new taxes.    [Schettino] What about the L6.8-trillion maneuver? What  about the increases in IVA and the price of gasoline -- are  these not new taxes?    [Spaventa] These taxes were announced a long time ago, and  they form an integral part of economic policy for 1994. They do  not represent an unforseen increase. I would like to remind  those who now appear shocked and suprised at the measures  decided by the cabinet on 29 December, that already in mid-July  the programing document and Finance Bill were referring to the  need for a tax package at the end of the year. Subsequently, in  September, this statement of intent was transformed into one of  the articles in the provisions attached to the 1994 Finance  Bill. The article in question, including a specific budgetary  allocation, was duly approved by parliament. To say now that we  have suddenly introduced an umpteenth tax increase is to deny  the facts.    [Schettino] Indeed, the end of the year maneuver had already  been announced. However, some consternation was caused by the  realization that one of its key elements was in fact an  umpteenth increase in the price of gasoline.    [Spaventa] We had to choose between a higher IVA increase or  raising the price of gasoline. I thought it would be more  appropriate to act on gasoline since it has only a very slight  inflationist impact on the economy, given the drop in oil prices.    [Schettino] One last question: Will a further, mid-year  package, including further cuts in expenditure, really be  necessary?    [Spaventa] Anyone speaking of a further package would do so  in a purely personal capacity. We are still in January and it  is too early to say what will happen. I can only say now that,  as regards certain obligatory expenditure items, such as wages  and pensions, no interventions are possible in the course of the  year. But let us not start crossing the bridge before we get  there.</p>

			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Euro Disney shares tumble Euro Disney, the troubled leisure group, yesterday saw its shares fall sharply as concern mounted about the prospects for its financial rescue plans after an inconclusive creditors meeting in Paris. The shares, which have been highly volatile since last autumn when the full extent of the group's financial problems became apparent, fell by 7.5 per cent to close FFr2.70 lower at FFr33.50. The fall was helped by the announcement that Euro Disney fell further into the red in the quarter to December 31 with a net loss of FFr553m (Dollars 93.09m) against FFr423m in the same period of 1992. Euro Disney's banks had originally hoped to use the meeting as a forum to finalise plans for their strategy in the rescue talks. But KPMG Peat Marwick, their auditor, was unable to complete its financial analysis in time. The banks now plan to meet later this month when KPMG has completed its report. KPMG's preliminary analysis of Euro Disney's position does not differ greatly from information released to the banks by Walt Disney, its US parent company. However, sources said its initial estimates suggest that the group may need a capital injection of around FFr12bn to reduce its FFr20.3bn net debt, slightly more than Walt Disney's suggestion of FFr10bn.</p>

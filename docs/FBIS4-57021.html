			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Zapatist National Liberation Army </F> Subcommander Marcos by Hermann Bellinghausen in Guadalupe  Tepeyac, Chiapas State, on 6 May]    [Text] "From the beginning, we noticed the government has  indicated clearly that it is hard-liners who are imposing their  will," EZLN [Zapatist National Liberation Army] Subcommander  Marcos said here during an interview. Marcos added: "If there  is no democracy, a civil war will ensue in Mexico." The  government "is making a mistake again by taking a hard-line  position," Marcos reiterated.    The morning after the meeting between Peace Commissioner  Manuel Camacho Solis, mediator Samuel Ruiz, and EZLN  representatives, Subcommander Marcos commented on the meeting  and analyzed the situation. First, he said: "We agreed to meet  on EZLN territory for security reasons."    Subsequently, he mentioned three issues that were discussed.  First, each party talked about what each member of the San  Cristobal peace talks had done. Second, they discussed the  national and regional situations. Third, they reviewed the next  steps to take.    Marcos summed this up by saying: The EZLN lauded the courage  demonstrated by the peace commissioner and the mediator to enter  a territory that is not under the federal government's control.  Later, the EZLN conceded that the mediator maintained the  rapport and cleared the way for the dialogue. The commissioner  referred to proposals made by the federal government in the  32-point document and two statements. He has worked hard in  seeking a consensus on the proposals and to discuss investment  and social programs in the various federal organizations. The  EZLN indicated that, in agreement with its latest communique, it  has resumed consultations and that in a strict time limit of  several weeks, it would be ready to resume the dialogue.    In this regard, Marcos believes "it is premature to talk  about the dialogue, or to set a location and date. The EZLN, in  accordance with its tradition, must consult all of its militants  everywhere." In turn, "the committee will issue a statement."    Marcos added: It is possible to finish the consultations. I  do not see why they should be interrupted again. In the  meeting, we reached the conclusion that we must respect and wait  for the EZLN to make its decisions.    Marcos spoke calmly. Throughout the meeting, Major Mario and  Major Moses accompanied him on the same esplanade that witnessed  the meeting between peace negotiators in Chiapas yesterday. We  are facing that "different" juncture Monsignor Ruiz mentions so  often. It is a time that appears to move slowly, but that [words  indistinct] speed-up mechanisms themselves.    Marcos said: As we speak, consultations are progressing in  communities located in the depths of the jungle, and we expect  answers some time next week.    Marcos also expressed his concern over the national  situation. A process of political peace and negotiation does  not exist, Marcos stated categorically. Marcos summed it up  this way: "The federal Army's efforts to support the process,  remain on the sidelines, and avoid doing anything that might  hinder negotiations were acknowledged during the meeting."    Marcos said: "Both the mediator and the commissioner said  the  federal Army has withdrawn its troops, and this shows that the  sectors involved are continuing the peace process.  Subsequently, we talked."    Marcos continued by saying: We certainly had a more  pessimistic view of the national situation. Regarding the  federal Army, we reiterated that there had not been such a  withdrawal of troops. More soldiers have been deployed in the  state than in January. But the Army's attitude has changed,  avoiding provocations that emerged after the dialogue. Both  officials and soldiers have showed more understanding vis-a-vis  the causes of our uprising, but a reduction in the number of  troops certainly has not occurred. Their belligerence has  diminished, and we welcomed that change in attitude, but without  conceding a reduction in troops because, as far as we know,  there has only been a redeployment.    Marcos added that, regarding the latest government  decisions,  EZLN followers told Camacho and Ruiz: The issue is not merely  the seeking of peaceful as opposed to violent solutions. From  the beginning, we have noticed the government has indicated  clearly that it is hard-liners who are imposing their will.    According to Marcos, the situation does not seem to be  heading "toward a process of political peace and democratization  that will eventually become a solution to the EZLN problem, but  everything seems to indicate that the government is preparing to  resolve this problem by force.    Examples of this include: "The government's major  administrative and police efforts are being channeled into  repressive measures, the purchase of war material, and the  creation of this new super-secretariat, headed by Farell, that  replaces Cordoba Montoya. All repression has been focused on one  person who has stood out in trying to smother the country's most  important sector, namely, the labor sector."    The Zapatist analysis prompts concern. Here is what Marcos  said: If there is no democracy, regardless of the Zapatist Army  and its political and military role, there will be a civil war  in the country. The government is making a mistake again by  taking a hard-line position against the people's demands, as if  this were the solution to problems. We mentioned at the meeting  that the government was making a mistake in its assessment and  that the results would be a civil war in Mexico. We insist that  this assessment is wrong.    At this point Marcos believes the political road of  negotiations should be followed, not the road of force. Marcos  said: As opposed to the Zapatist Army, with which one can talk  even though it does not have a face, in the case of a civil war  there will be no control, security will not count, and there  will be no one to talk to.    Marcos reiterated that the main problem is the lack of  democracy, "and even if the Zapatist Army is wiped out, this  will not be the solution, unless it is a revolutionary solution."    He added: "We see with concern the threat of civil war. In  other words, the Zapatist Army sees this as a disaster [de la  chingada]." What is going on in the country "does not convince  anyone," he commented.    The meeting with Commissioner Manuel Camacho and with Bishop  Samuel Ruiz "was brief, lasted only two hours (although  officially it was reported to be seven hours long), and reached  an agreement to "keep the channels of communication open."    Marcos said: "There are provisions to hold meetings such as  this one in safe places, and the only safe place for the  Zapatist Army is in the territory it controls."    Marcos also said: The coming months (May, June, and July)  are  "months of hunger" in the jungle. Planting has just concluded;  there are no crops, no money. Access to assistance and goods  has been cut off by the military cordon. It might be good to  recall, on this occasion, that the people who are going hungry  are also armed.    In addition, it has been learned that the majority of the  humanitarian aid goes to non-Zapatist communities in the jungle,  or it goes to members of organizations such as National Peasant  Confederation and Rural Association of Community Interest. No  matter what, the people of the region are headed toward "months  of hunger" in the wake of the military cordon, which is  affecting the life of the community and heightening shortages  and isolation.    Marco indicated: After holding consultations, there will be  a  response if there are conditions that will enable the resumption  of the dialogue. During the meeting, which was not a dialogue,  "rather, it was an exchange of reports," according to Marcos,  other matters were discussed.    Marcos said: Some things were discussed to help broaden  mediation, things that would help maintain the dialogue. One  preliminary step is to extend the gray areas to other points,  given the provocation caused by the presence of belligerent  forces, such as the Altamirano Association of Cattle Breeders.    Once again, reference to Morelia came up, the conflicting  common land next to the seat of that municipality. If peace is  to be established everywhere, this place must also be included.    The subcommander's conclusion about the meeting was that the  session was ephemeral: Nothing specific was agreed upon because  we are waiting for a reply from the consultation.    After the interview concluded, the subcommander told  reporters "off the record" [previous three words in English]  that the PRI candidate is expected to arrive this morning in  Chiapas. At the same time, Commissioner Camacho and Bishop  Samuel Ruiz would be giving their news conference in San  Cristobal. One of Marcos' aides heard this on the radio this  morning.    The PRI is going to haul off all of the reporters to Tuxtla  Gutierrez, Marcos joked. No, they are not going to leave  Camacho alone because they still fear him.    During the conversation with the subcommander, as in other  winds that blow in the southeast, a clear signal can be seen:  The presidential campaigns and their results, which will come  on 21 August, have no choice but to pass through the state of  Chiapas. National solutions must also pass through here.</p>

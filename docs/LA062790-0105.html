			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHT WING CALLS FOR ELECTIONS ON S. AFRICA REFORMS  </P> <P> South African President Frederik W. de Klerk was warned Tuesday by nine white  right-wing leaders that if he does not hold new elections to show he has white  support for negotiations with the "communist" African National Congress they  will seek to stop him by "other means."  </P> <P> "If the government proceeds on this course and does not call an early election,  then of course the government is closing the constitutional doors.  </P> <P> Obviously, people will be considering how to continue the fight with other  means," said Jaap Marais, leader of the Reformed National Party, and spokesman  for the group.  </P> <P> De Klerk, who is facing mounting right-wing opposition to his reform policies,  met for 90 minutes with four Afrikaner right-wing groups not represented in  Parliament and actively involved in organizing both an armed and political  opposition to the De Klerk government.  </P></p>

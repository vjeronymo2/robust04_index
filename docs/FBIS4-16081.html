			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia continues to stand for the territorial  integrity of Georgia, but believes that the interests of the  multi-ethnic population of Abkhazia should be taken into  account. The point was made by a personal envoy of the Russian  president, Boris Pastukhov, when he returned to Moscow from  Tbilisi on Wednesday.    In Tbilisi he was received by the Georgian head of state  Eduard Shevardnadze. The two sides discussed the settlement of  the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict.    Pastukhov told Interfax that the main thing at the present  stage is to guarantee a lasting ceasefire and the beginning of  the return of refugees because otherwise it is impossible to  resolve other problems.    The diplomat said that unfortunately the probability of the  resumption of hostilities in Abkhazia is still great. He  admitted that there are armed groups in the conflict zone from  Russia but not representing Russia as well as from several other  countries.    Speaking of the need to send a peace-keeping force to the  conflict zone Pastukhov said Moscow would never oppose the  deployment of peace-keepers, if the UN Security Council passed  an appropriate decision. In his opinion there can be different  options, but in any case a peace-keeping operation requires  considerable spending.    "It is impossible to uphold peace with bayonets, fundamental  agreements are necessary to prevent the resumption of  hostilities and they must be observed", Pastukhov emphasized.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Marshalls makes Pounds 20m cash call to fund low cost acquisitions A SECOND building materials company within a week has announced a rights issue to finance acquisitions. Marshalls, the Halifax-based concrete, stone and clay products is proposing to raise Pounds 20m. Mr Andrew Marshall, chairman, said the company proposed to take advantage of low selling prices for building material businesses at the bottom of the construction cycle. Shareholders are being offered 27.7m shares on a 1-for-5 basis at 75p. Holders of the convertible preference can take up 18 shares for every 125 preference held. The group also reported slightly lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.5m in the 12 months to the end of March compared with Pounds 12.7m. Turnover fell from Pounds 184.4m to Pounds 174.4m. The shares rose by 1p to close at 98p following yesterday's announcement. Last week Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement company announced plans to raise Pounds 241.6m in a rights issue. The proceeds were to be used to acquire Compagnie Internationale du Chauffage (Celsius), France's biggest manufacturer of domestic heating equipment. Marshalls said that it had identified several possible 'in-fill' acquisitions to increase its range of concrete and clay products and take it into parts of Britain where it currently made little impact. One possible option would be to acquire some of the brick interests in southern England which Redland has been ordered by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission to dispose of following its acquisition of Steetley, a rival building materials group. Mr Marshall said: 'A number of companies are in the process or reorganising and looking to dispose of peripheral and unwanted businesses. Prices for some of these subsidiaries are up to 50 per cent cheaper than they would have been if they had been sold when the UK construction market was at its peak.' At first the rights money would be used to cut net debt from Pounds 41.2m to Pounds 21m, reducing gearing from 42.5 per cent to 18 per cent. Marshalls expected gearing to settle down at about 30 per cent after making acquisitions. A maintained final dividend of 3.75p is proposed making an unchanged total for the year of 5p. Earnings per share were 4.33p (4.88p) basic or 5.9p (6.28p) fully diluted. Mr Marshall said that there were signs that the housing market was beginning to pick up but this had still not shown through in group sales. The outlook for the construction industry remained depressed. COMMENT It makes sense to be considering acquisitions at this stage in the cycle and no doubt there are bargains to be had by the shrewd purchaser. Marshalls, however, has had rather an indifferent investment record recently. The Armitage brick business was acquired at an inflated price at the top of the cycle while the lossmaking Trent jetfloor concrete flooring operation initially struck serious technical problems. These largely have been resolved but sales are now suffering as a result of the collapse of commercial and industrial property markets in the UK. The rights shares, however, are being sold at a sufficient discount and yield to ensure the success of the issue. The profits outlook continues to look depressed with about a third of group sales ending up in commercial and industrial developments. Pre-tax profits approaching Pounds 13m would put the group on a prospective p/e of about 17, which is high enough at this point.</p>

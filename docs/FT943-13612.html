			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Exchange unveils listings rules The London Stock Exchange yesterday unveiled new rules designed to make it easier for small companies which have been listed on its Unlisted Securities Market to obtain a full exchange listing. The new rules are necessary because the USM is scheduled to close at the end of 1996 and will not accept any new companies from the end of this year. The exchange agreed early last year that the USM was not a viable mechanism to ensure investment in smaller companies. The decision followed the early 1990s' recession during which trading in the smallest companies almost came to a standstill. Earlier this year the exchange announced a seven-point plan to encourage interest in small companies but rejected a call from one of its own advisory panels for an independent small companies exchange. Under the rules announced yesterday those companies which have been listed on the USM for at least two years and are not issuing new securities will be able to avoid the expense of filing full listing particulars, which require the production of statements of working capital and of total indebtedness. They may do so by filing an exempt listing document within 42 days of signing off unqualified accounts in accordance with a new European Union listing particulars directive. The document will contain three years' unqualified accounts, any interim report prepared since the last accounts, any prospectus published within the previous 12 months, a directors' responsibility statement and a letter confirming that the company has complied with all the requirements of the USM.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Personal View: Price fixers need a dose of disclosure Central bankers are the biggest price fixers of all. Day by day they conduct huge operations in the money markets to hold short-term interest rates close to their chosen peg. The top fixer, the US Federal Reserve, has held the key overnight rate at its peg of 3 per cent for more than a year. At least the Federal Reserve is the most accountable among central banks for its actions. The next biggest fixer, the Bundesbank, meets only the lowest standards of accountability. In view of the international importance of its policy actions, these standards need urgently to be improved. The discretionary power now wielded by central banks - either independently or as agents of the finance ministry - in the choice and defence of interest rate pegs is far greater than was historically the case. Under the gold standard, rates floated in response to the scarcity or abundance of metallic reserves. After the demise of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, discretion was limited - at least in the important cases of the Federal Reserve and Bundesbank - by the respect given to money supply targets. Indeed, in the first decade of the floating D-Mark-dollar rate, from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, the German and US central banks experimented by abandoning any attempt to peg money market rates even over short periods. The stimulus to this experimentation was a rapid acceleration of inflation. Important overnight rates were allowed to float as the central banks concentrated on hitting the target set for growth in monetary reserves. Once the inflation upsurge passed in the 1980s, experiment gave way to adjustments of interest rates, triggered by any significant deviation of the money supply from the central banks' medium-term targets. The recent loss of respect for monetary targetry has increased central banks' rate-fixing power. Yet the accountability of the rate-fixers, essential for upholding both democratic principles and operating efficiency, is in general poor and in some cases virtually non-existent. Accountability should not be confused with independence. The Bundesbank is renowned for its independence from government. But the accountability of German monetary policy is near zero. Bundesbank council members give speeches and take questions at press conferences. But the minutes of the council's deliberations become public only after a 30-year lag. Further, they are so concisely edited as to leave out some of the detail in which market participants and monetary historians are keenly interested. Bundesbank council members do not have to cope with questions from any parliamentary body. No freedom of information legislation applies whereby academic critics could sift through the record and examine Bundesbank efficiency in setting monetary policy. Perhaps the biggest error in recent German monetary history was the Bundesbank's failure to raise its discount rate for nearly a year after the announcement of monetary union between East and West Germany in February 1990. Yet the reasoning behind this mistake has not been revealed to the public. What was the attitude when Bundesbank officials, such as the current president, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, were promoted recently? If appointees such as Mr Tietmeyer had been obliged to undergo questioning by a Bundestag committee before confirmation, it would be a spur to good decision-making; and the public might have learnt more about another troubling episode - the raising of the discount rate in July 1992. As we now know, by then the German economy had slipped into recession. The situation for US central bankers could not be more different. The Federal Reserve's misuse of power in 1990-91, when the key overnight rate was adjusted downwards at a glacially slow pace rather than being allowed to fall steeply at once, has been blamed for an unnecessary recession and the subsequent lack-lustre recovery. . Congressional discontent with the Federal Open Market Committee has come to the boil and tough new proposals for accountability are on the table, including full and immediate disclosure of discussions at policy-making meetings. There can be little hope that the European Monetary Institute, likely to be firmly under the wing of the Bundesbank when it is set up in Frankfurt next year, will be a force for increased accountability. To mark a more promising beginning for the new era in European monetary policy-making, the Bundesbank should hang the words of Jeremy Bentham on the wall of its council meeting room: 'Without publicity, no good is permanent.'

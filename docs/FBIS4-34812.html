			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with presidential hopeful Javier </F> Perez de Cuellar by Juan Paredes Castro; in Paris "via  satellite," date not given]    [Text] [Paredes Castro] What is your reaction to the  numerous statements of support for your candidacy?    [Perez de Cuellar] I am deeply grateful to all the national  Peruvian sectors that have asked me to run for president. In  addition to being an honor and a distinction, it also  constitutes a challenge that can only be accepted after a period  of mature meditation. It is not that I am avoiding this  political commitment; during my 10 years as UN secretary  general, I engaged in politics and have witnessed the work of  eminent politicians. Out of a deep sense of responsibility, I am  compelled to carefully weigh the pros and cons of this decision.  Let me assure you, however, that I will inform you very soon  whether I have decided to run for president.    [Paredes Castro] If you run, will it be as an independent or  for a given party?    [Perez de Cuellar] I am, and have always been, a political  independent. I was a member of the Peruvian diplomatic service  for nearly 40 years and as such was obliged to be politically  independent. Being a confirmed democrat, however, I am not  adverse to political parties. I do not exclude them nor ignore  them because they have the indispensable duty of guiding the  people, representing them and defending their interests.  Political parties are the essence of democracy. Specifically, to  answer your question, I would choose to be an independent  candidate.    [Paredes Castro] How do you view the country's situation?    [Perez de Cuellar] It would take a long time to fully answer  your question. There have been important improvements in the  last four years: The country has been reinserted into the  international economic community, a certain economic stability  has been achieved, and terrorism has been considerably reduced.  We are still faced with many serious problems: Increasing  unemployment, a serious stagnation of our exports, agriculture  and mining face a difficult situation and, worse still, the  impoverishment of the majority is increasing. All this  undermines the success of the current economic model. I wish to  make it perfectly clear that this is not a question of changing  our macroeconomic policy which is in line with an almost  universal trend. I must remind you that while I was the UN  secretary general in 1990, I helped President Fujimori to  enforce this policy in Peru. We must avoid becoming fanatical or  ultra-neoliberal, and especially careful to avoid becoming more  fanatical than the leaders of the World Bank or the IMF.    I believe we must streamline public expenses without  altering  the macroeconomic balance; we must increase social spending and  invest in Peruvian citizens. If we are to safeguard and  consolidate what has been achieved in economics and in domestic  security, we must immediately pay heed to our social emergencies.    [Paredes Castro] Could you give some examples?    [Perez de Cuellar] The first thing that comes to my mind is  education. To invest in education is to invest in the future.  Education is the key to sustainable development. Youth should be  a priority area for upcoming Peruvian administrations: We must  train for the future, and this starts in schools and  universities. Preferably we must center our attention on  teachers. What is the point of building schools if we lack  teachers? What if the teachers we have available are discouraged  and poorly paid? Education is, undoubtedly, one of the least  favored areas in Peru.    Decentralization is another concerning issue. The executive  branch must delegate power at the departmental, provincial, and  district levels. Mayors elected by the people should have the  means to undertake the needs of their cities and residents. I  believe decentralization is the best way to achieve integration.    I would also like to mention the need to consolidate basic  institutions like the judiciary, the Armed Forces, the National  Police, and the Diplomatic Service, which must adopt their own  institutional regulations and must refrain from arbitrary  measures and avoid becoming politicized.    [Paredes Castro] How do you assess appeals for a national  consensus?    [Perez de Cuellar] In view of the serious problems affecting  the country, a national consensus is indispensable. By consensus  I mean different or opposing national opinions should agree on  common national objectives. This does not entail a unanimous  decision or a majority decision. Through negotiations, each  group should yield something toward a desired general agreement.  I believe the next president should strive to achieve a  consensus with Congress and thus solve the serious problems  affecting the country. The interrelation of the branches of  government will give Peru lasting stability and the  governability it needs. Moreover, we should not overlook the  advantage of consensus among the government, business, and labor.    [Paredes Castro] You have mentioned clear electoral rules.  What do you have in mind?    [Perez de Cuellar] We have already reinserted our country in  international economic circles. We must now reinserted it as a  democracy at the continental and international level. To achieve  this we must enforce an impeccable democratic system and an  irreproachable implementation of human rights. The free  expression of the will of the people is the basis of democracy.  If this will is to be undisputed, we must have absolutely clean  elections with very clear rules of play and absolute guarantees  of impartiality. This involves the Electoral Court, the Armed  Forces, and the National Police, which is fulfilling its role of  safeguarding security through its arduous fight against  terrorism and drug trafficking.    [Paredes Castro] Reports of your candidacy continuously  appear in the press....    [Perez de Cuellar] Ever since my candidacy was mentioned, I  have met in Lima and here, in Paris, with numerous fellow  Peruvians whose ideas and views I have heard with great  interest. I want to explain, nevertheless, that for the time  being the only reports and opinions that reflect my thoughts are  those which I make personally, like in this interview.</p>

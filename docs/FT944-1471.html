			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Observer: Passing the hat Nigel Whittaker, the energetic Kingfisher director and chairman-elect of the British Retail Consortium, is irritated that public references to cash being given to the Tory party gives the impression that Labour gets nothing from companies. Whittaker says his own company is this year giving the Tories Pounds 25,000  - disclosed in the company's annual report  - and also providing Labour with some Pounds 14,000, in the form of sponsorship and advertising. Whittaker reckons that Blair's boys may soon be doing very nicely from undisclosed corporate munificence, and plans to canvass his fellow retail directors to ask them how much their companies surreptitiously give Labour. Time, surely, for a Liberal Democrat to put forward a private member's bill banning any and all form of corporate donation to any political party?</p>

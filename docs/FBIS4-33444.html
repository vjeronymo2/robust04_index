			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irma Caceres] </F>   [Text] The U.S. Government has given top priority to the  50th anniversary of D-Day, which marked the opening of the  second European front against the Germans in World War II, or so  President William Clinton has demonstrated.    It would seem that the White House is seeking to restore the  Americans' role in military operations abroad or otherwise  strengthen the continuity of this policy, which is such a  sensitive issue for the current Democratic administration, given  the cases of Bosnia, Somalia, and perhaps Haiti.    U.S. troops landed on the French coast of Normandy on 6 June  1944 when the forces of the former USSR had already defeated the  German Empire. Military experts' opinions on this event differ  broadly. Many consider the opening of the second front an action  belated by at least two years, when the strategic initiative was  in the hands of the Soviets, who had paid a high price in  material losses and lives.    Others agree that the actual prospect of a German defeat at  Soviet hands and a future change in the correlation of forces  was undoubtedly the factor that determined the opening of the  second front. This allowed the United States, at the end of the  war and without having contributed much, to actively participate  in the division of the spoils and the theft of minds.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Unilever expansion in eastern Europe UNILEVER, the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group, is expanding its presence in eastern Europe with the acquisition of Povltavska Tukove Zavody (PTZ), a Czech state-owned producer of edible oils, fats, toilet soap and skin cream. Unilever will pay more than Dollars 10m (Pounds 5.8m) for 100 per cent of PTZ, which had sales in excess of Dollars 20m last year. Unilever has also agreed to invest Dollars 15m over two years to modernise the Czech plant, which will produce a range of Unilever's international brands. The acquisition will strengthen Unilever's position in the Czechoslovak consumer goods market, where its is competing with Proctor &amp; Gamble of the US and Henkel of Germany. Both of these companies recently formed joint ventures in the country to sell locally-produced and imported products. Mr Hans Eggerstedt, Unilever's commercial director, said the company would continue to invest in eastern Europe and hoped to have sales of Pounds 700m in the region by 1997. Unilever last year paid Dollars 20m for a detergent factory in Poland, in which it will invest a further Dollars 24m. Earlier this year it bought an ice-cream maker in Hungary and plans to acquire a second plant, making edible oils, together with Ferruzzi of Italy. 'Our aim is to target the national markets. We are not here to simply create a low-cost manufacturing base and re-export to the European community' Mr Eggerstedt said.</p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / London Stock Exchange: Widespread gains follow funding plan A BUOYANT session in UK equities became one of the strongest performances this year after sterling rallied sharply yesterday afternoon on plans for an Ecu10bn currency support funding by the British government. The unexpected move, announced shortly before the important Maastricht debate on French television, was regarded in the stock market as a sign of a determined campaign by European political leaders to secure support for the Maastricht proposals. The FT-SE Index closed 68.9 up at 2,381.9 after the UK market had joined in the strong advance across European bourses. The gain in the Footsie was the largest daily advance since the last day of 1991, with the exception of the 136.2 surge which followed re-election of the Conservative government in April this year. Equities had opened higher behind gains in stock markets in Tokyo and New York. Marketmakers' positions were squeezed as sentiment was also helped by the absence of any rate move at the Bundesbank's policy meeting, and by a flow of more satisfactory trading results from UK companies. The Footsie was already about 35 points up ahead of the UK funding announcement. Firmness in the dollar encouraged US-orientated stocks and an early improvement in sterling had eased interest rate fears. But the market went wild as the Ecu funding, completely unexpected in London, was seen as an impressive strengthening of sterling's defences. The leap in share prices following the Treasury announcement reflected hectic activity by marketmaking firms, which were caught very badly short of stock and suffered substantial losses. One brave house managed to operate a trading programme during the excitement. The leading US house with bear positions in the September contract on the Footsie was badly mauled as the contract raced in the direction of 2,400. Traders and analysts alike were stunned by the Ecu funding proposal and it was some time before the full implications were comprehended. There were the usual complaints from brokers that it had become extremely difficult to deal. Once again, bargain sizes were strictly enforced by marketmaking houses, although there was no sign of any change in normal Seaq screen quotations. Equity turnover, which had been trundling along at around 300m shares at midsession, had jumped to 551.3m by the close. Wednesday's 431.6m-share Seaq turnover again reflected low retail interest, at only Pounds 752.6m. Traders believe that retail, or customer, business in equities was restrained yesterday because the institutions were busy digesting the implications of the Ecu funding. But market dealers will be watching carefully for indications of institutional demand for UK shares today. The final spur to the London market came when Wall Street, after a slow start, showed an early gain of 20 Dow points. UK securities firms expect to face a difficult opening to equity dealing this morning. But the funding news was regarded as a welcome move.</p>

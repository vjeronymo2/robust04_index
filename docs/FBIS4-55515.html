			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shefqet Rexhepi on news conference given by </F> Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of Kosova, in  Prishtina on 13 May: "Kosova at the Geneva Ministerial Meeting"]    [Text] Serbian repression, concentrated particularly on  the outskirts of Kosova towns, continued last week, with  house-searches on the pretext of looking for weapons,  accompanied by cases of maltreatment and arrests in the communes  of Malisheve, Istog, Gllogovc, Mitrovice, Gjilan, Ferizaj,  Kline, Kamenice, Prishtina, etc. Repression against Albanian  schools also continued, as in the case of Istog, besides  repression against the Albanian Teachers' Alliance, the Gjakove  Finance Council, and Kosovar sport, The gunshots at Kodra e  Diellit in Prishtina, i.e. within the city, were a serious and  very significant incident. There were also forced evictions  from apartments.    Last week was also characterized by movements of the Serbian  army through Kosova, on the pretext of exercises. In fact this  was a threat to the population of Kosova. The commander of the  Third Army in Nis himself admitted the nature of this threat,  saying that these exercises are being conducted with the aim of  preventing an uprising of the Albanian populace or to maintain  peace in Kosova, despite the well-known fact that the Albanians  have declared themselves in favor of a peaceful solution to the  problem of Kosova. These threats are a bad omen, and we  therefore draw the international community's attention to the  consequences they may entail. Ibrahim Rugova, president of the  republic of Kosova, began yesterday's news conference in  Prishtina with these comments.  <H5>  Sali Berisha's Important Visit to Romania </H5>   Kosova continues to be at the center of attention of  international institutions and different world figures. Dr.  Ibrahim Rugova welcomed the recent CSCE statement on Kosova and  the debate in the U.S. Congress and in the Foreign Affairs  Committee chaired by Hamilton, which had devoted particular  attention to Kosova. Dr. Ibrahim Rugova went on to welcome the  very important visit of Sali Berisha, president of the Republic  of Albania, to Romania, also appreciating his commitment to  solving the question of Kosova. After expressing the hope that  the question of Kosova will be placed on the agenda of the  ministerial meeting to be held in Geneva, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova  again demanded that Kosova be placed under the supervision of  the international community.    President Rugova went on to reply to journalists' questions.  Asked about the Serbian rulers' threats to ban the activities of  the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK] Dr. Ibrahim Rugova stressed  that there had been demands to ban the LDK ever since it  started, and there were also such demands last year. In the  context of the question of banning this party, the so-called  prefect of Kosova Simovic also mentioned Hogg. The British  Embassy in Belgrade has meanwhile issued a denial that the  question of registering the LDK had been discussed during his  visit to Prishtina. Threats to ban the activities of the  largest political party in Kosova are a highly dangerous step.  This shows a tendency to destroy political life in Kosova.    A ban of the LDK would be the most serious kind of  provocation of the Albanians. This would not be a wise step for  the Serbian regime, and this party will continue its work. A  Serbian journalist asked whether the party would be registered.  There is no question of registration, President Rugova said.  We were registered under the former Yugoslav federation, of  which we were a part when the Kosova authorities were suspended.  This is merely a game and a pretext to ban this party. The  Serbian regime should therefore think carefully about this as it  is a dangerous step.  <H5>  We Must Be Careful </H5>   Asked what he thought about the talks conducted by foreign  delegations with people who have no legitimacy, Dr. Ibrahim  Rugova stressed that all the delegations that come from abroad  talk to the relevant personalities and institutions in Kosova,  to me, to the LDK and other parties, and to various people in  order to learn their views. This is normal. There have been no  attempts to identify some other party in order to achieve  something different. It is in the meantime well known who  possesses legitimacy in Kosova. On the basis of the elections,  we possess our authorities and institutions. The next questioner  said that criticisms are being raised against peaceful  resistance. There are demands for a more active resistance, and  even the organization of demonstrations. Dr. Ibrahim Rugova  said that we receive these criticisms in the spirit of the  differences of opinion displayed in relation to our movement.  Our movement has been called passive, but it is not passive; on  the contrary, it is active. This is shown by our political and  institutional organization and the organization of our life.  The patience we have shown when faced with the violence and  murders that take place in Kosova is also active resistance, and  is appreciated by the world. Not out of fear, but because of  the situation in which we find ourselves, it must be stressed  that even peaceful demonstrations are dangerous, and we must  therefore be careful.    As for the question of whether the question of Kosova will  be  raised at the ministerial meeting in Geneva, President Rugova  stressed that the request has been made for Kosova to be treated  at this meeting, because there can be no comprehensive solution  for the former Yugoslavia without a solution for the problem of  Kosova. Despite the tragic problem of Bosnia, we hope that  Kosova too will be on the agenda at this meeting, he stressed.  Asked whether any confusion persists regarding the visit of  British Minister of State Douglas Hogg to Kosova, Dr. Ibrahim  Rugova said that there is no confusion for us. His visit and  the statement he made in Kosova were very important for us.  These were the reasons why attempts were made to incriminate  and cast aspersions on his visit. He was one of the  highest-level figures to visit Kosova, which is very important  for us, president Rugova emphasized.  <H5>  It Is Known Who Performs Ethnic Cleansing </H5>   Asked about Milosevic's statement that it was the Albanians  who first started ethnic cleansing, Dr. Ibrahim Rugova said that  it is well known who started ethnic cleansing. I will go no  further than to recall the period between the two world wars  when Cubrilovic and Andric drew up plans for the emigration of  the Albanians. They were deported to Turkey, and these programs  were carried out after the war too. The case of Bosnia best  shows who is carrying out purges. This is clear to the world.  However, when the question of Kosova is raised before the  international public, the Albanians are accused of something  they have never done. Quiet ethnic cleansing is taking place in  Kosova, in that Albanians are leaving because of the violence to  which they are subjected. Serbia showed who is carrying out  purges when warnings came of the repatriation of Albanians from  some Western countries.    Commenting on this statement by Milosevic, Professor Dr.  Fehmi Agani recalled the statement by Karadzic, who said that he  had not bombarded the civilian population in Brcko. Sarajevo  was surrounded and bombarded for two years, but the other side  denied this. This is a manner of thinking that on the one hand  ignores facts and on the other despises and shows contempt for  the public, who are told to "listen to what I say."</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Review of the Week" program] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Correspondent Vitaliy Buzuyev]  Deputy Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, in a telephone  interview with our correspondent, said the following:    [Begin Lavrov recording] As far as an ultimatum is  concerned, we have already set out our position, and President  Yeltsin and the Russian foreign minister have stressed -- and so  has the chairman of the government -- that an ultimatum is not  the way we consider it is necessary to act in this situation.  We have not recognized NATO's ultimatum, and we have stressed  the need to work within the framework of the UN Security Council  resolutions. These resolutions, as is known, state the need for  all sides to take measures to lift the blockade of Sarajevo and  they warn the sides that, in the event of the UN peacekeeping  forces coming under attack, these forces will respond and will  receive support. Only in these instances can the use of force  be permitted, and we have explained this in detail in our  statements. We have also counterposed attempts to, so to speak,  solve matters by an ultimatum with a policy toward political  work and vigorous diplomatic actions which have, generally  speaking, brought results. Incidentally, we put forward the  idea of lifting the blockade of Sarajevo quite some time ago --  if you want to be exact, we were speaking about it last year  when we proposed more than once that the Security Council should  be convened precisely to examine the question of lifting the  blockade of Sarajevo, which is the key to a solution to the  whole Bosnian problem. [end recording]    [Buzuyev] In the opinion of many observers, the Russian  initiative restores our country's position as a player which  should be reckoned with in the international arena. Whether we  are too late will become clear in the next few days or even  hours.</p>

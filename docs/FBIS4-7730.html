			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the </F> Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, with unidentified  correspondent-- live]    [Text] [Correspondent] Our guest this evening is Jadranko  Prlic, the prime minister of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.  Good evening, and Happy Easter.    [Prlic] Thank you, the same to you and to all Croatian TV  viewers.    [Correspondent] A slightly provocative question to start  with: Does the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna and its government  still exist after the adoption of the Constitution?    [Prlic] Yes. In accordance with the adopted Constitution of  the federation, all transitional legal arrangements are valid in  this period until the elections are held or, in other words,  until the Constitution agreement has been fully implemented.    [Correspondent] How do you view some statements--for  example,  the one by Ivo Komsic, that Herceg-Bosna is some kind of a para-  state--something that is comparable to the so-called Krajina in  Croatia? Can some individuals, such as Komsic from Sarajevo,  jeopardize the agreement?    [Prlic] We adhere to our own policy, and we know what we are  doing. Such statements cannot dispute the rights of the Croat  people, which are most fully protected by the very creation and  existence of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.    [Correspondent] Would you say that those rights have been  respected over the last month?    [Prlic] Yes, although there have been some attempts--which  was clear in Sarajevo--to say that Herceg-Bosna does not exist,  that its existence is the key cause of the conflict between the  Muslims and Croats. We, of course, have always denied this.  The conflict began with Muslim aggression, and that is  completely clear to everyone.    Another very important thing is an attempt to impose a  feeling of collective guilt upon the Croats for everything that  happened during the last year, which we have also rejected and  have proved just the opposite.    [Correspondent] Croatian Defense Council [HVO] soldiers in  Bosnia-Herzegovina told me when I was in Herzegovina that they  would never have the fleur-de-lys [Bosnian symbol] sown on their  uniforms. Can you comment on that? Also, how long can the  transition to the federation last, and what will it be like?    [Prlic] The fleur-de-lys will not be worn because the  Constitution envisages that all symbols of the Bosniak-Muslim  and Croat federation--the flag, the coat of arms--will be chosen  jointly. The fleur-de-lys is not a state symbol. It remains  the symbol of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina only in the  transitional period. For as long as the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina exists--with the old assembly, presidency,  and government--the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna will also  exist.    [Correspondent] Do you personally believe in a quick  transition, or will it take time?    [Prlic] The transition will last for five or six months. The  starting point was the adoption of the Constitution. Local  elections will be held within five months and federal elections  within six months at the most. We expect that the Constitution  agreement will be fully implemented within that period.    [Correspondent] There are 32,500 Croats in Sarajevo,  according to the church register. Many more of our people live  elsewhere in Bosnia. Are they a forgotten part of the Croat  people, deprived of their rights?    [Prlic] No. Who was looking after all the Croats who live  outside of the territories controlled by the HVO? There are a  lot of examples; one is the care provided for the Croats in  Banja Luka, in the Krajina area [sentence as heard]. We also  reacted sharply to the events in Prijedor. (?We also took care  of) the Croats in Tuzla, Brcko, Zenica, Sarajevo etc. We allow  other positions and views, but we will not go beyond a minimum:  to secure for all Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina the same rights  as those of the other constituent nation in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    [Correspondent] Where is the Sarajevo HVO? We have reports  that the Croat National Council and the Bosnian presidency have  been presenting themselves as representatives to Western guests?  Where is the Sarajevo HVO ?    [Prlic] We installed an HVO headquarters in Sarajevo last  week, and its activities will be in accordance with the  Roso-Delic peace agreement, providing for deployment of our  troops, our security service, and our officers.    [Correspondent] Some say that Croats have limited themselves  to western Herzegovina, that they have forgotten about Sarajevo,  Tuzla, and so on. You have just denied this.    [Prlic] We have not forgotten, simply because the Chamber of  Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is made up of  Croats from all parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina. That is why I  think that such statements are deceitful.    [Correspondent] Some on the Bosniak side are still against  the agreement, and this makes things very difficult. Is there  any dissent on the Croat side, and how would you define it?    [Prlic] Well, resistance to the agreement could be caused by  the understanding of some that we have not achieved as much as  we could have. This agreement is a historical necessity, and  that is how it should be understood. My impression is that a  huge majority of Croats and even more Bosniak Muslims support  the agreement. Some of those against the agreement are  extremist forces in both nations. Some have lost family members  or friends during the war and cannot accept any kind of  agreement with the side that we fought against over the last  year because of the psychological state they are in. However, I  believe that we have good foundations for the implementation of  the agreement. I even believe that the agreement is being  implemented in the field much faster than was expected in the  beginning.    [Correspondent] When I ask you about the future, Mr. Prime  Minister, I would like to know more about business  possibilities. What can the people from prosperous Herzegovina  offer to Croats in Bosnia, since they have been separated thus  far? What can they get?    [Prlic] We have already worked out some 30 reconstruction  projects, particularly in connection with infrastructure,  education, and health. The rest of the program is being  prepared, and I believe that we have to develop an appropriate  system throughout the territory of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  federation in the initial phase. Until now--maybe it is immodest  for me to say this--the only state that exists and that  functions on the territory of Bosnia- Herzegovina is the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna. I am aware how the state system  functions in the territory controlled by the Serbs in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and now I have seen--and I knew previously  from information we had--that such a system does not exist in  factual terms on territory controlled by the Muslim army.    I expect that the deputy prime minister of the Sarajevo  government will come to Mostar this week together with several  other ministers. On this occasion, talks will be held on all  operational matters in connection with the development of the  economic and financial system, on the enabling of the free  movement of goods and capital, and--conditionally--on the  expected arrival of foreign capital--above all, for the  reconstruction of the infrastructure.    [Correspondent] One of my friends is a businessman. When  will he be able to go to Sarajevo, according to you, and open a  factory there? Is there such a possibility, and do you see this  happening soon?    [Prlic] I do. It was, in fact, I who initiated these talks  and the possibility of opening up Sarajevo, and I believe that  in the coming month we will be able to have more serious talks  on this.    We reached agreement in Sarajevo with the military  commanders-- who are already installing their headquarters in  Sarajevo--to rent two or three large buildings in Sarajevo where  we will open a Croatian bank and Croatian insurance company and  make it possible for Croatian factories to establish themselves  to a large extent and to set up the center of their business  operations in Sarajevo. I believe we will achieve this in the  coming month or two, and this will make possible the greater  presence of Croats in the capital of the federation.    [Correspondent] Do you believe personally in the Croats in  Sarajevo and in Tuzla? How do you see the possibility of their  becoming involved and beginning to live?    [Prlic] I believe it is possible. I believe that this  constitutional agreement and the quality-based selection of  personnel for the authorities of the federation will ensure for  them equality and the possibility of full national, economic,  and personal prosperity.    [Correspondent] Mr. Prime Minister, at the end of this  conversation, have you got anything you would like to say to  people in Herceg-Bosna and to people in Bosnia?    [Prlic] I would like to send them word that they are secure,  that Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina takes account of all  Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as those who are in the  territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina and those who are refugees as a  result of the war in these areas. We want to realize our  rights, but not to the detriment of the other nation with whom  we have joined to form the federation, and also not to the  detriment of the third nation that we expect to accept this  agreement in the period ahead. I would like to send word to  them to be patient and to attempt, in the elections that will be  held, to elect those people who can competently represent them  and build a state that will be much better than the one in which  we lived before the war.    [Correspondent] Dr. Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the  Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, thank you for being our guest.    [Prlic] Thank you.</p>

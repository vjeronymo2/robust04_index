			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 28 April (MTI) -- Hungarian Foreign  Minister Geza Jeszenszky at a Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF)  election rally in Budapest's Obuda district on Thursday evening  [28 April], said that the MDF had said in 1989 that Hungary  wanted to return to the European road, and had asked for the  world's support. "Experience shows that although Hungary does  get help from the West, we have to adapt mainly on our own,"  Jeszenszky said.    Jeszenszky said Hungary fosters excellent relations with  four  of its neighbors: Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, and Ukraine.  With good political relations, the rights of minorities are  also regulated by exemplary contracts.    Links with three other states -- Slovakia, Romania, and  Serbia -- are not satisfactory. In this context, Jeszenszky  said Hungarian diplomacy encourages democratic rights for the  Hungarian national minorities living in those countries, in line  with European principles.</p>

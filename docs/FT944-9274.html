			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Y-TT head calls for joint Channel 5 bid Mr Ward Thomas, chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, yesterday appealed to the ITV companies to make a joint bid for the new Channel 5. Although individual ITV companies are limited to a maximum stake of 20 per cent, there is apparently nothing in the rules to prevent them making a joint bid. 'I think the most sensible thing would be if a consortium of ITV companies combined to bid for Channel 5. The BBC has two channels. Why not ITV?' Mr Thomas asked. The Yorkshire chairman also announced a return to profit for the company in the second half after serious problems last year with its advertising sales. In the current 15-month period, pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 were Pounds 4.7m, cancelling out a Pounds 4.6m loss in the first half and leaving profits for the year at Pounds 111,000 (Pounds 7.9m losses). Turnover amounted to Pounds 225m (Pounds 237m) generating operating profits of Pounds 59.9m (Pounds 35.8m) for the 12 months. Mr Thomas, who has made it clear he would like to be part of a Channel 5 application, said Yorkshire's advertising revenue was starting to grow. The Yorkshire chairman also said he had tried to persuade the government to privatise Channel 4. 'I am one of those trying to encourage the government to think about the privatisation of Channel 4,' said Mr Thomas, who added that Pounds 1.5bn could be raised. This could mean Pounds 1bn for the government and the rest could be used to reduce the total bid money ITV must pay to the government. Privatisation, however, seems unlikely. Yorkshire, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 14 per cent stake, said the drive to cut costs continued. It had cost of sales and operating expenses of Pounds 81.6m in the second half, down from Pounds 94.8m, while programme sales remained strong. 'We will produce for anybody. That is where our business can expand and why we have to be cost effective,' Mr Thomas said. Earnings per share for the six months amounted to 6.2p and for the 12 months to 0.1p (11.1p losses). At the end of the 15-month period to December 31 the directors will give 'serious consideration' to proposing a dividend. The shares rose 6p to 395p.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Panama Canal tolls to rise Panama Canal tolls are to rise 10 per cent from the start of October, Stephen Fidler reports. The increase will raise the rate for laden vessels from Dollars 2.01 to Dollars 2.21 a ton. The rise is the sixth in the canal's 78-year operating history, the last taking effect in October 1989. The increase is needed to meet expenses and finance a capital improvement programme.</p>

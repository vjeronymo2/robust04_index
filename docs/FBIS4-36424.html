			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, June 9 (AFP) -- Two northern warplanes  were shot down on Thursday [9 June] as they bombed Aden airport  in south Yemen, witnesses said.    Four planes bombed the airport area, but one slammed into  the  sea and a second crashed into the city's residential Shaykh  'Usman district after running into anti-aircraft fire, they said.    Northern warplanes launched a second raid half an hour  later.    There were no immediate details of casualties.    Southern warplanes based at the airport have taken part in  bombing runs to try to stop the northern advance on Aden which  was declared the capital of an independent state last month.</p>

			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Arts: Disaster at the top - Off the Wall THE MOOD in the arts world has never been so gloomy and insecure. It is now accepted that the chancellor will cut the budget of the Department of National Heritage in his November 30 statement, and the best that the Arts Council can hope for is that the reduction in its grant will be confined to just Pounds 5m, leaving it with Pounds 221m for next year. It will presumably spread the agony by cutting the grants of all its clients by 3 per cent. This will be the first ever cash cutback in government funding of the arts. If it was seen as a once and for all emergency, a case of the arts doing its bit to get the nation's finances into balance, it would be bearable, but a further expenditure freeze is on line for 1995-96. Even more ominously it intensifies the fear that official thinking is turning against the arts. Margaret Thatcher was so uninterested in culture that during her premiership the arts never became a national donkey, needing to be kicked into life. It would be ironic and tragic if the ideologists suddenly sank their teeth into the arts at this late stage. The problem is political. While the Department of Arts and Libraries was a backwater, its civil servants, with little hope of catching the eye of Whitehall mandarins, spent their time fighting the arts corner. Its ministers, too, often discovered to their surprise that, when given the peripheral arts portfolio, really the arts in the UK, especially in the regions, were much more fascinating than they imagined, and they fought valiantly to preserve the arts budget. The new Department of National Heritage, despite its minister with cabinet rank, has turned out to be a disaster. At the top it is stacked with ambitious civil servants who are using the arts and the heritage to impress their superiors in the sexy government departments like the Treasury. The minister, Peter Brooke, is treating the department like a politician rather than a committed believer in the arts. He shows no desire to fall on his sword to defend its budget. Now there seems to be squabbling inside the department. Brooke's number two, Iain Sproat, is a right wing ideologue. While confined to the department's responsibility for areas like sport or tourism he was not seen as a danger, but now he is taking an interest in the arts, and is pushing a budget-cutting line which is believed to go too far, even for Brooke. As a cricket buff Sproat has the ear of the Prime Minister. When arts groupie David Mellor was on hand as Heritage Minister to influence his friend the PM that was fine; with Sproat singing a different tune the arts' access to top table is not an advantage. The situation is desperate because the arts are already struggling. Next month the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts will announce that corporate sponsorship in the UK fell for the first time ever this year  -business cannot and will not make good any shortfall in government support. Also the recession has hit box office revenue: audiences for plays, dance, classical music, and art exhibitions fell in 1992-93. Only opera bucked the trend. The fourth potential paymaster of the arts, local authorities, have struggled manfully to maintain their support but now they are being forced to reduce spending. The Liverpool Everyman is facing closure as is the Passmore Edwards Museum in Newham. This week the government backed a British Tourist Authority wheeze to make 1995 a Festival of Arts and Culture in the UK. Over half the UK's visitors state that the arts and entertainment are a major reason for travelling here, and they spend Pounds 2b a year to prove it. A flourishing arts scene pays for itself, and much more, through overseas earnings, VAT receipts, and tourist expenditure. It seems inconceivable that the government should so wantonly put the boot in when the arts are operating in such a hostile financial climate. The Arts Council has created public relations problems for itself by belatedly getting selective over which theatres to support during a recession. It has now withdrawn the axe from the regional theatres but the lack of judgment has hardly helped the search for a successor to Lord Palumbo, who retires as chairman next spring. Now the prospect of a cut in grant must make the unpaid job look distinctly unappetising. You can forget outsiders like Lady Archer or Peter Gummer, the PR magnate brother of Environment Minister Gummer. The totally acceptable front runner as the next chairman is Sir Ernest Hall, who combines business success with an impressive commitment to the arts, not least at his Dean Clough mill complex in Halifax where commercial concerns rub shoulder with artists to mutual benefit. The other weighty candidate could still be Lord Gowrie, who is likely to go non-executive as chairman of Sotheby's Europe next year. But could he have his eyes on supervising the Lottery-funded Millennium celebrations? Or has that task been reserved for Lord Palumbo, who first came up with the idea? The Lottery is, of course, the joker in the arts pack. No one dares say so but the arts are being given a hard time now because the government believes it has secured their long term future through this new source of funding. Yesterday Peter Brooke gave his cautious view that the arts, the heritage, the Millennium Fund, sport and charities could each benefit by an additional Pounds 75m a year from 1995. In practice, and time, the figure could grow. The money will go mainly on capital projects but these, in turn, should improve audiences and the efficiency of arts organisations. One problem for bodies such as the Tate or the Royal Opera House is which Lottery budget to go for: they could make a case for Millennium money, or heritage aid, or even to the Arts Council, for the millions needed for the new Tate and the new Covent Garden. The real problem will be who will pay the running costs when the projects come on steam? This will be a restraining factor for brand new buildings. The Lottery funding bodies, like the Arts Council, will surely favour existing clients, whose track record they know, over fresh ideas. Even so seed money to get work started on the brand new Cardiff Bay, home of the Welsh National Opera, a hot tip for Millennium aid, has now been raised.</p>

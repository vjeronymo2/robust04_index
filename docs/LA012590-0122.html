			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COLLEGE BASKETBALL  </P> <P> TODAY'S HIGHLIGHTS  </P> <P> WESTERN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO STATE (11-8, 3-3) at HAWAII (15-4, 4-2), 9:30 p.m. (PST)  </P> <P> TV -- None. Radio -- KFMB (760).  </P> <P> The first round of WAC play comes to a close, and the Aztecs are still trying  to establish some consistency. Case in point: Last Saturday in San Diego, the  Aztecs led Texas El Paso at halftime, 44-38, but shot a frigid 24% in the  second half and lost, 71-63. Michael Best made just two of 11 shots and scored  five points in 33 minutes after scoring 24 points (10 of 13 shooting) Thursday  against New Mexico. Center Marty Dow has been SDSU's most consistent force in  WAC play, averaging 15 points and 6.3 rebounds. He will be key against Hawaii's  strong rebounding team (second in WAC rebounding advantage at an average of 4.9  more than opponents per game). Terry Houston leads Hawaii with 6.7 rebounds a  game. Chris Gaines, who missed second half of last season because he was  academically ineligible, is Hawaii's leading scorer (19.3 points).  </P></p>

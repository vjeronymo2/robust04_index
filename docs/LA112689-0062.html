			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MATURE TRAVELER: TWO-WEEK LIVE ABROAD STAYS IN OAXACA OFFERED  </P> <P> Grand Circle Travel has added a new Live Abroad vacation in Oaxaca to go with a  similar long-term stay in Guadalajara and its two-week "Three Faces of Mexico"  tour. Like all Grand Circle offerings worldwide, it's for the age 55-plus  traveler.  </P> <P> Offered through April, 1990, the Live Abroad two-week stay in Oaxaca costs from  $800 to $940 per person, double occupancy, depending on the season and choice  of accommodations. The price includes air travel from Los Angeles, transfers,  tips and baggage handling.  </P> <P> A choice of two first-class hotels is offered: the San Felipe Mision and the  slightly more expensive Mision de Los Angeles. A daily American breakfast is  served in both, but those choosing the San Felipe Mision also get dinner each  day.  </P> <P> Set in a mountain-ringed valley 350 miles south of Mexico City, Oaxaca has an  excellent climate -- especially during winter -- of warm days and cool nights.  In addition to golf, tennis and swimming, there is optional sightseeing to six  major ruins within a 20-minute drive, including the famous Monte Alban.  </P> <P> And like the Live Abroad program in Guadalajara, each hotel has a weekly social  program with a welcome cocktail party, bingo, Spanish cooking and language  lessons, plus films, an orientation tour and local entertainment.  </P> <P> The Live Abroad program in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city, also  offers a choice of hotels for the two-week stay: the first-class Plaza de Sol,  a 30-minute drive from downtown, and the deluxe Hyatt Regency Exelaris. Daily  breakfast is included at both hotels.  </P> <P> Prices vary from $762 to $832 per person double at the Plaza de Sol, and from  $902 to $972 per person double at the posh Hyatt Regency. Rates vary with the  season, but include air fare from Los Angeles, plus tips, transfers and baggage  handling.  </P> <P> Grand Circle's Three Faces of Mexico tour is a 14-day escorted trip that takes  in pre-Columbian cultures, plus colonial and modern Mexico. It covers the  Yucatan, Oaxaca, Mexico City and Guadalajara.  </P> <P> Priced at $1,772 per person double from Los Angeles, the tour includes  first-class hotels, 20 meals and comprehensive sightseeing. It can also be  combined with a Live Abroad stay in Guadalajara. Departures are Dec. 28, 1989,  Jan. 11 and 25, Feb. 8 and 22 and Mar. 8 and 22, 1990.  </P> <P> For more information, contact the Grand Circle main office in Boston at  toll-free (800) 535-8333, or the company's California office at (800) 327-3904.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Three San Francisco hotels are offering special deals or discounts for mature  travelers over the holidays and into 1990.  </P> <P> The Carlton Hotel, 1075 Sutter St., six blocks west of Union Square, has a  $62-per-night rate, single or double, now through March 11.

Tickets are $65 per person. For information: (800)  648-0912.  </P> <P> The tour includes four nights at the Hilton and reserved seats for the  Tournament of Roses Parade, in addition to the two shows and other sightseeing,  for about $500 per person, double.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Senior group tour leaders should know that the Candlelight Pavilion Dinner  Theater in Griswold's Claremont Center, featuring the Christmas musical "Home  For The Holidays" until Dec. 30, will follow with "Fiddler On The Roof" from  Jan. 5 to April 1.  </P> <P> Then comes "Evita," April 6 to June 17.

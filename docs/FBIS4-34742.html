			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Elsy Fors] </F>   [Text] Havana, 20 Jun (PL) -- Christine Stewart, Canada's  minister of state for Latin America and Africa, today endorsed  her country's investments in Cuba while addressing a conference  organized by British publication THE ECONOMIST.    Cuban Vice President Carlos Lage, Christine Stewart, and an  executive from the publication sponsoring the event opened the  conference entitled "Second Roundtable With the Government of  Cuba," which formally begins two days of working sessions  tomorrow behind closed doors.    The Canadian Government supports increased investments in  Cuba not only because they contribute to this country's  development, but because they also benefit Canada, the minister  explained.    Canada currently exerts a great deal of influence in foreign  investments in Cuba's mining sector, not only in the traditional  nickel sector, but also in exploring for gold, lead, copper, and  oil deposits.    Stewart conveyed the Canadian Government's willingness to  further promote the flow of capital toward Cuba. It was also  announced in Ottawa today that developmental aid will be made  available, as well as $360,000 in emergency food aid, which will  be granted through the World Food Program. A larger amount,  $720,000, will be donated to the food program in 1995.    Meanwhile, Lage stressed the importance of having such a  renowned publication as THE ECONOMIST organizing this  conference, as well as having Canadian companies such as Sherrit  Inc. cosponsoring it. The conference has an even greater  significance in light of the current economic hardships Cuba is  facing.    Octavio Castilla, spokesman for the conference and deputy  minister for foreign investment and economic cooperation,  believes the most significant message conveyed by Lage was that  regardless of all the flaws the Cuban legal system might have,  there is a willingness to analyze those flaws and to implement  reforms that further encourage the introduction of foreign  capital.    More than 100 businessmen and officials from Europe, Canada,  the United States, and Latin America are participating in this  conference. Formal reports will be given tomorrow by Enrique  Martinez, vice president of the Cuban Central Planning Board;  Foreign Trade Minister Ricardo Cabrisas; and Ernesto Melendez,  president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation.</p>

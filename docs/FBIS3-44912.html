Akaka.    Rong said the development of Sino-U.S. relations is  important  to development and world peace, and with so many common  interests, the differences between the two countries should not  affect friendship and cooperation.    Rong met Akaka, chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee of  the U.S. Senate, this morning in the Great Hall of the People.  China's vice-president said that given the two countries's  complementary economies and great potential for cooperation in  the field, stronger economic and trade cooperation will benefit  both sides.    "Sino-U.S. relations will see smooth growth if the  principles  of seeking common points while preserving differences, and  equality as well as mutual benefit can be observed," Rong said.    Akaka seconded Rong's views, saying that the differences  should be resolved through peaceful consultations and dialogues,  and should not damage bilateral trade and economic relations.    The issues of human rights and the most-favored-nation (MFN)  trade status should be separated from each other, the senator  said, adding that he supported a renewal of China's MFN status.    "Different countries hold different ideas on human rights,"  Rong said, and as a developing country, China first stresses the  right to live and the right to develop.    Akaka said that China's stand on human rights will shed  light  on this topic for other independent countries. Dialogues and  consultations on human rights will help promote understanding.    Akaka, who is on his fifth visit to China, said his current  tour impressed him deeply, and he was surprised with China's  rapid development.    He said he would urge more U.S. senators to visit China so  that they can understand China better.    Rong Yiren said that he would welcome more U.S. Congressmen  in China.    Akaka and his party arrived in China on Friday [7 January]  at  the invitation of the Chinese Institute of Foreign Affairs.  They toured Hainan and Shenzhen before heading for Beijing.</p>

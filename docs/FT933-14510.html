			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Government confident of defeating referendum move GOVERNMENT business managers expressed confidence yesterday that the attempt in the House of Lords today to bring about a referendum on Maastricht would be defeated. But evidence of their determination to take no chances came in a briefing note from Tory Central Office, countering arguments put forward by the referendum campaigners on Monday. Tactics for dealing with the more serious challenge to the government's ratification plans posed by the Commons social chapter debate later this month were discussed yesterday by senior ministers. They agreed that in order to leave the greatest possible freedom of manoeuvre, the government should not spell out publicly what it would do if it were defeated. Labour has had an amendment agreed to the motion for debate, saying that the treaty should not be ratified until the UK has committed itself to the social agreement. Yesterday's briefing note to peers particularly targeted Lady Thatcher, who made it clear earlier this week that she intended to vote against the three-line Tory whip and in favour of a referendum. Her speech in 1975 against a referendum was extensively quoted against the line that the campaign for a referendum was neutral and could be supported both by those in favour of Maastricht as well as those against the treaty. The note also rejected the suggestion that the government was trying to force peers to vote for a referendum by threatening to resign. 'Scare tactics may be part of others' strategy, but the government has no need of them,' it said.</p>

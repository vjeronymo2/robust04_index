			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE FINDS OFFICER'S SPEECH RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED  </P> <P> Police Chief Lawrence Binkley violated an officer's right of freedom of speech  when the chief reprimanded the officer for writing a critical letter to a  newspaper, a federal judge in Los Angeles has ruled.  </P> <P> Officer Greg Roberts' letter to the Press-Telegram last October was an  "expression fully protected by the First Amendment," U.S. District Court Judge  Ronald S.W. Lew wrote in his opinion. The case is scheduled to go before a jury  Sept. 18 to determine damages.  </P> <P> Roberts' letter, which was published Oct. 17, said "incompetent police  management" was responsible for inadequate patrol staffing. Binkley reprimanded  Roberts, saying the letter violated department rules against insubordination  and brought the department into disrepute.  </P> <P> In his ruling, Lew said that employees can't be disciplined for speaking out on  matters of public concern and that the officer's letter "clearly regards a  matter of public concern."  </P> <P> Police response time "is a matter of great public concern," the judge wrote.  The April 4 ruling was released this week by the officer's attorney.  </P> <P> The chief declined to comment this week, noting that other lawsuits are  pending. In the past, he has argued that officers with complaints should go  through the chain of command and not air their grievances in public.  </P> <P> Roberts was one of at least eight officers who were reprimanded, investigated  or threatened with an investigation last year after making public comments on  the department or its management. At the time, Binkley and the police union  were entangled in a bitter contract dispute, and both sides frequently tossed  barbs at each other.  </P> <P> Roberts and three other officers filed lawsuits against Binkley and the city.  Roberts' lawsuit is the first to be heard in court.  </P> <P> The officer is seeking unspecified damages and is asking that the reprimand be  removed from his personnel records. His attorney, James E. Trott, said he hopes  the two sides will settle before the jury trial. Attorneys for the city could  not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The ruling was hailed by Mike Tracy, president of the Police Officers Assn.  "It's critical to the public interest that officers not be censored," he said.  </P> <P> The lawsuits appear to have halted the policy of investigating officers' public  comments. Union leaders said they have not heard of any such cases since the  first lawsuit was filed Nov. 3 by a dispatcher who was also reprimanded for  writing a letter to the Press-Telegram.  </P> <P> City Manager James C. Hankla said he did not know whether there has been a  change in policy but hinted that if not, one may be forthcoming.  </P> <P> "Nobody tried to implement any Draconian measures," Hankla said. "(But) if the  court feels it was an infringement, then the best response to a letter to the  editor is a letter to the editor."  </P></p>

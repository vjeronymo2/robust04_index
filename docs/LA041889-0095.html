			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONVICTED SLAYER ADMITS IN COURT HE STRANGLED BOY  </P> <P> A man convicted of kidnaping and killing a 10-year-old West Covina boy in 1980  admitted his guilt for the first time in court Monday as he testified for the  city in a wrongful death suit brought by the victim's father.  </P> <P> Danny Jerome Young, 29, said he was testifying on behalf of the city in the  $10-million suit to set the record straight and remove any blame from the  police who handled the murder case.  </P> <P> "The only person who could have saved Ronnie Tolleson was God," Young testified  in Pomona Superior Court.  </P> <P> Young is serving a life term without possibility of parole for the slaying.  </P> <P> Eight days after Ronald Tolleson Jr. was abducted and $3,000 was demanded in  ransom, the boy's strangled body was found in the garage of a home two doors  away from the Tolleson residence. Young lived in the home with his sister.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Suing West Covina  </P> <P> Ronald A. Tolleson Sr. is suing the West Covina Police Department, Police Chief  Craig Meacham and two officers, alleging that police botched the investigation.  </P> <P> A Pomona Superior Court judge ruled that there was insufficient evidence to  warrant a trial.  </P> <P> But a state Court of Appeal ruled that the case could be heard, a decision that  the state Supreme Court affirmed early last year.  </P> <P> State Appellate Justice Campbell M. Lucas had concluded that police searched  the Young house the night of the kidnaping but did not enter the garage. Lucas  also found that a suspect was not apprehended, even though several police  officers were stationed near the site where the ransom was to be placed and one  officer saw a man pick up the money. The ransom bag contained $100, all the  senior Tolleson could raise, and crumpled newspapers.  </P> <P> The city's defense attorney, Thomas J. Feeley, has maintained that the boy was  dead before police were contacted and that the suit should be dropped.  </P> <P> Young, who was convicted in 1982 of second-degree murder and kidnaping,  testified Monday that he strangled the boy with an electrical cord within hours  after abducting him.  </P> <P> Although Young pleaded not guilty, the prosecution introduced a taped  confession obtained by police.  </P> <P> Young maintained during his trial that the confession was coerced. On Monday,  he admitted that he had lied.  </P> <P> "I don't think that careers should be in jeopardy for something I did," said  Young, as he unemotionally told how he killed Tolleson. "Even if this causes my  life to be terminated in the penitentiary, I got to do it. I can't lay back."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nothing to Gain  </P> <P> Feeley said Young has nothing to gain by his testimony.  </P> <P> "He's serving life without the possibility of parole . . . I'm not aware of  anything you can offer a person in those circumstances," he said.  </P> <P> But Tolleson's attorneys, Charles C. Simon and Peter M. Wucetich, said they  believe Young was offered some inducement.  </P> <P> "It's certainly not out of the goodness of his heart for the city of West  Covina and the police officers who put him away," Wucetich said.  </P> <P> Young testified Monday that the boy came to his house looking for Young's  nephews.  </P> <P> Young said he lured Tolleson into his room and bound and gagged him. He said he  demanded the boy's phone number, "because I knew at the time that I was going  to kill him."  </P> <P> He then took Tolleson to a downstairs bathroom, where he strangled him. After  wrapping the body in blankets, Young said he stuffed it behind a sofa in the  garage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Phoned House  </P> <P> That afternoon, he phoned the Tolleson house and demanded $3,000, Young said.  </P> <P> "Was Ronnie already dead at that point?" Feeley asked.  </P> <P> "Yes," Young said.  </P> <P> Young said he persuaded an acquaintance to pick up the ransom at a local park,  by telling him that he was obtaining a bag of marijuana. While watching the  drop site at Rimgrove Park, Young said he saw police officers "all over" after  the man picked up the bag.  </P> <P> Young was captured in Nevada a month after the slaying.  </P></p>

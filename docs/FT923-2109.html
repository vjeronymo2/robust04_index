			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Property: Prudent Welsh look to recovery - David Hoppitt discovers that confidence is coming back despite the death of the mining industry WALES is a blest country. Anyone depressed by urban sprawl and dwindling wildlife needs only to stride along Offa's Dyke and over the Black Mountains to restore their spirits. The dyke, built at the end of the 8th century, was intended to contain troublesome Welsh princes rather than stop the English drifting across the border. Wales (and Anglesey, in particular) is as old as the world itself, the pre-Cambrian rocks there having formed as the molten earth began to cool some 3,000m years ago. In the south, inland from the rugged Pembrokeshire coast at Mynydd Prescelly, the great blocks of granite that form Stonehenge were quarried. Small wonder that Wales is a country of strange legends and tradition, folklore mingled with fact. Castles and strange place names abound. Only a few years ago, when coal mining was in its terminal stages, property was among the cheapest in Europe. In 1984, I found Britain's cheapest house in a village named Cwmbach (bach meaning small and cwm meaning valley). The mid-terrace Victorian cottage, with a new roof, was offered for just Pounds 800 (no, I haven't left off a nought). After I wrote about it, hundreds of people headed for the village clutching chequebooks. Five years later, the same house would have cost at least Pounds 8,000. Cheap property can be found again now, but only where changing fortunes have caused repossessions. 'The situation in other parts of the United Kingdom is terrible. We are vastly better off here, largely because Welsh lenders have been very much more prudent than most of their English counterparts,' says John Mitchell, chief executive of the Principality building society. Although house prices fell after 1989, the drop was not so great as in other areas, largely because Wales avoids the peaks and troughs of the Home Counties' market. Mitchell actually sees the beginning of a recovery in the Welsh market; indeed, sales through the society's estate agency arm have increased both in 1991 and this year. 'Falling house prices have damaged confidence; affordability is not the problem here,' he says. But he adds: 'As long as the stock of unsold properties decreases, the prospect of a housing market recovery in Wales looks more optimistic than for many other areas.' People seem to have come to terms with the death of coal mining; Sony, the Japanese electronics giant, now employs some 3,000 people at Bridgend, which is more than work in the remaining four pits. Soon, there will be just one working mine in the entire principality. There is a feeling of growing confidence in Wales, exemplified by the national garden festival near Ebbw Vale that ends early next month. 'The festival has been a triumph - local people have petitioned for the park to remain,' says Alan Nicol, project director of the Welsh Development Agency. In fact, 70 acres of the park will be retained; some 500 homes and 3,500 sq ft of business and industrial space will be built alongside. The three energy-efficient houses constructed specially for the festival will soon be sold, and a number of sites have been reserved to encourage self-build projects. Christopher Heath, of Custom Homes, the Redhill (Surrey) company that built the largest of the three houses, says: 'There has been tremendous interest in the self-build plots; already, 12 have been reserved at prices starting at Pounds 25,000.' He talks of 'lifting this former blighted area into a place that will provide perfect living and working conditions.' In addition, the Welsh Development Agency has a Pounds 25m annual programme to promote large-scale regeneration projects, working with local authorities. Present schemes, creating and safeguarding thousands of jobs, are at Llanelli, Merthyr Tydfil, Barry, Holyhead and Cynon Valley. Mitchell says new homes in the valleys always sell well because the housing stock in Wales is predominantly old. But F. Carey Jones, of Crown, part of the Royal Life group, adds that while there was a noticeable rush for exchanges and completions to beat the August deadline on stamp duty, especially among first-time buyers, the market for more expensive houses in the Pounds 180,000-plus bracket is very slow. Graham Adnitt, of Jackson-Stops &amp; Staff, says: 'Understandably, vendors are reluctant to bring their houses on to the market until conditions improve; consequently, when a house of genuine quality is offered, there is still a real response, proving that there are buyers about.' The firm is selling the listed Old Rectory at Cerrigydrudion, near Corwen, a Grade II Georgian house with a guide price of Pounds 195,000; already, there has been a flurry of inquiries. Swetenhams, which has some mouth-watering country and seaside property on the books, is offering some cheaper properties as well. An end of terrace one-bedroom cottage in Llandudno, with views of the estuary and castle, can be bought for Pounds 37,500. If a holiday foothold is all that is required, the Holiday Property Bond - approaching its 10th birthday - has added to its wide portfolio of properties with St Bride's Castle, on the Pembrokeshire coast not far from the delightful St David's. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000, but most families put around Pounds 4,000 into the fund. Of all the HPB's 500-plus holiday homes, however, flats in this dramatic castle are proving to be among the most popular. Elsewhere in Wales, the second-home market has gone very quiet; Humberts says the only homes selling for holiday occupation are those that need major restoration. Prices around Wales vary enormously but Peter Alan, of Principality's estate agency arm, gives guide prices in two key areas - although he stresses that the figures given are 'minima.' In Cardiff, a two-bedroomed terrace is Pounds 20,950; a three-bed semi Pounds 31,950; a four-bed detached Pounds 69,950; and a country house with paddock Pounds 185,000. Comparative figures for Swansea are Pounds 19,950, Pounds 24,000, Pounds 55,000 and Pounds 145,000.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- Seoul urged the American  Embassy here Wednesday to begin negotiations on paying rent for  its facilities and on exactly when the installations became  legally exempt from free use by the United States.    Assistant Foreign Minister Choe Tong-chin met with Charles  Kartman, a minister at the U.S. Embassy, and delivered a note  explaining Seoul's position on the status of disputed facilities  that include the embassy compound downtown and embassy staff  residence quarters in Yongsan. It is the first time that the  Seoul government has requested overall negotiations on all the  facilities in question.    The Board of Audit and Inspection ruled last summer that the  U.S. Embassy must pay rent for one of its twin buildings  formerly occupied by American AID [Agency for International  Development] organizations. The board said that since the AID  organizations have left South Korea, there is no legal basis for  rent exemption.    The embassy agreed in principle that its rent-free status  has  ended, but not on when it expired. The embassy took over the  building on Oct. 1, 1980.    Seoul also demands negotiations on relocating embassy staff  quarters in Yongsan Army Base since the South Korea-U.S. Status  of Forces Agreement (SOFA) bars use of the American military  base for non-military purposes.</p>

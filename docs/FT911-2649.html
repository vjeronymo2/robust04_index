			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / You don't have to 'compete' It has long looked likely that economic performance depends not only on 'economic' variables such as resources, or incentive and ownership structures, but also on more elusive psychological attributes - which have been treated in studies such as Martin Wiener's well-known English Culture and the Decline of the Industrial Spirit. It was therefore worth seeking out evidence of national differences in attitudes to work, studies, money and so on, and see how they related to more conventional indicators. Prof Richard Lynn's study, undertaken with a 48-person international team, entitled The Secret of the Miracle Economy (Social Affairs Unit, 104 Park Street, London, W1Y 3RJ, Pounds 8.95) is therefore welcome - so long as it is examined critically. Attitudes were ascertained by means of questionnaires put to students. This is obviously far from ideal, but better than nothing. The four theories examined in the study relate to economic growth to a Protestant-type work ethic, to a comprehensive 'achievement orientation', to competitiveness at the individual level and to 'valuation of land'. The last is a negative factor and is a generalisation of the Wiener theory relating to Britain's poor relative performance in the last century to a national preference for the supposed virtues of the landed gentleman over those of the successful businessman. Lynn reports that only 'competitiveness' is significantly associated with economic growth. By competitiveness Lynn does not mean a low real exchange rate or openness of markets to new entrants, but enthusiastic personal support for propositions such as: 'Winning is important in both work and games.' Competitiveness is itself associated with other variables such as individuals attaching high value to money and wanting to enter business. But the essence is the triumph of winners over losers. It is different from the economist's idea of the pursuit of wealth or real income (including leisure) which does not in principle require the existence of losers at all. The headline conclusion is that competitiveness is higher in the five 'miracle' economies of East Asia - Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong Japan and Singapore - than it is in Europe. There is a consolation for Britain, which is well up in the European league, and scores higher not merely than Norway or Sweden, but Germany and Switzerland as well. But if the reader glances at the full table in the study he will find that the world leaders in competitiveness are not the East Asian stars at all, but Egypt, Jordan and Bangladesh in that order. There is, however, more genuine reassurance elsewhere. If developed and developing countries are considered in separate groups, no significant relationship is found between competitiveness and real per capita income. Thus the not very edifying elbowing-out attitudes are much less important for countries wishing to stay at a high income level than for poorer countries aspiring towards them. A similar disclaimer applies to the warning about the ambitions of the able young in advanced societies towards the caring professions, such as medicine, teaching and social work. The psychological law of diminishing marginal utility, which is studied more by economists than psychologists, tells us very crudely that the more you have of something the less you value additions to it, relative to something else. Thus, rich countries can afford a shift to less business-oriented values even if it means a sacrifice in the rate of growth of take-home pay. The value of a market economy to me has always been the choice of life-style. You do not have to be a thrustful competitor unless you want to. This advantage remains despite the new study.</p>

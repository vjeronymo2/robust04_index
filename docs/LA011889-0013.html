			<p><P> January 18, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BAKKER PLEADS INNOCENT TO CHARGES HE MISUSED MILLIONS IN PTL FUNDS  </P> <P> Evangelist Jim Bakker pleaded not guilty Tuesday to federal charges that he  diverted millions of dollars from his PTL television audience for personal use.  </P> <P> Bakker's lawyer, George T. Davis, asked U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor during the  hearing for a gag order for all parties involved, based largely on comments by  the retired federal bankruptcy judge who supervised the sale of PTL assets.  </P> <P> In seeking the gag order, Davis presented Taylor with a copy of a recent  newspaper article in which retired U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds called  Bakker a "sawed-off little runt."  </P> <P> Taylor said he would consider the request, instructing attorneys to draft a  consent order and present it to him by Thursday for approval. The magistrate  told Davis he was concerned that Bakker would go on television and talk about  the case, but he issued no formal request for Bakker to keep quiet.  </P> <P> Bakker was silent during the hearing, but made a statement afterward.  </P> <P> "I am definitely not guilty of any charges in this indictment," Bakker said.  "The judge asked for no conversations about this case, but I'd like to say that  Tammy and I are thrilled to be back on TV."  </P> <P> The Bakkers began broadcasting "The Jim and Tammy Show" from their leased home  near Charlotte earlier this month. Bakker did not appear on the telecast  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bakker quit the PTL ministry in March, 1987, after admitting a sexual encounter  with former secretary Jessica Hahn and paying her money to keep quiet. The  ministry he founded sought reorganization in bankruptcy court a few months  later. Last month, a Canadian businessman bought the ministry's assets at a  bankruptcy auction.  </P> <P> Taylor tentatively scheduled the trial for the court's February term but set no  specific date. He also gave the attorneys 15 days to file other motions.  </P></p>

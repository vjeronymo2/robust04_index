			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Mobil surprises with 40% operating advance MOBIL, the big US energy group, outstripped market expectations yesterday by unveiling a 40 per cent jump in underlying third-quarter earnings, reflecting increased oil production and higher sales of petroleum products. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 666m, or Dollars 1.63 a share, compared with Dollars 413m, or Dollars 1, a year earlier. Excluding one-time net gains of Dollars 53m in the latest quarter and a special charge of Dollars 25m a year earlier, Mobil said operating earnings rose 40 per cent to Dollars 613m, or Dollars 1.50. Mobil's US marketing and refining operations earned Dollars 139m in the quarter, compared with a loss of Dollars 19m a year earlier. The company attributed the improvement partly to better industry margins. Overseas, marketing and refining brought in earnings of Dollars 215m, up Dollars 130m, led by a strong performance in the Pacific Rim. Results in Europe were better than last year, but continued to reflect the impact of recession. Cost-cutting measures also helped earnings. Mobil's domestic exploration and producing earnings fell Dollars 36m to Dollars 110m. A sharp drop in crude oil prices was only partly offset by higher natural gas prices and lower administrative expenses. International exploration and producing earnings dropped Dollars 61m to Dollars 255m reflecting lower crude oil and natural gas prices and reduced European natural gas volumes. Earnings from chemicals slid Dollars 15m to Dollars 9m. The company blamed sluggish economies and industry oversupply for the low margins on polyethylene and films. During the quarter, Mobil's corporate and other expenses rose Dollars 11m to Dollars 47m but financing expenses were Dollars 10m lower at Dollars 68m, reflecting a lower debt level and lower interest rates. Amoco, the Chicago-based energy company, posted third-quarter net income of Dollars 520m, or Dollars 1.05, against Dollars 496m, or Dollars 1 a year ago. Stripping out one-time items in both years, Amoco's operating earnings slipped to Dollars 446m, or 90 cents from Dollars 454m, or 92 cents last year. Lower crude oil prices and production volume depressed earnings from US exploration and production, to Dollars 156m from Dollars 253m last time. Outside of the US, exploration and production earned Dollars 62m, including a one-time gain of Dollars 70m, compared with Dollars 107m a year earlier, including tax benefits of Dollars 23m. Refining, marketing and transportation earned Dollars 225m in the quarter, compared with Dollars 143m.</p>

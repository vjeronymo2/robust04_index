			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): A nod towards the problem - Advance Corporation Tax THE good news for business leaders campaigning for a review of the problem caused by 'surplus' advance corporation tax (ACT) is that the Chancellor mentioned it in his speech - the most public official recognition that a problem exists. The bad news is that he gave little in the way of promises to deal with the problem. The problem stems from the very heart of the corporate tax system. Whenever a company pays a dividend it must pay advance corporation tax to the Inland Revenue. The rate of ACT is set by reference to the basic rate of income tax. Accordingly, after yesterday's Budget, it remains unchanged at one-third of the dividend paid: on a dividend of 75p, ACT of 25p is paid. The company can deduct the ACT from the corporation tax on its profits. The deduction is limited so that with corporation tax at 33 per cent there will always be a residual 8 per cent liability. Where the company has no taxable profits, the ACT is an additional tax cost. When the company earns its profits largely abroad, its UK tax liabilities may be permanently reduced by the foreign tax it pays. The ACT on its dividends is then an additional tax cost which it has to write-off in its accounts. This affects its earnings per share. CBI and other business bodies have urged the Government to take steps to tackle this problem. One proposal has been to allow ACT to be deducted from the residual 8 per cent liability. Another has been to exempt dividends paid out of foreign income. While acknowledging the problem in his speech, the Chancellor felt unable to propose immediate measures given the tax cost of doing anything effective. The EC is also a factor. In 1990 the Community adopted two Directives which took effect from 1 January 1992. The first of these permits dividends to be paid within the Community between a parent company and its subsidiaries without deduction of tax at source. The second measure enables certain mergers to take place across Community borders on a tax free basis. A third measure deals with the resolution of inter-company pricing disputes with Community tax authorities. The Government published draft legislation in December 1991 to implement these measures and this will be included in the Finance Bill. More radical proposals may shortly be made by the Ruding Committee, established by the Commission at the end of 1990 to look more fundamentally at the future of company tax systems in the Community. The Ruding Committee will publish its recommendations on 18 March. Those proposals may propose that the UK and other Community countries adopt measures that would then solve the UK's surplus ACT problem. In the light of that, the Chancellor clearly felt unable to make proposals which might shortly be overtaken by events. The author is a partner of Linklaters &amp; Paines.</p>

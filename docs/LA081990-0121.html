			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> BERNSTINE, LEWIS HELP CHARGERS GET IT INTO GEAR  </P> <P> It was an exhibition victory that, in itself, was no big deal.  </P> <P> But by defeating the Rams, 30-27, before 45,684 in Anaheim Saturday night, the  Chargers (2-0) discovered two important things:  </P> <P> 1. Rod Bernstine is very capable of playing running back.  </P> <P> 2. Nate Lewis, a guy who made his name at the collegiate level at a little  school named Oregon Tech, is very capable as a kick returner.  </P> <P> Bernstine's all-purpose performance, which included 94 rushing yards on eight  carries and two touchdowns, allowed the Chargers to be in position to win. And  Lewis won it.  </P> <P> After the Rams had taken a 27-24 lead with 5:19 to play, Lewis did his thing on  the ensuing kickoff, running through a huge hole created by a wedge block and  going 87 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> This is the kind of play that feels pretty good to a guy who isn't sure he is a  lock to make the final roster cut.  </P> <P> "Very happy," Lewis said. "I haven't done one of those since high school. I  wanted to show everybody what I can do and be a part of this team."  </P> <P> Bernstine knew he wouldn't be cut, but he kept hearing whispers that he might  be good trade bait. That worried him.  </P> <P> "Well, really, last night I didn't sleep too much," he said. "I really was  worried about whether they were going to trade me or not. I enjoy San Diego. I  like all the ballplayers I have been playing with, and hopefully I can stay  here."  </P> <P> In the past, Bernstine has been used as an H-back and a tight end. He has  gotten to the point where running back feels comfortable. Really, it's more a  matter of getting the football.  </P> <P> "Anytime I can get my hands on the ball, I think I can benefit the team," he  said.  </P> <P> This game was one of many twists and turns. The boos heard by the Rams in the  first half turned to cheers in the third quarter when Mark Herrmann, their  third quarterback of the night, led them 80 yards in 13 plays for their first  touchdown.  </P> <P> With 5:10 remaining in the third quarter, backup fullback Robert Delpino took a  Herrmann pass on the right sideline and went 14 yards for a touchdown, fending  off a desperation push by safety Bruce Plummer.  </P> <P> Enter Mark Vlasic at quarterback for the Chargers. Last week, in a 28-16  victory over the Cowboys, Vlasic was magnificent. But when he first came in  against the Rams, he looked exactly like a guy who has only played in two games  in 21 months.  </P> <P> Vlasic, who eventually found his touch to finish 12 of 16 for 113 yards and a  touchdown, threw a sideline pass right into the hands of cornerback Bobby  Humphrey, who returned it 35 yards to the Charger six. On the next play, Gaston  Green went off left tackle for the touchdown.  </P> <P> The fourth quarter got a little wild.  </P> <P> The Rams took a 21-17 lead on their next possession. Seventy yards, Green  scoring from the one. Most of the guys who regularly start on defense for the  Chargers were not on the field at this point.  </P> <P> Vlasic picked up his game, completing eight of nine to lead the Chargers 76  yards in 12 plays for 24-21 lead, completing the job with a one-yard pass to  rookie tight end Derrick Walker with 7:57 to play.  </P> <P> But the Rams again came right back, driving 67 yards in six plays, with Green  scoring his third touchdown on a one-yard run. Mike Lansford missed the extra  point to make it 27-24.  </P> <P> After Lewis' return, John Carney missed the extra point, returning the favor.  But the Charger defense drove the Rams back seven yards on five plays after the  kickoff, took the ensuing punt with 4:02 left and then ran out the clock.  </P> <P> In the first half, there were a lot of favors distributed to each team by the  other.  </P> <P> The first quarter was classic exhibition football, with lots of fumbles,  bumbles and stumbles mixed in with an occasional bit of flash.  </P> <P> The starting quarterbacks, Charger Billy Joe Tolliver and Ram Jim Everett,  threw incompletions on the game's first 11 passes, though both had help from  slippery-fingered receivers.  </P> <P> Everett, who threw for 4,310 yards last season to rank second in passing in the  NFL behind Joe Montana, was zero for six when he was yanked in favor of Chuck  Long with 5:43 remaining in the first quarter. Everett has yet to complete a  pass in the United States this season. The Rams played their opener against the  Kansas City Chiefs in Berlin.  </P> <P> Tolliver was zero for four before he hooked up for 11 yards over the middle  with Walker. That, with 3:55 remaining in the quarter, was the game's first  completion. A few minutes later, Long actually completed two consecutive  passes, one for seven yards to tight end Pat Carter and a 35-yarder down the  right sideline to wide receiver Derrick Faison.  </P> <P> Bernstine lined up in the backfield with a little more than three minutes  remaining in the quarter and gave the Chargers something to hoot about and Ram  fans something to sulk about.  </P> <P> Sweeping to his right on first and 10 from the Charger 33, Bernstine jumped  over a pile crossing the line of scrimmage, swerved by cornerback Clifford  Hicks and ran away from former San Diego State cornerback Alfred Jackson, who  got only a finger or two on the back of Bernstine's jersey before he was left  behind. Fuad Reveiz converted the extra point after Bernstine's 67-yard run to  make it 7-0 Chargers.  </P> <P> By the second quarter, the Chargers settled down, played more consistently and  let Bernstine continue to gallop. To increase their lead to 14-0, the Chargers  drove 53 yards in eight plays, with Bernstine rushing four times and catching  two passes from Tolliver for 13 and four yards. Bernstine plowed over from the  one for the touchdown.  </P> <P> Just before halftime, the Chargers drove 29 yards to the Ram 11, and Reveiz  kicked a 27-yard field goal to make it 17-0. That drive was set up by an  interception by Charger strong safety Martin Bayless, who hauled down a Long  overthrow and raced up the right sideline for 43 yards.  </P> <P> Naturally, the fans didn't think much of what they saw in the first half and  hollered a few boos at their team as they retired to the locker room for the  break. The same thing happened when they returned to the field.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Defensive end Burt Grossman, the Chargers' first-round draft selection last  season, has switched agents and now will be represented by Mike Merkow of  Poway. Grossman had previously been represented by Steve Feldman, who is based  in the Los Angeles area. Feldman represents Junior Seau, the Chargers'  first-round draft pick this season who hasn't yet agreed to a contract. "Burt  wanted to go with somebody close by," Merkow said. "He just felt that he needed  representation on a full-time basis." Grossman, Merkow said, will sign an  endorsement contract today with a car dealership and Tuesday with an  international athletic shoe company. "He is an advertiser's dream or a  nightmare," Merkow said of Grossman, who is never at a loss for words. "But  this kind of guy, if he is packaged properly, could do very, very well." . . .  Outside linebacker Billy Ray Smith, hampered throughout practice this week with  a thigh bruise, did not dress Saturday. Henry Rolling, a third-year free agent  from Tampa Bay, started in place of Smith. Tight end Arthur Cox, who missed  Saturday's game with a back strain, was replaced by Derrick Walker, a  sixth-round draft choice from Michigan. ... Charger cornerback Sam Seale left  in the second quarter with a mild quadriceps strain. . . . Nose tackle Les  Miller left the game in the third quarter with a hyper-extended elbow and did  not return.  </P></p>

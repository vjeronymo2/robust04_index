			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Investors likely to focus on results season  -New York After last week, when the stock market reacted mainly to bond price movements, the dollar, and inflation news, investors are now likely to concentrate on the second-quarter results season, which enters its second week today. Few corporate earnings will be as eagerly awaited as IBM's, due Thursday. Its results have long been regarded as a highlight of the season, even if its fortunes have waned in recent years, and its stock overtaken by Merck's as the bellwether of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. IBM's shares have been under pressure, dropping 12 per cent in the past month due to growing uncertainty about what earnings will look like. Pessimists fear it will not come close to matching the 6 per cent sales growth of the first quarter, a view backed by a recent meeting between the company and analysts in which IBM suggested some sales forecasts were overly bullish. There is also some doubt that IBM has been able to make the sort of costs savings analysts regard as essential to its long-term recovery. Consequently, Wall Street earnings forecasts vary from 50 cents to 80 cents a share, although most are at the high end of that range. But even if the figures are disappointing, the stock may not suffer a major sell-off, as the recent fall can be seen as a discounting of bad news. If the numbers are good, then a rally may be in order. It is unlikely the rest of the market will take its cue from IBM. The days when 'Big Blue' led the market up - and down - are long since over. Other big companies will be producing results this week, and among the most keenly-watched will be the big money-centre banks, starting with Chase Manhattan today. Citicorp, the largest US bank, will report tomorrow, and the consensus among analysts, according to the First Call service, is for earnings of Dollars 1.22 a share, up from 82 cents a year ago. Trading profits are expected to bounce back from a difficult first quarter, when turmoil in worldwide bond markets hit Citicorp's bottom line. Investors this week are also likely to keep an aye on the Humphrey-Hawkins Testimony, the semi-annual appearance of the Federal Reserve chairman before Congress due to start on Wednesday. Everyone will be keen to hear what, if anything, Fed chairman Mr Alan Greenspan has to say about the role of monetary policy in influencing the valuation of the still-weak dollar. Analysts expect Mr Greenspan to remain silent on the dollar. They say he is more likely to repeat the warning he gave Congress a year ago - that further interest rates increases might be needed to ensure the economy does not add too much fuel to the inflationary fires.</p>

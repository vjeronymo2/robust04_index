			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL 3 COUNTY JC TEAMS TO BEGIN PLAYOFF ACTION IN MEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> The Moorpark College basketball team had taken a wait-and-see attitude about  making the playoffs all season. So it came as no surprise to Coach Al Nordquist  that the Raiders were still waiting to find out about a postseason berth after  finishing their regular-season games.  </P> <P> To Nordquist's relief, the wait ended Monday when Moorpark earned a berth to  the Southern California regional junior college basketball playoffs after  finishing 16-14, 6-8 in the Western State Conference. Ventura and Oxnard also  made the playoffs.  </P> <P> Compton, the 11th-seeded team, plays host to 22nd-seeded Moorpark in a  first-round game Saturday.  </P> <P> Moorpark qualified for the playoffs for the first time in three years despite  losing its last four games, including a 100-93 double-overtime loss to Ventura  College on Saturday.  </P> <P> "I thought we had a good chance and I felt like we deserved to go to the  playoffs," Nordquist said. "I think our overall record was good enough to get  us in and our schedule was tougher this season."  </P> <P> For Nordquist, who started the season with 11 new players on a 13-man squad,  making the playoffs was especially gratifying.  </P> <P> "I was pleased with the way this team came together and played all year,"  Nordquist said. "We basically have players who are very average. There are no  real superstars on this team."  </P> <P> The Raiders will make good use of their week off before the playoffs start. The  time off will allow more time for freshman guard Bruce Watson's injured hand to  heal. Watson, who averages 16 points to lead Moorpark in scoring, returned to  the lineup against Ventura after missing two games because of a cut index  finger.  </P> <P> "Bruce will be ready," Nordquist said.  </P> <P> Compton (20-10, 10-4) placed second in the Southern California Conference.  Sophomore forward Jerry Morgan is averaging 19.8 points a game to lead the  Tartars in scoring.  </P> <P> Oxnard was in an even more uncertain position coming into this season than  Moorpark. Coach Remy McCarthy took over a Condor team that finished 7-22 and  won only one of 14 conference games last season.  </P> <P> The Condors (19-11, 9-5) finished second in the WSC Northern Division behind  Ventura, which has a first-round bye. Tenth-seeded Oxnard plays host to  23rd-seeded Cypress (13-16, 5-7 in the Orange Empire Conference) Saturday at 7  p.m.  </P> <P> Despite the Condors' improvement, McCarthy is not satisfied at just making the  playoffs.  </P> <P> "With Oxnard not having a good season last year, you can look at making the  playoffs as a victory," McCarthy said. "But I don't want to look at the  playoffs like that. We can't be satisfied with just getting there. I want to  win two or three."  </P> <P> Guard Mike Price is averaging 19 points a game to lead Oxnard in scoring. Randy  Carter is second at 18.4 points and is the Condors' leading rebounder.  </P> <P> Cypress finished in a four-way tie for third in the Orange Empire Conference  after losing its last three games. Andre Lamoureux, a 6-9 freshman forward,  leads the team in scoring and rebounding. Lamoureux and Mike Varos, a 5-8  guard, are each averaging 12.9 points a game.  </P> <P> Cypress, which has won two state titles since 1977, is shooting 74% from the  free-throw line. Ian Donnelly has made 95% of his free throws to lead Cypress.  </P> <P> Ventura, the WSC Northern Division champion, does not begin its state title  quest until next week after drawing a first-round bye. The fifth-seeded Pirates  (27-5, 12-2) will play the winner of the Rancho Santiago-Citrus game.  </P> <P> The Pirates advanced to only the second round of the state playoffs last season  before losing to Palomar. Ventura won the 1986-87 state title.  </P> <P> Six teams from the WSC advanced to the playoffs. The state finals will be held  March 9-11 at Santa Clara University.  </P></p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / World Trade News: EU tackles US-Japan trade ties - Guy de Jonquieres on Brussels fears over concessions to Washington The European Union will seek concrete assurances from Tokyo this autumn that Japan will not respond to US pressure on trade by favouring US exporters at the expense of European producers. Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, plans to stress his concern about such discrimination at a long-delayed meeting on November 19 in Tokyo with a Japanese team led by Mr Ryutaro Hashimoto, the minister for international trade and industry. Though the EU has still to formulate specific demands, commission officials in Brussels say Sir Leon is determined that the meeting agree practical measures to ensure that any Japanese trade concessions to the US are also extended to Europe. 'Sir Leon will be delivering a tacit ultimatum to the Japanese,' one official said. He aims to underline the importance of the meeting by taking with him several other senior commissioners. At last weekend's Quad summit in Los Angeles, Sir Leon taxed Mr Hashimoto with several cases where the EU believes Japan has accorded US suppliers preferential treatment for political reasons. He is worried that such practices may proliferate as Japan seeks to head off the threat that the US will designate its trade practices as unfair at the end of this month and initiate trade sanctions proceedings under its Super 301 legislation. Among the instances of apparent discrimination cited by the EU are: A sharp rise in the value of Japanese imports of US cars and car parts in the first half of this year, while imports from Europe fell. Japan Airlines' decision this year to buy Boeing 737-400 aircraft without seriously considering the rival Airbus A320. Japanese carriers' consistent failure to specify Rolls-Royce aero-engines for their airline fleets. Exemption of US medical equipment from inspection procedures still applied to similar European exports. Several European governments have expressed fears that their exporters may be squeezed out of the Japanese market. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, recently wrote to Mr Tomichi Murayama, his Japanese counterpart, demanding that Dassault be given equal treatment with US companies in bidding to supply support aircraft to Japan's self-defence agency. The November meeting will pose a test of Sir Leon's policy of extracting trade concessions from Japan through patient negotiation, in contrast to the noisily aggressive tactics and threats of sanctions deployed by the US. The meeting follows a rebuff by the US and Japan last spring of a proposal by Sir Leon that they should expand their bilateral trade talks to include the EU. Since last year, EU and Japanese officials have met regularly to try to identify and negotiate away obstacles in cases where internationally successful European companies had difficulty penetrating the Japanese market. However, the only substantive results so far have been a relaxation of its beer licensing rules and the establishment of joint industry groups to discuss co-operation between European and Japanese manufacturers. Successive Japanese governments have also resisted EU proposals for ministerial-level trade talks. It has taken a year since the idea was reluctantly accepted by Tokyo to set up this November's meeting. EU officials hope that, as well as securing Japanese commitments to equal treatment of European exports, the meeting will expand regular bilateral negotiations to a wider range of industry sectors and markets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      Japanese/EU Trade (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           Exports   Imports   Balance    Exports    Imports    Balance           (Japan)   (EU to)                            Annual totals           (to EU)   (Japan)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Q1 91     15969.6    8524.5    7445.1 Q2 91     14596.8    7536.0    7060.8 Q3 91     14031.0    7595.4    6435.6 Q4 91     14959.8    8278.8    6681.0    59557.2    31934.7    27622.5 Q1 92     16615.5    8034.0    8581.5 Q2 92     15711.3    7530.0    8181.3 Q3 92     16141.5    7869.9    8271.6 Q4 92     14390.4    7956.0    6434.4    62858.7    31389.9    31468.8 Q1 93     15621.9    7280.7    8341.2 Q2 93     14031.6    7502.4    6529.2 Q3 93     13857.0    7686.9    6170.1 Q4 93     13087.2    7795.8    5291.4    56597.7    30265.8    26331.9 Q1 94     13988.7    7671.0    6317.7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

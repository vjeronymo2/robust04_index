Also present were chairmen of the government coalition  parties -- Jan Kalvoda of the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA),  Josef Lux of the Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak  People's Party (KDU-CSL) and Ivan Pilip of the Christian  Democratic Party (KDS). Premier Klaus is also chairman of the  fourth government coalition party -- the Civic Democratic Party  (ODS).    Havel said the Czech Republic's security situation from the  long-term perspective and the Czech security relations were  discussed at the meeting, organised by Zieleniec.    Klaus characterised the meeting as a "conceptual philosophic  debate" and "clarifying of general matters." He said that  similar meetings serve to diminish the number of political  statements which harm the Czech Republic's reputation abroad.    Baudys told journalists that neither his proposal for  solving  the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina nor the Czech-German relations  have been discussed.    Parliament Deputy Chairman Jan Kasal told CTK today that  Baudys has interrupted his vacation to attend the meeting.    Deputy Foreign Ministers Pavel Bratinka and Alexandr Vondra  were reportedly also present at the meeting.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 2 Jun (EFE) -- Three of the Cubans who broke  into the Belgian Embassy in Havana last Saturday left the  building last night, according to official sources. The sources  did not give the identity of the people who left the embassy  last night, nor the identity of the person who left Sunday night.    Observers believe the four who left the residence of the  Belgian ambassador could be the last people who were  unexplainably able to break through dozens of police on Saturday  morning. In documents released to the media on Tuesday, the  refugees expressed their suspicions that the four were State  Security agents.</p>

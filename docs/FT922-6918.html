			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Daimler helps Frankfurt to 21-month high APART from some weakness in Scandinavia, continental bourses were mostly firmer, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rose to a 21-month high as domestic and foreign investors responded to this week's engineering and construction pay deals, and positive comments from Daimler-Benz on Tuesday. Volume rose to DM9.9bn from DM7.2bn. After a 6.84 rise to 717.40 for the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX ended 24.24, or 1.4 per cent higher, at 1,787.50, its highest close since August 3, 1990. Some analysts expect it to approach its all-time, March 1990 high of 1,976.43 within six months. Optimism hinged largely on Daimler's expectation that 1992 results will be above those of 1991. In a broadly based gain taking in carmakers and chemicals, steels and some engineers, both Daimler and AEG were boosted by the former's statement that it did not expect to book an AEG loss in 1992. AEG rose DM6 to DM212 and its parent by DM16.50 to DM804. Construction stocks liked the wage deal, and forecasts of further growth in the sector. Bilfinger &amp; Berger led them up with a rise of DM24.80 to DM1,060. Retailers were mixed: Karstadt put on DM24 or 3.8 per cent to DM655; but Douglas closed DM26 lower at DM615 on a forecast of flat or lower earnings this year, after an early rise of DM14 to DM655 on higher profits for 1991. PARIS inched higher after Tuesday's drop but dealers said investors were getting cautious after the market's recent rally. The CAC-40 index ended up 7.71 at 2,030.84 in modest turnover of FFr2bn. Alcatel Alsthom was one of the day's more prominent losers, as the stock touched a low of FFr639 before closing FFr12 to FFr646 on news that it had placed 10m American Depositary Shares in the US at Dollars 23 5/8 each, which traders said was the equivalent to FFr635 in the French share price. In the afternoon, it was reported that a block of 290,000 American Depositary Rights in Elf Aquitaine were traded at Dollars 36 1/8 . In Paris, the shares closed FFr5.20 higher at FFr387.10. MILAN was enlivened by industrial stocks. The Comit index rose 2.21 to 475.01 in turnover estimated at L95bn after L76bn on Tuesday. Olivetti added L112 or 3.7 per cent to close at a 1992 high of L3,144, while Fiat broke through L5,000 on the kerb, having closed L19 higher at L4,960. Montedison added L10 to L1,475. The banking sector recovered as Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) rebounded L49 to L2,967 after its 4 per cent plunge on Tuesday. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index rose 0.8 to 130.2 on foreign institutional interest. There was active buying in Buehrmann-Tetterode on reports of a buy recommendation from a UK brokers and it closed up Fl 1.70 or 3.5 per cent to Fl 49.80. KLM remained a favourite on renewed speculation that merger talks with BA had been reopened. It gained 70 cents to Fl 40.10. Polygram rose 70 cents to Fl 50.90 on news that it had formed a joint venture with Universal Pictures for the distribution of films in the US, while Heineken took comfort from the hot weather in Europe and was Fl 2 stronger at Fl 165. ZURICH brokers said that continuing high Swiss interest rates were keeping some investors away. The market gave up some earlier gains on a lack of buying interest, as the SMI index of leading shares rose 5.4 to 1,933.4 in quiet trading. Winterthur bearers fell SFr20 to SFr3,350. After the close the insurer said it would raise dividends after an 112 per cent increase in 1991 profits, and that it was opening up its share register to foreigners. STOCKHOLM was little changed as in Astra led most blue chips higher, balancing declines in domestic stocks and Volvo, where the B free fell SKr8 to SKr423 after Tuesday's SKr248m first quarter loss. The Affarsvarlden General Index rose 0.9 to 999.3 in heavy turnover of SKr900m. Astra accounted for SKr360m of total turnover, as the B unrestricted shares advanced SKr19 to SKr547 after Tuesday's favourable first quarter earnings report. The company also raised its forecast for full year profit growth to more than 25 per cent. BRUSSELS was firmer as dealers squared positions on the last day of the forward account. The Bel-20 index advanced 4.05 to 1,224.19. Petrofina rose BFr75 to BFr11,400 ahead of today's dividend payment.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAY 20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1185.44  1186.14  1186.46  1188.02  1188.59  1188.43  1187.94  1187.62  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1188.97    Day's Low  1185.37  -----------------------------------------------------------------------       May 19    May 18    May 15    May 14    May 13      1180.66   1184.41   1171.24   1179.98   1187.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

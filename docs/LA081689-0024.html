			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALES TAX  </P> <P> In her letter (July 27) (regarding mail-order loophole), Assemblywoman Gwen  Moore states, "Local retailers and national firms with stores in California  already make a substantial contribution to the state's revenues." Maybe someone  should explain to Ms. Moore how the state sales tax works. The "local retailers  and national firms" are not making "the substantial contribution"; the  taxpayers are making that contribution.  </P> <P> It is heartwarming to know, however, she feels that by having us pay this  additional tax she has "acted to secure our taxpayers' interests." As the  saying goes, with friends like this, who needs enemies?  </P> <P> ANADEL MILLER  </P> <P> Whittier  </P></p>

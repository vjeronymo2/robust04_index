			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Fine not an appropriate response Sir, Can anybody tell me what purpose is served by imposing a fine on a mutual society such as Norwich Union? As I understand it, the Financial Services Act was introduced to help protect the public from financial loss through being sold inappropriate long-term financial products. Mutual societies have no shareholders, so all their profits are distributed to their with-profits policyholders. Therefore, those who suffer financial loss from the imposition of a fine are the very people the legislation was designed to protect. Surely more thought could be given to the penalties imposed for infringements of the regulators' rules? For instance, fines could be imposed on directors and chief executives or regulators could be given the power to remove the chief executive of a persistent offender.

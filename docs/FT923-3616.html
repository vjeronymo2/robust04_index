			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / World Trade News: No substance to Mirage denial PERSISTENT reports that the French government has authorised 'in principle' the sale of 60 Mirage 2000-5 fighter jets to Taiwan yesterday elicited only a half-hearted denial by the French Ministry of Industry and Trade. Commenting on a report by the French news agency AFP, quoting 'concordant French sources', that the green light for the Dollars 2.6bn deal had been given to the French manufacturers, Dassault Aviation, Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French Minister of Industry and Trade, said that the export of Mirages to Taiwan had not been 'officially authorised.' 'As long as a detailed dossier of the sale has not been formally submitted to the government by the industrialists concerned, we cannot make a decision,' the minister said. But he was quick to add that the government would not consider such a sale as 'an aggression against China,' which has registered its strong opposition to any sales of fighter-bombers of the Mirage type to Taiwan. For good measure, Mr Strauss-Kahn stressed that the French government had given its blessing to Dassault for its efforts to sell Mirage fighter-bombers to Taiwan. The sale of French warplanes to Taiwan has long been a subject of dispute between government departments favouring a deal, the ministries of defence, finance and industry, and the foreign ministry, which opposes it because of the adverse effect on Franco-Chinese relations. However, the economic arguments in favour of such a deal are powerful. Dassault, which has not sold a single military aircraft abroad since 1988, desperately needs export orders to boost its falling profits. Moreover, an aircraft deal with Taiwan could open the door to further export orders for France for high-speed trains and nuclear power stations, it is hoped in Paris. The US proposal to sell F-16s to Taiwan could ease the Chinese pressure on France to abandon the deal. Moreover, French officials believe Taiwan may be ready to share its military aircraft market between the US and France.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Marseille, France, March 28 (AFP) -- Bernard Tapie,  the flamboyant politician and businessman who owns the Olympique  Marseille football team, has been indicted in connection with  fraud in the club's accounts, officials revealed Monday [28  March].    The officials, who spoke after Tapie's stunning victory  Sunday in a local election with 67.88 percent of the vote, did  not reveal the exact charges, but said examining magistrate  Pierre Philippon discretely indicted Tapie on March 10.    It was Tapie's third indictment.    Officials at the public prosecutor's office said Philippon  was probing alleged "forgery and embezzlement" in the club's  accounts after then Justice Minister Michel Vauzelle in 1992  ordered an investigation into nine French clubs, including  Marseille.    Tapie, 50, was charged last month with bribery and  interfering with witnesses involved in attempts to pay three  Valenciennes players to throw a game against Marseille last May  20.    On December 22, he was charged with embezzlement at Bethune,  northern France, in a case involving the Testut weighing machine  firm in his business empire.    Tapie, urban affairs minister in the socialist government  ousted last month, swept to victory in a former communist-held  constituency over far-right National Front candidate  Marie-Claude Rossignol. She received 32.13 percent of the vote.    Tapie, who is also Marseille MP for the Radical Left, an  ally  of the Socialist Party, said after the first round of voting on  March 20 that he was now aiming for the mayoralty of France's  third largest city in municipal elections in 1995. He also  plans to head the Radical Left list in the European elections in  June.    Earlier this month, Tapie reached an accord with the  state-owned loss-making Credit Lyonnais bank to write off his  debts and to sell off all his business interests in his empire,  Bernard Tapie-France, with a mortgage on his personal fortune.    The risk for the bank could be up to 500 million francs  (84.8  million dollars). Right-wing MP Philippe de Villiers called for  an inquiry into the debt write-off.    Before the Valenciennes scandal, Marseille won the French  championship for the fifth consecutive year and on May 26 its  fortunes were at their zenith when Marseille beat A.C. Milan to  win the European Cup, becoming the first French club to do so.    On September 6, football's governing body in Europe, UEFA,  barred Marseille from the European Cup.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Travel: Burgundy, only the real thing will do - Film critic Nigel Andrews, motoring aimlessly around French country lanes, finds more delights than in all the guidebooks THE SMALL silver-grey object hurtling through Burgundy once a year to or from the Cannes film festival is a Honda Ballade. It belongs to this writer, who, when let out of a cinema, is known to attach himself recklessly to a steering wheel. He is also known to be astounded on discovering a real world out there beyond the movie screen: real people, real trees and, above all, in Burgundy, real castles and cows. Although the Cote d'Or is, strictly speaking, a smallish region to the north of Nuits St George, it should be stretched to take in all those buttercup-covered, cattle-thronged, history-haunted fields to the west - and north-west and south-west - of Dijon. Here is the most beautiful part of France. You may keep the Dordogne and the villages of Provence. Keep, too, the Loire valley, with its hordes of tourists. This region of Burgundy is what the world was truly like when it resembled a medieval illuminated manuscript. Consider first all those entrancing motorway signs. Not 'Beaune 52, Lyon 216' but those chestnut-and-white tourist information signs saying, sometimes with illustration, 'Vezelay, colline eternelle,' or 'Paysage Avallonais,' or 'Oiseaux migrateurs,' or 'Buses, rapaces, utiles.' This last refers not to local transport facilities but to the heraldic-looking buzzards that wheel rapaciously overhead. Above all, there are cows and castles. The cows are white, the castles grey to pinkish-brown. The cows are more beautiful than any others in Europe, large dozy sirens with long eyelashes, quizzical muzzles and gleaming alabaster hides. Their fastidious choice of a standing or recumbent position is known to predict the weather better than any other of their kind east of Dover. And the castles, unlike the set-syllabus ones on the Loire, are charmingly battered grandees with missing towers or sinking keeps. They seem to be growing back into the landscape, repossessed by Nature. Once they were watering holes for the famed Ducs de Bourgogne, a dynastic foursome that saw Burgundy to the height of its power between 1364 and 1477. Now, scattered widely around a line between Auxerre and Beaune, the castles testify to the ivy-threatened ephemerality of power. Rather than list them all, let me try you out on the poetry of their names - Ancy-Le-Franc, Le Chastenay, Couches, Chateauneuf-en-Auxois - and home in on two favourites. Bussy-Rabutin, near Flavigny, north-west of Dijon, is a dinky-toy version of Chantilly. Four cream-coloured towers surround an originally medieval house, the facade of which was revamped in the 17th century by Roger de Rabutin. Roger, a colourful fellow, was exiled there by Louis XIV after contributing some scurrilous lyrics about the king's love life to an orgy that he, Roger, attended. Once so sequestered, Roger wrote the salacious Amorous History of the Gauls, available from the chateau bookshop, and had the walls painted with allegorical tableaux. Many of these were also salacious, but they were so deeply encoded in symbols that few today can understand them, least of all a British film critic trying to follow the fast French of a lady tour-guide. At least we can wonder at their surreal oddity - here an exploding haystack, there a giant onion sitting in a road, here a female nude, there a flailing red-eyed monster of no known sex. My other favourite among Burgundian chateaux is Commarin, north of Beaune. Lost somewhere in time and an overgrown French village, it could be auditioning as a location for Le Grand Meaulnes. 'Through two 18th century gates one penetrates into the Court of Honour' (I translate from Henriette de Ganay's useful Les Routes des de Ducs de Bourgogne, price FFr18). The castle, never sold, has been lived in by the same family since the 14th century. And the 16th century tapestries are dazzling: flaming globes, mermaids, lions in every known heraldic position, and scrolls with teasingly obscure legends (Tant le desir; Aigre et douce). There is another modest centre of magic in Burgundy and one that nourishes both cows and castle-dwellers - the source of the Seine. Tucked away near the village of St Germain, this little-signposted enclosure of tree and field and water belongs to the city of Paris. Paris is possessive about its noble river, howsoever humbly it gushes forth from beneath a nude stone Nereid presiding over a fake grotto in this undersung tourist site. In truth, there are several other sources if you go walkabout in the region. But this was deemed the principal one by Napoleon III who erected a plaque to the grotto's left. In the harsh sunlight one can barely read the incised legend, so why not turn to the more helpful English-language guidebook. 'Water courses uncompromising out cavern,' it says, 'beginning its mighty arch through a land of forest to the grand burg.' The grandest burg around here is Dijon, closely followed by Beaune. This brings us to the subject of cooking. I have tried to put a tactful distance between my last mention of Burgundian cows and my next topic, which is boeuf a la Bourguignonne. As made in Burgundy, it is an indelible experience. Using good meat marinaded for about six years, the dish sends flavours rocketing around your mouth. Wine, onion, mustard, bacon, garlic, herbs  - a hint of orange - and all this swilled down with a good bottle of St Emilion. If you cannot bring yourself to eat the beautiful white cow of the Cote d'Or, the other Burgundy special is jambon braise a la creme - succulent slices of ham covered with a brandy and cream sauce and garnished with . . . but that is enough. I am sitting in a London flat and Burgundy is too far away. There are few, if any, bad restaurants in this region. But my happiest eating experiences have been in a little town called Arnay-Le-Duc, where Chez Camille gets rosetted by Michelin and other cheaper dining-rooms are barely less good. As for accommodation, its proximity to the motorway and its modest prices make the Val Vert at Pouilly-en-Auxois a good bargain (beware of the ants in Room 21). Dijon and Beaune are full of good middle-price hostelries, many taken over by the voracious Mercure and Altea chains. There is one more thing worth saying about Burgundy. You should not go simply to the places you are told to go to. Motoring aimlessly around country lanes, one finds more delights than in all the guidebooks. At Clomot, near Pouilly, there is a gorgeous view of a private chateau with a long lilac-topped wall and a white horse grazing in a stream below. At Pouilly itself there is a magically overgrown railway station, last in active service when Claude Lelouch directed Jean-Louis Trintignant in some French film whose shooting I stumbled on six years ago. And at almost every turning in every road there is a view of lush green hillsides studded with whiter-than-white cows. The sight makes one swear off beef for life. Or at least until dinner-time, whichever comes sooner.</p>

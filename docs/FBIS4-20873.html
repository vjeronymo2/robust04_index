			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris </F> Krivoshey and Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 17 Mar -- The decision by the U.S. President  to prolong the nuclear test moratorium for another year, up to  September 1995, has been met with satisfaction in Russia. This  was stated at a briefing today by Grigoriy Karasin, director of  the department of information and the press of the Russian  Foreign Ministry.    He stressed that Russia's position on this question remained  unchanged. We were the initiators of the trilateral moratorium  on nuclear tests, which is being observed de facto by Britain,  too, and we recently stated once again our intention of  continuing to adhere to it. At the same time we called on the  other nuclear countries to do the same, the spokesman of the  Russian Foreign Ministry stated.    In connection with this, he recalled that during the  Russian-U.S. summit meeting in Moscow, Presidents Boris Yeltsin  and Bill Clinton confirmed Russia's and the United States'  commitment to achieving within a very short period an  international treaty on the total banning of nuclear tests.  Karasin also noted the constructive atmosphere at the talks on  this question, which are taking place at the disarmament  conference in Geneva.</p>

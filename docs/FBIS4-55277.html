			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 11 May--According to Prime Minister Waldemar  Pawlak, the "strike atmosphere is dying out," which creates a  good climate for direct talks and for resolving problems.    At a meeting with the regional press in Warsaw today, the  prime minister stated that the government is anxious to preserve  the basic principle of democracy so that all of the major  partners-signatories to the enterprise pact would participate in  talks. That is why the government is attaching importance to  negotiations within the Tripartite Commission, Pawlak added.    Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and minister of  finance, said that the government will not pay for the strikes.  Asked about their costs, he said they are "too great,  inadmissible, and unacceptable from a social viewpoint" and  that, if they were to continue, all of society would shoulder  the burden. Then it would be difficult to return to the  previous income tax rates, he added.    In Prime Minister Pawlak's view, in accordance with the law,  compensatory pay for the strikes should be paid by trade unions.  This has been the case in one of the collieries. "When  decisions are made, responsibility for their consequences is  needed," he said.</p>

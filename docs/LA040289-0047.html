			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> SIGHTINGS INCREASE AS HOUSES PUSH INTO WILDERNESS;  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DEVELOPMENT, COYOTES COLLIDE  </P> <P> In San Clemente, coyotes serenade each other from the front lawns of startled  residents.  </P> <P> In East Tustin, the sight of the coyotes running through one neighborhood has  prompted residents to post "Beware Coyote" signs.  </P> <P> And in Fullerton, coyotes have become so brazen at Orange County's Craig  Regional Park that they stand and glare at approaching rangers before calmly  retreating into the brush.  </P> <P> As new housing tracts push steadily into the shrinking wilderness of Orange  County, coyotes are turning up at an ever-increasing rate.  </P> <P> And with February and March, their mating season, coyotes are more visible --  and louder -- than ever.  </P> <P> "I hear them howling so much that it's like an animal powwow," said Linda  Emerson, 29, a San Clemente homemaker whose property abuts open hills.  </P> <P> Although no figures are available on exactly how many coyotes inhabit the  county, an indication of their abundance can be gleaned from the few agencies  that log coyote-related calls.  </P> <P> Orange County Animal Control officials, for example, receive up to 100 coyote  complaints a year; there were virtually none a decade ago. Most of the calls  are coming from foothill communities, where the county's development is  concentrated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> San Clemente Calls  </P> <P> In San Clemente alone, officials have logged more than 60 calls in the last  year, most from the city's new housing tracts, which snake into rolling hills.  </P> <P> Many coyote sightings have also been reported nearer the coast. Coyotes have  been known to run down the middle of streets in Laguna Beach. And in Dana  Point, coyotes inhabiting a deep canyon ringed by development awaken residents  at night with their howls.  </P> <P> "We do hear them approximately three nights out of seven," said Chris  Christianson, 26, a resident of Dana Point's Thunderbird tract, which overlooks  a canyon.  </P> <P> "They're not really that much of a problem, other than they disturb you in the  evening with their howls."  </P> <P> Cowardly creatures by nature, coyotes for the most part are not a threat to  people, wildlife biologists said. But they can become vicious if they begin  relying upon neighborhood food sources and, in the process, lose their fear of  people, said Bruce Cahill, a Los Angeles County wildlife biologist who is a  consultant for Orange and other Southland counties.  </P> <P> "They steal lunch bags from children. Adults are threatened if they come up on  a mother and her pups," Cahill said.  </P> <P> The first sign of trouble is when the coyotes start getting into garbage, said  Tom Paulek, a state Fish and Game wildlife biologist in Long Beach. Next, they  start going into back yards and gobbling up leftover pet food. Then they start  gobbling up the pets.  </P> <P> Eventually, Paulek and Cahill said, coyotes become so dependent on these  artificial food sources that they lose their desire to hunt for small game. And  when this happens, small children can become targets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Handful of Incidents  </P> <P> In Southern California, there have been a handful of incidents since 1980 in  which coyotes have attacked and injured children; the most serious occurred in  1981, when a young girl was attacked and killed by a coyote in Glendale.  </P> <P> In Orange County, there have been four reported coyote attacks on children in  recent years; three in San Clemente in 1983 and 1986 and one in Yorba Linda in  1987. No one was killed.  </P> <P> Coyote attacks on pets have occurred in such heavily urbanized areas as Craig  Park in Fullerton, a 124-acre preserve surrounded by shopping centers, housing  tracts and freeways. In recent months, coyotes there have killed several small  dogs left unleashed, against park rules, said Joe Cooke, the park's senior  ranger.  </P> <P> Cooke added that the park's coyotes -- numbering perhaps half a dozen -- have  also become so bold that they pause to watch as rangers drive up. A coyote's  normal reaction to approaching people is to bolt immediately.  </P> <P> Rangers at two other county parks, Carbon Canyon Regional Park in Brea and  Irvine Regional Park in Orange, are also reporting increasingly brazen coyotes.  </P> <P> Unlike mountain lions and other large wild animals -- whose populations have  diminished as development has encroached into their habitat -- coyotes seem to  thrive on close human contact and have eluded man's efforts to control their  population.  </P> <P> Studies by the Los Angeles County Agricultural Commission have shown a coyote  population as dense as 50 animals per square mile near new developments; they  average one animal per 10 square miles in the wild.  </P> <P> The population explosion is fueled by the new housing developments that offer  an ideal combination of additional food and water for coyotes, Cahill said.  </P> <P> And the greenbelt areas that now accompany most large housing tracts afford  "perfect habitat" for coyotes, he said: "They use the greenbelts for refuge  from jumping in and out of back yards. And the coyote doesn't have to worry  about some farmer protecting his crops."  </P> <P> But what is good for the coyote is not good for man.  </P> <P> "We all have this romantic view of the coyote, but coyote and man in large  quantities are just not compatible," Cahill said.  </P> <P> Mass killing of the animals is not a solution, Cahill and other wildlife  experts said, because it is neither desired nor politically acceptable.  </P> <P> Limited kills, which were conducted in San Clemente in 1983 and 1986 after  toddlers were attacked, had the short-term effect of weeding out "troublemaker"  coyotes and deterring others, said San Clemente Fire Marshal Gene Bagnall.  </P> <P> "The last time we did this, we left kills in the field to dissuade other  coyotes from coming in," Bagnall said.  </P> <P> In 1983, a police sharpshooter patrol tracked and killed 11 coyotes; following  the 1986 attack, a hunter killed 22 more.  </P> <P> But Bagnall added that the limited kills are only a stopgap. Eventually --  perhaps as soon as this year -- the city will have to send a hunter out to get  rid of new problem coyotes, he said.  </P> <P> The best solution to the problem is educating the public on how to keep food  away from coyotes, Bagnall and the other wildlife experts agreed.  </P> <P> Bagnall ticked off a few do's and don'ts: "Don't leave dog food out. Don't  leave your cat out. Put lids on your trash cans."  </P> <P> Above all, never deliberately feed the coyotes. One man in Glendale, for  instance, used to feed the neighborhood coyotes more than 100 pounds of pet  food per week, Cahill said.  </P> <P> San Clemente enacted an ordinance prohibiting people from feeding coyotes, as  has Los Angeles County and several L.A. County communities.  </P> <P> When coyotes are not stirring up problems, many people enjoy having them around  and listening to their plaintive wail.  </P> <P> One San Clemente man expressed disappointment, in fact, when coyotes failed to  turn up near his home when he entertained out-of-town guests last week.  </P> <P> "We asked our visitors after their first night if they had heard the coyotes,  and they said no," said the man, who did not want to give his name. "I had  wanted them to put on a show."  </P></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Citizen plunges 26% with outlook bleak CITIZEN, the leading Japanese watch and electronics manufacturer, yesterday warned that the Japanese business environment would become increasingly severe in the second half of this fiscal year after reporting a 26.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits in the six months to September. Citizen said that despite the Japanese government's emergency spending package announced in August, the company was planning for increasingly harsh business conditions in the second half. The company said it expected sluggish consumer demand and industrial investment in Japan would be compounded by slow growth in export markets in Europe and the US. This partly reflected the recent rise in the value of the yen which has undermined the competitiveness of Japanese exports. Citizen, which makes industrial machinery, personal computers and portable televisions as well as watches, reported a 25.6 per cent fall in operating profits to Y5.8bn (Dollars 47m) in the six months to September compared with the same period last year. Pre-tax profits fell 26.7 per cent to Y7.5bn on a 1.6 per cent increase in sales to Y123.8bn. Net income per share was 7.8 per cent down at Y14.7 but the company maintained its interim dividend at Y4. Citizen's business divisions reported widely differing results. The watch division, which accounts for about half the company's turnover, fell from Y62.6bn in the first half of last year to Y62bn this year. Sales of luxury watches were particularly badly hit which reduced the average price per unit sold. Sales of industrial machinery such as computer numerically controlled machine tools fell by 40.8 per cent to Y9bn. Information equipment sales were 21 per cent up, largely thanks to Citizen's miniaturised notebook computers and higher floppy disk drive sales. This offset a decline in computer printer sales in Europe and north America. Electronics equipment revenues rose by 23 per cent to Y17.3bn largely as a result of increased sales of liquid crystal displays and portable colour televisions.</p>

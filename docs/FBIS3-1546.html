			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Nigerian Army says it has uncovered the real  objective behind the recently concluded Franco-Beninese joint  military exercise. A statement from the director of Army public  relations says the level of participation and the manner in  which the weeklong exercise was conducted showed that it was a  preparation by France to eventually intervene on the side of  Cameroon should the Bakassi dispute escalate.    The statement said about 544 officers including four  colonels, two lieutenant colonels, and three majors left France  with a lot of sophisticated armament and weapon systems for the  exercise, and that some of the weapons were left in Benin  Republic at the end, parts of which could be diverted to  Cameroon for possible use against Nigeria. The Army says that  military observers from neighboring countries including Nigeria,  who were invited to witness the exercise, were not given any  chance to see the arms and equipment used but were encouraged in  tourism and ceremonial matters.    The statement points out what it called the clandestine and  questionable role of France in the Nigeria-Cameroon problem as  against Nigeria's genuine efforts toward a peaceful resolution  of the conflict.</p>

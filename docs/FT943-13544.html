			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / BBA executive departs after disagreement BBA, the engineering and motor components group, yesterday announced that one of its most senior managers was leaving after a fundamental disagreement with Mr Roberto Quarta, the chief executive recruited last year to conduct a root-and-branch restructuring. Mr Peter Crawford, chief executive of the group's automotive division, was told early yesterday that his tier of management was being abolished and that Mr Quarta was taking over his responsibilities. Mr Quarta, who earlier this year announced a proposed dividend cut and 2,000 job losses, said Mr Crawford's departure was part of a general review. He did not rule out further job losses among senior executives. The 44-year-old chief executive, who arrived from BTR last November, said he had given the existing management six months to respond to new objectives. 'I spelt out the aim to achieve double-digit growth by 1996, and the automotive division was the key to that improvement.' Profits in the automotive division fell 42.8 per cent to Pounds 21.5m last year, while its turnover of Pounds 574.1m represented 40.5 per cent of the group total. Following that performance, Mr Quarta is said to have clashed with Mr Crawford over strategy. Mr Crawford is understood to have called for increased investment in product development in the hope that the division would exploit an upturn in motor manufacturing. Mr Quarta, however, was keen to cut the cost base. 'I decided it would be better to deal directly with the businesses in automotive,' he said. 'I believe in short lines of communication.' Mr George Cartwright, chief executive of the friction materials business, and Mr Bob Gaunt, managing director of power transmission systems, will report directly to Mr Quarta. Mr Crawford, who earned around Pounds 150,000 a year on a two-year rolling contract, was yesterday said to be discussing his severance terms. Although he has been a director of the division and its predecessor Automotive Products for almost 10 years, it is thought unlikely he will receive the full Pounds 300,000 pay-off. Mr Quarta added that he wanted to expand the automotive division's new friction materials business in North America. The shares fell 2p to 206p.</p>

			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> THIEBAUD: CHANGER OF THE MUNDANE INTO THE SURREAL  </P> <P> You're moving your tray down the cafeteria line, reaching for the rolls, the  salad, the hot dish. You swore you weren't going to eat dessert, but the stuff  looks so luscious. That wobbly drift of delicately browned meringue over that  slab of chocolate pie. . . . Well, damn the calories.  </P> <P> Anybody with a sweet tooth knows that siren call. We carry pictures in our  minds of these treats, and we expect that whatever we see in the restaurant  will match our mental images. How could a slice of pie fail to be triangular?  How could meringue not be white and slightly browned on top?  </P> <P> When Northern California artist Wayne Thiebaud began painting pictures of  restaurant desserts in the 1960s, he was struck by the way the food looked  under the harsh, unnatural glare of fluorescent lights. He was intrigued by the  traditional ways desserts are decorated to tempt the diner. And he liked to  think about the differences between their real appearance and the way we  picture them in our minds.  </P> <P> Thiebaud's subjects also include other inanimate objects, as well as the San  Francisco cityscape, landscapes and the human figure. All these bases are  covered by a dandy show of more than 80 of his paintings on paper, drawings and  prints from the past four decades, at the Fine Arts Gallery at UC Irvine  through Nov. 4. The exhibit was organized by Nelson Gallery at UC Davis, where  the 69-year-old artist has taught since 1960.  </P> <P> That was the year when he hit upon his signature approach to objects -- an  effect he once described as "somewhat like the feeling in an air-conditioned,  well-lighted, quiet place where the slightest tremor can be sensed."  </P> <P> Orderly rows of food on plates turn out to be studded with tiny discrepancies  -- variations in the sizes of the cake wedges or the way the cherry garnishes  are plunked on top. Even when Thiebaud zeroes in on a single dish, like a  serving of pudding -- you find yourself noticing the slight ooze of cherry  juice that disturbs the pillowy whiteness of whipped cream.  </P> <P> By isolating his stylized subjects against brightly lit, white backgrounds,  Thiebaud could recreate them as clearly recognizable yet oddly surreal products  of the mind's eye. Objects frequently have rims of bright yellow, red or green,  mimicking the optical phenomenon known as "halation" -- the rainbowlike halo  effect that occurs under bright lighting.  </P> <P> More recently, Thiebaud has used dark backgrounds as a backdrop in such works  as "Dark Candy Apples," a watercolor (it also exists in an oil version). With  </P> <P> nothing else to distract the eye, the viewer is struck by the glossy tactility  of the deep-red glazed apples and by the rhythm of the different angles of the  wood sticks.  </P> <P> Other still-life subjects of his include glistening fish, a hunk of red-brown  rib chops, a smoking cigar, a daffodil in a drinking glass, rows of wire-rimmed  eyeglasses and a pair of polished shoes.  </P> <P> The familiar subject matter and seductive style of Thiebaud's work make it so  immediately lovable that it's easy to ignore or misunderstand its virtues as  serious contemporary art. During the '60s, Thiebaud's food imagery was assumed  to be part of the Pop Art movement, which cast a variably neutral or jaundiced  eye on consumer products and mass media.  </P> <P> In common with a number of pop artists such as Andy Warhol and James  Rosenquist, Thiebaud worked in the commercial-art world before he came to  concentrate on fine art. His clarity and economy of line may well owe something  to the discipline he learned during his days as an illustrator, cartoonist and  Rexall Drug Co. layout design man. (His interest in lighting, on the other  hand, may date all the way back to his stage-crew work for his high school's  theatrical productions.)  </P> <P> But unlike the pop artists, Thiebaud didn't choose to stress the  consumer-oriented aspect of this food. Instead, he followed in the footsteps of  generations of artists who had a particular fascination with small, familiar  objects.  </P> <P> Having worked in restaurants as a youth, Thiebaud remembered (as he once told  an interviewer) how rows of pies or "a tin of pie with a piece cut out of it  and one piece sitting beside it . . . were always poetic to me."  </P> <P> He zeroed in on the formal qualities of this humble food in a particularly  contemporary way, with an ultra-cool, detached approach that stressed minute  variations within multiple images of the same object and simple geometric  forms.  </P> <P> Thiebaud's landscape and city images are the product of the same values.  Although the country scenes are rooted in the Sacramento Valley countryside  Thiebaud knew well, their rhythms, shapes and colors exist only in the artist's  mind.  </P> <P> In a pastel drawing, "Cow Ridge (Three Cows)," three cows separated by equal  distances make their way down a hill that is as severely slanted as the side of  a triangle. The sky is green, the hill is blue, and the shadow patterns of the  animals create a simple three-note harmony. The cows look alike -- except for  the different shapes of their tails.  </P> <P> In 1973, after establishing a second home in San Francisco, Thiebaud began  translating the dizzying grades of San Francisco streets into puzzle-like  stacks of colored shapes. Sometimes combining several perspectives in one view,  he created wonderfully dense and rhythmic patterns that combine specific  building details with vertical ribbons of road. Other works dwell on the shape  of freeway curves, punctuated by slender light poles that droop like delicate  plants.  </P> <P> When his subject was the human figure, the artist must have found it  particularly hard to strip away all the extraneous detail, to treat flesh and  blood with the neutral, bright-light scrutiny of a piece of pie. Thiebaud has  painted suave, immaculately stripped-down canvases of people -- including his  own wife. But the figure drawings on view show him simply as a good draftsman,  not the alchemist who can turn the stuff of daily life into simple, startling  objects that compel attention.  </P> <P> Works in the exhibit from the late '40s and '50s reveal the eclectic activity  of Thiebaud's early days, when he was restlessly pursuing artistic leads from a  range of different sources. This sampling includes a careful, Cubist-derived  landscape ("Rocks and Sea"), an academic portrait ("Woman with Fan") and a  landscape with skittering, Expressionistic dashes of ink flying over the white  paper ("Figures in the Snow/New York City").  </P> <P> Other artistic influences he has acknowledged include the ornate,  presentational style of Byzantine art, the creamy brushwork of the 19th-Century  Italian Macchiaioli painters and the figurative painting of his Bay Area  colleagues, particularly Richard Diebenkorn.  </P> <P> Eventually, he figured out how to combine aspects he admired in these works  with his own distinctive take on the world around him. Watching this process  unfold in the first batch of drawings and watercolors -- watching him single  out the slant of a hill or the tilted display box in a grocer's window -- is  one of the quiet joys of this exhibition.  </P> <P> As a longtime teacher, used to having to explain himself, Thiebaud has made  many pithy observations about his work. Drawing, he once said, is a way "to  test what one can know about the look of such things as grace, sensuality,  affectation, tension, repose, ineffableness, and those many mysterious  characteristics which remain between a question and an answer."  </P> <P>  "Wayne Thiebaud: Works on Paper 1947-1987" remains through Nov. 4 at the UC  Irvine Fine Arts Gallery, in the university's Fine Arts Village off Bridge  Road. Hours are noon to 5 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday. Admission is free.  Information: (714) 856-6610.  </P> <P> </P></p>

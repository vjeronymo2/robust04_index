			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: UNITED WAY REACHES 65% OF FUND GOAL  </P> <P> With eight weeks remaining in the 1989 United Way of Orange County fund-raising  campaign, an estimated 65% of the $20.5-million goal has been achieved,  officials said.  </P> <P> Campaign pledges have risen steadily since the drive's midway point and United  Way officials say they believe the goal can be met if the community responds  generously in the weeks ahead.  </P> <P> Campaign officials had previously expressed pessimism at the rate of giving  this year. But recent tabulations from companies with large employee groups has  been encouraging, said Campaign Chairman Ron Merriman.  </P> <P> Several companies have recorded large increases in employee giving, including  Tarbell Realtors, with a 500% increase over 1988 results; Ciba-Geigy, with a  256% increase over last year's totals and Neiman Marcus employees recorded a  100% increase over last year. County of Orange employees have already raised  more than $45,000 over their campaign goal.  </P> <P> The United Way campaign began on Sept. 9 and will conclude on Jan. 24. CARLA  RIVERA  </P></p>

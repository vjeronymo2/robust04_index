			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, March 11 KYODO -- The United States and  Japan are close to resolving a cellular telephone trade dispute,  U.S. officials said Friday [11 March], predicting the deal will  inject a healthier tone to troubled trade ties between the two  countries.    "We are getting close to an agreement," U.S. Commerce  Secretary Ron Brown said.    Brown told KYODO NEWS SERVICE the two sides have made  "significant progress" in resolving their differences and  indicated a final deal could come at any time.    "We are pleased with that progress but you never announce  agreements before they are finally reached," Brown said.    White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers earlier Friday  characterized the bilateral negotiations as "going very well."    Reports from Tokyo indicated Motorola Inc. and its Japanese  partner, Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp. (IDO), the two firms  embroiled in the dispute, have worked out a tentative accord and  are now working on the specifics.    In a statement released Friday, U.S. Trade Representative  Mickey Kantor cautioned against undue expectations over an  imminent deal, saying the two countries have yet to work out  "all the terms" necessary for an agreement.    "At this time progress has been made but the United States  and Japan have yet to reach agreement on all the terms," Kantor  said in a brief statement issued while on a visit to Chile.    The dispute stems from charges Kantor made a month ago that  the Japanese Government has breached a 1989 trade accord that  provides for "comparable market access" in the cellular phone  service in Japan.    Kantor has threatened to impose trade sanctions on Japan  unless there is a negotiated settlement and the U.S. Government  is scheduled to unveil a list by March 17 of Japanese products  that will be subject to punitive tariffs.    Brown sounded a note of optimism in his interview with KYODO  when asked about the impact of a cellular phone accord on the  overall bilateral relationship.    "Every success is a good sign in improving the trade  relationship," he said.    Laura Tyson, head of the White House Council of Economic  Advisers, echoed Brown's assessment.    A cellular phone agreement would be "a step forward in terms  of the trade tensions and trade relations between the two  countries," Tyson told KYODO.    Saddled by a vast Japanese trade surplus, trade ties between  Japan and the U.S. have taken a sharp plunge with the collapse  of top-level trade talks February 11 between Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton.    Kantor has seized the cellular phone dispute as an example  of  Japan's unwillingness to open its markets, particularly in  high-technology sectors, to foreign competition.    The prospect of a settlement in the cellular phone dispute  under the threat of U.S. sanctions has convinced some officials  in the U.S. Government that a "get-tough" trade policy with  Japan works.    "We have taken a very firm position" with regard to Japan,  Brown told a news conference Friday. "I happen to believe that  the results of that policy are now looming to fruition," he said.</p>

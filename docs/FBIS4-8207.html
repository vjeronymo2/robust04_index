			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 11 (AFP) -- Russia's special envoy  to ex-Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin criticized the United Nations  Monday for launching air strikes against Serb positions in  Gorazde saying that the international community had embarked on  a "slippery slope" in Bosnia.    "We are very much concerned that maybe we are on a slippery  slope in terms of international involvement in this fighting  area, and our main effort now will be directed at making sure  that this tragic experience of Gorazde is not going to be  repeated," Churkin told reporters here after holding a two-hour  meeting with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.    He said Milosevic had asked him to try "to help find a way  out of this situation" which has been rendered more difficult by  the Bosnian Serb decision to break all contact with the UN  Protection Force (UNPROFOR).    Churkin said he believed Russia could play an important role  in relaunching the peace process which would be aimed at finding  a "firm and lasting cessation of hostilities."    He said Russia was not pleased at the "level of  communication  in this very tense moment," apparently referring to the UN  decision to launch the air strikes without consulting with  Russia first.    "I believe that if Russia was involved in a much closer way  in this conflict area, maybe some of the developments may have  been prevented," he said.    Churkin was to travel to the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale  later Monday to meet with military leader Radovan Karadzic. The  latter earlier cancelled a meeting with U.S. special envoy to  ex-Yugoslavia Charles Redman.</p>

The Thai parliamentary delegation visited the Lao  People's Democratic Republic, the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,  and the Republic of Cambodia from 1 to 7 February. The visit  was termed highly successful. The Indochinese countries agreed  with Thailand's proposal to set up parliamentary friendship  associations which will highly benefit the Indochinese countries  in terms of legislative and parliamentary development. The  establishment of friendship associations between Thailand, Laos,  Vietnam, and Cambodia should be accomplished in the near future  to forge closer relations among those countries.    The Thai parliamentary delegation was accorded great honor  and warm welcomes throughout the visit. It received requests to  provide knowledge of modern laws and to introduce interesting  laws of Thailand for the others to study. Thailand also  discussed with Vietnam the fate of a group of Thai fishermen  arrested there. Vietnam pledged to take proper steps in order to  achieve their release prior to the visit to Vietnam in March by  the Thai prime minister.    Asked by newsmen about Thai investment in Cambodia, Marut  Bunnak said Thai businessmen encountered some small problems  which should be settled through clarification of the contracts.  He noted that it was only the beginning and Thai investors,  therefore, should be careful about what they are doing. Anyway,  he said those problems would have no impact on overall  investment by Thai businessmen.</p>

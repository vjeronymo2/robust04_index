			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BIGGIO GAVE HIM $200, OFFICER SAYS  </P> <P> A police officer testified that Houston Astros catcher Craig Biggio handed over  his driver's license along with two $100 bills shortly before being arrested  for drunk driving.  </P> <P> The testimony came in the trial of Biggio, 23, who pleaded not guilty to a  misdemeanor charge of driving while intoxicated. Biggio, who made a public  apology after his arrest, waived the right to a jury trial, and the case  continued today before Harris County Court-at-Law Judge Jim Barkley.  </P> <P> Officer Joel Garza testified Tuesday that he assumed that the cash was offered  as a bribe.  </P> <P> Garza said he chose not to arrest Biggio for trying to bribe a police officer  because he was "concentrating more on the DWI" and Biggio never "stated  anything at all" regarding the cash being a payoff.  </P></p>

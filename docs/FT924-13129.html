			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: More losses in paper and pulp THE WEAKNESS of the US paper and pulp market was underscored yesterday when two companies - Georgia-Pacific and Bowater Inc - both reported continuing losses in the third quarter. Georgia-Pacific reported a net loss of Dollars 37m, or 43 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 31m, or 36 cents a share, in the same period of last year. The 1991 figures included a Dollars 12m after-tax loss from asset sales. Net sales increased from Dollars 2.97bn last year to Dollars 3.06bn. The company's building products business produced record profits of Dollars 201m, up from Dollars 129m, while pulp and paper dipped from Dollars 67m to Dollars 23m. Mr T. Marshall Hahn, chairman, said pulp and paper profits were negatively affected by weak market conditions and downtime taken to reduce inventory and reform maintenance. Market pulp prices improved in the third quarter and despite relatively high industry inventory, its containerboard and packaging business remained good. Bowater, the newsprint manufacturer, reported a third-quarter net loss of Dollars 17.9m, or 51 cents, on sales of Dollars 366.2m. This compared with income of Dollars 7.1m, or 17 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 312m in the same period of last year. The 1992 results are not directly comparable because of an acquisition. Mr AP Gammie, chairman, said he believed the company was 'past the worst'. Newsprint prices had firmed, and while the company was still some way from profitability in this area, it was heading in the right direction.</p>

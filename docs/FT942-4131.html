			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Markham Main pit to reopen Markham Main colliery in South Yorkshire, which was closed by British Coal in 1992, will be producing coal again by the winter. Coal Investments, a company headed by former British Coal commercial director Mr Malcolm Edwards, has taken over the pit near Doncaster on a 15-year lease and expects to start recruiting in August. About 150 miners will be employed initially and a further 100 jobs may follow. Coal Investments has already been granted licences to run four pits in Stoke, Coventry and south Wales.</p>

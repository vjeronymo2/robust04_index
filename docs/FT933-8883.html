			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Japanese PM urges currency markets calm MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, yesterday called for international intervention to calm currency markets after the yen closed at a Tokyo record of Y103.37 to the dollar, up from Y103.77 a day earlier. The yen's recent surge has prompted concern in the new coalition government that an already weakened Japanese economy will suffer further damage because of the sudden fluctuations. Mr Hosokawa's call follows suggestions in recent months by Finance Ministry officials that the US should intervene to halt the yen's rise, particularly as comments by US government officials had sparked an earlier bout of appreciation. However, US officials have indicated that, while not in favour of sudden movements, they believe yen appreciation will assist in cutting Japan's widening trade surplus. Mr Hosokawa did not indicate how he expected the international intervention to be organised. Over the past few years, the Japanese central bank and US Federal Reserve have intervened on a piece-meal basis to smooth exchange movements, with mixed success. Mr Hosokawa emphasised that the value of the yen, which strengthened further in London, did not reflect the true state of the Japanese economy and appeared to be the result of speculation. Since the end of last year, the yen has appreciated by 17 per cent, and Mr Hosokawa, who took office on Monday, has faced calls for action from Japanese business leaders, who had expected that the yen would weaken this month. The strengthening, which has come in spite of daily intervention this week by the Bank of Japan, is putting extreme pressure on export-oriented manufacturers. While the negative effects of the yen's movement have been quickly felt by Japanese companies, a consumer survey by the Economic Planning Agency has found that only 43.9 per cent of respondents say the currency's appreciation has led to lower prices for imports.

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Argentine inquiry scorned MR Raul Granillo Ocampo, former Argentine cabinet secretary, has rejected as irrelevant a government investigation into a case of alleged corruption involving Swift-Armour SA, an American-owned meatpacking company. In January, the case made corruption a political issue after a newspaper published a confidential letter from the American embassy complaining that an official had demanded bribes from Swift-Armour. The scandal touched off a cabinet crisis in which four ministers were dismissed. A federal judge investigated the case but last week shelved it for lack of evidence. Mr Ocampo, who resigned after being accused of leaking the letter, said on Wednesday that the investigations 'were nothing more than an official formality to confirm a conclusion written and determined before its initiation.' He said his enemies used the investigation to further their own political agenda, rather than investigating the claim.</p>

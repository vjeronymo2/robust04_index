			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR'S OPINION OF CIVIC CENTER REPORT  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times Westside section on Sept. 13, 1990, reported on the  Beverly Hills city manager's report on the cost of the new Beverly Hills Civic  Center. The article was accurate as to the cost of the project escalating  substantially over the eight-year period of its development and construction.  What was missing in the article was the context of the Civic Center Report and  the expression of opinions by the council members regarding the project.  </P> <P> In my installation speech as mayor on April 17 of this year, I set as a top  priority the preparation by the city manager, Mark Scott, and by our chief  financial officer, Don Oblander, of a historical chronology of the Civic Center  project, with specific emphasis on the escalating costs. The entire City  Council concurred in my requesting the staff report. The purpose of the report  was to inform the Beverly Hills community and all others who were interested as  to how we ended up with a Civic Center costing many times more than was  originally anticipated. The report that was presented Tuesday evening was the  culmination of the historical review as requested by the City Council.  </P> <P> I expressed at my installation and I expressed again at the meeting on Tuesday  evening that it is my personal opinion that the Civic Center, notwithstanding  the beauty of its design and the importance of the facility as a gathering  place for the community, especially the library and the Boat Court amphitheater  area, is excessive in design, excessive in size and without doubt excessive in  cost. Each of the council members has his or her own view of the project, as  was expressed at the meeting, but I think it is fair to say that all of us  agree that it is excessive in cost.  </P> <P> Notwithstanding the excessive cost of the Beverly Hills Civic Center, the  recent careful scrutiny of the Beverly Hills budget and forecasts for the next  five years demonstrate that the city can afford the new Civic Center without  cutting back any necessary services or capital improvements that are currently  proposed. However, if the Civic Center had cost in the $60-million to  $70-million range rather than the $120-million range, those excess funds could  have been used in so many more beneficial ways for the Beverly Hills community  or could have added a major additional cushion to the city's reserves.  </P> <P> ALLAN ALEXANDER  </P> <P> Mayor, Beverly Hills  </P></p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Procedure for challenging government in court The House of Lords rulings over the procedure for challenging the government in the UK courts could prove a greater blow to ministers than those on the specific issue of part-time workers, some senior lawyers believe, writes John Mason. The rulings are likely to leave the government having to defend itself against an increased number of legal actions brought by pressure groups and others. First, groups challenging issues of European law will now be able to bring them through the judicial review procedure in the High Court. This would prove both easier and quicker than having cases heard by the European Court in Luxembourg. Second, the legal position of pressure groups seeking to bring any kind of actions before the UK courts has also been strengthened. The result of both rulings could be the government having to defend its policies more often and in the greater public spotlight offered by London rather than Luxembourg. The law lords overturned a Court of Appeal ruling that judicial review proceedings in the High Court were not an appropriate forum for hearing cases on European issues. In approving the use of High Court judicial reviews, they have given pressure groups and others the opportunity to bypass the long process of taking cases to the European Court. Cases that are taken to the European Court may take four to six years to resolve. If a judicial review application is expedited and approved, the case can be before the High Court in a matter of days - as demonstrated by the reviews over Maastricht and the challenge to the government's pit closure programme. The High Court could, however, still decide to refer the case to Europe rather than proceed with a judicial review. The law lords also strengthened the position of pressure groups by ruling that the Equal Opportunities Commission had 'locus standi' in this case - in effect it was suitably qualified to act on behalf of part-time workers. This principle has often been disputed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F> staff, and Major General Uri Sagi, chief of the Intelligence  Branch, with domestic correspondents at the Defense Ministry in  Tel Aviv -- live]    [Text] [Baraq] Last night, after 0200 [2300 GMT], an IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] unit executed an operation in Qasr Naba  in al-Biqa', not far from Zahlah. As you can see on the map,  here is Beirut, here is Damascus, here is the Damascus-Beirut  highway and Zahlah, (Rayyaq), and Qasr Naba to the north of it.  This mountain range is called Mount Lebanon. Its altitude is  the same as Mount Hermon, and it has steep cliffs at the bottom  of which lie a number of villages. The force brought Mustafa  al-Dirani, the leader of the Believers Resistance, on whose  deeds Chief of Intelligence Uri Sagi will later elaborate, back  from there.    The operation was conducted on very rough and steep terrain.  The village is located at the bottom of a cliff, and the area  is difficult for vehicles of any kind to traverse and for  aircraft to land. The unit achieved absolute surprise, and  within a few minutes, the operation in the building itself was  over. A considerable number of weapons were found in the  building, including a loaded gun at Mustafa al-Dirani's bedside,  which he had no time to use, just as others had no such  opportunity as a result of the element of surprise. Numerous  documents of all kinds -- not just written ones -- were found.  The unit, which was instructed to avoid hurting any other  members of the family or other civilians in the village to the  extent possible, even if they opened fire, succeeded in  fulfilling this mission.    During the operation and while the unit was making its  retreat, fire was opened from the adjacent apartment, inhabited  by al-Dirani's brother. The fact that the village was awakened  by the operation called for certain changes in the unit's exit  from the village. They made their exit while shooting for the  most part without taking aim. One of the officers was slightly  injured in the thigh, apparently by a bullet or shrapnel.  During the evacuation flight, a few rounds of antiaircraft fire  may have been directed at the helicopters or at the roar of the  helicopters near the Lebanese coast, north of Beirut.    The objectives of the operation were fully attained.  Al-Dirani is in our hands, and we believe his interrogation  will contribute to shedding light on the situation with regard  to Ron Arad's whereabouts and perhaps to understanding what must  be done to deal with Ron Arad's case in the future. No human  lives were lost. The operation and its outcome contribute to  some extent to the IDF's deterrent power and are an expression  of our moral debt to Ron and to the principle of the IDF's modus  operandi, whereby everything that can be done to bring back  every POW and ascertain the fate of every MIA will be done, even  at the expense of risky operations.    The operation was planned for many weeks, in fact months,  and  it relied on operational and intelligence abilities -- not just  in the field -- which we have accumulated over the years. It  was executed with the highest level of professional acumen and  precision and while adapting to what materialized in the field.  In such operations, a thin thread separates success from  failure and its cost. I am glad that it ended the way it did.    I can only express my appreciation to the executing unit, a  very select IDF unit; to the Air Force squadrons, particularly  the Saar gunship helicopter squadrons, the cargo and other  aircraft; to the intelligence community: to the Intelligence  Branch and to its chief, Uri Sagi, whose unique contribution to  this operation and its outcome goes beyond the formal duties of  a chief of intelligence; and, of course, to the decisionmakers:  to the inner cabinet, which decided on the operation based on  our recommendation, and first and foremost to the prime minister  and defense minister, who supported the planning of the  operation and backed it all the way through.    I will now leave the floor to Uri. Later, if you want to  pose some questions, we will be willing to answer a few of them.    [Sagi] Mustafa al-Dirani is the head of the Believers  Resistance, a splinter group of the Amal organization. He  headed Amal's terrorist apparatus until 1988 and, as part of his  duties, was responsible for a large number of attacks on IDF  soldiers, from the time of the Peace for Galilee Operation and  until he retired from Amal in 1988. He is the founder of the  Believers Resistance, an independent faction which has now  merged with Hizballah. While it was an independent body,  however, it carried out numerous attacks against IDF and SLA  [South Lebanese Army] soldiers in south Lebanon. His  involvement in holding Ron Arad hostage has long been known, at  least to the intelligence community. We possess reliable  information -- which applied prior to the operation and has been  largely confirmed with al-Dirani's transfer to Israel -- to the  effect that Ron Arad was taken prisoner and held by Mustafa  al-Dirani for a period of over two years and that he even  conducted negotiations about him which may give us a lead as to  the future and perhaps even the fate of Ron Arad.    Undoubtedly, the investigation is at its height. Both the  investigation and the findings brought back by the unit will  apparently provide us with some answers -- I hope soon -- to  questions we could not answer prior to the operation. As said,  the operation did not lead to any exceptional reactions that  were not foreseen or predicted. Like the chief of staff, I can  also tell you that no civilians or other people who were not  meant to be hurt or be brought to Israeli territory were hurt.  The repercussions of the operation will yet be examined, but  there is no doubt that the fact that Mustafa al-Dirani is here  may shed a great deal of light on the main question: Will we  have more detailed intelligence about Ron Arad's fate?    [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1's Alon Ben-David] Mr.  Chief of Staff, the prime minister said a few minutes ago that  al-Dirani's abduction was not meant to provide us with a  bargaining chip for Ron Arad's release. Before we set out on  this operation, did we have any information to the effect that  this abduction will bring Ron Arad's return to Israel somewhat  closer?    [Baraq] In my opinion, the main thing to be obtained is a  better understanding on our part -- as a result of what will  emerge from the investigation and of a thorough analysis of the  papers and other documents we seized there -- as to what exactly  happened to Ron Arad. It is the confirmed end of a thread  leading to somebody who held him in his hands and apparently  handed him over to the Iranians. Information and a better  understanding may surface later as to how to act in the future  in order to secure Ron Arad's return to Israel.    [Jerusalem New Channel 2 Television's Roni Daniyel] Mr.  Chief of Staff, could you be more specific about the method of  operation in the village last night?    [Baraq] I think it would not be right to detail the methods  of operation on television. I cannot swear to you that this  will be the last time we will have to use these operational  tools, which are very important and sensitive and contribute a  great deal to the IDF's abilities. I cannot tell you that this  is the last time we will use them. Therefore, the better we  manage to conceal and cloud the details of the operation, the  better it will be.    [Daniyel] Mr. Chief of Intelligence, could you elaborate  on what we learned about Ron Arad that we did not know before?  Lebanese reports say that cassettes and documents were seized  from his home.    [Sagi] I would consider it rash and perhaps even wrong to  elaborate at this point on the additional findings, coming as  they do on the heels of quite a considerable amount of  information we had before we carried out the operation. I  believe it would be correct to say that in addition to our  assessment prior to the operation, we are certain about the  responsibility for Ron Arad's fate during his captivity with  Amal and later on when he was under the charge of Mustafa  al-Dirani and the Believers Resistance. We apparently have and  we will yet attain additional information about the ensuing  period. In other words, in my opinion, in 1989 Ron Arad was  handed over to other organizations. I believe it would not be  right to elaborate on this point because of the intelligence  sensitivity of the matter and the need to investigate further  and confirm the findings in our possession. As noted, the  nature of the operation shows that the information obtained  through al-Dirani's capture and from other findings can really  and considerably improve our knowledge.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el's Army affairs correspondent Karmela  Menashe] Mustafa al-Dirani held Ron Arad as far back as six  years ago. Did the operation not come too late?    [Sagi] I, of course, do not define the timing of operations.  On this issue, I am subject to the chief of staff's decision  and, to the best of my knowledge, he is subject to the decision  of the defense minister and the government. Whenever the  operational opportunity and intelligence need arise, I think  there is a proper way to make our recommendation to the  authoritative levels. If and when conditions enable it, the  needs justify it, and the operation is approved, then it is  carried out. I must say -- fortunately, these are secret  matters -- this is not the first such operation and, I believe,  neither will it be the last.    [Baraq] I would like to add that this operation had been  prepared once before and was quite close to execution, but as a  result of considerations related to the covert efforts for the  release of Ron Arad, we decided not to execute it and to put it  off for several months. Now the time looked right for its  execution, and the operation was carried out.    [Unidentified Tel Aviv IDF Radio correspondent] Mr. Chief of  Staff, did you take into consideration the possibility of a  confrontation with the Syrians in the course of the operation?    [Baraq] The area in which the operation was carried out is  controlled by the Syrian Army. Syrian troops are deployed in  this area, which lies within the range of Syrian antiaircraft  and ground missiles. Nevertheless, we built the operation in  such a way as to reduce these risks to a minimum. I am glad  that no such confrontation occurred and believe there is no  reason for this issue -- fighting for information and for ways  to secure the release of an Israeli POW -- to lead to any  substantial friction with the Syrians.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UN challenges power of the gunmen THE United Nations plans to ignore the objections of local Moslem military leaders by attempting to evacuate another 15,000 refugees from the besieged eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica. Mr Jose Maria Mendiluce, the special envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said yesterday that the situation in Srebrenica had turned into a test case for the UN that would indicate whether its priority was to save lives. Local Moslem leaders on Sunday prevented a UNHCR convoy, which had brought in relief supplies to Srebrenica from allowing refugees to board trucks to take them to the relative safety of Tuzla. However, Mr Mendiluce said the situation in Srebrenica, which is in range of Serb artillery, was desperate. The ceasefire had been broken in many areas yesterday and the Moslem front lines were being slowly but surely squeezed by the Serb forces. Mr Mendiluce said there were a total of 60,000 people in the Srebrenica region, of which 25,000 to 30,000 were in or near the town, besieged by the Serbs for the past year. The present population could not be settled in Srebrenica in any case, and the UNHCR's objective was to evacuate a further 10,000 to 15,000 people, to add to the 5,000 it had taken out last month. UN officials denied, however, that by evacuating more people from Srebrenica, they were in effect contributing to the Serb policy of so-called 'ethnic cleansing', the expulsion of Moslems from towns and enclaves which the Serbs claim as part of their own territory. A UNHCR spokesman said the UN was not evacuating residents of Srebrenica, a town whose population has been inflated by the influx of tens of thousands of refugees, but only those who had fled there after other Moslem areas had been captured by the Serb militia. Though the Bosnian president, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, said on Sunday that he would allow the evacuation and order local Bosnian army commanders to let the returning relief convoys load up with refugees, the UNHCR said yesterday it was not sending in a convoy before it was clear that the president's orders would be carried out. Meanwhile, the military commanders of the Moslem, Serb and Croat warring parties in Bosnia, are due to meet under UN auspices in Sarajevo today, to try to consolidate a fragile eight-day ceasefire in the conflict. An estimated 150,000 Bosnians have been killed or have been reported missing, while hundreds of thousands of others have been driven out of their homes and taken refuge in other parts of the former Yugoslavia or abroad, since the civil war started one year ago today. General Philippe Morillon, the UN commander in Bosnia, said yesterday the Bosnian Moslems had only agreed to attend if the Serbs halted their attacks on Srebrenica. Months of preparation have gone into the agenda of the military commanders' meeting, which includes discussions on the demilitarisation of Sarajevo and protected corridors for the free movement of civilians. A mixed military working group of staff officers from the rival factions has reached agreement in principle on many essential points in a series of meetings since last November. Implementation of these agreements could be the first step towards the realisation of the peace plan drawn up by the international mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / President under fire on Iraq CONGRESSIONAL criticism of President George Bush's handling of the Iraqi civil war increased yesterday as House committees approved more than Dollars 550m (Pounds 325m) for US relief operations for Kurdish refugees. The funds approved by House appropriations committees (Dollars 321m for military costs and Dollars 235m for refugee and disaster assistance) are for use only until the end of this month, thus putting pressure on the Bush administration to carry out its planned withdrawal from Iraq. The initial US attitude of non-involvement has been criticised by a staff report for the Senate foreign relations committee. Mr Peter Galbraith, a senior adviser to Mr Claiborne Pell, Democratic chairman of the committee, argues that the US may have lost an opportunity to overthrow Saddam Hussein in mid-March, in large part because it had no contacts with the Iraqi opposition. Mr Galbraith says that as the anti-Saddam rebellion gained force in mid-March, 'several strategically located Iraqi military figures were in contact with the joint action committee of the combined Iraqi opposition. 'According to opposition sources, these leaders looked for a signal that the US supported the rebellion. Not only was no signal given, but the public snub of the Iraqi opposition combined with background statements that the administration sought a military, not a popular, alternative to Saddam Hussein, served to deter defections to the rebellion, helping to doom the anti-Saddam cause'. The White House said yesterday anybody who wanted to change sides was welcome to do so.</p>

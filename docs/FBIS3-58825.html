Hinrichs; place and date not given: "Hungarian  Industry Minister Wants No Devaluation, but Greater Efficiency:  `The West Pays Too Little Attention To Us'"]    [Text] The attention paid to Hungary has somewhat decreased  in recent years. While Communism reigned, Hungary was the  conspicuous, stubborn little reformer. Now it is the only  country where the economic reforms can be continued normally,  without resulting in any major shocks. Whereas the reforms  carried out elsewhere have caused necessarily large and  spectacular shocks, Hungary had already made extensive  preparations "on the way to the market."    Hungary is also the only former Socialist country where an  active industrial policy does not mean that the previous  planners are trying to retain their grip on businesses. Hungary  is conducting an industrial policy in the Western sense. On  Tuesday [18 January] and Wednesday, the Hungarian minister of  industry and trade, Mr. Janos Latorcai, visited the Netherlands,  where he met with Ministers Andriessen and Alders, and with  Secretary of State Van Rooy, was a guest at Akzo, and had a  meeting with various Netherlands bankers.    Latorcai said that Hungary's industrial policy comprises  five  main subcomponents. "Privatization is of major importance. A  large number of companies still has to be transferred to the  private sector. Then there is a considerable number of  companies which are too big, and which we are splitting up into  smaller units. We are encouraging companies to improve their  technology and to develop new products. Then, we want to  attract technological know-how and money from the West. And we  are trying to encourage people to change their attitude."    The companies which have invested in exports to Eastern  markets in recent years have all run into financial problems.  As Latorcai put it: "We have a strategy aimed at reducing  corporate debt in a manner that is compatible with the market.  One of the instruments for doing so is to turn debt into  shares. Sometimes one part of the debt can be eliminated.  Since 1991, the policy has been that companies have to find a  solution to their problems, otherwise they will go bankrupt." As  a result, dozens of companies have gone bankrupt, unlike in  other East European countries.    It is striking that unemployment is nonetheless clearly on  the decline. In February last year, unemployment peaked at a  level of 700,000; in December there were still 620,000  unemployed. Thus, the level of unemployment decreased from 13.6  to 12.1 percent, a drop that is unique in East Europe.    According to Latorcai there is talk within industry of  further, considerable increases in productivity: "With a  4-percent growth in industrial production during 1993 we still  lost 100,000 jobs. Last year, production in industry increased  by 10 percent. The services sector -- and tourism in particular  -- made up for this to some extent."    Hungary is implementing a strict monetary policy to keep  down  the rate of inflation, which was rated at 22.5 percent in  December. One of the elements of that policy is that  devaluations of the forint have been strictly limited. Although  he is very happy with this in his capacity as industry minister,  are Hungarian companies not complaining loud and clear about  their position regarding exports?    Latorcai responded: "Monetary policy must be seen as one  part of a whole. It may well be that industry is complaining,  but if further devaluations are made to stimulate exports, then  that will only help in the short term. In the long term we are  concerned with costs, productivity, and the development of new  products. Devaluations freeze the technical inferiority of  companies and only set companies even further behind."    Hungary, which borders Yugoslavia, Romania, Ukraine,  Slovakia, and Austria, is an island of stability in a sea of war  and political unrest. As Latorcai puts it: "That is the sad  truth, and it means that we have poor sales markets in our  immediate vicinity. The war on our southern border and the  embargo on Yugoslavia is costing us pots of money."    And then he switched over to the favorite subject of every  member of the Hungarian Government. He hastens to reiterate  that none of this is preventing foreign capital from flowing  into Hungary in abundance. In 1993, foreign investments  totalled $2.2 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in the  previous two years. Over five years, a total of $7 billion has  been invested in Hungary. "That," maintained Latorcai,  "certainly means something. More than half of what has been  invested in East Europe has gone to Hungary."    After the disintegration of the Habsburg empire, Hungary  shrank considerably in geographical terms, leaving large  Hungarian minorities in its neighboring countries. These total  five million, and their plight has been a continual source of  tension since the fall of Communism. Several of Hungary's  neighbors are now maintaining that Budapest wants to change its  borders.    The minister left no doubt as to the fact that the  government  in Budapest is not advocating border changes. "However, we do  feel responsible for the Hungarians in our neighboring  countries, and we are demanding that their rights be respected,  that there be no discrimination, and that they are given the  chance to speak their own language, and be educated in  Hungarian."    Latorcai says that his government is maintaining normal  contact with the government of nationalist [President] Meciar in  Slovakia: "We are always ready to take the first step in our  contacts with Slovakia," he claimed. In May there are general  elections, and there would seem to be a good chance of the  present tripartite coalition losing its majority. Is it  conceivable that the ultranationalist Istvan Csurka, who wants  the question of Hungary's borders to be discussed, will be  included in the coalition? Latorcai claimed not: "The coalition  wants to exclude extremists."    However, he was not enthusiastic regarding the attitude  adopted by the West in the recent debate on the extension of  NATO, saying -- diplomatically -- that Budapest regards the  Partnership for Peace as merely a first step along the road to  full membership. However, he had to concede that absolutely no  guarantee had been given. "West Europe places too much emphasis  on regions that are much further afield," he said. "It is a  mistake to overlook us. If something goes wrong in East Europe,  then West Europe will not escape the consequences. There is now  a possibility to do away with the distinction between East and  West Europe. We must seize this opportunity."</p>

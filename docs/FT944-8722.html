			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Sony The 7 per cent fall in Sony's share price in London yesterday is slightly odd. The Japanese electronics group's problems with its Hollywood movie studio have hardly been a secret. The massive Y265bn write-off is actually good news. By cleaning the decks, Sony is signalling its determination to get a grip on the former Columbia Pictures. The studio's new management should be able to put an end to the extravagance that led to such spectacular flops as Last Action Hero. Columbia still enjoys a strong distribution network and picture library. Its share of US box office takings has collapsed below 10 per cent but it is hard to see it falling much further. There is no denying, though, the disastrous investment Columbia has been for Sony. The hoped-for synergies between consumer electronics hardware and software have failed to materialise. The Japanese group has also been the wrong parent for such a 'talent' business. It rightly recognised it knew little about the business, but then gave the studio's top management such a free rein that they lost masses of money. Now it risks keeping such tight control that it drives the talent away. This is not a feature of Sony's Japanese nationality: look at General Electric, the US conglomerate, and its unhappy experience with broker Kidder Peabody.</p>

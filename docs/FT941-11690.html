			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Move on account loopholes Accountants in business will be obliged under guidelines issued yesterday to discourage fellow directors and officers from using 'creative accounting' loopholes. The onus will be on all members of any of the six leading professional accountancy bodies in the UK to pass on the pronouncements from the urgent-issues taskforce of the Accounting Standards Board. The details are included as part of the foreword to urgent-issues taskforce abstracts, issued by the board yesterday. The taskforce is designed to prevent what Mr David Tweedie, board chairman, calls 'the creeping crumple' - the process by which auditors were in the past coerced into allowing clients to exploit creative accounting loopholes because other firms of auditors had already approved the accounting technique in another company. The taskforce was set up as part of the new machinery for financial reporting created under the 1989 Companies Act. The foreword states that the Accounting Standards Board has the right to reject any statement issued by the taskforce if it contradicts legislation or the direction of financial reporting being taken by the board.

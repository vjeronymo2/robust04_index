			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT;  </P> <P> HAPPY MEALS INSTEAD OF HAPPY STARS SELECTED TO SPICE UP THE FARE  </P> <P> Airplane food may be a self-canceling phrase, but it's not as if things in the  terminal are a whole lot better.  </P> <P> How many of us have muttered softly to ourselves about the food in airport  cafeterias, picking listlessly at a dried-out piece of chicken while chewing on  a cherry tomato that couldn't be speared with a fork.  </P> <P> Now, somebody is trying to change all that. The nerve.  </P> <P> Like all the great airport foods of the world -- the barbecued beef of Memphis,  the chili crab at Don Muang Airport in Bangkok and the beluga caviar of Maxim's  at Charles de Gaulle in Paris -- a regional emphasis is the foundation of  success.  </P> <P> Host International Food and Beverage Services, the same people who have already  brought you that success fou, the Japanese noodle bar at L.A. International  Airport (and a good deal of that dried-out chicken), is in a regional mood  again. The new Thomas F. Riley Terminal will be their latest experiment.  </P> <P> There, at Orange Grill, a 177-seat restaurant that will be the centerpiece of  the terminal's atrium, they plan to offer California/Mexican cuisine in a  casual atmosphere. According to Bruce Fish, Host International's general  manager at John Wayne, the menu at the restaurant will feature, among other  things, quesadillas, soft tacos, tostadas, grilled sandwiches and oversize  salads. The prices will be moderate, with almost everything ranging from $5 to  $8.  </P> <P> The atrium itself will contain a Food Court, in case Cal-Mex cooking is not  your style. There, you will find TCBY (the audacious acronym for "the country's  best yogurt"), Pizza Hut and something they call the "personal pan pizza" (in a  cardboard box that bore a striking resemblance in texture to what was inside  the last time I tasted it), Fresh Bakery, a Host International operation  serving cold sandwiches, chocolate chip cookies and the like, and an outfit  called Creative Croissants, which will hopefully do its part to stop those  uncalled for comparisons about airport croissants and the padding in Italian  shoes.  </P> <P> More conventional travelers and kids, no doubt, will be happy to know that two  McDonald's restaurants will be opened in the gate areas. Apparently, Orange  County-based Carl's Jr. was in contention for the spots, but McDonald's got the  franchises. Essentially, that means happy meals instead of happy stars. I'm not  sure what else.  </P> <P> All of this sounds shopping mall-ish to me, but then, that's life here in  Orange County.  </P></p>

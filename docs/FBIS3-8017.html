			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic in New </F> York on 2 March after meeting UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali; in English with superimposed Serbo-Croatian  translation -- recorded]    [Text] This is the first step. We will get on with our  work. We will continue negotiations on a final agreement in  Vienna and try to finish our work by 15 March. We have signed a  preliminary agreement on the Croat-Muslim federation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the confederation between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. It will be a very strong union.  An agreement on the economy, currency, customs, and other  issues has been concluded.    As for the UN Protected Areas [UNPA's] in Croatia, we are  expecting a very active mandate on the part of the UN Protection  Force in the forthcoming period, especially with regard to the  Croatian borders, disarmament, the establishment of  communications, and the peaceful reintegration of UNPAs in  Croatia's legal system. We are ready for talks with local Serbs  about local autonomy and we are ready for international  supervision, by the United Nations, the Council of Europe, and  European Union observers, over human rights, especially the  rights of the minorities in Croatia.    As for the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we largely  support NATO's actions so far and we will continue with the  talks. Croats and Muslims will continue negotiations with the  Serbs in order that the Serbs can either join the federation or  that some other agreement can be reached with them.</p>

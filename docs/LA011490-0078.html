			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUN CONTROL LEGISLATION  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp's warning to street gangs and drug traffickers that  he intends to enforce "to the hilt" the new Assault Weapons Control Act is an  empty threat (Part A, Jan. 4).  </P> <P> If he can't enforce the laws against murder, assault and drug dealing which  these criminals are breaking openly in the streets, then how does he plan to  enforce a law against unregistered firearms hidden in closets and car trunks?  </P> <P> The threat is very real for the 300,000 honest citizens who legally own the  banned firearms for legitimate, traditional and constitutionally protected  reasons. Those who choose not to register because they feel that the law is  unjust face criminal arrest, but only after violation of their right against  search and seizure. In no other way is enforcement possible. Those who comply  with the law will have their name, address and description of firearm given to  local police for some unstated reason.  </P> <P> What, exactly, does "to the hilt" mean?  </P> <P> JERRY L. ALLEN  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

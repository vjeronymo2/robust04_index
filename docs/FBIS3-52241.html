In an exclusive statement to MENA today, Kamal said that  President Husni Mubarak had exerted special efforts to maintain  consultations and coordination among all the Arab parties  concerned with peace in the Middle East. He stressed that the  PLO and President Yasir 'Arafat are interested in cooperating  and consulting with Syria. He pointed out that despite the  Palestinian side's preoccupation with the negotiations with  Israel during the past two months, contacts between Damascus and  the PLO continued through diplomatic channels.    Kamal expressed his belief that nothing prevents a meeting  between 'Arafat and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad before the  Geneva summit between al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton on  17 January.</p>

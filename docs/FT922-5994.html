			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Poor trade figures upset share prices A PROMISING start by London's equity market to the last period of the three-week trading account was halted in its tracks by a disappointing set of UK trade figures for April and a steep opening decline by Wall Street. The trade figures were greeted with widespread dismay by marketmakers, who quickly gave the leaders the red pencil treatment, chopping prices across the board and prompting a hefty reversal in the FT-SE 100-share Index. Up more than 12 points within two hours of the opening, the index moved into negative ground soon after the economic data emerged, and remained under pressure for the rest of a quiet session to close a net 10.4 off at the day's low of 2,704.6. Ironically, it was the oil and gas sector, among the market's poorest performing areas for around 18 months, that helped prevent an even steeper fall by the Footsie. Last week's Opec agreement on output resulted in crude oil prices edging back over the Dollars 20 a barrel mark yesterday and produced keen support for the sector. The day began on a subdued note, with the Footsie opening around seven points higher, mainly due to the strength of the oil sector and a number of individual stocks such as Cable and Wireless, Welcome and SmithKline Beecham. But with little genuine retail buying interest evident and the trade figures coming in much worse than had been expected, the market turned off sharply as a flurry of profit-taking and institutional selling appeared. Dealers pointed out, however, that the market's attendance was well down on normal levels, as many operators took advantage of the good bank holiday weather with extended breaks. One estimated that perhaps as many as a quarter of the usual number of fund managers had stayed away. 'The marketmakers wanted the market down, got their excuse with the trade figures and Wall Street and they got their way,' said one senior salesman. The Footsie's poor performance was accompanied by equally poor turnover figures for equities. Volume yesterday fell to 404.3m shares, the lowest since the general election. Figures published by the Stock Exchange revealed that the value of customer business last Friday totalled Pounds 937.8m. On four out of the five trading sessions last week retail business fell below the Pounds 1bn level. With the volume of business showing distinct signs of shrinking and summer looming, many market traders are beginning to question the likelihood of a flurry of takeover activity and spate of rights issues widely forecast after the Conservative election victory. The oil sector provided the best individual Footsie performance in Lasmo, which rose more than 4 per cent, closely followed by BP, British Gas and Shell. The rises followed what Mr Steve Turner, energy specialist at Smith New Court, described as 'the most unambiguously bullish Opec meeting since July 1990, when Opec announced its intention to move to a Dollars 21 a barrel market price'. TSB took the dubious honour of being the worst Footsie performer, dropping 4.3 per cent.</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / FT Guide For The Serious Investor (12): Look ahead on interest rates - Tax-efficient investments 4, National Savings / Certificates are the most suitable product for higher-rate taxpayers, says Scheherazade Daneshkhu. But investors need to plan over a five-year period NATIONAL SAVINGS products have at least two things in their favour. One is the tax-free return that some of them offer; the other is security - the government is the safest institution you could invest in. If you are a higher-rate taxpayer, the most suitable investments are the certificates. These are free of both income and capital gains tax, but you have to hold on to them for five years to obtain the full return, and they pay no income. The rates on the certificates are fixed, so the main concern if you are thinking of buying now is where you think interest rates will be over the five-year period. The latest issues pay considerably less than last year when bank base rates were higher. For example, it was only just over a year ago, that the 37th issue certificates were offering a guaranteed return of 8 per cent a yearcompound if held for five years, compared with 5.75 per cent today. If you think base rates will rise significantly within the next five years, this may not be the best time to lock your money away for a fixed return. But if you think base rates will fall as low as 4 per cent by the end of the year, as some economists have predicted, and will continue to remain low for several years, these may be the highest rates on offer for a while. The minimum investment in either the savings or the index-linked certificates has recently been raised from Pounds 25 to Pounds 100; purchases above the minimum are in units of Pounds 25. The maximum investment in either is Pounds 10,000, although an additional Pounds 10,000 can be reinvested from matured certificates of earlier issues. If you forget to cash in the savings certificates and do not reinvest them, they will continue to attract interest but at a much lower rate. The general extension rate is currently 3.75 per cent a year. Savings certificates: The current 40th issue pays a guaranteed return of 5.75 per cent a year compound if held for five years. The return is the equivalent of 9.58 per cent to a 40 per cent taxpayer (7.67 per cent to a lower-rate taxpayer). Index-linked certificates: These pay 3.25 per cent a year above the rate of inflation, measured by the retail prices index. It is possible to hold both these and the 40th issue certificates, but if you wish to choose between the two, you have to decide where you expect the inflation rate to be within the next five years. If you think it will be above 2.5 per cent a year, then index-linked certificates are going to offer the higher returns. (Those with a gambling instinct could buy premium bonds. The prize fund is calculated at 5 per cent on all eligible bonds and the prizes are tax-free. There are over 160,000 prizes of between Pounds 50-Pounds 250,000 a month. The minimum investment has also been raised to Pounds 100, and the maximum is Pounds 20,000.) Capital bonds: The most suitable product for non-taxpayers are the Capital Bonds which also offer a guaranteed return if held for five years. They are subject to tax but non-taxpayers will have the benefit of receiving interest gross, because the return comes in the form of a capital gain at repayment. Basic-rate taxpayers will face a tax bill on their accrued 'interest' each year, although they do not actually receive the return until the five years are up. The present Series G offers a gross return of 7.75 per cent a year, compound over five years. The bonds are sold in multiples of Pounds 100, to a maximum of Pounds 250,000. Income bonds: The main NS product which delivers an income is the income bond. Once again, interest is taxable but tax is not deducted at source - making bonds suitable for non-taxpayers. National Savings has recently made income bonds more attractive by adding a differential rate which is higher for larger investors. Rates are variable. Balances under Pounds 25,000 attract an interest rate of 7 per cent a year gross, while that paid on amounts above this is 7.25 per cent gross. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000, the maximum Pounds 250,000. Children: Parents who transfer money to their children usually have to pay tax on the income. NS offers a tax-free savings route with its Children's Bonus Bond. Issue E pays a guaranteed return equal to 7.85 per cent a year when held for five years. Unfortunately, only a maximum of Pounds 1,000 can be invested in this way; the minimum is Pounds 25. Adults have to purchase the bond for children under the age of 16, and there are no more returns after the 21st birthday.</p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Business and the Environment: The truth but not the whole truth - Peter Knight assesses whether companies really benefit from showing off their environmental credentials More and more European companies are voluntarily lifting their environmental skirts to reveal information about their green performance. The revelations are in the form of publications aimed at the general public, although some firms target specific groups, such as shareholders, employees and the local communities in which they operate. Many of the companies that have published environmental reports, however, wonder if it is worth the trouble. The reviews are often ignored by the public or criticised for being bland and empty by environmentalists. The pressure to publish comes from both the public and the law. Environmental groups and local communities are increasingly interested in what pollutants are produced behind the factory gate. Industry - sometimes begrudgingly - acknowledges that the public, especially local communities, have a right to know. Limited data on pollution are now available to the UK public under the Environmental Protection Act. But this obligation is not as onerous as the US's Superfund Amendment and Reauthorisation Act, and industry realises that the quality of its voluntary responses will help determine the strength of future laws. Now companies are asking how much the publication of environmental data really benefits a business. 'There seems to be a split between Americans and Europeans on this issue,' says John Elkington of consultants SustainAbility, who has worked with companies on their reports. 'People in the US are saying that their legal requirements to publish information go far enough and there is no need to talk to a wider audience. They're advising their European counterparts to throttle back on information placed in the public domain.' Regardless of this advice a small but highly influential group of companies are continuing with their efforts to be more open about both the good and bad elements of their environmental impact. Norsk Hydro's UK company led the way two years ago with a comprehensive report, with verifying comments from Lloyd's Register. British Airways followed with a slimmer but highly factual report on its Heathrow operations, compiled from a survey conducted by environmental consultants Technica. These reports recently shared the first award on environmental reporting by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants. BP produced a safety and environmental review, called New Horizons, and was criticised for failing to publish concrete figures and clear improvement targets. British Gas's first review is equally short on figures and talks in general terms about the environmental issues facing the company, such as methane leakage, derelict land and the problems of exploring in tropical rain forests. ICI's corporate environmental report, published last month, is more frank than most. The company lists the number of prosecutions for environmental transgressions worldwide (26 in 1991 and 36 in 1990) and gives data on the amount of waste produced, the type and where it ends up. Critics of ICI have called for greater detail, such as a breakdown of the hazardous waste category into specific wastes. Some also question the validity of the figures which were not audited by outsiders. Greenpeace says ICI should publish more information about its continuing production of CFCs. But by merely producing some figures, the company has demonstrated that the data are collectible and can be presented in an accessible form. This puts paid to the industry-perpetuated myth that such statistics are too difficult to collect and impossible to present to non-specialists. 'If we are going to gain the public's trust, then we have to publish the results,' says ICI director Chris Hampson. But he emphasises that the figures are indeed difficult to collect, mainly because the process is new to the company and there are no standards. Shell UK, which is in the process of collecting environmental information to publish in the autumn, agrees with this argument. Industry also feels that data on some wastes are commercially sensitive and could be used by competitors to work out manufacturing cost and margins. The UK's power producers use this argument to fight for the confidentiality of information given by them to HMIP, the government's pollution agency. But possibly more important, companies have to overcome internal resistance. 'Our people were concerned about us doing it because when you publish these sort of figures you expect to get a lot of flak. We spent a year collecting the data and working with the people at the plants to equip them to handle the possible questions that might arise after publication,' says Hampson. Chemical companies, supported by their trade associations, are making greater efforts to talk to their employees and the communities which play host to their plants. Dow Europe, the European arm of the US-based multinational, is about to publish a review aimed specifically at employees. It is also important that the companies are seen to be improving their environmental performance, rather than only making vague promises. IBM UK, for example, has published clear targets, including dates, of when it intends to achieve certain goals. Companies emphasise that their first reports represent an initial step and that the quality of reporting will improve. 'The British Gas Review is a statement of our current position. The next edition will be more factual and more numerical,' says Mike Arnold, group director of safety and environment at British Gas. The quality of green reporting in the future depends to a large extent on the corporate willingness to communicate both good and bad news. While there indeed might be resistance from managers at the sharp end of the business to reveal too much, the first round of reporting exhibits the glossy hand of the public relations experts. This often involves big photographs of happy, pretty people. The British Gas report is a good example: full-page pictures of an old lady keeping warm, and a young girl swimming in a gas-heated pool. Rob Gray, a judge on the Chartered Association of Certified Accounts panel, does not hold out much hope for voluntary reporting. 'I have real doubts whether we will see regular, good and widespread reporting without regulation. All the evidence from accountancy research shows that until there is strong cajolery, it won't happen.' Roger Hardman, environmental analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, agrees. 'Round promises are meaningless. Companies have been making statements in their annual accounts about things like ethics and sexual equality for 20 years and nothing much has changed. I want to see hard evidence of environmental improvement. And I want these reports to be written by outsiders with a reputation for integrity.' Steve Warshal, editor of Greenpeace Business, wants more. 'There's a big information gap between our knowledge of what business does and what it says it does. The ICI report, for example, does not say anything about the fact that the company is the biggest producer of CFCs in Europe.' While industry can be legitimately concerned about some of the commercial drawbacks of being more open with the public, companies should take heart from ICI's experience. 'When we completed the task of collecting and publishing the figures I asked one of our plant managers what he would do differently,' recalls Hampson. 'He said: 'Next time I wouldn't lose so much sleep about it'.'</p>

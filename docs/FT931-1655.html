			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Rise in yen, Russia fears leave Nikkei down 1.6% A SHARP rise in the yen against the dollar and European currencies, and news of political unrest in Russia made their mark. Share prices lost ground on selling by investment trusts and profit-taking by dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 292.77 or 1.6 per cent to 18,491.62, having opened at the day's high of 18,734.72 before sliding in later trading to hit a low of 18,489.52 just before the close. Volume was 370m shares against Monday's 330m. Losers led gainers by 732 to 300, with 138 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 15.79 to 1,397.91 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose by 0.96 to 1,112.39. A fall in overseas stock markets unnerved some investors but the decline was led by the futures market, followed by arbitrage selling. Profit-taking by foreign investors was also noted. Concerns over the higher yen heightened as the dollar moved to record lows against the domestic currency. Investors feared that earnings of leading exporters would be eroded by foreign exchange losses if the yen continued to strengthen. The dollar closed at Y115.33, down Y0.69. Export-oriented companies weakened on volatility on the currency market. Hitachi lost Y22 to Y760 and Fujitsu fell Y10 to Y585. Toyota Motor declined Y10 to Y1,440. Steels were lower on profit-taking: Nippon Steel fell Y10 to Y330 and Kawasaki Steel lost Y6 to Y317. Brokers were also lower as profits were taken. Nomura Securities, which has gained 21 per cent since the beginning of the month, fell Y30 to Y1,820, while Daiwa Securities lost Y80 to Y1,000. Nippon Express, the parcel delivery company, gained Y14 to Y849. The issue has been traded by short-term dealers as a Japan Railway-linked issue, and has gained 18.7 per cent since March 1. Mitsubishi fell Y24 to Y971, having announced on Monday that it will bail out its financing and investment subsidiary, which accumulated stock investment losses of Y28bn. Other trading houses, which hold heavy unrealised losses on stock fund investments, also lost ground with Sumitomo down Y15 to Y805. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 100.43 to 19,462.39 in volume of 74m shares. Roundup Political events in Russia continued to inhibit trading in some Pacific Rim markets. HONG KONG paid little heed to the day's political developments in the simmering Sino-British dispute and shares ended higher with trading dominated by domestic speculative interest in property stocks. The Hang Seng Index closed 57.91 higher at 6,117.95 in modest turnover of HKDollars 2.2bn. Property issues were in demand after unconfirmed local press reports that the Banking Commissioner was studying ways of increasing the ceiling on mortgage lending from 70 per cent. Cheong Kong topped the active list, closing 60 cents higher at HKDollars 22.20. Henderson Land added 40 cents to HKDollars 17.10 while New World rose 50 cents to HKDollars 18.70. AUSTRALIAN investors remained worried about the situation in Russia and the market moved lower in spite of a cut in local interest rates. The All Ordinaries index dipped 4.7 to 1659.5 in weak turnover of ADollars 271.6m. Banks were, however, mostly beneficiaries of the rates cut. National Australia rose 5 cents to ADollars 8.77, ANZ put on 2 cents to ADollars 3.46 while Commonwealth was steady at ADollars 7.92. However, Westpac fell 7 cents to ADollars 3.03. Great Central Mines rose 20 cents to ADollars 11.20 after Monday's ADollars 3 surge in response to a strong overnight performance by the company's American depositary receipts. TAIWAN was discouraged by reports that parliament planned to complete the privatisation of state-run financial institutions over the next three years, since previous sell-offs had proved unsuccessful. However, selected buying in industrials provided some support and the weighted index finished 27.05 lower at 4,647.23 in fairly active turnover of TDollars 72.87bn. Electronics and food shares were the only gainers, with Acer rising 60 cents to TDollars 23.6 and Great Wall Enterprise up 40 cents to TDollars 28.4. MANILA was weakened by an overnight fall in Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co (PLDT) on Wall Street, and the composite index slipped 12.35 to 1,443.25. On the local bourse, PLDT fell 25 pesos to 870 pesos. Manila Electric, however, was in demand, ending steady at 310 pesos, after speculation that it will declare a 40-60 per cent stock dividend. SEOUL rebounded after Monday's sharp fall and the composite index added 8.20 to 666.95, boosted by a government pledge to offer cheap finance to small and medium-sized companies.</p>

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: UK gilts Yesterday's gilts auction was an inauspicious affair, with demand little better than at the last auction in August. More seriously, the sale attracted barely a modicum of overseas interest despite the normally popular 10-year maturity. Admittedly foreigners have been net sellers of gilts since sterling came out of the ERM, so there was little chance of a stampede. Some may also be reluctant to commit funds so close to the year end. The Bank of England will doubtless hope to drum up more enthusiasm if it decides to auction more of the same stock in the spring. Something will have to give, though, if overseas investors are to provide more than grudging support for the funding programme. Gilts yielding 1.3 percentage points more than German bunds were attractive enough while sterling was inside the ERM. They look far less enticing now that Mr Major's government is free to pursue growth ahead of lower inflation. Sterling's devaluation since then leaves more room for currency gains, especially if the dollar resumes its upward march against the D-Mark. On yesterday's auction evidence, however, overseas investors are not convinced that sterling has hit bottom. Little wonder gilts do not have much credibility as a safe haven from turbulence within the ERM. Thus the yield differential between gilts and French bonds widened this week as the latter rallied in expectation that any devaluation of the franc would be coupled with lower interest rates. International investors prefer to take their chances with the Bundesbank rather than place trust in Mr Major.</p>

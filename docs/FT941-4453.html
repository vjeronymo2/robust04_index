			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Aylwin pardons 3 Chileans President Patricio Aylwin, in practically his last official act, has pardoned three Chileans condemned to life imprisonment for the attempted assassination of the then military ruler General Augusto Pinochet in 1986. The three, all members of the Frente Patriotico Manuel Rodriguez, were yesterday due to leave for Belgium where they are expected to spend 20 years in exile. The controversial pardon, announced less than 24 hours before today's handover of power to fellow Christian Democrat president-elect Eduardo Frei, is a sign that civilian authority has taken deep root since the military government stepped down in 1990. Mr Aylwin was keen to deal with the issue now in order to prevent it from causing friction with the military authorities during Mr Frei's six-year term. The armed forces have made it known they would not look kindly on the release of those who attempted to kill their commander-in-chief. Civilian-military relations have been difficult, mainly over human rights trials, but the Aylwin administration has become more confident as its largely successful economic and social policies gained support. However, military influence remains. The president has no authority to remove Gen Pinochet as head of the armed forces. He is expected to stay until 1998.</p>

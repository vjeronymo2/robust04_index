			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / IG Metall may shift stance on E German pay SIGNS have emerged that IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, may be about to abandon its opposition to separate wage deals between individual east German companies and their employees. Any such move away from centralised wage bargaining would have important implications for industrial relations throughout Germany, according to economists. 'Essentially, this dispute (between union and employers in eastern Germany) is about deciding where power lies,' one economist said. 'Will wage negotiations still be centralised among the employers' associations and IG Metall's federal organisation, or will it be decentralised in eastern Germany, which, eventually, will have an impact on western Germany?' IG Metall was yesterday adamant that it will go ahead and ballot its members in eastern Germany in preparation for an all-out strike among the region's steel and engineering sectors. The strikes are aimed at putting pressure on Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, and Arbeitgeberverband, its steel counterpart, to rescind their decision to end a contract for eastern wages to be brought into line with those in the westby April 1994. But the union yesterday admitted that it had not yet decided precisely 'where or when' the ballots would take place. 'The joint working parties on pay will have to decide to ask for a ballot (in the companies),' said Mr Jorg Barczynski, IG Metall's federal spokesman. The union's hesitation in organising an all-out strike, even though it still believes one is inevitable, stems from the conflicting pressures facing it in the five eastern states. Several companies in eastern Germany, most notably in the car, shipbuilding and privatised steel industry, have offered 26 per cent pay increases. These concur with the original March 1991 contract between the employers, IG Metall and eastern German enterprise managers. 'It will be difficult to bring these workers out,' an IG Metall official said. But the union is reluctant to call off the strike because other enterprises are offering 9 per cent, as recommended by the employers, or a bit more. 'That would mean admitting the end of the contract which Gesamtmetall broke,' said Mr Barczynski. However, he added that IG Metall could envisage a situation where collective wage bargaining in eastern Germany would be superseded by separate contracts with individual enterprises. It appears that IG Metall would be prepared to accept, in eastern Germany at least, an end to the traditional system of collective wage bargaining between employers and unions, even though it has repeatedly accused the employers of wanting to use the wage conflict in eastern Germany to end that system. For its part, Gesamtmetall was yesterday adamant that it did not want to break the collective wage bargaining system. 'Individual contracts may well happen in eastern Germany, but it is a special case. It would not happen in the west,' an official said.</p>

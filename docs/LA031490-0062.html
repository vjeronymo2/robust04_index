			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANTONOVICH OPPOSES PLAN TO DUMP SLUDGE IN ANTELOPE VALLEY;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE PROPOSAL TO SPREAD HUNDREDS OF TONS OF THE SEWAGE BYPRODUCT  OVER FARMS IN THAT AREA ALSO ENRAGES ENVIRONMENTALISTS AND DRAWS COMPLAINTS  FROM OFFICIALS OF NEARBY CITIES.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Mike Antonovich said Tuesday that he will oppose a plan by  Los Angeles to spread hundreds of tons of sewage sludge over farms in the  Antelope Valley, a proposal that also enraged local environmentalists and drew  complaints from officials of nearby cities.  </P> <P> "It is time the city of Los Angeles and its elected officials recognize they  cannot use the Antelope Valley as a dumping ground for their garbage," said  Antonovich, who represents the area. The supervisor said he would change his  mind only if the plan were to draw "substantial community support." That seemed  an unlikely prospect Tuesday. Antelope Valley environmental activists vowed to  resist it while city officials in both Lancaster and Palmdale complained that  they had not been told of the plan and doubted it would be approved by state  officials.  </P> <P> Under the plan, Los Angeles, using a private firm, would truck up to 300 tons  of sewage sludge a day -- more than 20% of the city's output -- to be used as  fertilizer at five farm sites in the Antelope Valley.  </P> <P> The state Regional Water Quality Control Board, meeting Thursday in Death  Valley, had been set to approve the proposal. But a decision was delayed for  two months after some board members complained that the sludge could  contaminate the high desert region's crucial ground water supply.  </P> <P> The federal Environmental Protection Agency and leaders of national  environmental groups said that government agencies across the United States are  increasingly looking to direct land application of sewage sludge as an option  as landfills become scarce.  </P> <P> "It's an issue that's exploding all across the country," said Douglas Rader, a  senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund, a private,  pro-environment group. "We're seeing hundreds and hundreds of these things  coming out of the woodwork all over the country."  </P> <P> Rader and EPA officials said that using sludge as a fertilizer can be  beneficial and is preferable to dumping the mud-like substance into the ocean  or landfills, as many cities still do. But they added that the treated sewage  can contaminate ground water supplies and pose a health hazard if not properly  regulated.  </P> <P> Some environmentalists and city officials in the Antelope Valley, the  fastest-growing region of Los Angeles County, see the issue in much simpler  terms -- as yet another case of people from "down below" in Los Angeles trying  to dump their problems somewhere else.  </P> <P> "This is the typical mentality about the high desert," said Lancaster Mayor  Lynn Harrison, who said officials there did not know of the Los Angeles plan  before Tuesday. She said city dwellers believe that "nobody lives there -- it  doesn't matter."  </P> <P> "They're always quick to get rid of what they don't want up here," she said.  </P> <P> "I'm sure it's not going to go over very well with the community," added  Palmdale City Administrator Bob Toone, who also said his city had not been  previously told of the proposal.  </P> <P> Toone said the proposal should have to approved by county planners, but Dick  Frazier, a county supervising regional planner, said he saw nothing in the  proposal that required county action.  </P> <P> "We were just horrified. We are totally against this," added Stormy Williams, a  Rosamond resident who heads an Antelope Valley environmental group called  Desert Citizens Against Pollution. "They are not going to get anywhere on this.  Everyone in the valley will unite on this."  </P> <P> Los Angeles officials, who are backing the plan with a private company, Bio Gro  Systems Inc., insist that the sludge program is environmentally safe and  actually recycles what has been a waste product. The city now trucks 950 tons  of sludge a day to farms in Riverside County and Yuma, Ariz., but wants to  divert about a third of that to the closer Antelope Valley to save money on  trucking costs.  </P> <P> Los Angeles and Bio Gro officials said they could understand public concern  over the proposal.  </P> <P> "Because of the public perception of sludge, we are fortunate to be regulated  enough that we can be confident it is a good program," said Carol Pavon, Bio  Gro's monitoring manager.  </P> <P> She acknowledged that Bio Gro, although it has been pursuing the Antelope  Valley proposal for nearly a year, until now had not discussed the plans with  the public or city officials in Lancaster and Palmdale.  </P> <P> But now, she said, "If they are interested in it, we're certainly willing to  talk."  </P></p>

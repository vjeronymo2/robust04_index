			<p>BFN     [Text] Recent foreign media broadcasts referring to a  cease-fire agreement between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  and the government are unfounded. The RPF cannot sign an  agreement with a government it does not recognize.    The so-called government is null and void politically and  legally. The clique calling itself a coalition of parties which  were part of the previous government actively comprises  individuals jointly motivated by a desire to divide Rwandans.  The government comprises the small group of people who fought  the Arusha agreement and did everything possible to ensure it  was scrapped.    The RPF cannot hold talks with the clique, which does not  recognize the Arusha agreements. As far as the RPF is  concerned, there is no government in Rwanda. It does not even  recognize the man who calls himself president of the Republic  after being installed unlawfully. He has said himself that he  was installed as president under Article 42 of the Constitution  of 10 February 1991. He says so himself. However, he well knows  that the article is no longer valid. The president of the  Republic had been sworn in under the peace agreement and was to  have been replaced in accordance with the same agreement. The  agreement stipulates that the president of the Republic is to be  replaced by the president of the transitional broad-based  National Assembly. Theodore Sindikubgabo is only president of  the National Development Counci [CND], which is now irrelevant.  His government cannot hold talks with the RPF. It is not a  government of Rwandans but a clique with Coalition for the  Defense of the Republic [CDR] ideas which conflict with the  Arusha agreements. It is a government that has not been  recognized by a single foreign country. Even international  radios call it the CDR.    [Words indistinct] the United Nations has not recognized it.  The so-called government cannot hold talks with the RPF, because  it has exterminated the government of Mrs. Agathe Uwilingiyimana.    A close look shows that the government is made up of a  clique  which usurped power by shedding blood. What it did is no  different from a coup d'etat. It has been said on several  occasions that the clique wanted to replace the government with  another which would oppose the RPF. To install such a  government they first had to kill all their opponents in the  government, which they did.    What also exposes their plan was killing Felicien Ngango,  who  was to have become president of the broad-based National  Assembly and would therefore have replaced the president of the  Republic. They made it even clearer with the death of Joseph  Kavaruganda, the president of the Constitutional Court, who was  empowered to swear in the individual who would have replaced the  president of the Republic and his friends.    The clique had always nursed its plan of capturing power,  but  failed to obtain the ways and means to carry it out. They found  a way through the death of President Habyarimana, which the  clique must have paved the way for so as to bring to realization  the objectives of those who called themselves power. [as heard]  That is why some conclude that what was done was no different  from a coup d'etat, as there are killings causing tears. Over  10,000 have already died. The government is still cooperating  with the killers although it [words indistinct] part of its  program. That is why the RPF must fight the clique until  dictatorship and division are disposed of in Rwanda.    The RPF decided to resume fighting for three main reasons:  First, to support the RPF combatants in the CND compound, who  have been and continue being attacked by the Presidential Guard.  Second, to stop the killings of innocent people. Third, to  restore peace in the country.    The RPF continues to implement its goals. In fact, the RPF  has entered the outskirts of Kigali. It is fighting the  Presidential Guards and their supporters. That is why it asks  all citizens to support the RPF combatants [words indistinct]  and that if they see them they should know they are coming to  rout Rwanda's enemies.    We call on government soldiers who do not support the clique  to support the RPF combatants. The UN Assistance Mission to  Rwanda's contribution is also necessary. They should avoid the  clique's traps, especially by refraining from bringing the RPF  leaders messages from the clique. This is not a clique to hold  talks with, but one to be fought by all Rwandans. If we unite,  we shall get rid of it.</p>

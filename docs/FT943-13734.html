			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Survey of South Africa (10): A widely respected banker The decision by Mr Derek Keys, finance minister, to step down in October for personal reasons caused panic in the financial markets when it was announced this month, but his chosen successor, Mr Christo Liebenberg is likely to prove a capable replacement, writes Mark Suzman. Mr Liebenberg, who is presently acting as Mr Keys's understudy before the incumbent leaves, fits all the requirements for finance minister. He is a widely respected banker with strong private sector credentials, a sound understanding of the economy, and a tough, conservative attitude to fiscal discipline. 'He's a journeyman executive. He's capable and will work hard at the job.' observes one banker. 'A very good back-room man,' notes another businessman who has worked with him. 'He understands the issues, works through them carefully and delivers the goods.' Mr Liebenberg, a career banker, started work in the mail room of a Nedbank branch and slowly worked his way up the ranks. En route, he picked up managerial qualifications from the Institute of Bankers, Dale Carnegie, Insead and Harvard, and built up a solid reputation as a dedicated and hardworking executive. In 1989 he became Nedbank's managing director and in 1990 he was appointed chief executive of Nedcor, South Africa's fourth-largest banking and financial services group, a post from which he retired in February of this year after a solid stint at the helm. He has no previous government experience and will be expected to bring business acumen rather than political skills to the post. Although affable and good humoured, Mr Liebenberg is seen as both less charismatic and less cerebral than the ebullient Mr Keys and he will find it more difficult to win people over to his point of view. One probable result of his appointment will be a change in the balance of power in the government's economic policy team. Whereas Mr Keys was unquestionably the dominant figure in the troika composed of him, Mr Jay Naidoo, and Mr Alec Erwin, the new arrangement will likely be more of a gathering of equals. Mr Liebenberg's lower international profile will also allow the other two to increase their exposure within the global financial community.</p>

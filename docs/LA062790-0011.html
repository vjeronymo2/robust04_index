			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN LEFT;  </P> <P> MANDELA'S WAY: THE ROAD NOT TAKEN;  </P> <P> COLD WAR POLITICS PUT U.S. AND SOUTH AFRICAN BLACKS ON DIVERGENT PATHS.  </P> <P> Nelson Mandela is about to visit Los Angeles and the national NAACP leadership  will meet here next week. These twin events put into focus the relationship  between blacks in South Africa and in the United States. The differences in how  these two communities have responded to racism extend far beyond the fact that  one is an oppressed majority and the other is a discrete minority.  </P> <P> Ironically, the Cold War was a significant factor in eroding Jim Crow in the  United States and in encouraging the onset of apartheid in South Africa. How  could Washington continue howling about human-rights violations in the Soviet  Union when most African Americans could not vote or eat at certain lunch  counters or be buried in some cemeteries? Simultaneously, Washington's search  for allies in this global struggle allowed the ruling party in Pretoria to  promulgate apartheid in 1948, proclaiming the African National Congress a  veritable tool of Moscow. Then as now, the ANC was allied with the South  African Communist Party and Washington lent a sympathetic ear to the  government.  </P> <P> The NAACP had not been indifferent to the U.S. Communist Party in the pre-Cold  War era. Many of its leaders, especially Roy Wilkins, lent support to the black  Communist lawyer Ben Davis when he was elected to the New York City Council  from Harlem in 1943 and 1945. But unlike the ANC, the NAACP broke these ties in  the postwar period; hence, founder W.E.B. Du Bois was ousted in 1948, the group  supported wars in Korea and Vietnam and barred Communists from membership as  part of a de facto Faustian bargain that led to concessions on civil rights.  The ANC chose not to take this path.  </P> <P> The consequences of the NAACP's choice resonate to this day. With the left  still marginalized among blacks (not to mention the nation as a whole), black  youth in particular face unpalatable choices. One is a pallid integrationism  that has the virtue of organizing across racial lines. But the absence of  militance provides little appeal for youth, who recognize that militance has  historically been the engine bringing gains to our community. The other is a  narrow nationalism, symbolized by the throngs greeting the Rev. Louis  Farrakhan, that is verbally militant but is self-defeating in its lack of  organization, a historical approach and chauvinism. Eastern Europe is now  discovering the lesson learned ruefully by blacks, that decline of the left  leads to the rise of narrow nationalism.  </P> <P> Though racism in South Africa is more severe than it is here, Farrakhan's  sexism and anti-white rhetoric would be viewed with far greater skepticism in  Soweto. Similarly, the NAACP's anti-communism would receive outraged disbelief.  </P> <P> When Mandela was freed, he singled out for special praise the Communist Party  and its leader, Joe Slovo, who is of Lithuanian-Jewish descent and who has  quite a following in black South Africa. Meanwhile, U.S. youth are captivated  by rap groups like Public Enemy, which engage in anti-Semitic allusions.  </P> <P> When the left was marginalized in the United States, along with it went the  idea that racism stemmed from profit and the operations of a system. It became  inevitable that blacks, seeking new explanations for their plight, would blame  Euro-Americans as a whole.  </P> <P> The ANC speaks explicitly of redistribution of wealth; despite the significant  disparities of wealth that also exist in the United States, this demand is  curiously absent from the agendas of most civil rights organizations. Indeed,  the NAACP was reluctant to take up the cause of the anti-apartheid movement  because of its allergy to the left, and relented only recently.  </P> <P> It would be simpleminded to blame just the NAACP for this sad state of affairs.  Powerful elites backed its leaders into this corner. But Nelson Mandela and the  ANC also faced powerful enemies and decided to stare them down; now they are on  the verge of taking over a government and a sizeable state-owned economy with  the aim of improving the well-being of the black majority. Meanwhile, African  Americans face an uncertain future as the scientific and technological  revolution has undermined a major base of livelihood -- factory jobs -- while  our crumbling system of education is not preparing blacks for an increasingly  gloomy tomorrow.  </P> <P> Nelson Mandela represents the road not taken, though it is still not too late  for the NAACP and other civil rights organizations to learn from his example.  </P></p>

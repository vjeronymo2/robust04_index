			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Business Travel (Update): Ryan routes Ryanair, the fast-growing independent Irish airline, is to open a new 'low-fares-no frills' Dublin-Gatwick route from October, with a schedule of up to six flights per day. Return fares will start at IPounds 69. The airline has pioneered low-cost air travel across the Irish Sea and last month added Manchester and Glasgow Prestwick to its list of UK destinations out of Dublin. Aer Lingus, British Midland, Ryanair and Virgin are all now competing intensely for business in the Dublin-London air travel market, the second busiest in Europe, so travellers should check with each to see what special offers are available.</p>

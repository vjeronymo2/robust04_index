			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] About an hour ago, State Chamber Chairman Herman  Rigelnik announced the results of a secret vote on the candidate  for interior minister, Andrej Ster. Out of 76 deputies, 58  voted in favor of him while 15 were opposed. Before the vote,  hitherto Interior Minister Ivo Bizjak had addressed the  deputies. Here is a report by Robert Rakar:    [Begin recording] [Rakar] Immediately upon his election,  the new interior minister, Andrej Ster, in an interview for our  radio station said that he was very satisfied with the outcome  of the vote and especially with the number of votes in support.  Regarding his future work in the ministry he said:    [Ster] The tasks are not in short supply. In addition to  the present ones new tasks will arise daily. The fact is that a  conflict replacement or replacement that would drag on over a  longer period of time in uncertainty could very much delay if  not interrupt some pretty important projects that are currently  underway in the ministry. I see my role primarily here. I have  absolutely no illusions about the capabilities that I have. I  intend to work to the best of my ability and knowledge, together  with a ministry team that I believe is rather good. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

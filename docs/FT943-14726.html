			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Arts: La fanciulla del West - Opera In a year when even Glyndebourne has gone over to operas set on the empty stage of post-modernism, this old production looks as if it belongs to another era. The late 1970s were a high point at Covent Garden and La fanciulla del West was among its golden successes. Money was said to be short at the time, but it does not look like that now. No doubt working on the premise that Puccini's 'Gold Rush' Western is an opera ripe for Hollywood, the producer Piero Faggioni went to Tinseltown for his designer, Ken Adam (of James Bond fame). His massive designs still look impressive, especially Minnie's log cabin in the mountains, the whole life-size structure built on stage. Who cares if changing the sets means the intervals last 40 minutes, especially on the hottest night of the year? The opera has returned this summer for Gwyneth Jones, who sings Minnie. After 30 years plus service for the Royal Opera there can be few new roles left for her. Working up through the Wagner heroines, Strauss's Frau and Elektra, then Puccini's Turandot, she has left Minnie till last - the final rung on the dramatic soprano's climb up the heaviest roles of the repertoire. Puccini himself admired Maria Jeritza in the title-role, probably stunned by her entrance sliding down the banisters, firing her gun in mid-air. Gwyneth Jones does not try any antics like that. Her Minnie is warm-hearted, tender, eyelashes fluttering at the end of Act 1 as she feels love for the first time. A tendency to lift up into notes in the early half of the evening is a nagging annoyance, probably a sign that she was not in her best voice, but there is no shortage of power packed in her holster. Justino Daz makes a formidable adversary for her. His sadistic Jack Rance, wrapped in an ankle-length white fur coat, is a dominating figure with biting, powerful singing on the same scale, easily the best thing he has done here. Nicola Martinucci is a reliable Dick Johnson, who rises to his big moments eagerly. It is good to have an Italian tenor in the role and one with a voice of the right size, even if he lacks some vocal class. The way he and Minnie warily circle each other captures well Puccini's subtlety as he edges their relationship forward. It is important to issue a reminder that La fanciulla del West is not an early work. This is vintage Puccini, cocooning the lovers at Minnie's snowbound hut with music that knows exactly how to create a world of its own. Richard Buckley loves the score, but unfortunately to excess. All the slow music drags and it is only partial compensation that he finds such high-octane verve when pace is called for. Among the miners there are some good cameos, especially Francis Egerton's trusty Nick, still there after 17 years. Michael Druiett makes a lowering figure of Ashby, the Wells Fargo man, and Clive Bayley is a striking Castro. This is not the most exciting revival the production has had (a tighter sense of pacing would be needed for that) but it is worth catching. La fanciulla del West is an expensive opera to put on and we can no longer count on seeing Puccini's neglected masterpiece often. Revival sponsored by Dr Stanley Ho. Further performances until July 23.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREGNANCY 'CRISIS' CONFERENCE URGED  </P> <P> Declaring that thousands of poor women in Orange County face "substandard"  maternity care, local March of Dimes officials on Wednesday called for a  community meeting to resolve what they termed "the present crisis."  </P> <P> March of Dimes leaders Fred Owens and Dr. Ralph W. Rucker also warned that  unless more hospitals agree to treat the indigent pregnant women, "we face the  prospect of reverting to a two-tiered level in the standard of medical care --  substandard for the poor and excellent for the rest of us."  </P> <P> They invited hospital administrators, the Board of Supervisors, state  legislators and advocates for the poor to attend an open forum July 13 at the  Westin South Coast Plaza hotel on "Access to Maternity Care in Orange County."  </P> <P> The March of Dimes' call for a meeting is at least the fifth such request by  various groups since June 2, when UCI Medical Center in Orange announced a  controversial policy to turn away some women in labor because its obstetrics  ward is overcrowded and conditions are "unsafe." The medical center cares for  most of the county's indigent pregnant women, many of them Latinas who have had  no prenatal care.  </P> <P> UCI officials have hoped that other hospitals would sign Medi-Cal contracts,  sharing some of the indigent-patient load, but some hospitals have expressed  concern about Medi-Cal's low reimbursement rate. Also, some had wanted  "obstetrics-only" contracts that state Medi-Cal officials have not been willing  to allow.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, state Health Services Director Kenneth W. Kizer invited  hospital administrators and others concerned about maternity care in Orange  County to meet with him. Depending on what that meeting -- or series of  meetings -- produces, Kizer and his officials "may or may not carry a  particular message" to the commission that sets Medi-Cal rates, Kizer told The  Times Orange County Edition this week.  </P> <P> Also in separate discussions, officials from the Hospital Council of Southern  California, the county's Obstetrics and Gynecology Society and United Way of  Orange County have reacted to UCI Medical Center's "obstetrical diversion"  policy, expressing concern about improving access to maternity care. Owens, the  March of Dimes board chairman, said he was aware of the other meetings or  requests for meetings. But, he said, "it seems that a lot of people are  talking, but nobody's talking together."  </P> <P> Owens said he would like to get lawmakers -- particularly county supervisors --  "to realize there is a problem. . . . When women are denied access to maternity  care, that seems to be a pretty serious problem."  </P> <P> Added March of Dimes Community Service Director Dorothy Andrews: "We're seeing  a community denial that there are problems in Orange County affecting poor  women and children. . . . We thought it was time we acted as a neutral party to  call all the other factions and organizations together at least as a first  step" toward improving maternity care for the poor.  </P> <P> The March of Dimes letter was sent to about 100 individuals and organizations,  including all five county supervisors, Orange County representatives in the  state Legislature, UCI's Medical School dean and vice chancellor of health  sciences Walter Henry, the administrators of 15 hospitals, several prominent  obstetricians as well as advocates for the indigent.  </P> <P> Henry could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but Wade Rose, an assistant  dean at the medical school, applauded the idea of the March of Dimes' forum.  </P> <P> "It's a very positive sign to have people in the community reaching out to  solve this very serious problem," Rose said.  </P> <P> What various organizations describe as a crisis has been building for some time  as more hospitals in Orange County dropped their Medi-Cal contracts and most of  the county's obstetricians have declined to treat Medi-Cal patients because the  reimbursement rate was so poor.  </P> <P> The situation peaked in early June when UCI Medical Center officials said that  their obstetrics ward was crowded and "unsafe," with fetal monitors in short  supply, infections frequent among women having Cesarean deliveries and some  mothers forced to deliver in the hall.  </P> <P> Since the medical center's "obstetrical diversion" policy was announced, the  hospital -- whenever it was full -- has turned away pregnant non-patients at  curb-side and handed them a map to other area hospitals.  </P> <P> So far, the hospital has announced four "diversions" and turned away two  pregnant women, hospital spokeswoman Elaine Beno said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Ironically the maternity ward, designed to handle 250 deliveries a month, may  handle more than 600 births this month since women who have had prenatal care  at UCI clinics have continued to be admitted during "diversions."  </P></p>

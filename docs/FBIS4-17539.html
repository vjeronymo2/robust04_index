			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Nekrasova] </F>   [Text] Lvov 25 April TASS -- President Leonid Kravchuk  intends to request the new Ukrainian parliament to postpone  presidential polls scheduled for June 26.    He told the "Ukraine" world service radio on Monday that it  is "inappropriate" to hold the presidential elections as the  status of the president had not been determined and the  constitition was not adopted.    Kravchuk added that the former parliament adopted the  decision on holdng the presidential polls "under the pressure of  opposition."    Kravchuk's intention to move up elections is shared by the  nationalist opposition Rukh movement, the Green Party and the  Christian Democrats. They decided at their congresses that it  is dangerous to hold elections in Ukraine at present and did not  nominate their candidates.    Vyacheslav Chornovil, the major opponent of Kravchuk, also  refused to run for the president so far.    However, the leftist forces became active in this respect.  The Socialist Party nominated its leader Alexander Moroz, while  the communists, who ensured a major success at the latest  parliamentary elections, nominated Petr Simonenko.    Other candidates are Speaker Ivan Plushch, former prime  minister Leonid Kuchma, Vladimir Lanovoi, Vladimir Pilipchuk,  Yuriy Kostenko, Larisa Skorik.</p>

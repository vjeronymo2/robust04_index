			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT ISRAEL FORUM, PLO VIDEO URGES TALKS  </P> <P> The Palestine Liberation Organization made a novel effort to influence Israeli  public opinion Wednesday by means of a videotape, shown at a Jerusalem peace  symposium, in which a top PLO official appeals for direct talks with Israel's  government.  </P> <P> No one could remember a PLO official addressing the Israeli public in such a  way, even in a closed forum. It was the latest development in a recent string  of contacts between leftist, dovish Israelis and PLO sympathizers here and PLO  members abroad.  </P> <P> The Palestinian speaker on the tape is Salah Khalaf, a deputy to PLO Chairman  Yasser Arafat. Khalaf, who uses the code name Abu Iyad, is regarded as an  inflexible hard-liner among PLO officials.  </P> <P> "All security arrangements and guarantees can be discussed in direct meetings,"  Khalaf said. "Then, if we reach agreement, as I am sure we shall, we can take  this agreement to an international conference where the entire world can be a  witness to these security arrangements, so that not a single loophole will be  left to spoil it."  </P> <P> The offer appeared to put a new face on the PLO's demand that an international  peace conference, under U.N. auspices, be convened to settle the  Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel has refused to talk with the PLO under any  circumstances.  </P> <P> The Khalaf tape, smuggled into Israel via Paris from PLO headquarters in Tunis,  was shown at a symposium organized by the International Center for Middle East  Peace, headed by former Foreign Minister Abba Eban. Officers of the center  declined to say who had brought the tape into Israel, except to say that it was  a European member of the group's board.  </P> <P> Khalaf seemed to go out of his way to assure his viewers that the PLO quest for  a Palestinian state is not just a way to build a springboard to attack Israel.  </P> <P> "The important thing," he said, "is that the two peoples, the Palestinian and  Israeli, come to believe in the necessity of coexistence between the two  states."  </P> <P> He appealed for Israelis to see the PLO's implicit recognition of Israel as a  bold and moderate step.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Test of Courage  </P> <P> "We would remind you," he said, "that just as you have some extremists, we also  have many such people. However, the test of courage is when such extremism is  countered head-on rather than surrendered to."  </P> <P> Khalaf said that the PLO's national charter, which calls for the destruction of  Israel, is open for discussion.  </P> <P> "Our covenant and yours can be discussed," he said, apparently refering to the  Israeli declaration of independence.  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, the symposium featured another first: a Soviet expert on  Middle East affairs making a public appearance in Israel. In the recent thaw  between Jerusalem and Moscow, most cultural contacts have taken place in the  Soviet Union. An Israeli basketball team recently played in Moscow and a pair  of Israeli singers performed there.  </P> <P> The Mideast expert, Andre Shouminkhin, called for a speedup in contacts aimed  at ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and he said the Soviet Union could  play a key role.  </P> <P> "Without the Soviet Union, conflicts cannot be resolved easily, if at all," he  said.  </P> <P> In reference to reports from Washington that the Bush Administration sees a  reduced role for Moscow in Middle East diplomacy, Shouminkhin remarked that "no  one should impose any restrictions on Soviet participation in the settlement."  </P> <P> "The greater the Soviet role, as well as the role of other outsiders in  settling (this) particular conflict, I think, the better for everyone around,"  he said.  </P> <P> Shouminkhin pressed for inclusion of the PLO in any such talks.  </P> <P> "Let's face it," he said, "Without the PLO . . . peace cannot be achieved. You  can go on postponing these negotiations, but if you really want an  understanding you should begin."  </P></p>

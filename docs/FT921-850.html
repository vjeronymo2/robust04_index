			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / World Trade News: Japanese cotton spinners threaten dumping actions JAPANESE cotton spinners are threatening anti-dumping actions against Pakistani and Indonesian yarn exporters, an unusual course for Japanese industry, generally the target of dumping allegations itself. The Japan Spinners' Association said it was preparing to file a formal action against the exporters, alleging the dumping of cut-price cotton yarn is damaging its industry. Over the past three years, only two other dumping cases have surfaced in Japan. South Korean woollen product exporters agreed to 'voluntary' limits after a threatened action, and a case against China, Norway and South Africa for alleged dumping of a ferro-alloy is being investigated by Japan's trade and finance ministries. The textile cases reflect the problems traditional Japanese manufacturers face. Mr Takateru Tobitani, managing director of Shikibo, a leading spinner, has said Japanese companies are 'in a similar situation to US car makers'; the local industry cannot compete with cheaper imports. 'Japan's textile market is basically a free market, and cheaper imports from Pakistan and Indonesia have increased sharply,' he said. Japanese spinners say they would like 'voluntary' accord with the two countries, but 'we don't want Pakistan to think we will not take action'. Pakistan hopes for an agreement soon.</p>

			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: CUDAHY;  </P> <P> PARK AVE. SCHOOL CLEANUP TOPIC OF BRIEFING TONIGHT  </P> <P> After months of meetings to discuss the petroleum contamination that shut down  Park Avenue Elementary School last year, parents, teachers, state and school  officials tonight will be briefed on the cleanup of the campus and its  long-awaited reopening Monday.  </P> <P> The meeting of the Park Avenue Environmental Task Force, which was set up to  discuss and recommend solutions for dealing with the contamination, will begin  at 6 p.m. at the school, 8020 Park Ave., Cudahy.  </P> <P> Park Avenue Elementary was closed by the Los Angeles Unified School District  last July after parents and teachers voiced concerns that the sticky black goo  that formed small puddles on the asphalt playground was toxic. Studies later  showed the goo to be petroleum sludge that had been buried in an old dump on  which the school was built.  </P> <P> For the last several months, an environmental engineering firm has been working  to contain the sludge by capping the playground with a thick plastic cover and  a layer of fresh asphalt. A built-in venting system to dissipate gases also was  installed.  </P> <P> District officials said the 1,065 students of Park Avenue, who have been  attending two other local schools, will return to Park Avenue on Monday.  </P></p>

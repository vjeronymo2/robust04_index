			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEEN HAS PLENTY OF PHOTOS FROM HIS SOVIET TRIP  </P> <P> After graduating from Mira Mesa High School last June, some of Jason Whaley's  classmates jumped on the first plane to Hawaii, checked into a cheap hotel for  a week, and celebrated on the beach until they acquired a glowing, magenta  sunburn.  </P> <P> Whaley eschewed the traditional graduation partying to ride stuffy trains to 32  cities in 23 days and eat beet soup -- paying $3,300 for the privilege.  </P> <P> "It was worth every penny," said Whaley, 17, an aspiring photojournalist who  shot 75 rolls of film -- about 2,700 pictures -- during a three-week trip to  the Soviet Union this summer.  </P> <P> "That camera was like an appendage. Whatever was happening, Jason was always  right there with his camera," said Bill Melton, head chaperon on the Russian  excursion that Whaley made with 32 other students from San Diego County.  </P> <P> The trip was sponsored by People to People, a nonprofit organization founded by  the U.S. State Department during the Eisenhower Administration to encourage  international student exchange.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Learning-Oriented Trip'  </P> <P> "I knew it wasn't going to be a vacation. I knew it was going to be a very  vigorous, learning-oriented trip, and I was ready for it," Whaley said.  </P> <P> He prepared not only by reading more than 70 articles written by the State  Department, but by writing to Kodak, Agfa and Fuji to request film for the  trip. The latter two sent a total of 45 rolls.  </P> <P> But Minolta came through in the biggest way. After the company president in  Osaka, Japan, received a letter from Whaley, he agreed to give him a camera,  lens and motor drive -- about $2,000 worth of equipment -- in exchange for  publication rights of the photos Whaley shot.  </P> <P> Some of those pictures will appear in the 1990 edition of Minolta Mirror, the  company's annual international journal of photography. Such exposure will  somewhat eclipse Whaley's previous career highlight: having pictures published  in the Mira Mesa Marauder, the high school yearbook.  </P> <P> Whaley's group flew from San Diego to New York, then to Helsinki, Finland. They  then traveled by train to Sochi, a resort town on the Black Sea, where they got  as crazy as their friends who had gone to Hawaii. They even threw a watermelon  off the balcony of their 17th-story room just to watch it splatter.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of time, so we did some very American things," Whaley said.  </P> <P> They sobered up quickly, however, when they arrived in Kiev and realized they  were a mere 60 miles from Chernobyl. Although everyone in the group had read  about the nuclear disaster there, they were shocked to see how close the plant  was to the huge city.  </P> <P> "When we first got there, I even considered fasting, but I figured I'd still be  irradiated from the water," Whaley said, admitting that he was overly concerned  about radiation poisoning. "Actually, I ended up having some of the best food  on the trip there. . . . No matter what anyone says about borscht, I think it's  good."  </P> <P> There were other highlights: a dinner and long visit at the home of a Soviet  librarian in Kiev, talking politics with members of the city council in Minsk.  </P> <P> Another rare opportunity arose while Whaley walked with friends near Red  Square. He saw a demonstration being held by members of Hare Krishna and,  realizing the significance of a religious protest in a communist country, began  clicking. He told his friends to take the bus back to their hostel; he'd take a  cab.  </P> <P> While Whaley found the Soviets friendly, easy to talk to and curious about  American life, it was a different story when he took to the streets with his  camera.  </P> <P> "One of the hardest things for me as a photographer was to find someone  smiling. When I went for my home stay (a visit to a resident's home), the  librarian told me, 'That's because we have nothing to smile about.' Their  country is changing rapidly, and they're scared."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Whetted His Appetite  </P> <P> Whaley got some of his best shots in Moscow. His favorite, a picture of the  spiraled towers of St. Basil's Cathedral on Red Square rising against a surreal  gray sky, is the only photo he's printed. Developing the rest of the film may  take a while for Whaley, who works as a cook.  </P> <P> The trip has merely whetted his appetite for travel. He hopes to attend the  world-famous Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara, then work as a  photographer for National Geographic magazine.  </P> <P> Whaley plans to spend the next two years working in a lab or at a photography  studio, cleaning floors if has to, to save money to attend Brooks.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he's happy to rest on the memories of three weeks in the Soviet  Union.  </P> <P> "Without a doubt, this has been the best experience of my life," he said. "I  don't know when, but someday I'm going to go back."  </P></p>

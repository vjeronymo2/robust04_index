			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Observer: Roman sauce Romans are as fond of political jokes as anyone; the arrival of the charismatic Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister prompts the following tale. Berlusconi dies and goes to hell. But Lucifer quickly finds him impossible and arranges him a transfer to purgatory. There he creates equal mayhem, with multiple takeover bids, cross-ownership deals and so on. Eventually, for the sake of a quiet life, St Peter admits him to Paradise. Two weeks later, Lucifer rings up to ask how it's going. It's all quiet, says St Peter. Oddly quiet, he thinks, and goes to see what Berlusconi is up to. He finds him closeted with God, whom he overhears saying: 'OK, that's you sorted out. But me . . . why only vice-president?'</p>

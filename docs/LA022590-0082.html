			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS  </P> <P> Question: We've received Alaskan brochures indicating that Prince William Sound  is again seeking tourists. Is the area free of oil?  </P> <P>  Answer: More than 2,000 miles of the sound's coastline was untouched, and the  section affected by the Exxon spill is slowly being cleaned. Local officials  say that the sound is still one of Alaska's major visitor attractions. For  details, write to Prince William Sound Tourism Coalition, P.O. Box 1477,  Valdez, Alaska 99686.  </P> <P> Q: As rail buffs, we'd like to ride the fastest European trains. Which are they  and how do they compare with the speed of the Japanese bullet trains?  </P> <P> A: The French TGV still is the fastest, linking Paris/Lyon at a maximum 186  m.p.h. German Intercity Express will reach 165 m.p.h. next year between Munich  and Hamburg, while British Rail's high is 125 m.p.h. Top speed of the Japan  bullet trains is 170 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Q: How does the new Historic Hotels of America organization select its members,  and are there any in California?  </P> <P>  A: The hotels must be at least 50 years old, and listed or be eligible for the  National Register of Historic Places. Among the first 32 chosen are the La  Valencia Hotel in La Jolla (1132 Prospect, La Jolla 92037, 619-454-0771) and  two in San Francisco -- the Westin St. Francis (335 Powell St., San Francisco  94102, 415-397-7000) and El Drisco (2901 Pacific Ave., San Francisco 94115,  415-346-2880). For a complete list, write the organization at 1785  Massachusetts Ave. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036.  </P> <P> Q: A hotel recently charged $10 a page for FAX usage. Is this a normal cost?  </P> <P> A: As hotels can charge whatever they want for telephone, FAX and other message  services, it's best to ask before using them. Public FAX services are  proliferating and may cost considerably less.  </P> <P> Q: Is there a chain of French country inns that guarantee against noise?  </P> <P>  A: The Relaise du Silence cater to guests who prefer solitude to the bustle of  larger hotels, and allow for back roads exploration. A directory of more than  100 of these establishments is available for $2 by writing to 38640 Claix,  Isere, France.  </P> <P> Q: Do Hong Kong tailors still make suits in one day?  </P> <P> A: Some will, but many of the better tailors suggest three fittings and  three-day delivery.  </P> <P> Q: What's the best way to find out which hotels and motels accept dogs?  </P> <P> A: A directory, "Traveling With Towser," listing thousands of hotels that  accept dogs, is available for $1.50 from Quacker Professional Services, Dept.  GPR, 585 Hawthorne Court, Galesburg, Ill. 61401.  </P> <P> Q: Are there package tours for recovering alcoholics and drug users?  </P> <P> A: Nearly a dozen companies operate such trips to domestic, Caribbean and other  destinations. Most offer outdoor recreation, counselors and seminars as part of  the therapy programs. Among the companies is Sober Vacations International,  2365 Westwood Blvd., Suite 21, Los Angeles 90064, (213) 470-0606.  </P></p>

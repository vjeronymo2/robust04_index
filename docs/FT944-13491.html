			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: BM cuts deficit to Pounds 71.5m and proposes name change BM Group, the engineering company, yesterday reported a 75 per cent reduction in bank borrowings and a name change alongside its results for the year to the end of June. The group, which almost collapsed last year, sold 17 businesses and 14 properties to reduce its borrowings from Pounds 160m to Pounds 40m at September 30. Announcing new banking arrangements, the group also broke with its past by proposing to change its name to Brunel Holdings. 'Effectively, we are at the end of a massive and costly restructuring of the group,' said Mr Cliff Walker, chief executive. 'The announcement of new banking facilities, the bulk of which are on a three-year term, enables us from now on to focus all our management concentration on the development of our ongoing businesses.' Pre-tax losses were reduced from Pounds 117m to Pounds 71.5m. The deficit was struck after Pounds 67.5m of exceptionals, which included a Pounds 51.6m goodwill write-off and Pounds 12.7m pension prepayment write-off, both relating to the disposal programme. At the operating level the company reported profits of Pounds 6.73m for the year against losses of Pounds 1.23m on sales of Pounds 403m, down from Pounds 547.2m. But interest costs still amounted to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 14.1m). The company also announced recommended offers to acquire all the preference shares of Blackwood Hodge, the construction equipment distributor, for 6.57m new BM ordinary shares, with a market value of Pounds 2.95m at last night's close. BM, which already owns the entire ordinary share capital of Blackwood Hodge, intends to liquidate the company. The Pounds 60m acquisition of Blackwood Hodge in 1990 was largely blamed for the difficulties which led BM to breach its covenants on interest cover and net assets last year. The company is still considering litigation against Hambros, the merchant bank which advised on the purchase. Blackwood Hodge reported reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 8.12m (Pounds 44.2m) for the year to June 30. Turnover fell from Pounds 267.7m to Pounds 235.6m after disposals including its lossmaking Canadian operations. BM has sold virtually all of the Blackwood Hodge businesses. BM is concentrating on its process engineering businesses, including skid steer loaders, fasteners and woodworking machinery. More than 50 per cent of its sales are to customers outside the UK. Mr Moger Woolley, chairman, said BM would return to normal preference dividend payments this year, including arrears for the year to June 30. He also announced its intention to return 'as soon as possible' to the payment of ordinary dividends, which were last paid at the interim stage in 1992-93. Losses per share declined from 109.1p to 63.4p. The shares rose  1/2 p to 45p yesterday. See Observer</p>

In  his meeting with Ciller, Besharati said that there was no  problem in the relations of the two countries in the security,  political and economic fields. He said that occasional  misunderstandings which sometimes surface between the two  countries are natural between two neighboring countries, adding  that they can be removed through constant bilateral talks.    Besharati said that Iran's foreign policy is based on  non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries and  that Tehran's ties with Turkey are based on good neighborly and  friendly relations. Tehran-Ankara cooperation in campaign  against terrorism was a positive result of the constant meetings  between Iranian and Turkish officials he said and voiced concern  over the activities of certain opponents of the Islamic Republic  in Turkey.    Referring to damages inflicted from the bombardment of  Iranian border areas by Turkish fighters, he called on Turkey to  compensate the losses. Turkish fighters bombarded two Iranian  border villages in the outskirts of the northeastern city of Sar  Dasht on January 28 during which two people were killed.    Besharati also called on Turkey to introduce the members of  the parliamentary friendship committee and the joint trade and  economic commission saying that the Iranian members were already  nominated.    Ciller expressed regret over the losses inflicted as a  result  of the air raid on the Iranian border areas and said that  experts are investigating the issue. She added that strict  instructions have been given to the Turkish interior minister  and the governors general to prevent the activities of the  anti-Iranian elements.    Turning to regional issues, Ciller stressed preservation of  the territorial integrity of Iraq, and added that regional  countries would face problems if the Iraqi problem is not  settled.    In his meeting with Foreign Minister Cetin, Besharati  discussed bilateral cooperation in security, political,  economic, and parliamentary fields.    In an interview before the meeting, Besharati said that  constant talks and contacts between the two countries' officials  helped maintain peace and stability in the region. Expressing  satisfaction over the prevailing tranquility in the region, he  said that Iran and Turkish officials preferred long-term  interests to the short-term ones.    Stressing that enemies of Turkey had no base or place in  Iranian territory, the interior minister said that Tehran was  aware of Turkish problems and considered Ankara's enemies as its  own enemies.    Turning to the forthcoming tripartite meeting of the foreign  ministers of Iran, Turkey and Syria to be held in Damascus next  month, he said that follow-up of the developments in northern  Iraq will be among important topics of the meeting's agenda. He  said that the forthcoming visit to Tehran of Turkish President  Suleiman Demirel will be another important stride towards  consolidating bilateral ties.    In a speech, Cetin mentioned Iran and Turkey as the two  great  countries of the region and said that expansion of friendly and  brotherly ties between the two countries has important impact on  the establishment of peace and stability in the region.  Referring to the constructive role of the exchange of visits  between the ranking officials of the two countries, Cetin said  that the commission on security cooperation is continuing its  talks at the highest level.    Meanwhile, the Iran-Turkey joint security commission Monday  afternoon held a session at experts level chaired by the deputy  interior ministers of the two counties.

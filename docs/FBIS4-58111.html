			<p>BFN     [Text] On instructions from the judicial judge  investigating the assassination of engineer Dany Sham'un and his  family, forensic doctor Subhi Germanus this afternoon examined  Samir Ja'ja', commander of the dissolved Lebanese Forces, in his  place of detention to determine his health. This was done in  response to a request by his lawyer, As'ad Abu-Ra'd.    The checkup proved that his health is very good, that his  condition is normal, and that his heart rate and blood pressure  are normal. He is in good health. The forensic doctor will  submit a report to judicial investigator Judge Hunayn to be  added to the investigation file.    It should be recalled that the jail in al-Yarzah has the  necessary health facilities and a doctor visits the prisoners  daily to check their health.</p>

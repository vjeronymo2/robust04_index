			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Protest at pollution curbs delay A PROTEST about delays in granting licences to National Power and PowerGen to operate under the Environmental Protection Act was sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, by Friends of the Earth yesterday. The two companies should have been given authorisations by the Pollution Inspectorate by the end of August. They would put limits on power-station emissions. The act requires details of the companies' applications to be placed on a public register. The companies appealed against that on grounds of commercial confidentiality. The Department of the Environment yesterday said a report on the appeals had been written and was with Mr Heseltine. FoE said because of the delay the companies had been operating without authorisation for nearly five months. The environmental group leaked a letter from National Power to the Pollution Inspectorate in which the company said it was concerned that the information in its application 'will enable competitors and suppliers to analyse and assess National Power's operating regime and calculate the effect on National Power's costs.' It said: 'We must protect National Power's commercial position against both potential competitors and suppliers.' Ms Fiona Weir, FoE air pollution campaigner, said Mr Heseltine was allowing the power generators to hold up implementation of 'vital new pollution laws' as they applied to power stations.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Senior turns down Wheway rescue role MCLEOD RUSSEL Holdings, the paints producer and distributor which is offering Pounds 13.3m for Wheway, yesterday increased its stake in the struggling engineering group to 7 per cent. McLeod purchased 4 per cent of Wheway at just under 10p a share. It came as Wheway learnt that it had lost the potential support of Senior Engineering Group, the tubing, boilers and ductwork group. The two groups had held talks as part of Wheway's strategy of trying to find another third party interested in a merger. However, after looking at Wheway's businesses, Senior has decided against making an offer. Mr Hugh Ashton, Wheway's chairman, said he would continue to talk to other companies to see if he could get a better deal for shareholders. McLeod and Wheway were also recently in talks about a possible merger. However, McLeod decided to go hostile after failing to reach agreement on price. Mr Nigel Openshaw, McLeod's chairman, said: 'The fact that we were able to pick up shares so easily shows that Wheway's shareholders are voting with their feet. It is time Wheway's board recommended this offer.' Wheway shareholders are being offered one McLeod share for every 10.</p>

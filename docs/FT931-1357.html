			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / MPs mollified while the industry seethes THE press reform proposals yesterday won the backing of MPs who have been demanding press reform - and were greeted with outrage by the industry. Most newspapers said they welcomed the recommendations for greater public access to information but they stressed that the plan to introduce a privacy bill and to create a statutory press ombudsman and a Press Commission with powers to fine newspapers would be unwelcome and unworkable. Mr Clive Soley, the Labour MP whose private Freedom and Responsibility of the Press Bill returns to the Commons next month, broadly welcomed many of the proposals. But he criticised the report's failure to recommend a statutory press watchdog. 'We are in danger here of buying the press another round in the Last Chance Saloon,' he said. Sir Frank Rogers, chairman of the Newspapers Publishers Association and deputy chairman of The Telegraph group, said: 'They are suggesting the imposition of a statutory body extremely similar to the Calcutt report recommendations. It is an extraordinary document - diffuse and even incoherent.' Echoing a widespread criticism by the press of the proposed privacy bill, Sir Frank said: 'If a privacy bill can be constructed it will be extremely difficult to operate. It's impossible to create anything that would work. A lot of lawyers have tried and failed.' He stressed that the privacy bill was not the main bone of contention. 'The main issue is the statutory body,' he said. Ms Patsy Chapman, editor of the News of the World, said: 'It looks to me like layer upon layer of red tape. It doesn't give the industry any credit for having improved its procedure.' Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, the self-regulatory body, condemned the planned new body and said that the proposal for a privacy bill was unworkable. 'I am exceedingly shocked by the extent to which public business is being conducted by slovenly procedures,' said Lord McGregor, who claimed that the select committee's report had ignored the government's previous research on the newspaper industry. The report's proposal for a system of statutory fines drew criticism across the board, but plans to control press intrusion drew a more mixed response. Lord McGregor welcomed the proposal that reporters should identify themselves, and inform interviewees of their rights. But Mr Chris Davis, assistant editor of The Sun, said: 'It's basically the establishment and the MPs trying to look after themselves. We will continue to harass MPs for breakfast, lunch and dinner.'</p>

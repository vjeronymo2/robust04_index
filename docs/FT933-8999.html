			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Japan trade surplus up 28% as weak demand damps imports JAPAN'S trade surplus in July was Dollars 11.82bn (Pounds 8bn), 28 per cent higher than in the same month of 1992, reflecting the weak demand for imports from a still ailing domestic economy. The surplus has risen year-on-year for 31 consecutive months. However, the yen's strength is slowing export volume, which is up only 2.1 per cent. The surplus also appears to be near its peak, which would be welcomed by Japan's new coalition government. Japanese industry leaders expressed regret at the sharp appreciation yesterday of the yen, which closed in Tokyo at a record of Y103.77 to the dollar, compared with Y104.47 on Tuesday, and said the figure did not reflect the real health of the economy. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, the federation of economic organisations, said the yen had 'deviated from reality' and that the continuing appreciation had put great pressure on Japanese companies, which already face a fourth year of falling profits. Exports during July rose 9 per cent to Dollars 32.18bn, while imports grew by a slim 0.4 per cent to Dollars 20.37bn, although both figures reflected exchange rate movements. The finance ministry said the average yen value for exports in July was Y108.21 to the dollar, compared with Y125.57 a year earlier. The surplus with the US rose 22.7 per cent to Dollars 4.68bn, the 16th consecutive month of expansion, but Japan's surplus with the European Community fell 19.5 per cent to Dollars 2.01bn. Seasonally adjusted, the surplus rose from Dollars 8.64bn in June to Dollars 11.17bn last month. Trade with China continues to expand at a remarkable rate and after almost five years of deficit Japan now has a bilateral surplus. Exports to China rose 68.7 per cent to Dollars 1.77bn, while imports were 17.1 per cent higher at Dollars 1.6bn. Last September, Japan had a deficit for the month of Dollars 634m. Indicating the demand from an overheated Chinese economy, car exports rose five times, steel exports 167 per cent, and electric machinery 62 per cent. However, the figures hardly reflect the true growth of Japanese exports because they do not include goods shipped through Hong Kong.

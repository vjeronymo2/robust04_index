			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Council acquires listed hotel HIGH PEAK Borough Council in Derbyshire has bought the Georgian Grade I listed St Anne's Hotel, in Buxton Crescent, Buxton, and English Heritage is to provide Pounds 1m for roof and stonework repairs. The crescent was built between 1779 and 1789 for the fifth Duke of Devonshire, who intended its buildings to form a leisure complex and lodgings for a new spa which he hoped would rival Bath. St Anne's Hotel deteriorated over the years and was closed in 1989 because of breaches of hygiene regulations. The owners sold it, unable to afford the repairs. The structure continued to deteriorate further, and in 1990 gales badly damaged the roof. The National Heritage Memorial Fund has taken the unusual step of giving the council a grant to cover the hotel's Pounds 180,000 purchase price. The National Heritage Department said yesterday that this was in recognition of the importance of the building and to arrest its accelerating deterioration. Last December the National Heritage Department issued a notice demanding that Capitalrise, then the hotel's owner, carry out extensive repairs to the roof and masonry and eliminate wet and dry rot. In April the government served a compulsory purchase order on Capitalrise, on the grounds of 'lack of any significant progress'. It was thought to be the first time a CPO had been served by the secretary of state to protect a listed building, rather than by a local planning authority. A report recommending future uses for the building by English Heritage, the borough council and the county council, which owns the rest of the crescent, is now under consideration.</p>

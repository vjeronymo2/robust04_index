			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Philips says price of DCC tapes to match CDs PHILIPS, the Dutch group, and Polygram, the music recording company in which it owns a 79 per cent stake, yesterday announced the prices of digital compact cassette (DCC) tapes would be similar to the prices of compact discs currently being sold, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. Polygram also announced a list of musicians - featuring Bryan Adams, U2 and Fine Young Cannibals among the pop set, and Pavarotti and von Karajan from the classical world - whose music would be available on DCC when the system is launched in September. The company plans to have about 500 music titles ready when DCC systems become available. The pricing of pre-recorded music on the new digital cassettes has been an important issue in the industry and one which many observers believe will be a key factor determining the success of or failure of the DCC. If much of the pre-recorded music on DCC is priced at levels similar to the price of compact discs, they will be substantially higher than the price of analogue audio-cassettes, which they are intended to replace. In the UK, the current price of a hit album on compact discs, at Pounds 14.99 (Dollars 27.13) at leading retailers, has already attracted consumer criticism as being excessively high. It compares with a retail price of Pounds 8.99 for a hit album on analogue tape.</p>

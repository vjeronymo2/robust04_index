			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / GM alleges defamation by NBC in film of truck crash GENERAL MOTORS, facing accusations that it sold millions of pick-up trucks with faulty fuel tanks, hit back hard yesterday, defending the design of the vehicle and launching a defamation suit against NBC television. GM alleged that NBC's Dateline current affairs programme had broadcast film of a test crash of a GM pick-up, showing the vehicle bursting into flames, which had been rigged to give a 'grossly unfair and inaccurate' impression of the vehicle's safety. GM argued that this was part of an orchestrated campaign by lawyers who represent plaintiffs in product liability cases, and others, to create a 'poisoned climate' about the vehicles. The company's defamation suit - thought to be the first in GM's history - came four days after a jury in Atlanta, Georgia, found GM was negligent in the design of the pick-up trucks and awarded Dollars 105.2m (Pounds 69.6m) to the parents of a boy who died in a fiery crash at the wheel of the vehicle. Separately, federal regulators have launched an inquiry into the safety of the vehicles. They have the power to order a recall of the estimated 4.7m trucks on the road, which would be extremely costly for GM at time when the company is already financially stretched. The controversy centres on the fuel tank of the C/K pick-up truck, which in models built between 1973 and 1987 was located on the side of the vehicle, outside its main frame. Critics claim this makes the pick-up vulnerable to fire when hit on the side by another vehicle. GM yesterday produced statistics from crashes in six states which it claimed showed its pick-ups were no more vulnerable to fire than those manufactured by US rivals Ford and Chrysler, and that for all three the incidence of post-collision fires was low. The company held a lengthy news conference to reconstruct and denounce the NBC test. It said the TV company had failed to inform viewers that remote-controlled explosive devices were used to create a fire source during the test crash. It also argued the fire was probably fed by petrol spilling from an over-full fuel tank, with a badly-fitting non-standard cap, and not from a tank rupture. NBC said yesterday the programme was factual and accurate, though it would be broadcasting another this week telling viewers of the presence of 'sparking devices' during the test.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Taba talks make progress ISRAELI and Palestinian peace negotiators wound up their third round of talks yesterday after having made steady progress throughout the week on security issues. The Palestinian team yesterday said they wanted a police force of 25,000-30,000 equipped with machine guns, helicopters and armoured vehicles. Palestinian officials said there was broad agreement on the police force, but Israel wanted a smaller one equipped with less heavy weaponry. The police force would be divided into a general force for crime, and special forces for security, intelligence and anti-riot measures. The Palestinians have proposed a police training camp set up in Gaza in the coming weeks. 'By and large I think there is not a big problem on the question of a police force,' Mr Ahmed Khalidi, Palestinian delegate, said. Both sides have had preliminary talks on possible joint control or a joint presence at border crossings, especially at the Rafah crossing from Gaza to Egypt. If agreed, this would mark a considerable Israeli concession. Deeper splits have emerged about the jurisdiction of the Palestinian police force over Jewish settlers in the Gaza Strip, the right of Israeli police to pursue Palestinians, and the release of political prisoners. Some Palestinians have accused Israel of reneging on an agreement gradually to free most of the Palestinians held in Israeli jails, numbering up to 14,000. But Israeli officials said 'no more free gestures' would be made. They were expecting reciprocal gestures from the Palestinians, said to include a Palestinian call to suspend the Arab economic boycott against Israel and assurances that Palestinians who have allegedly collaborated with Israel would not be harmed once the Israeli army starts leaving Gaza and Jericho on December 13. Israelis and Palestinians at the talks, being held at the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba, have said that despite the differences there is a momentum, and both sides have praised each other's willingness to seek compromises. Next week, issues such as the transfer of power from the Israeli-run civil administration to Palestinian hands and the territorial definition of the Jericho area will be tackled. The first visit by a joint Israeli-Palestinian security team to Jericho and Gaza is due next week.</p>

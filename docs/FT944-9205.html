			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Most bourses higher anticipating US rate rise Most bourses advanced on the prospect of a US rate rise after Continental market hours. Zurich begged to differ, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT appeared to extend itself ahead of today's holiday, the Dax index closing the session 21.46 higher at 2,110.75 and creeping up further to 2,112.21 by the end of the post bourse. But, said Ms Barbara Altmann at B Metzler in Frankfurt, the market was more nervous than it looked. Turnover picked up to DM6.6bn, from DM4.4bn on Monday. The big gains were in banks, on an improving bond market and on the feeling that the sector had seen the worst of this year's bad news; and in carmakers, reflecting the limited recovery in the dollar and a degree of short-covering. Schering responded to good prospects for its BetaSeron multiple sclerosis drug, rising DM28 to DM995 by the end of the day; and Veba continued to respond to last week's progress report with a gain of DM7.50 at DM532.50. Underperformers included Volkswagen, relative to other carmakers, with a gain of DM3 at DM459 after recent outperformance; and Siemens, the only Dax stock to lose ground on the day, with a decline of DM1.70 to DM622.50. PARIS saw turnover increase to a more satisfactory FFr3.4bn as the CAC-40 index improved 13.45 to 1,954.53. Eurotunnel topped the list of most active stocks, with some 7m shares traded, and put on FFr1.35 or 6 per cent at FFr24.00. Brokers reported that most of the buying seemed to come from the domestic retail side with no substantial business from institutions. In contrast, Euro Disney was marked down 35 centimes or 3.6 per cent to FFr9.30 in strong volume of 1.6m shares as worries surfaced that it might be replaced as a constituent of the CAC-40 index by Renault. Among automotive stocks, Peugeot shrugged off domestic reports of a decline in quality control to close with a gain of FFr1 at FFr828. Michelin added 80 centimes at FFr216.80. Thomson-CSF rose 90 centimes to FFr154.90 as SGS-Thomson, the French-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, said that it would list 21m shares in Paris and New York in an initial public offering. Thomson-CSF indirectly holds 23.81 per cent of SGS-Thomson and will see its stake fall to around 20 per cent following the IPO, which will run from November 21 to December 8. LVMH advanced FFr15 to FFr863 following nine month sales figures released late on Monday. ZURICH was unable to make much progress as interest rate sensitive banks and insurers came under pressure, although Ciba's confirmation that it was seeking a minority stake in Chiron, the US biotechnology company, provided a focus. The SMI index picked up late in the day to finish 1.0 higher at 2,591.9 as some investors reflected that Sweden's vote in favour of EU membership, and expectations that Norway would follow suit on November 28, had turned a spotlight on Switzerland's increasing isolation within Europe. Ciba added SFr7 to SFr753 with some analysts arguing against a deal with Chiron, unless the Swiss group was assured of ultimate majority control. However, Mrs Birgit Kulhoff at UBS, who saw substantial benefits for Ciba from a link, noted that the companies had different corporate cultures and said it was important for Chiron's future success that it retained its own identity. Among the financials, CS Holding lost SFr12 to SFr558 and Swiss Re, which has risen by 40 per cent over the last two months, gave up SFr7 to SFr705 on profit-taking, with heavy selling by one private bank reported. Holderbank, on the upward path since its strong profits forecast 11 days ago, was a beneficiary of switching from the financials. The shares rose SFr14 to SFr1,049. AMSTERDAM made ground, a number of solid gains coming to notice as the AEX index rose 3.29 to 412.21. KPN, the telecommunications group, rose to a new year's high, adding 50 cents to Fl 55.80. The newly privatised group has benefited from broker's upgrades recently, and is seen to be one of the most attractively priced telecoms stocks in Europe. Futher strong support was seen for KNP BT, the paper and packaging company, up 70 cents to Fl 51.00 on expectations of good third quarter results, due on Friday. Hoare Govett was confident that the results would be positive, with operating profits expected to show a recovery in paper and graphic systems, but a decline in paper merchanting, office systems and packaging. Other good gains were seen in chemicals with Akzo Nobel and DSM putting on Fl 2.20 and Fl 2.30 respectively to Fl 201.20 and Fl 139.30. MILAN's attention turned back to politics with today's confidence vote on pension reform, and news that the unions had called a general strike for December 2 pulling prices back from early highs. The Comit index was 3.40 higher at 643.53 but the late weakness was reflected in an 11-point fall in the Mibtel index, to 10,253. Against the trend, RAS, the insurer, picked up L726 to L19,411 with some large buy orders noted ahead of the launch of its L2,300bn capital increase tomorow. MADRID said flatly that a 50 basis points Fed rate rise would justify yesterday's 3.51, or 1.2 per cent gain in the general index to 305.24; less than that, and the market would be vulnerable; more, and it might rise further. Block trades bloated turnover to Pta37bn. COPENHAGEN was higher for the fifth consecutive day with the advance supported by a firm bond market. The KFX index rose 1.27 to 95.24. Rising bond prices brought buyers back into bank stocks, which fell heavily last week. DUBLIN was depressed by the Irish political crisis following the government's handling of a child sex abuse case, the ISEQ overall index rose only 0.74 to 1,804.07. WARSAW duly dropped to a new 1994 low, its sixth successive decline taking the Wig index down 355.1, or 4.9 per cent to 6,880.8. The market was said to be flooded with sell offers, and turnover rose 42.4 per cent to 576bn zlotys.

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (9): New lease of life for mines After a decade in the doldrums, mining is set to play a substantially greater role in export and output growth than in the past 25 years, writes Tony Hawkins. Output volumes have barely changed since 1980. Chrome ore production has halved, copper volumes are down 70 per cent, asbestos down 38 per cent, tin down 30 per cent and nickel down 20 per cent. Only coal, up 68 per cent, and gold, up 62 per cent, have bucked the trend to the point where gold now accounts for some 45 per cent of total value. With ferrochrome output rising as world demand recovers and the impact of Russian exports is digested, and with gold production maintaining its uptrend, production volumes should regain their peak levels of the mid-1970s by 1996. Significant new capacity will come on stream in 1996-97 with the Dollars 225m Hartley Platinum mine being developed by BHP and Delta Gold of Australia, the development of a number of small and medium-scale diamond properties, a new copper mine and, very likely, a second major platinum producer, the Mimosa, currently being investigated by the new owners of Zimasco, one of the country's two large-scale ferrochrome manufacturers. Further down the line are two major methane gas projects and the possible expansion of nickel production. All of this sustains the view that resource- intensive, primary sector development is more likely to spearhead export growth in the late 1990s than labour- intensive manufactures.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Mitsubishi and Daimler extend co-operation Japan's Mitsubishi group and Daimler-Benz, the German motors and aerospace group, have reached agreements on various engineer exchange programmes, as well as on small-scale co-operation in fields including environmental preservation and telecommunications, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The agreements were announced in a joint statement issued by Daimler-Benz and four Mitsubishi companies - Mitsubishi Corp, Mitsubishi Electric, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Motors. Mitsubishi and Daimler-Benz officials met this week to discuss areas of business co-operation. They have met once or twice a year since 1990. In addition to various personnel exchanges, the statement reported three moderate co-operation agreements. 'There were no big joint projects announced this time. It's just that co-operation between the two companies is gradually building up,' an official of Mitsubishi Heavy said. Mitsubishi Heavy and Daimler agreed to exchange young engineers and managers in preparation for a future joint project. Daimler-Benz has been asking for joint development of aircraft, but Mitsubishi had called for engineer exchanges, Mitsubishi Heavy said. The three agreements include the establishment of a 50-50 joint venture between Mitsubishi and Daimler-Benz's wholly owned unit Daimler-Benz Inter-Services, to provide general information. The statement added that Mitsubishi Motors had agreed to start selling pick-up trucks in South Africa through Daimler's Mercedes-Benz South Africa unit by the end of October, six months ahead of schedule. Daimler-Benz and Mitsubishi Heavy also decided to continue joint research on the recycling of waste plastics. The two groups are to seek areas of co-operation in other parts of Asia.</p>

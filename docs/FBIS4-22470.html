			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Stanislav Terekhov by Nadezhda </F> Garifullina; place and date not given: "We Were Sentenced to  Death"]    [Text] A good deal has already been written and much  is known about the October tragedy, but still there are quite a  few blank spots. In particular, what actually happened on the  evening of 24 September next to the staff headquarters of the  CIS United Armed Forces? The only person who could shed light on  this is Colonel Stanislav Terekhov. But at that time he had been  arrested and was out of the game. But there were many versions  floating about: from accusations of terrorism--in the democratic  press--and provocations--alas, in certain patriotic  publications--to suggestions that he was captured when he left  the House of Soviets to see his family. In a word, everything is  covered by a shroud of mystery. Therefore when I went to see  Terekhov in his home the first thing I asked him to do was  clarify the incident on Leningrad Avenue.    [Terekhov] Then I shall begin "from the beginning." On 21  September at 2000, as soon as the coup d'etat had taken place,  quite different mechanisms from the ones that had been operating  theretofore were put in play. We understood quite well that the  presidential side should not wait until the House of Soviets had  been worn down by the blockade to such an extent that it would  have been possible to starve them out as the Tatars once  captured Russian fortresses. The blockade in the center of  Moscow could not last forever.    On 23 September several sources informed me that under the  leadership of Korzhakov and other figures who have armed state  structures, a "surprise" was being prepared for the opening of  the special Congress of People's Deputies. By that evening the  probability of a "surprise" was very great. It was necessary to  make a decision. I spoke with several of our leaders in the  Supreme Soviet: We must not remain passive because if we are we  will be swatted like flies.    X hour was approaching, there was no time left to verify and  verify again. The Congress was just about to open and then the  mechanism of provocation would go to work. I was faced with a  choice: Either hope for the best and not do anything, or....    [Garifullina] And you decided to act?    [Terekhov] I understood that in order to extricate ourselves  from the situation imposed on us with the fewest losses I had to  take responsibility for myself. I will not call this  self-sacrifice, but believe me I knew where I was going.  Speaking in military language, I decided to divert the enemy's  attention by conducting a secondary maneuver.    [Garifullina] In other words, you went to the staff  headquarters of the CIS United Armed Forces. But why did you  have to do this?    [Terekhov] Indeed, everyone was confused: Why? But if we  were  to take something it should be the staff headquarters--it is a  kilometer away from the House of Soviets. And the CIS staff  headquarters was absolutely abandoned, there were no weapons,  and no communications...of course, if you look at it seriously  it is insignificant, but it would do for a diversionary  maneuver....    The action I undertook made it possible--I am not speaking  about after-effects now--to introduce confusion into enemy  ranks. They are not about to storm the House of Soviets if there  is some kind of trouble in their rear, and they know nothing. In  brief, when they cannot understand the intention, the enemy  usually becomes stupid and begins to rush about. And, as a rule,  they postpone their basic operation. The maneuver succeeded; the  diversion of attention was significant, you know that. And at  that time I was shut off from all sources of information. But  you knew the reaction both from the other side and from the  leaders of the Supreme Soviet: They either pretended not to know  or really did not guess the true meaning of what was happening.  And those who wanted to clear themselves simply placed the  responsibility on me.    [Garifullina] And what role did Anpilov play in these  events?    [Terekhov] I want to say this right away and put a stop to  all the rumors that have been circulating since that evening: He  is not a provocateur, not a spy, and not a secret agent. Viktor  Anpilov as a public leader and the chief of his party has done  his job to the best of his abilities and opportunities. That is  a statement of fact. And the insinuations that are being spread  around him are on the conscience of those who did this.    [Garifullina] Stanislav Nikolayevich, on that evening  Anpilov  called for people to come to the headquarters of the CIS United  Armed Forces to help you. This is why passions have flared up  concerning him. Tell us, did you have a conversation with him  before your departure for Leningrad Avenue?    [Terekhov] The conversation occurred somewhere around 15 or  20 minutes before nine, about five minutes before I departed for  Leningrad Avenue. Incidentally, I did not inform him or the  others of the details; I told them briefly in two words: I am  going there, I am going to stir up a ruckus there, and you make  sure that the forces are drawn there...it was necessary to  convince the people, otherwise they simply would not have gone  there...the 150 or so men who arrived at the staff headquarters  made the operation a success. Those who did not want this began  to raise a ruckus around me and Anpilov. They said that this  action did much harm. Excuse me, but if what should have  happened on that evening in front of the House of Soviets had  actually happened, if we had not frustrated their plans, then  you would have had something to say about the actions of  Terekhov and Anpilov and those who were with us.    [Garifullina] Tell me, did you actually take the place over?    [Terekhov] We did not have to. I was blocking the  checkpoint,  where the soldiers were, in the first place, in order to prevent  people from getting into the staff headquarters. While I was  blocking it some pistols were taken from the soldiers. I was  blamed for this. But, please, why would I want to steal pistols  when I had an automatic and my people, the ones that were  providing the protection, were armed? They had nothing left to  do but look for formal indications of the commission of a crime.  First: resisting the militia. But, on the contrary, I wanted to  save the militia. And the person who fired at the militiaman did  that as a special case, I want to emphasize that. My order from  the very beginning was--do not shoot!    [Garifullina] Did you give the commands over a loudspeaker?    [Terekhov] No, it was night on a deserted street and you  could hear well, even witnesses have confirmed this. And  suddenly, during the course of the operation, in spite of my  command, a shot rang out...I was forced to remain there and make  sure nobody was wounded. Not a single bullet was fired at the  staff headquarters and not a single person went in there.  Therefore what kind of seizure could there be? In front of the  House of Soviets people were told to divert and shift the  attention of the opposing side.    [Garifullina] I want to clarify one more detail pertaining  to  Anpilov. Did you ask him to announce this operation at the rally?    [Terekhov] Yes, yes!    [Garifullina] Why am I asking you this? Viktor Ivanovich  told  me: "I promised Stanislav and I kept my word. If I had it to do  over again I would not have done it that way."    [Terekhov] He did what I told him to do. And I said that the  officers were conducting an operation on Leningrad Avenue and  they had to be supported. They went there and supported them,  and there would have been no casualties were it not for the  shooting that we did not start. And the bullet that hit the  elderly woman was fired after I had left in the crossfire  between the militia and someone else who appeared later. And  again the real murderer was not found! We were accused of theft,  bearing arms, resistance, and mass disorder, but nobody was  accused of murder. It is strange that the person who fired the  weapon was not found, just like the one who ran down Tolokneyev  on 1 May.    [Garifullina] Under what circumstances were you arrested?    [Terekhov] My arm was injured, the upper half of my shoulder  was paralyzed. Incidentally, I gave the command to leave weapons  on Khodynskoye Field, and I threw my automatic down there too  because I knew that if they saw me with an automatic within a  hundred meters they would shoot as though they were in the  middle of crossfire. Then when they were taking me around to all  the militia divisions and command headquarters they were  continuously, every five minutes, poking me with the muzzle of  their gun and saying: We are going to shoot you now. And I was  already helpless, in handcuffs.    [Garifullina] What was the most difficult thing for you  after  your arrest?    [Terekhov] A person can stand anything--beating, insults,  when they have you against the wall, on the floor, or wherever  they wish. After a certain amount of time the wounds heal, the  pain passes, and the organism restores itself. There are  nonphysical aspects-- betrayal, an extremely vulgar, brutish  attitude toward an officer-- this is the sort of thing that is  not forgotten.    After my arrest I was sent to the military command post. I  spent almost a day there. The next day the military investigator  from the military procuracy of the Moscow Military District  arrived--he was the chief of the investigation division, Colonel  Morin. I emphasize that he was a representative of the  procuracy! Incidentally he came with a representative of the  Main Military Procuracy. They came with a platoon of  special-purpose militiamen and representatives of the Ministry  of Internal Affairs and took me to the 109th Division. That I  will never forget!... They wanted to break my morale; they  probably thought that all it would take would be one stressful  blow and they could wind me around their finger. At 0300 in the  morning they were working me over with cross interrogation,  constantly bringing in militiamen from the division, who were  half drunk to boot. Chance helped to get me out of there alive.  I told them: I will testify only through my wife, after she  calls a lawyer. And I also told them directly if anything  happens to me that you have thought up, things will go badly for  you as well. I no longer had anything to lose. But they stopped  the physical torture. But they continuously threatened to shoot  me if I tried to escape...they brought me to the point where the  doctor insisted on immediate hospitalization. But the  investigator had received a categorical instruction--in no case  send him to the hospital. The vehicle with the special purpose  militia detachment was constantly at my side. They would take me  in the vehicle--there were five automatic riflemen with me, in  front--a car and behind--a bus. They took me to the doctor--also  surrounded by automatic riflemen, and I was in handcuffs, I  could barely stand on my feet, I could barely move...and that is  the way it was until they put me in the detention cell....    [Garifullina] Were you surprised that the army participated  in those events and on the side of the ones committing the coup  d'etat?    [Terekhov] That, of course, is the most difficult and bitter  question. It is difficult to accuse the entire army, although I  am not now inclined to defend the military. On the contrary!  Most of the officers in this conflict proved themselves to be  helpless and indifferent individuals. I do not want to  generalize, I am speaking only about those who looked on  apathetically at what was happening in the House of  Soviets...they all waited, quieted down, and continued as if  there were nothing for them to do. If the Supreme Soviet had won  they all would have shouted for joy, fired into the air,  saluted, and rushed back to their jobs. This is how morally  degraded our power structures are! I think we will have to work  very long and hard to make the sense of duty and honor  correspond to the ranks, shoulder boards, and positions....  Maybe it is not right to accuse those who were in the military  units. If the order had been clear and if they had done  preparatory work, what we could have hoped for! But they tell  us: You are the Union of Officers. Yes, we, the Union of  Officers, sent all of our forces there. But in the final  analysis we are a public organization, we do not train terrorist  groups, and we are not a state structure with weapons, vehicles,  and everything else. We express the position of a certain part  of the population. But there are people who, because of their  service duty, respond--the vice president, the chairman of the  Supreme Soviet, the power ministries....    But to reproach the officers we have left...our  officers--regardless of whether they were full time or  reserve--went and stayed until the end, they were the last to  leave, and all this was under gunfire.    [Garifullina] But why did we still suffer a defeat?    [Terekhov] You have touched upon what is really the most  painful and bitter subject. Believe me, in jail during those  sleepless nights I was tortured by the question of why all this  happened. And I will tell you frankly that this is the lesson I  learned. The high leaders, placed in an extreme situation,  should have thought everything through ahead of time and made  wise decisions...their passivity, their inactivity, and even  lack of talent with respect to many issues--I do not want to go  into this now--contributed to the defeat. I attended meetings of  the high leaders with the participation of Rutskoy, Makashov,  and Achalov, who were supposed to organize a powerful  resistance, which was the main thing at the time. The tasks were  set but as though for God himself: There was no mechanism for  specific people to carry out the orders. Even at that time I  understood that we were hostages. I circulated in the high  spheres and at the same time I had sources of information in the  lower structures. We found ourselves surrounded by flags and  sooner or later the shooting had to begin. And it began....    [Garifullina] The president is preparing a memorandum  concerning accord. There are also other forces that are calling  for us to reach out to one another--this is from the opposition.  How do you feel about these proposals?    [Terekhov] In principle it is natural to speak about accord  and civil peace. We too are in favor of this. The form in which  it is expressed and by whom are another matter. I personally do  not intend to sign any agreements with people who are criminals  and want to make me one. Second, and I want to emphasize this  especially: Some people want their hands untied so that they can  continue their shameless behavior, their unlawful and illegal  activity to plunder the country. And they will "push" for this,  tying the hands and feet of those who sign it. But let them sign  their own paper and swear that they will never again fire  weapons at the people, they will never again bring a tank out  into the square, let them admit to their own people that they  committed a crime and are prepared to take responsibility for  this under the law or at least agree to early elections. And  indicate this in a memorandum and then I will sign it....    [Garifullina] What are your immediate plans?    [Terekhov] On 18 April we held the all-Union congress of the  Union of Officers. Our telephone number is 257-01-68. Our  purpose is to evaluate the situation, draw lessons from the  October tragedy, and map out the future. We want to determine  what is left of us in this stage, which forces we have  preserved. As a public organization we are acting independently,  we were not, and now we certainly will not be and do not want to  be considered a military detachment of the CPSU, the Communist  Party of the Russian Federation, or any other, say, monarchist  or national party. The Union of Officers is strengthening its  roots, its foundations as military statesmen.    At the same time I have understood for a long time that it  is  not enough to conduct active political work within the framework  of the Union of Officers. We need a new independent political  structure. But we want to preserve the basic principles on which  the Union of Officers was built: These are statehood, great  power status, patriotism, honor, and dignity. These are the  precise goals a great-power party proclaims.    [Garifullina] Stanislav Nikolayevich, you spent a total of  157 days in Lefortovo and, without exaggeration, you looked  death in the face. This is true. Tell us, were you always  optimistic or did you despair and have a sense of hopelessness?    [Terekhov] Sometimes I had the feeling there was no way out.  I knew that I was threatened with more than one sentence. They  hit me with four charges, and two of them were serious,  including especially dangerous state crimes--15 years apiece. Of  all the people in jail nobody had more charges filed against  them than I did: four of them! I understood that they would want  to put me in jail, and that even if I beat my head against the  wall I would not get out of there. And I was seized by  hopelessness....    But I had confidence in the fact that this could not go on  forever. In any case, these people would not live forever.    [Garifullina] Did your family have a hard time without you?    [Terekhov] If I believed in anyone to the very end it was my  wife and family. I was simply moved by their moral  steadfastness. Larisa and I have three daughters: The eldest is  17, she is finishing school, and she intends to enter a legal  institute; the middle one is nine, and the youngest is a sixth  grader. I received this apartment through my job but on 23  September I was discharged from the army; they quickly  documented this with an order after the fact both from the  minister and the academy. They apparently thought that after a  person has been in jail he will not worry about violations with  his discharge. Now, naturally, I will be reinstated, and again  through the court. So, about my family. Larisa Aleksandrovna is  a great person. Not every woman is capable of going through what  she has been through. I have brought out in her capabilities  which even I did not suspect she had.    [Garifullina] Who do you consider to be your teachers?    [Terekhov] I have had many teachers; I consider them to be  the people who have gone through the school of life. I served in  Nerchinsk, where they exiled the Decembrists, in Chita,  Ulan-Ude, Krasnyy Chekoy, Sakhalin, and several places that are  not even on the map...there my teachers were the commanders with  whom I served. In recent years my teachers on the political  plane have been those who have been caught up in the overall  struggle. Some of them have strong points which I do not have. I  learn from them. From Zhirinovskiy I learned one thing; everyone  is learning from him now, incidentally. From Zyuganov--another  thing, from Baburin--a third thing, from Sterligov--a fourth  thing...these political figures have created themselves. How did  they do it? What is keeping them from becoming nationwide  leaders? In this sense I have no idol or guiding star.    In prison I had a chance to think about everything  unhurriedly, to sum up the past and think about the future if  such a possibility were to present itself. Fortunately, it did  present itself. I am back with my comrades again and life and  the struggle continue....</p>

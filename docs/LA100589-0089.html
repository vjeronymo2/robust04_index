			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: RIO HONDO;  </P> <P> COLLEGE TEACHERS AT IMPASSE IN CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS  </P> <P> Administrators and teachers at Rio Hondo College have reached an impasse in  their contract negotiations, mostly because of disagreements over salary, and  have requested that the state send in a mediator to help solve the differences.  </P> <P> The talks, which had been going on since last spring, are expected to resume  when a negotiator is assigned in two weeks. Meanwhile, the teachers are  continuing to work under the terms of their old three-year contract, which  expired in July.  </P> <P> Officials from both sides say they expect to solve the disagreements without a  strike.  </P> <P> "Things are extremely amicable right now," said college spokeswoman Pamela Cox,  adding that outside mediators often have been called upon to help solve  contract disputes.  </P> <P> The teachers are requesting an immediate 12% raise and an 18% salary increase  over the next two years. College administrators are offering an immediate 6.5%  increase and a 12% increase over the next two years.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PENTAGON WARNS OF A KREMLIN REVERSAL;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: DESPITE OPTIMISM OVER EAST BLOC CHANGES, THE JOINT CHIEFS URGE U.S. TO  STAY STRONG. NATO WOULD HAVE 70 DAYS WARNING OF ATTACK IN EUROPE, REPORT SAYS.  </P> <P> The Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff on Tuesday cautioned against too much  optimism about changes in the Soviet Bloc and called for the United States to  maintain a "hedge against a sudden reversal of events that could threaten the  interests of the United States."  </P> <P> In their annual "net assessment" of the relative military might of American  forces and their potential adversaries, the nation's senior military officers  conceded that sweeping changes throughout Eastern Europe would leave the  Soviets "primarily on their own in any theater offensive."  </P> <P> Already, the changes have given the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as many  as 70 days' warning of an impending Soviet attack on Western Europe, the  assessment said.  </P> <P> But the United States still must maintain the ability to "surge" production of  weapons, and the NATO alliance still must develop and field new nuclear weapons  for use in a war in Europe, concluded the report, much of which remains  classified.  </P> <P> House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) complained that the  classified portions were more optimistic than those made public.  </P> <P> He said that one of the classified report's most surprising findings indicates  that NATO could defend against a Soviet military lunge at Western Europe  without resorting to the use of nuclear weapons.  </P> <P> The Pentagon study was aired on Capitol Hill less than two weeks after William  H. Webster, director of the CIA, told Congress that changes in the Soviet Bloc  are virtually irreversible.  </P> <P> Webster's testimony has fueled calls on Capitol Hill for deeper and more rapid  defense cuts than those advocated by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.  </P> <P> Cheney has held to his position that the United States, faced with the prospect  of a reversal of Soviet reforms, must move slowly to scale back its military  spending.  </P> <P> Asked about the split in his Administration in a press conference Tuesday,  President Bush said, "I don't think anybody believes, including Cheney, that  the Soviet system is going to go back to where it was." At the same time, he  added, "we must retain a credible defense."  </P> <P> In an apparent effort to end the near-public dispute between Webster and  Cheney, Bush said, "I've talked to them now, and I feel that they are pretty  close together."  </P> <P> Lawmakers, responding to the Bush Administration's mixed messages on changes in  the Soviet Union, appeared uncertain of the report's significance.  </P> <P> "Your classified statement sounds a lot more like Webster; your public  statement sounds like Cheney," Aspin complained to Maj. Gen. John D. Robinson,  director of the study.  </P> <P> "I look at this net assessment, and I say we win!" Aspin said. "For the first  time in history, (somebody's) come up with an assessment on the NATO-Warsaw  Pact balance where we win."  </P> <P> However, Robinson said that the United States and its allies must continue to  modernize their short-range nuclear forces "while recognizing the political  sensitivity of land-based short-range nuclear forces."  </P> <P> Aspin also criticized the latest Pentagon assessment, completed in late  January, for not taking account of political and military changes that have  since tipped the balance further. As a result, he said, the 1991 defense budget  request is "clearly out of date."  </P> <P> In testimony before Aspin's committee, Robinson presented a picture of  remaining Soviet military capabilities as "still . . . formidable," in spite of  setbacks.  </P> <P> "Although unilateral force reductions have eroded their capability to conduct  successful, substantial conventional operations against NATO, significant force  advantages remain favoring the Soviets," Robinson said.  </P> <P> As the Pentagon unveiled its study, a bipartisan group of Washington military  experts called the proposed 1991 defense budget an "excessively cautious and  inordinately expensive response" to the rapidly diminishing Soviet threat.  </P> <P> The disintegration of the Warsaw Pact requires a restructuring of the U.S.  military, starting with a reasonable goal of a 50% reduction in defense  spending by the year 2000, said the group, led by Lawrence Korb, a Defense  Department official during the Reagan Administration.  </P></p>

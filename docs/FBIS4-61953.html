			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 ITAR-TASS -- The national press leads  with reports about the celebrations of Victory Day in Moscow and  other cities of the country.    The newspapers also highlight President Yeltsin's visit to  Germany which begins today. "Russia and Germany are entering a  new phase in relations," according to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. "No  Russian soldiers will remain stationed in Germany as of this  year. Their send-off will be an event of great importance both  for Germany and for Russia. The format of the ceremony will be  in the focus of talks between Yeltsin and Kohl. The Weimar  Syndrome, for which Russia is often being rebuked because of its  reluctance to agree to a farewell ceremony in the city of Goethe  and Schiller, is not likely to be broached during the talks,"  the newspaper says.    The newspaper predicts success to the Russian president's  visit and points out that even "the unpleasant point related to  restitution is unlikely to overcloud the talks".    PRAVDA ventures in this respect that "Kohl and Yeltsin  during  their meeting in Bonn are to take the final decision on the  ceremony of withdrawal of the Russian troops. Of course, the  United States, Britain and France are Germany's long-standing  NATO partners, who, following the blockade of 1948-1949 and the  building of the Berlin wall, became "Berlin's defenders" against  the communist menace". But the question now is about summing up  the final results of the war, in which these three powers were  Russia's allies, and not about Germany's gratitude to the  Americans and the British for the airlifts of food to West  Berlin".    As concerns the possible return to Germany of the collection  of the Gotha Library, PRAVDA says "the most important thing in  this respect is the creation of a precedent. It is not really  important what Russia is going to give away this time -- a royal  collection, a collection of paintings or the Kuril Islands. As  soon as precedent is there, new and unpredictable claims may  arise, just as several countries are already claiming the famous  "Schliemann's gold".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries a headline "Russian Have Armed  the Yemenis to the Teeth and Are Now Washing Their Hands" under  which it analyses the causes of the civil war in that country.  The hand of Moscow, or rather its absence, pushed Yemen to its  present political and economic crisis. When it abandon Yemen  after pumping hundreds of millions of dollars in it, the Kremlin  decided that Russia does not have any special interests in the  south Arabian Peninsula". The newspaper stresses that "it is  now clear that no peace can be established but through a  political dialogue. Even if the northerners capture the main  strategic targets, the southerners will probably retreat to the  desert or the mountains, and the war, judging from the country's  history, might continue for decades".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) comments on the same and adds  that  "unfortunately, there is little hope for a prompt ending to the  military actions". "Both the south and the north are swamped  with guns, which number at least 30 million pieces," the  newspaper says. "The heavy guns were delivered in plenty by the  former Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries. Both the  southerners and the northerners know how to use these guns as  may of them were trained in Russian military schools and  academies".    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries an analysis of the situation  before  the Russian-Chechen negotiations. According to Russian  Vice-Premier Sergey Shakhray, the negotiations will begin quite  soon. The delegation from the Russian Federation has worked out  a position of its own and is ready to get down to work,"  ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI announces.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA is critical of the past and the future of  privatisation in the country. "It is now obvious that not only  the disabled but also able-bodied Russians have a chance of  joining in the process of redistribution of property," the  newspaper writes. "The continuing impoverishment of the  population and the devaluation of labour in recent months have  finally undercut any possibility for wage-labourers to  participate in the division of property".    TRUD publishes an interview with State Duma deputies Mikhail  Mityukov and Vladimir Isakov about the law-making process in the  lower chamber of the Russian parliament.</p>

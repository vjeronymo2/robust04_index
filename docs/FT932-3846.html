			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness tremors Fortunes of Guinness shares see-sawed yesterday after LMVH, the French luxury products maker which has a 24 per cent cross-holding in the company, warned of lower first half profits. Guinness ended the day where it had begun - at 478p - although it lost 5 in early trading when one broker was said to have turned negative. Analysts decided not to alter forecasts for Guinness profits in spite of developments at LMVH and the stock rallied in a volume of 2m. One said that although the cross-share relationship would impact on Guinness, it would not be of crucial importance. One analyst said fears over the effect of falling champagne prices had caused concern about LMVH's contribution to Guinness but added that this alarm was largely misplaced. He believed the Guinness share price would drift between 450p and 500p.</p>

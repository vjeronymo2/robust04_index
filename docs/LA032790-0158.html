			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JEWELED EASTER EGG FOR SALE: $11.3 MILLION  </P> <P> Jewelers Kutchinsky, whose audacious creations are de rigueur in some jet set  circles, said today they have crafted the ultimate Easter egg.  </P> <P> The two-foot-high egg, made from 37 pounds of gold and studded with 20,000 pink  diamonds, will go on sale for $11.3 million.  </P> <P> "So far as we know, it is the biggest decorative egg of its kind in the world  and contains the largest single collection of rare pink diamonds in any one  piece," said designer Paul Kutchinsky.  </P> <P> The egg opens electronically to reveal a miniature library with cabinets and  books. A carousel then revolves to display a tiny portrait gallery where the  eventual owners could feature their family.  </P> <P> The egg will be unveiled on April 11, just before Easter, in London before  being shown in Tokyo and New York.  </P></p>

			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Markets: Buba leaves the Bank to juggle the rates - London Waiting for Buba is never one of the markets' favourite pastimes. The Bundesbank seems to enjoy dragging out the suspense of an interest rate shift, springing it on the markets when their attention is elsewhere and conditions for a change appear to have gone. Finally on Thursday, a wearisome 118 days since its last rate cut, the German central bank dropped its discount rate by half a percentage point to 5 1/4 per cent. Markets across Europe rose on hopes of further reductions by their own monetary authorities but the enthusiasm quickly wore off. London equity and gilt markets, roused by apparently weak UK economic data earlier in the week, added the Bundesbank's action to their list of reasons why the UK government and Bank of England should ease interest rates again. But by the end of the week the arguments were less persuasive. Moreover, inflation jitters in the US upset bond markets there, with a knock-on effect on UK gilts and equities. The FT-SE 100 index struggled to end the week up a net 3.7 points at 3,382.6. On Tuesday, the Footsie had reversed a four-day, 76-point slide and gained ground on news that manufacturing output had slipped in December and that the Central Statistical Office had cut its trend growth rate for manufacturing to 1 per cent from 1.5 per cent. The mood was reinforced the next day by a weak rise in the retail price index and an unexpected 15,500 rise in unemployment after four months of falls. The trouble is that these statistics suffered from weather, public holidays and other seasonal adjustment problems. If the Bank of England was less willing than the government to make the recent UK base rate cut - hence a compromise reduction of a quarter of a percentage point - then this week's data would not have changed its mind much. The Bank is having to juggle a number of considerations revolving around sterling's recent weakness, external trade trends and demand for gilts at up-coming auctions. The auction next week is small but foreign investors are a little jittery about gilts after the market turmoil of the past fortnight. Although the superior yield of gilts over German bonds had recovered somewhat from its low point in late January, it has eroded again in recent days, as the chart shows. Although another UK cut soon might be justified by domestic economic considerations, external factors are weighing against it. Such an argument was used by Nick Knight, Nomura's high-profile market strategist, when he unsettled the equity market on Thursday with his advice to sell into any strength equities exhibit. From the man who made his name as a raging bull when Britain left the ERM, his talk of adverse trends on inflation, the trade deficit, sterling and interest rates was pretty bearish. Most institutional investors will take more persuading about the risks of equities at these levels before they act decisively on such advice. But they are already backing off from putting more money into the market. The latest Smith New Court monthly survey of fund managers' intentions found that cash had a growing attraction to them. For the first time since the survey began in 1990, more of them planned to increase their cash balances than reduce them. UK investors are still troubled by the aftermath of the Federal Reserve's raising of US interest rates and the recent reduction by UK authorities. US investors, despite being unsettled in the last couple of days, appear to have adjusted more rapidly to the changed environment. Since the Fed tightened, equities have clocked up a negative return of less than 2 per cent in the US but more than 3 per cent in the UK. Likewise, the bond return is less than a negative 1 per cent in the US but more than a negative 1 per cent in the UK, points out Goldman Sachs' London strategists Sushil Wadhwani and Musthtaq Shah. 'The on-going correction is unlikely to be very large', not more than 5 per cent, and the outlook six to 12 months ahead 'is good', they believe. Analysing the last four occasions on which US interest rates had bottomed out in the past 22 years, they found that the total return on UK equities was an average of 17.49 per cent for the subsequent six months. They offer four main arguments for equities: they are still under-valued relative to short-term interest rates; they typically outperform bonds when earnings growth is expected to be above-average; US retail investors should continue to increase their equity holdings since interest rates are still relatively low; European rates are still coming down and retail investors are still underweight in equities. One big test of their argument begins in earnest this coming week as the reporting season picks up speed. Earnings and dividend growth has indeed been strong among the early reporters to-date such as Reuters, Lloyds and Glaxo. But sparkling performances are expected from big international companies such as Glaxo and Reuters, thanks in part to currency factors. The more telling performances will come from among the vast swathe of smaller, more UK-oriented companies. The sorriest corporate story of the week was Tiphook. It has sold at last its container business but only for Pounds 734m, leaving it with a trailer rental business carrying Pounds 160m of equipment purchase commitments for which it has no finance, Pounds 500m of existing debt and shareholders' funds of Pounds 40m. One man gambling on its recovery is Robert Montague, chief executive. To sweeten a cut in his base pay from Pounds 816,000 a year to a mere Pounds 200,000, he was given options on 2m shares at 20p, 500,000 at 65p and a bonus of 1 per cent of pre-tax profits. But investors watching for Montague's trailer to come in, loaded high, will have a far more excruciating wait than anybody has ever had for the Bundesbank.</p>

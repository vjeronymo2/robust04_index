			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At the Japan-U.S. summit talks slated to be held on  11 February in Washington, President Clinton will ask Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa to buy U.S. rice to cover from 60 to  70 percent of the minimum access of rice which will come into  effect from next year. This was disclosed by a government  source on 8 January. It will be the first time for the leaders  of both countries to actually talk about the rice issue at  summit talks. It seems the U.S. Government will strengthen its  pressure on Japan regarding the rice measures in the future.    According to sources concerned, President Clinton will  likely  make the request unofficially. It seems that following the  conclusion of the new multilateral trade negotiations (Uruguay  Round) of GATT, "the United States aims to secure and expand its  rice export share before Japan actually decides from which  countries it will import rice" (according to the government  source).    The new round of negotiations over the rice issue decided --  as an exception to an introduction of a comprehensive tariff,  designed to replace all import regulations with a tariff -- to  adopt "special measures" for expansion of the minimum access  instead of shelving the tariffication for six years. Through  the minimum access, Japan will import about 400,000 tons of rice  for domestic consumption in 1995. It will eventually be  increased to about 800,000 tons.    Japan still has not decided which countries it is going to  import rice from for the minimum access. However, some people  are saying, from the viewpoint of protecting rice farmers, that  "the government should import rice for production of rice cakes  and other processed food" (according to Kozo Watanabe,  representative secretary of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]).  So far this is the strongest demand. Many people are saying  that priority should be given to the idea of buying rice from  Thailand instead of from the United States which is working on  producing short-grain rice (called Japonica rice) for direct  consumption as staple food.    Moreover, the rice produced in the United States is more  expensive than Thai rice, which is used in setting the price  index in the rice trade market. It is also true that China and  Vietnam are exerting efforts to produce high-quality Japonica  rice.    Because of this, many people think that "American rice,  which  will have a major impact on Japan's rice production, will not be  imported much even after Japan's rice market is liberalized."  This was a prevailing view even before the decision on the rice  issue was made.    Under such circumstances, the Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry, and Fisheries is maintaining a negative stance about  accepting U.S. requests. But political decisions are more  important than economic principles as far as negotiations over  the rice issue are concerned. Therefore, some government  officials are saying that "the United States started to control  our rice policy at the moment when we rejected immediate  tariffication and accepted the partial liberalization,"  (according to the government source). Japan has no choice but  to make a decision on the issue of rice imports within the scope  of overall Japan-U.S. relations. It seems that Japan will  constantly import a certain volume of U.S. rice by eventually  accepting the President's request.</p>

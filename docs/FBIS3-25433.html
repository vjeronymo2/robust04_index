			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edmundo Galiza Matos] </F>   [Excerpt] The Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo], the  government, and the United Nations have concluded that there is  no evidence of General Peace Accord violations. Renamo's  Lieutenant General Mateus Ngonhamo's accusations that General  Eduardo da Silva Nihia was training men to fight Renamo after  elections have been denied by General Raul Dique, head of the  Renamo team to the Cease-Fire Commission [CCF]. Let us listen  to an excerpt of the interview I had with him at the Military  Club in Maputo this morning.    [Begin recording] [Matos] What are the findings at this  stage?    [Dique] The (?commission) [words indistinct] men being  trained to fight Renamo after elections. At this stage, men are  assembled...    [Matos] Lt. Gen. Mr. Ngonhamo said that Mr. Nihia was  training men to fight Renamo to disrupt elections. Is that  (?true)?    [Dique] Well, the truth is that people were found, and at  the  time they were not undergoing training. Obviously, if they had  been undergoing training previously, once everything was brought  to the press it was easy to stop the whole thing.    [Matos] What does Renamo think? After this report by the  commission that has gone to investigate the matter, does it  think that men were being trained to fight Renamo (?after) the  election?    [Dique] Well, when the investigating team got to the area,  it  did not see any men undergoing training. There is no  confirmation that men had been trained there before. That side  of things was not investigated.    [Matos] What is Renamo's opinion now?    [Dique] Renamo's opinion is that training is not happening  any more. People (?are being) moved now to assembly areas.    [Matos] Is Renamo satisfied with those results?    [Dique] Renamo is satisfied because it was disappointed with  the confinement of the forces and its conclusions are that,  under the control of the regional CCF team, all forces that are  assembled in that area [words indistinct] satisfied.    [Matos] Kindly tell me something, Gen. Dique: The problem  that Lt. Gen. Ngonhamo raised, and his accusations in regard to  Mr. Nihia, are now a thing of the past? The matter has been  clarified?    [Dique] It has been clarified now because those forces will  be removed from that area and there will be no problems. [end  recording] [passage omitted]</p>

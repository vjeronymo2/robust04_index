			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INS HEEDS FAMILY PLEA, LETS NANNY HERO RETURN;  </P> <P> IMMIGRATION: PARENTS WIN BATTLE FOR ILLEGAL ALIEN WHO HELPED WHEN CHILD SHE  CARED FOR WAS KIDNAPED. THE GOVERNMENT GRANTED THE WOMAN A SPECIAL  DISPENSATION.  </P> <P> Five years ago, Hirlanda Ramirez trembled as she slipped across the U.S. border  crossing at El Paso, undetected by busy immigration officers. On Sunday, she  returned to Los Angeles -- legally -- and was welcomed by the U.S. government  as a heroine.  </P> <P> Ramirez, 33, who is from Guatemala and works as a nanny to a Pacific Palisades  4-year-old, played a key role in helping the family and authorities when the  girl was kidnaped briefly in 1987. Ramirez served as the main witness in the  case even though she risked deportation.  </P> <P> Her grace under pressure, as well as her strong bond with the precocious  strawberry-blonde child, so impressed authorities that the federal government  granted Ramirez a rare dispensation, allowing her to return to the United  States and become a legal resident.  </P> <P> The same moxie that initially brought Ramirez to the United States catapulted  her into a role during the family's ordeal. She provided the family with moral  support and cooperated with police and prosecutors in the case.  </P> <P> But when she left for Guatemala three months ago, Ramirez and the family were  uncertain whether they would ever see each other again.  </P> <P> The family, which asked not to be identified, felt so strongly that Ramirez  "deserved a break" after her "exceptional" conduct, that they began lobbying  the federal government on her behalf, persevering for the better part of a  year.  </P> <P> On Monday, Ramirez arrived at the family's sprawling, ranch-style home with a  special "humanitarian parole" permit in her purse.  </P> <P> As Ramirez approached the home, the little girl darted across the driveway and  flew into her arms. "I missed you," she told Ramirez. "I love you."  </P> <P> For the Guatemalan nanny it was a bittersweet homecoming. Her own children --  two boys ages 8 and 5, were left behind.  </P> <P> Those who know Ramirez, both in the United States and Guatemala, describe her  as a woman of rare character and strength. Her courage has seldom failed her.  </P> <P> Abandoned by her husband in Guatemala when she was pregnant with their second  child, Ramirez was unable to support herself and her children with her factory  job.  </P> <P> She debated coming to the United States and leaving her children. "I cried and  cried . . .," she recalled. "Then one day I said, 'Either I do something or I  die of hunger with my children.' "  </P> <P> She said she spent her first year in Los Angeles crying over her children's  absence, but has never regretted her decision. The money she sends home from  her earnings here enables her children to eat well. She regularly sends them  new clothing and pays to send her eldest son to a private school. "Now they  have a future," she said.  </P> <P> Ramirez and the family she works for say they consider themselves fortunate for  having met. The family lauds Ramirez as an exceptional woman of great warmth  and strength. Ramirez said they make her feel like part of the family.  </P> <P> "The love I can't give my own children, I give to her," said Ramirez, rocking  her young ward on her lap. And the feeling is mutual.  </P> <P> During Ramirez's three-month absence, the little girl often asked about her and  kept a snapshot of the two of them taped to her bedroom wall, amid her dolls  and stuffed animals.  </P> <P> She does not remember the kidnaping that occurred a block from her home three  years ago, and her parents want to keep it that way. She was only 14 months old  at the time.  </P> <P> Ramirez was pushing the infant in a stroller in the middle of the afternoon  when a masked man suddenly pulled up in a car. Flashing a gun, he grabbed the  child and sped off, leaving a ransom note behind.  </P> <P> After spending the "worst night of our lives," the anguished parents were  informed the next morning that their child had been found wandering unharmed in  a park. She had not been hurt or molested, said the girl's father, a  radiologist.  </P> <P> Her abductor had apparently kept her tied overnight to a tree in the Santa  Monica Mountains, but had released her while he headed to pick up the ransom  money. Police were waiting for him at the pickup spot.  </P> <P> From the moment the kidnaping occurred, Ramirez never hesitated. She ran to a  neighbor's home to call police and then cooperated fully during several hours  of questioning.  </P> <P> "A lesser person would have run away," said the girl's father. "She proved  herself under fire."  </P> <P> Ramirez was just as cooperative with the Los Angeles County district attorney's  office and, as the only realiable eyewitness in the case, her testimony was  critical during the trial. The result was a life sentence for Mark Faulkner,  then a 21-year-old San Fernando resident.  </P> <P> "I didn't care if I got deported. What mattered to me was that the girl be  recovered as quickly as possible," Ramirez said. "And if I hadn't testified, he  might have done it again and again."  </P> <P> The girl's father said that "it was a pretty open and shut case." Winding his  way through the federal bureaucracy in search of clemency for Ramirez was a  greater challenge.  </P> <P> With guidance from an immigration lawyer, the girl's father was able to gain  needed labor certification, through the U.S. Department of Labor, after  demonstrating that the family was unable to find a U.S. citizen or legal  resident willing and qualified to take her job. The family then petitioned for  an immigrant visa on Ramirez's behalf. Although it was approved, it normally  takes about three years for it to be granted.  </P> <P> When Ramirez got word that one of her own children had fallen ill last fall,  she flew back to Guatemala. Once outside the country, she had no legal basis  for returning.  </P> <P> It was then that the girl's father began a letter-writing and telephone  campaign with immigration officials in Washington, asking that Ramirez be  granted special "parole" status, allowing her to return to the country  immediately.  </P> <P> Not only was Ramirez important to his child's well-being, the father argued,  "she deserved a break."  </P> <P> "She did something that a lot of American citizens would not have done," he  said.  </P> <P> He felt so confident that justice was on his side that he wanted to test the  system, he said. "I felt that if I'd ever been right in anything, I was right  in this case. And I believed the system could respond."  </P> <P> He had heard less than glowing reports about the U.S. Immigration and  Naturalization Service, often labeled one of the least efficient federal  government agencies. To his surprise, however, he said he found that the INS  had a heart. "They're tough, but there is compassion there," he said.  </P> <P> His perseverance and the compelling nature of the case won out.  </P> <P> National INS Commissioner Gene McNary, who approved the parole petition based  on humanitarian grounds, called it "a close call."  </P> <P> "We do not want to appear to condone the practice of hiring illegal aliens as  maids or nannies," he said, and added that the child's well-being was what  persuaded the INS to grant the parole. The INS receives about 4,000 such  petitions a year and approves only about one-fifth of them, according to an INS  spokesman.  </P></p>

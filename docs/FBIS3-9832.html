			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "rb": "The Army's Wretchedness and Glory; </F> Association of Slovak Soldiers With the Left at the Ministry of  Defense"]    [Text] Bratislava--The appointment of a civilian as  minister of defense means the realization by the Ministry of  Defense of the Slovak Republic of the management model advocated  by the Association of Slovak Soldiers [ASV] since its founding,  ASV Chairman Lieutenant Colonel Milan Stegena said yesterday.  Although this appointment ensures civilian control over the  Army, this control remains insufficient, according to the ASV.  It therefore proposes the adoption of a law on the control of  the Army by the National Council of the Slovak Republic. The  ASV regards as equally important the establishment of a defense  committee in the parliament.    In view of the political affiliation of Defense Minister  Pavol Kanis, the ASV chairman expressed fear of a possible  perpetuation of the left-wing profile of the Army of the Slovak  Republic. "Left-wing forces are forming groups [grupuju sa] at  the Ministry of Defense. I would cite the example of Professor  Bartak," he said. Referring to the unsatisfactory model of  management relations within the department of the Ministry of  Defense of the Slovak Republic, he said that the  military-political and executive components of the Army have not  been consistently separated to this day. There are frequent  clashes of power between the Ministry of Defense [in Bratislava]  and the Command of the Army of the Slovak Republic [in Trencin].  The ASV does not want to subject the new leadership of the  Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic to criticism during  its first 100 days in office. This period will show whether  visible positive changes will occur within the department.</p>

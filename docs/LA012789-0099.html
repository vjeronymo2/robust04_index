			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT : 'SHE'S A WHORE' AT THEATRE ON EDGE; ITCHEY FOOT'S 'NOT LEWIS  CARROLL'; 'LADY FROM THE SEA' AT FOUNTAIN THEATRE; 'FALSE TEETH' AT EAST WEST  </P> <P> "Tis Pity She's a Whore,' John Ford's Jacobean tragedy of incest, revenge and  blasted souls, is rarely staged, with good reason. Its excesses are relentless.  But a new company, Theatre on the Edge, has reshaped the drama into a rock  musical at the Olio Theatre that is notable for its brash fury.  </P> <P> Director Robert A. Prior's adaptation takes the bloody text by Ford  (1586-1640), and unleashes it into an orbit full of amusing anachronisms. The  costumes by Barbara Cox are Renaissance-by-way-of-Frederick's of Hollywood. The  jaded party scenes and the horrid wedding party suggest "La Dolce Vita." The  duels and gore are Shakespearean. Twice a dagger sailed off the stage and under  this reviewer's seat.  </P> <P> The story is about an aristocratic brother and sister (played with a nice  purity of feeling by Gregg Rainwater and Manjit Kapany) who are passionately in  love. Events compel the sister to marry a temperamental nobleman (a dashing,  reckless Dane Christopher), but not before she has already conceived a child  with her brother.  </P> <P> Subplots spiral, led by Chris Spitler's scabrous, leather-clad bodyguard (and  the show's outstanding rocker) and Erin Connelly's vicious widow.  </P> <P> The Gothic dynamics of the production are propelled by the alternately  urgent/dreamy score by composer Andrew Yeater. The percussive music is live,  electronic and synthesized from Yeater's perch high above the stage.  </P> <P> The result, despite the need to trim more material, is surprisingly raucous and  viscerally compelling.  </P> <P> An opening 20-minute work, "The Vision of Eros," directed by Erin Connelly,  transforms 11 of Shakespeare's sonnets into dance imagery, performed by the  same company. It's superfluous, though, to the evening of lust ahead.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Am Not Lewis Carroll'  </P> <P> A semi-formal evening with the author of "Alice in Wonderland" becomes a  beguiling adventure at the Itchey Foot Cabaret.  </P> <P> Actor Dan Bredemann, with an eagerness and fussiness that is endearing, creates  a warm and alternately anxious vision of Oxford professor Charles Lutwidge  Dodgson (a.k.a. Lewis Carroll).  </P> <P> The one-man show, directed by Alan Weitzman, is a dimensional re-creation of a  celebrated children's author whom most of us know only as a strange, shy,  wondrous storyteller with a fixation on pre-pubescent girls.  </P> <P> Here, in material Bredemann based on Dodgson's books and countless personal  letters, we see the man's vulnerability, his enthrallment with the real-life  Alice, and catch a glimmer of the wand he waved over the rabbit hole.  </P> <P> A camera on a tripod is a major image. Carroll's photographs of little girls is  never depicted as anything less than genuine love, and Bredemann's portrayal is  devoid of any suggestion of pedophilia. When Dodgson delights over a little  girl's "flounced, buttoned, frilly dress," it's pure as the driven snow. Little  boys, however, in a revealing flashback, are sticks and stones. The adult  Dodgson is haunted by a nasty trick played on him in boarding school by cruel  schoolmates.  </P> <P> Dodgson, who would often deny he was Lewis Carroll (hence the title "I Am Not  Lewis Carroll"), is introduced as an inventive young man of 33 cleverly  entertaining a child in his Oxford study. We see him 14 years later, after his  success with his "Alice" books, vaguely uncomfortable with the adult world  while dwelling (at unnecessary length) on his not altogether blissful  friendship with the famous 19th-Century British actress Ellen Terry.  </P> <P> Bredemann, who looks like Oscar Wilde, at times seems too robust for the role.  Nevertheless, fragility and eccentricity illuminate the interpretation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'The Lady From the Sea'  </P> <P> Non-traditional casting in the major female role lights up Henrik Ibsen's  psychological study of a woman's quest for freedom of choice in the tender "The  Lady From the Sea" (1888).  </P> <P> Jeanne Sakata's Asian Norwegian strongly serves the cause of colorblind casting  as Sakata impressively dramatizes the quiet determination of a wife drawn to a  mesmerizing sailor from the sea.  </P> <P> Director Meg Kruszewska's production at the Fountain Theatre is polished,  blending softly the requisite mystery and flecks of humor in a thematic work  that echoes "A Doll's House" and anticipates Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler."  </P> <P> Set in an upper-middle-class ocean-side retreat, Ibsen's play of feminine Angst  rings with contemporaneity. The production swerves straight to the issue: When  the possessive, incredulous husband here -- nicely played by Mark Ringer --  finally does release his wife to the stranger from the sea she reclaims her  integrity and the power and responsibility to choose.  </P> <P> The gawky, invalid suitor is touchingly, lovingly rendered by Sanford Clark.  Timm Ottman's shadowy sailor, Brynn Baron's older sister, and Patrick Rowe's  family guest all enjoy texture. And the mood is bolstered by Natasha Beyeler's  costumes and Ken Booth's lighting scheme.  </P> <P> What seriously flaws the show is the miscasting and the curiously poor  direction of Kate Asner as the family's younger daughter. She is unremittingly  screechy and much too teen-age American to be in the least convincing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Laughter and False Teeth'  </P> <P> Playwright Hiroshi Kashiwagi and director Robert Ito spent part of their youths  interned in Japanese-American relocation camps during World War II. So it is a  curiosity that "Laughter and False Teeth" at East West Players is a comedy, and  not a very dark one at that. (It, incidentally, coincides with the resignation  of Mako as East West's artistic director).  </P> <P> The production is directed with verve, but its failure to touch on racial  prejudice or even convey a sense of an internment camp blunts its purpose. The  plot, which depicts people resourcefully overcoming oppression, centers on a  winsome but toothless madam and the men eager to supply her with false teeth.  </P> <P> The strategy here recalls the internment camp variety show in the 1985 East  West Players production of "Christmas in Camp II," but without any sense of  captivity.  </P> <P> The play was written in 1954 and rarely staged. Some Japanese-Americans have  been sensitive to its humorous portrayal of camp.  </P> <P> Set against a painted background of mountain peaks, the production features a  kimono-clad chorus and Brechtian elements mixed with realism. Yoshio Be  Moriwaki's disconsolate boiler man and Fei-Ru's deranged mother are the only  characters in the 12-member cast who act like they're incarcerated.  </P> <P> The show is stylistically too busy to develop its one provocative theme: a  conflict between a dentist (Zar Acayan) gung-ho to fight for Uncle Sam and his  lab assistant Tojo (Ken Katsumoto), fiercely loyal to the Japanese emperor.  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Observer: Don't be vague Chris Greig, managing director of Scotch whisky producer Invergordon, remains cagey about the future now that his company has been all but swallowed up by Whyte &amp; Mackay. Yesterday worth Pounds 12.6m, at least on paper, Greig may decide to put his feet up and devote more time to farm management. But should he tire of such diversions, the 59-year-old may wish to contemplate the exciting post-retirement life of a former boss. After gaining his PhD in chemistry from the University of London, Greig's first job was in the research and development division of the Distillers Company, working for Magnus Pyke. The mad scientist whose desperate handwaving earned him the sobriquet of the human windmill was, between 1955 and 1973, in the more sober employ of the Glenochil Research Station in Clackmannanshire. It was not until turning 67 that the retired food scientist won the Pye award for the best newcomer to television.</p>

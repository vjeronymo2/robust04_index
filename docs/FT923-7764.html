			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation news drives equities higher WHAT BEGAN as another unimpressive session on the London stock market yesterday took a decided turn for the better after good news on inflation in Germany and the UK drove share prices sharply higher. Although traders warned that the advance was led by the futures and involved a good deal of hasty activity by marketmakers caught on the wrong foot, the gain of 38.8 on the FT-SE index was the best performance since the end of last month. The final reading put the Footsie at 2,356.8, contrasting sharply with earlier readings which saw the index down to the 2,311 area. The turn came, quite clearly, when the German Federal Statistics Office sent stock markets ahead across Europe with the news that retail sales had fallen by a real 6 per cent, nominal 2.6 per cent, in June. Almost simultaneously came the disclosure that the UK retail price index had gained at an annualised rate of only 3.7 per cent last month, significantly better than forecasts in the City of London, which had ranged to 4.2 per cent. The change of tone was first reflected in the stock index futures market, and soon brought widespread gains among the interest-related stocks. There were gains in the construction and building sectors which have suffered severely from the pressures over interest rates, which had been renewed this week when mortgage rates came into question again. Also very firm were the retail and store stocks which have been depressed by the collapse in consumer spending that has been blamed on high interest rates. At the same time, firmness in the dollar boosted the big overseas earning stocks. However, market strategists were cautious of sounding too optimistic in the wake of yesterday's unexpected gain in the stock market. Share prices were driven ahead by a shortage of stock, and marketmakers, taken aback by the suddenness of the upturn, found themselves forced to bid for shares in markets which have become extremely thin and difficult to trade. Seaq volume of 449.7m shares compared favourably with the 441.3m of the previous session. Thursday's retail, or customer, business was worth only Pounds 816.9m, less than satisfactory for marketmakers. However, Sharelink, the execution-only broker, said that private investors had been heavy buyers of UK stocks this week. Retail business in equities has remained poor, and below last year's daily average levels, inflated by trading programmes by securities houses.</p>

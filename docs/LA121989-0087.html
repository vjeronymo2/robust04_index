			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO WEIGH NIGHTCLUB PERMIT  </P> <P> Live entertainment at the Purple Heart Saloon may come to an end when the City  Council tonight considers whether to grant an extension of the nightclub's  entertainment permit.  </P> <P> Because of "noise complaints and disturbances . . . far outweighing those of  other establishments where alcoholic beverages are served," the city staff has  recommended against extending the permit.  </P> <P> The owner of Purple Heart Saloon, Kenneth L. Hermon, has requested a permit for  disc jockeys and live bands to perform on Friday and Saturday nights from 8  p.m. to 1 a.m. The permit would also allow performances for special events,  including a New Years' Eve party, a post-Super Bowl party and wedding  receptions.  </P> <P> Residents who live near the saloon at 534 S. Brea Blvd. have complained that  patrons leave broken bottles and other litter in the area, and sometimes  urinate near homes.  </P> <P> Dan and Linda Kelly, who have led the neighborhood protest against the night  club, have complained to the City Council about loud music playing at 1:30 a.m.  and fighting in the alley between the saloon and their home.  </P></p>

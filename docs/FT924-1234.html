			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Brussels set to restrict ice cream makers THE European Commission is set to impose restrictions on German ice cream makers accused of trying to exclude Mars, the US group, from the German market. Officials yesterday refused to elaborate on the likely action against manufacturers, which will be announced next Wednesday, and would not name the companies involved. Brussels issued a temporary order in March that ties between German retailers and manufacturers should be cut to allow Mars to compete during the summer. That decision may be converted into a definitive ruling next week. The Commission has been investigating complaints by Mars that Langnese-Iglo, a subsidiary of Unilever, and Scholler, another big manufacturer, were excluding competitors from retail outlets.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Papers highlight McCain divisions TOP management at McCain Foods, the international frozen-foods group owned by Canada's McCain family, is riven with discord, according to documents filed in a New Brunswick court yesterday. The documents were submitted by Mr Wallace McCain, joint chief executive, in support of his efforts to overturn a resolution by McCain's board last month to oust him as president and chief executive by September 30. The court is due to hear Mr McCain's application later this month. Mr McCain's action is directed primarily against his older brother and co-CEO, Harrison, whom he alleges has persistently undermined a plan put in place two years ago to provide for an orderly succession at the top of the company. Both McCains are in their mid-60s. Two other brothers have died, but several of the four men's sons are also active in the business. Wallace's son Michael runs McCain's US subsidiary. Until the dispute surfaced. Michael was widely assumed to be a front-runner for the CEO job when his father and uncle step down. McCain, with sales of about CDollars 3bn (USDollars 2.2bn), is the world's largest potato-chip producer, with 20 factories in North America, Europe and Australia. Other products include frozen juices and pizzas. McCain's business has prospered even during the recession. But the documents filed yesterday show that the family has become increasingly pre-occupied in recent years with the succession issue. Harrison wrote to one of his nephews last September that, 'Wallace and I are no longer a single team running the McCain Group. A happy situation which for 30 years saw us agreeing appropriate courses of action, mutually supporting each other and letting each have a veto over important decisions has been substantially fractured.' Wallace denies this, saying in an affidavit that 'we continue to operate in our respective spheres quite effectively and independently of each other'. Protracted negotiations over the past six months to solve the succession dispute have come to naught. They have culminated in Wallace making a CDollars 1bn offer to buy the McCain shares not already held by his branch of the family. Wallace and Harrison each own one-third of the McCain group's shares, with the rest divided among the families of their two deceased brothers. As an alternative, Wallace has also proposed splitting the company in two roughly equal parts, with him acquiring the operations in North and South America and Asia, which he presently oversees. Harrison would take over the UK and European businesses. Harrison has so far rejected these overtures and, instead, has spearheaded the efforts to remove Wallace from his present position. Harrison is due to file his defence to Wallace's claims by September 13.</p>

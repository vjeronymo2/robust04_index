The Voice of Vietnam summarizes the  talks between the two prime ministers:    Mr. Mahathir and Mr. Kiet discussed bilateral multilateral  relations and international issues of common concern. They  expressed their satisfaction at the positive developments in the  friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the two  countries in the last two years. During this time, the two  countries have repeatedly exchanged visits of high-level  delegations. In January 1992, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet  visited Malaysia and in April of the same year, Malaysian Prime  Minister Mahathir officially visited Vietnam. In March 1994,  Vietnamese Party General Secretary Do Muoi also visited  Malaysia. The visits have all helped broaden mutual  understanding, consolidate mutual trust, and promote mutual  comprehensive cooperation.    At present, Malaysia is among six ASEAN countries who have a  large investment in Vietnam worth about $75 million. Two-way  trade turnover between the two countries at present is 20 times  larger than 1985 figure of $20 million. During the talks this  time in Kuala Lumpur, the two prime ministers discussed concrete  measures to strengthen cooperation in the production of  construction materials, industrial construction, and tourism.    Concerning the situation in Southeast Asia and the Pacific,  the two prime ministers expressed their satisfaction at the  increasing trend for peace and cooperation in the region and  stated: Nations in the region must join their efforts for  consolidation of this trend, through which all disputes should  be solved in the principle of mutual respect and respect for  internatonal law and practices.    Prime Minister Mahathir once again affirmed the support for  Vietnam's admission to ASEAN as a full member which will benefit  both Vietnam and Malaysia and cooperation for prosperity in the  region.</p>

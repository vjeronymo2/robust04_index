			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Double Standard Must Not Be Allowed in Nuclear Issue" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Nuclear physicists of  South Africa reportedly threatened recently that they would  expose data related to nuclear arms development if the  government did not pay them retirement allowances, and disclosed  that research facilities had been provided by France and Britain.    The nuclear arms development of Israel which has close  relations with South Africa in this respect has been assisted by  the United States. The U.S. is also cooperating in South Korea's  nuclear arms development.    NODONG SINMUN today views these facts as an eloquent proof  of  the United States, France and Britain being the masterminds of  international proliferation of nuclear weapons.    The news analyst says:    It is noteworthy that these countries and the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] are applying a double standard in  nuclear inspection.    While turning an unseeing eye to South Africa, Japan and  South Korea dangerously playing with nuclear material under the  patronage of the United States, the IAEA is unreasonably taking  issue with the DPRK in its peaceful nuclear activities.    The recent publication of a "statement of the president" of  the U.N. Security Council unreasonably urging the DPRK to accept  additional inspections by the IAEA is a graphic expression of  the double standard policy in the nuclear issue. This shows the  U.N. Security Council is playing into the hands of the United  States in the execution of its hostile policy of stifling the  DPRK.    Lack of impartiality and random application of a double  standard in the nuclear issue are attributable to the  arbitrariness of the United States, France and Britain,  masterminds of the international proliferation of nuclear  weapons, in the U.N. Security Council. It is abnormal that the  countries that deserve sanctions are left alone and pressure is  put on an innocent country.    If the U.N. Security Council really has the intention to  discharge its mission, it must take issue with the United  States, which is obstructing the settlement of the nuclear issue  and gravely threatening peace and security on the Korean  peninsula with huge nuclear weapons, and the South Korean  authorities, its servant.    If the U.N. Security Council and the IAEA serve as tools for  military and political purposes of a nuclear power, applying a  double standard, the non-nuclear states and the Third World  countries will no longer trust these international organisations.    The double standard must no longer be allowed in the nuclear  issue.</p>

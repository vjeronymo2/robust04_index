			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> CHARLES, DIANA IN HONG KONG  </P> <P> Prince Charles and Princess Diana arrived in Hong Kong today for a three-day  official visit, possibly the last by British royalty before the colony reverts  to China in 1997.  </P> <P> All air traffic was halted before the royal flight touched down at Kai Tak  Airport, which has one of the world's most spectacular runways, jutting out  into the harbor.  </P> <P> Charles is expected to hear the concerns of Chinese in Hong Kong who are  worried about their future under Beijing sovereignty. Local fears have been  heightened by the crushing in June of China's pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> The couple had been scheduled to visit China, but the trip was canceled after  the brutal crackdown in Beijing, and they went to Indonesia instead after a  last-minute invitation by President Suharto.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Houston the Duchess of York ended a five-day visit to Texas with  a visit to an inner-city school where she took part in a day filled with  anti-drug messages.  </P> <P> The 30-year-old former Sarah Ferguson was also serenaded by more than 600  pupils at Blackshear Elementary School.  </P> <P> The duchess, who is married to Britain's Prince Andrew, came to Houston on  Thursday at the invitation of the Houston Grand Opera, which is saluting 300  years of British opera.  </P></p>

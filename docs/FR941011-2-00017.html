			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The analysis conducted for the PACFISH EA indicates that implementation of the interim management will have minor environmental effects in California because of the relatively small size, discontinuous, and geographically dispersed ownership pattern of the affected BLM and FS administered lands, and because of the protection already afforded by the implementation of existing management plans. Details follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Lassen National Forest_Mill, Deer, and Antelope Creek Watersheds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing Lassen National Forest Plan includes direction for protection and improvement of anadromous fish habitat. Three anadromous fish-producing watersheds exist on the Forest: Mill, Deer, and Antelope Creeks. Along most of their lengths, these creeks are managed as proposed Wild and Scenic Rivers under the existing forest plan Outside the Wild and Scenic River corridors established by the plan, watershed disturbance is limited by other standards and guidelines established by the plan. All lands in and adjacent to lakes, streams, ephemeral and perennial wetlands, bogs, seeps, and pothole lakes are assigned the riparian/fish prescription. Activities within riparian zones are limited to those that enhance riparian objectives. Final widths of reiparian zones are set following site-specific evaluation. The forest plans directs preparation of detailed anadromous fish and Wild and Scenic River management plans following site-specific analyses. Other prescriptions that limit watershed disturbance include primitive recreation, late-successional, research natural area, and existing and proposed Wilderness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Lassen National Forest Plan will be amended by the California Spotted Owl EIS that is under preparation for the ten national forests in the Sierran province. Alternatives considered in that EIS include enhanced riparian standards and guidelines, with special provisions for the anadromous fish-producing watersheds on the Lassen. The standards and guidelines are based on the Aquatic Conservation Strategy in the President's Forest Plan for the Pacific Northwest, and on the proposed PACFISH interim management direction. A decision on this EIS is expected in 1995. The alternative selected may further limit disturbance in anadromous fish-producing watersheds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Los Padres National Forest_Mine Coastal Watershed Areas <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The existing Los Padres National Forest Plan includes direction for protection and improvement of anadromous fish habitat. The forest has developed a Riparian Conservation Strategy to aid in implementation of the forest plan direction. Standards and guidelines for watershed protection and programs for in-stream habitat improvements and prescribed fire for chaparral management are included in the plan. Wildfires in chaparral and riparian woodlands are identified in the plan as having the greatest effect on anadromous fish habitat. Scheduled timber harvest is not permitted under the plan (the allowable sale quantity is zero). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> BLM_Redding and Hollister Resources Areas <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In California, BLM manages two areas with anadromous fish-producing watersheds outside the area implementing the President's Forest Plan for the Pacific Northwest. BLM has reviewed the current resource management plans (RMPs) for the Redding Resource Area, Ukiah District, and the Hollister Resource Area, Bakersfield District, and has determined that PACFIAH interim management direction is in conformance with the existing plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Redding Resource Area includes about 24 miles in scattered parcels along the Upper Sacramento River and tributaries, including Battle, Clear, Deer, and Paynes Creeks. The enhancement of anadromous fisheries is identified as an objective in the Redding RMP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Hollister Resource Area includes a parcel of approximately 1300 acres of upland area within an andromous fish-producing watershed in the upper Carmel River drainage. The Hollister RMP identifies watershed enhancement as a major land use objective. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Elements of the PACFISH interim management, including interim Riparian Management Objectives and Riparian Habitat Conservation Area widths, may need to be refined for long-term management, in light of specific conditions in California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Written comments from the public on this analysis should be submitted as indicated at the beginning of this notice. Comments would be most useful if sent by the date specified and if they address clearly the proposed action: development and implementation of a long-term strategy for the management of anadromous fish-producing watersheds on FS and BLM administered lands in California, outside areas implementing the President's Forest Plan for the Pacific Northwest. Alternatives that may be considered include continuation of existing management direction for the affected national forests and BLM resource areas; integration of PACFISH interim management with features of existing plans that provide equal or greater long-term protection of anadromous fish habitat; and application of the Aquatic Conservation Strategy from the President's Forest Plan for the Pacific Northwest in all anadromous fish-producing watersheds of the Lassen National Forest and Redding Resource Area. The analysis of public comments and review of existing management plans could reaffirm the adequacy of existing plan direction, or it could lead to amendment of those plans, documented with one or more environmental analyses. If more than one analysis is conducted, they may be structured by unit, by agency, or by geography. For example, two joint FS/BLM analyses might be conducted_one for portions of the Lassen National Forest and Redding Resources Area, and another for portions of the Los Padres National Forest and Hollister Resource Area. A decision on the nature, scope, and structure of the analysis necessary for long-term management is expected by April 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The responsible official for the FS is G.

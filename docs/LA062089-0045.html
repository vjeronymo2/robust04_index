			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: FIRST-TIME DIRECTORS MAKE IMPRESSIVE DEBUTS AT EUROFEST  </P> <P> New films by such masters as Ermanno Olmi and Jacques Rivette plus impressive  directorial debuts from Max Von Sydow and composer Michel Legrand highlight the  sixth American Film Institute's European Community Festival, which runs Friday  through June 29 at the Fine Arts in Beverly Hills. As before, the overall  quality level is higher than that of the AFI's FilmFest, and at a time when  markedly fewer foreign films are released, the EuroFest may be your one chance  to see even the best of these offerings.  </P> <P> Opening the festival at 6:45 p.m. is Olmi's "The Legend of the Holy Drinker," a  droll, gentle fable of beguiling beauty and religious mysticism starring Rutger  Hauer. He plays an alcoholic vagrant with a tragic secret who receives an  unexpected blessing, yet each time he attempts to repay it he encounters  unexpected obstacles.  </P> <P> If there's no good reason beyond the obvious commercial one for this film to be  in English -- the setting is Paris, and Hauer plays a one-time coal miner from  Silesia -- at least the dialogue is easy and colloquial. Hauer has a low-key  power, Paris never looked so enticingly sleazy and romantic and "The Legend of  the Holy Drinker," adapted from the Joseph Roth novel, is a winner -- a literal  one having won the Italian Oscar equivalent of Best Film, Direction and  Cinematography. (It screens again on Saturday at 12 noon).  </P> <P> Rivette's "The Gang of Four" (Saturday at 3, Sunday at 2) is his usual fiercely  demanding interplay of art and life as a group of young acting students become  caught up in the mystery and danger engulfing a former colleague and housemate.  "The Gang of Four" on the one hand recalls Rivette's "Paris nous appartient" in  its evocation of paranoia and "L'Amour fou" on the other, with the students  finding themselves playing roles in life as well as on the stage. As long (160  minutes) and grueling as it is, "The Gang of Four" is worth the effort, and  Rivette's young actresses lighten the journey with their loveliness, talent and  individuality. The caring, detailed delineation of these young people coping  with everyday life while ardently pursuing their dreams evokes both humor and  compassion. Cast as the girls' exacting teacher is the exquisite Bulle Ogier,  one of Rivette's favorite actresses.  </P> <P> With the pure enchantment of "Katinka" (Saturday at 7), Max Von Sydow proves to  be as skilled a director as he is an actor. This irresistible period piece,  adapted from a novel by Herman Bang and set in rural turn-of-the-century  Norway, is a beautifully told story of the love that develops between a young  stationmaster's wife (Tammi Ost) and the handsome new manager of the largest  estate in the area (Kurt Ravn). The past comes vividly alive in Von Sydow's  loving observation of both daily life and hearty holiday celebrations. There's  something of Renoir and, not surprisingly, much of Ingmar Bergman in this film,  and for all the emotions Ost and Ravn stir in us over their predicament, they  above all earn our respect for their old-fashioned sense of honor and  responsibility, especially in regard to Ost's good-natured husband (Ole  Ernest).  </P> <P> Spanish film maker Antonio del Real's leisurely "The River That Was" (Sunday at  6 p.m.) follows a group of loggers, headed by Alfredo Landa (star of "The Holy  Innocents") as they guide thousands of logs down the River Tajo from Paralejos  de las Truchas to Aranjuez. The time is 1946, and this will be the last such  journey before trucks are to start transporting the logs. A war-weary Irishman  of partial Spanish descent (a reflective Tony Peck) joins the loggers, whom he  discovers to be a hearty, honorable band of free spirits at odds with a  corrupt, fascist society. At times the film, for all its pastoral beauty, feels  overly long and tedious, yet there's no denying that its slow pace matches the  tempo of a way of life it depicts with such concern.  </P> <P> Also screening is "The Tall Guy" (Friday at 9:10), which stars Jeff Goldblum as  an American actor in London and which was unavailable for preview, and two  disappointments, "Paperback Woman" (Saturday at 9, Sunday at noon) and "The  Woman Who Dreamed" (Sunday at 8:30).

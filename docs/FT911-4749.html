			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: Higher relief on dereliction costs - Oil/Gas Companies THE Finance Bill has broadened the definition of the expenditure made by oil and gas companies in abandoning North Sea production platforms that qualifies for relief from Petroleum Revenue Tax. Although the bill will not have a big effect on the main operators - since it merely tightens up the wording of existing legislation rather than altering the spirit of the law - it once again raises the controversial issue of what oil companies do when a North Sea field runs out of oil. Companies have not yet tested government legislation on abandoning installations because North Sea fields have only just started to run dry. The bill announced yesterday broadens the rules on tax relief for abandonment which means that companies will be able to write off all the costs incurred against tax. It also stipulates that partners in an oil or gas field which obtain bank guarantees against one partner's defaulting on the cost of abandoning that field can write off the cost of getting that guarantee against tax. At the same time, if an oil company has to pick up the cost of abandonment for a defaulting partner, it can also obtain tax relief on that payment as well as on its own share of the costs of abandonment. Government rules state that oil companies must return the sea bed to its natural state once they have finished producing oil or gas. This means, at least in theory, that they have to recover the immense production platform, drag it onshore and break it up. After that, they must plug the well heads with concrete to prevent oil leakages. The cost of this operation could run into billions of pounds and as it is entirely allowable against Petroleum Revenue Tax - which runs at 75 per cent  -the government could end up footing three-quarters of the bill. For this reason, many big oil companies privately believe that when it comes to it, the government will allow them just to blow up the rig and leave it. Occidental Petroleum was given a special concession to topple the damaged Piper Alpha rig into the sea after the explosion that killed 167 men. But there are at least six fields that look as though they may run out of oil in the next four years and are not making much of a profit now - which means they could be abandoned at any time. On Friday, a House of Commons select committee will publish a report on abandonment after hearing evidence from oil companies, fishermen and environmental lobbyists.</p>

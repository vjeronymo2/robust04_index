Growth in the second quarter was driven mainly by consumer spending and non-residential fixed investment which grew at revised annual rates of 3.4 per cent and 16.6 per cent respectively. Reuter adds: In his most optimistic comments since taking office in January, Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen said yesterday the US economy was poised for a strong upswing.

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Taylor Woodrow Not many companies fritter away the proceeds of a one-for-four rights issue within 12 months, even in property and contracting. It is thus a measure of Taylor Woodrow's fall from grace that the company was forced to admit yesterday that virtually all the Pounds 163m it received in last April's cash call has now disappeared in retained losses and writedowns. It may be that the new sense of purpose from the reshaped board, which was partly responsible for yesterday's 8 per cent jump in the shares, will ultimately revive Taylor's fortunes. But the immediate outlook for investors once income funds have collected their 8 per cent yield looks distinctly unexciting. The dividend, after all, was only held to honour the promise made with the rights issue. Unless something very extraordinary turns up it will have to be cut this year, perhaps from 9.5p to 7p. Even then, the payout will be uncovered on profit forecasts which were only being upgraded yesterday on the view that further Channel tunnel provisions will be deferred to 1993 and that last year's US contracting losses will not be repeated. Taylor's big property exposure hardly looks attractive, and investors who disagree can do better than buy a stock trading at a mere 20 per cent discount to net assets. There are purer housebuilding plays in the market, and though the intention is to grow this side of the business, reduced cash flows from contracting will not leave limitless room for balance sheet manoeuvre.</p>

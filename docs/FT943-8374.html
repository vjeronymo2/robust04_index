			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador moves farther along oil privatisation trail Ecuador is taking a further step in opening its oil industry to the private sector. Concession contracts to operate and explore marginal fields will be offered in late September or early October. Marginal fields are defined as those that now produce less than 1 per cent of Ecuador's total output. Petroecuador, the state-owned oil company, believes that reserves and production in these fields can be increased significantly with only modest investment. Under the current administration's oil policy Petroecuador's limited investment funds are to be utilised to develop the country's principal fields. A team of specialists is evaluating each of the 10 wells to be offered for bidding. The studies will determine precise investment requirements, which for now are estimated to total USDollars 60m. 'This is a low-risk investment,' says Mr Bernardo Perez of Petroecuador's contracting office, 'because the fields are already producing and much of the infrastructure is in place.' The oil fields combined proven reserves total more than 100m barrels but are expected to increase following exploration efforts. The operating cost per barrel of crude oil varies between Dollars 1.45 and Dollars 6. Under the newly devised contract the current output of each field will continue to go to Petroecuador and the contractors income will be generated by increasing production. The winning bidder will be the company that offers the state the highest percentage of the additional output and the largest investment. If the contractor proves unable to increase production within two years, the concession will be terminated and the field will have to be returned to state control. Part of the contract, which is to last for 20 years, will also allow for oil exploration in the immediate vicinity of the existing well sites. Newly discovered reserves will be remunerated over a fixed compensation period. Infrastructure or machinery installed by the contractor will become state property after the contract expires. The announcement of this latest bid comes only months after 10 petroleum companies won the right to explore and produce oil in over 2m hectares of Amazon rain forests.</p>

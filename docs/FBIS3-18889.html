The report showed how of the 15,309 ships identified in the  operation, most in the Otranto Channel or off the coast of  Montenegro, 1,237 were bordered and inspected while 314 were  re-routed to Italian ports in the Puglia region for a more  in-depth inspection.    The Operation Sharp Guard report was given here by the  deputy  commander of the operation, Italian Admiral Gianfranco Coviello,  and the commander of WEU naval forces, Rear-Admiral Elio  Bolongaro, onboard the frigate "Zeffiro."    In their report, the commanders underscored how the  patrolling has interrupted all sea commerce for Montenegro,  although, Coviello admitted, "we missed a few speedboats which  could only carry small cargo."    Each day an average of 60 ships, excluding ferries, are  identified by the nine NATO-WEU ships assigned on patrol, out of  a total fleet of 21 ships. The operation also employs a  significant number of aircraft in its operations.    Once the ships have been identified and, if necessary,  inspected, as is the case for ships en route to Slovenia or  Croatia, they are then monitored by radar to verify that they  arrive at their declared port of destination as stated in the  ship's manifest.    In the event that the final port not be clear or control of  the cargo difficult, such as with seal containers, then the ship  is diverted to an Italian port for inspection.    It was recalled during today's review how Operation Sharp  Guard was the consequence of United Nations sanctions with the  aim of coordinating, under a single command, the parallel  operation of NATO and the WEU for a better rationalization of  forces.    Of the 21 ships taking part in the operation five are from  the WEU: the Italian ships "Zeffiro", to be now replaced with  the frigate "Lupo", and the "Alpino", the "Cataluna" of Spain  and the French vessels "Cassard" and "D'Estienne D'Orves."</p>

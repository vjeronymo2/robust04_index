			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / US toughens policy on links with Cuba The US further toughened its Cuba policy at the weekend. The stronger measures against President Fidel Castro's country followed Washington's announcement on Friday that Cubans fleeing the Caribbean island as refugees would be barred from the US and detained at Guantanamo, the US base in south-eastern Cuba. President Bill Clinton said on Saturday he was barring cash remittances by Americans to Cuba and putting new limits on charter flights between the US and the island. Scheduled flights have long been discontinued under the 30-year US embargo on its trading with Cuba. Mr Clinton also pledged increased and amplified US radio broadcasts into Cuba, warning residents not to go to sea and head for the US. With the spotlight of attention shifting from the refugee problem and onto the US agenda to oust Mr Castro, Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff, said yesterday that imposing a blockade on Cuba was not out of the question. 'That is obviously one of the options that we would look at in the future, as we see whether or not Castro begins to make some legitimate movements toward democracy,' he said on television in the US. He added that the US was committed to foster democracy in Cuba, as well as to end the wave of illegal emigration to Florida by flimsy boats and rafts. 'At the same time, we have to continue to put pressure on Castro because the problem is not with refugees - it is within the Castro regime.' However, administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said later that Mr Panetta had been referring to blocking trade from other countries with Cuba. Such an idea is on a long list of US options, but the officials said there was no active effort to implement a blockade. Mr Newt Gingrich, Republican minority whip in the House of Representatives, yesterday accused President Clinton of failing to flesh out his Cuba policy. 'This administration has a passion for taking one or two steps without working out what the rest of the trip is,' Mr Gingrich said, calling on Mr Clinton to look for a smooth transition to democracy and a liberal economy in Cuba. It remains to be seen whether the change in US policy towards Cuban refugees, whose predecessors were welcomed in the US and offered the possibility of permanent residence status after one year, will deter further attempts to cross the Florida Strait. The US Coast Guard in Florida picked up 1,189 people on Saturday, the highest total of such Cuban boatpeople in one day this year and nearly three times the number of such Cubans who reached the US in the whole of 1990. However, the Cuban-American community in Florida appears to acknowledge the need to stem the flow of would-be immigrants to the US as refugees from the island. A survey of 240 Florida residents, by the Miami Herald, showed 66 per cent support for Mr Clinton's decision and 43 per cent not wanting detained refugees given a chance to apply for asylum. Governor Lawton Chiles of Florida, and all those likely to challenge his bid for re-election in November, approved a tough stance on Cuban refugees, an indication of how they judge the attitude of non-hispanic voters in Florida.

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Technology: All working from the same screen - An executive information system cleared the channels of communication at ICI, says Claire Gooding in the latest in a series on getting the most out of software / Software at Work The first act of Scott Davidson as he walks into the room is to overturn the 'No Smoking' sign and light a cigarette. It's done swiftly, decisively and with charm. As managing director of ICI Fibres and ICI Acrylics, he makes the rules. His job involves dashing from Brussels to London and other outposts of ICI at a time when meetings with company lawyers and negotiations about the handing over of ICI Fibres to Du Pont of the US, as part of an asset swap, dominate the schedule. His unorthodox approach to information technology has made it possible for him to run two ICI companies - and take an active role in a third, ICI Materials - from Brussels. The system Davidson uses accompanies him everywhere, in a small briefcase-sized computer. It is an executive information system (EIS), which keeps him in touch with his companies and serves him, wherever he is, with information that used to come from a headquarters staffed by 420 people. Now, partly because of the system, the Brussels head office has only 12 staff. Scott Davidson took over ICI Fibres at the start of 1990, when it was a Pounds 650m company. An ICI man for about 25 years, his first task was to take control, and make people accountable for their performance, at a time when the recession was making business tough. The lack of control over information technology and information systems in general (estimated at Pounds 18m) was then a major concern and one with which he found it frustratingly difficult to get to grips. After a chance meeting, Jon Morgan, managing director of a consultancy - Executive Information Solutions (EISL) - specialising in EIS, quickly became involved in identifying the needs of what Davidson calls the 'top box' of managers. 'One of the benefits of using consultants is their objectivity in examining what we wanted and needed. From that came a 'halo' effect, casting light on the effect of IT as a whole.' There were two concerns - managerial accountability and the information systems structure. A basic difficulty was putting names to activities and identifying people with their responsibilities. Morgan and his colleague Gerry Cryer started a process they call 'goal focus' which was to result in a three-year relationship with Davidson and other parts of ICI. It also brought about various incarnations of the EIS Davidson uses. The aim was to replace dozens of paper reports, some of which used to adorn the 'chart room' where hand-drawn graphs were amended daily. 'The process sharpened our focus on people, sales and working capital,' says Davidson. Morgan stresses that the benefits come from the process of defining the business system, as much as the system itself. 'As with most organisations, the individuals involved were finding it difficult to see the forest for the trees. The goal focus process ensures that decisions are turned into actions, and that performance is monitored and continually examined.' The strategy for ICI Fibres was a business improvement programme that would cut down on bureaucracy, focus on customer satisfaction, and improve business performance. The computer system, fed by constant updates acts as the monitor of every stage of the plan. Davidson believes ICI Fibres was among the first companies to take the full brunt of the recession. Without damaging the revenue, he had to take steps to cut costs by as much as 30 per cent. 'The Business Information System allowed us to work to targets.' He estimates a Pounds 7m saving in the first year, resulting from the work of EISL. In the last two years, the staff of ICI Fibres has shrunk from 8,500 to 6,000 people. The consolidation of information in one system, used by about 20 ICI Fibres managers, made it possible to decentralise the headquarters. Despite his idiosyncratic attitude to 'No Smoking' signs, his main aim is that all his managers obey the same rules. 'One of the things about any organisation is that people interpret figures in the way they wish to do so. These days, face to face or on the phone, we are all working from the same screen.' Typical of the figures the screen presents to the people at both ends of the phone are exceptions against budget, the trend of raw material costs, market share and short-term forecasts. In the case of ICI Fibres, the market figures came from the trade group in Brussels and are shown by country and business sector: carpets, textiles, industrial yarns, polymers and engineering plastics. Managers have easy access to screens that show the various goals, such as accident rate, lost hours, waste and fixed costs, displaying actual figures, goals and performance to date. The presentation not only consolidates the whole picture, but makes it possible to zoom in on detail and split the large issue down into manageable chunks. The menus are self-explanatory, and the headings and acronyms provide a common vocabulary which means the same to all users. The system has another important function. Once true figures are established, they can be used to focus on individuals. This fosters competition, and encourages people to keep up to the mark in such areas as lost time, sickness, conversion of raw materials to product, and conversion efficiency. The connections between activities are so clear that they have the effect of pulling the whole team together. 'We tend to equate doing a professional job with earning more money; group pride gives people personal pride. Incentives and prizes recognise performance.' When Davidson took over at ICI Acrylics, he needed immediate and fast control. His brief was to integrate businesses from approaching asset swaps with Du Pont and BASF swiftly and effectively. 'I needed a fast track on what was going on, and a quick understanding of people's accountability. The financial systems had to be in place before Du Pont and BASF integration started.' EISL went through a similar, though speedier, process with ICI Acrylics. The system has replaced a large number of administrative procedures. Dennis James, the head of IT, ensures a smooth information flow. Among the issues raised - though not yet solved - is the integration of IT and information systems in the new organisation, involving the acquired companies. EIS is, Davidson concludes, 'not necessarily a magic wand; it's a discipline. It is a simple way of running the business, month to month, day to day. The bottom line is that we all deal with a document which tells the same story: it denies the opportunity for personal interpretation.' Buzzword EXECUTIVE INFORMATION SYSTEMS were conceived as a screen-based information service geared specifically to top executives, with easy-to-use, ready-packaged information which would provide a complete picture of the organisation. 'Drill down' provides detail on components, also in graphical form.</p>

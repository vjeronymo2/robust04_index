			<p>Drug   Abuse   <F P=102> AU3005120694 Prague CTK in English 1017 GMT 30 May 94 </F> <F P=103> AU3005120694 </F> <F P=104>  Prague CTK </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Prague, May 30 (CTK) -- Expert estimates say that  the Czech Republic has between 50,000 and 60,000 drug addicts,  Petr Lom, a correspondent for the parliamentary health and  social committee, says in an interview published in today's  edition of the Czech daily RUDE PRAVO.    For example, one in three of an estimated 60,000 prostitutes  sooner or later ends up on drugs; besides, there are 2,000 drug  addicts among the prison population and the drug abuse  consulting centers file another several thousand people, Lom  says.    Although people can now get all kinds of drug, surveys have  lately been neglected. Addicts themselves take to drug  trafficking in order to gain access to drugs; they dilute them  for sales and take some themselves at the same time. However,  the heroin being found among users is quite concentrated, which  shows that re-selling chains are still short, the paper says.  The Czechs still have no law banning the free sale of drug  precursors, that is medicines such as ephedrine, it adds.    The inter-ministry narcotics commission with district  branches, aimed at coordinating the fight against drugs, has not  come up with any concrete results so far, the paper says, adding  that the commission only has an advisory capacity.    The customs as well as other Interior Ministry departments,  jealously guard their independence, and their cooperation with  the Interpol and the national narcotics information center is  only voluntary.    The Drop-In rehabilitation centers for drug addicts also  struggle against the odds, with diolane, a simulation drug with  a short-term effect, being the only tool at their disposal.  Ways of monitoring the diolane-based abstinence treatment are  non-satisfactory, the paper says.    Another shortcoming is the fact that the Health Ministry  only  monitors the consumption of drugs and has no controlling  authority over their production and distribution. The present  Anti-Narcotics Bureau is just an office within the health  ministry, but if we are serious in wanting to protect the  country against the drug trade, steps must be taken to unite  drug-fighting efforts at home and bring the anti-narcotics  agencies closer to the drug-producing scene in countries not far  from the Czech Republic, such as Ukraine, Hungary and Poland,  and plot the routes plied by the drug trade, Lom says in RUDE  PRAVO.</p>

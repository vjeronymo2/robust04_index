			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Land sale agreement supports Hong Kong THE yen's depreciation against the dollar failed to maintain Japanese share prices at Monday's higher levels as arbitrage-related buying lost momentum and dealers took profits in late trading, writes Wayne Aponte in Tokyo. The Nikkei average ended 114.34 easier at 20,940.37, after a day's range of 20,932.34 and 21,224.78. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 3.22 at 1,635,83, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.93 to 1,272.12. Volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was estimated at 700m shares, compared with a final 549m during the previous session. Rises still showed a lead over declines at the close by 667 to 418, with 114 issues unchanged. Investors are likely to avoid taking long positions in Tokyo before the bulk of Japanese corporate earnings reports are released later this month, brokers said. Fears of unexpected downward company revisions, coupled with a lack of fresh incentives, have placed a ceiling on the Nikkei's advance, they added. However, market participants expect limited downside risk because institutional investors tend to buy equities on dips and pension funds managed by the government may serve to support share prices. An analyst at a Japanese securities brokerage said domestic life insurance companies were gradually increasing the percentage of equity holdings in their portfolios, which would improve the chances for a sustained rally once additional signs of an economic recovery surfaced. In spite of the day's declines, the yen's downturn against the dollar prompted investors to purchase export-related issues. Sony put on Y80 at Y4,930, Pioneer Electronic Y70 at Y2,650 and TDK Y20 at Y4,000. Profit-taking pushed carmakers lower: Nissan shed Y39 to Y780, Toyota Y20 to Y1,720 and Isuzu Y8 to Y485. In Osaka, the OSE average finished 198.81 higher at 23,152.38 in volume of 31.6m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets managed a mostly firmer performance yesterday. HONG KONG rallied as the Sino-British Land Commission agreed its land sales programme for this year. The Hang Seng index was up 107.83, or 1.6 per cent, at 6,847.06 after touching 6,872.79. Turnover came to HKDollars 4.2bn after Monday's HKDollars 4.0bn. Property issues led the rise. Cheung Kong and Henderson Land rose 70 cents to HKDollars 27.30 and HKDollars 20.30 respectively. AUSTRALIA received support from strength on Wall Street and demand for some banking shares. The All Ordinaries index appreciated 15.4 to 1,687.4 as hopes of an interest rate cut encouraged investors. Westpac jumped 14 cents to ADollars 3.77 and ANZ advanced 13 cents to ADollars 3.80 on overseas buying. Brambles Industries, the transport group, recouped Monday's loss which was prompted by a weak profits forecast, rebounding 46 cents to ADollars 13.44. SINGAPORE saw selected institutional buying which took the market index higher while overall trade remained mixed. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 22.02, or 1.24 per cent, to 1,794.04 in volume of 211.4m shares, after 217.7m in the previous session. KUALA LUMPUR was mixed to easier on profit-taking, with falls in some leading component stocks weighing on the composite index, which finished 5.55 lower at 710.55. BANGKOK edged higher in thin trade and the SET index gained 8.51 at 850.35 in turnover of Bt2.1bn. Among the actives, Bangkok Bank of Commerce firmed Bt1 to Bt16.00. NEW ZEALAND rebounded from Monday's fall on short-covering and bargain hunting. The NZSE-40 index rose 8.55 to 1,565.59. Forestry stocks, which had led the recent slide, firmed, with Fletcher Challenge up 1 cent to NZDollars 2.57. KARACHI was higher after the government unveiled incentives to help the textile industry, ranging from a cut in duties to more liberal financing. The 100-share price index climbed 7.13 to 1,113.95. BMA Capital Management in Karachi notes in its latest weekly review that investor confidence has been improving amid repeated assurances by the caretaker government on holding elections on time and under army supervision. BOMBAY gained ground on short-covering and the BSE index rose 62.37 to 2,289.31.</p>

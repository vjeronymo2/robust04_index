Rybkin noted that the president assured legislators that the  chief executive will give every kind of support to the Duma.    Describing the talk with the president as detailed,  substantive and constructive, Rybkin stressed that Yeltsin  expressed readiness for constant cooperation with the state  Duma. Meetings between the Duma speaker and the president will  be regular, at least once a month.    Rybkin informed deputies that the talk focused on  cooperation  between the chief executive and the state Duma in law-making  activities. The president stressed that the division of powers  does not mean their estrangement, Rybkin said.    "We shall be guided by this principle during our work at the  state Duma," the speaker stressed.    According to Rybkin, they also discussed material and  technical aspects of the state Duma's work as well as working  and living conditions of legislators. The speaker noted that  the president reaffirmed: Lawmakers will be provided with all  necessary things for their work.    Rybkin informed deputies that all buildings and services of  the former parliament will be transferred to the Russian  parliament fully or for temporary use. The president instructed  the business administration to hand over all necessary services  to financial and economic administrations of the Duma.    This question was also settled in principle with the Russian  Government, Rybkin added. He told parliamentarians about his  two-hour talk with Viktor Chernomyrdin, which was held also on  Thursday.    The premier said that the Duma will receive back the  institute of comparative jurisprudence, one of the most  important institutions which will be returned to the lower  chamber.    The question was also raised about completing all repairs at  the building of the former townhall which is now occupied by the  state Duma. The president informed the speaker that he gave  appropriate instructions to the government to complete repairs  at the earliest.    Rybkin also said that the Duma would receive an appropriate  number of other spacious buildings and installations in the  capital, although he did not specify which ones. He only noted  that buildings are good both in floor space and quality and in  no way inferior to the previous ones.    The speaker informed deputies that a working staff of the  state Duma would be formed. He told lawmakers that the  president, on his suggestion, signed a decree disbanding the  temporary staff of the Russian Parliament and establishing a  permanent staff of the state Duma.</p>

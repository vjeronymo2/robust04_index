			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Four of the new faces around Major's cabinet table - Virginia Bottomley: Health secretary AMONG Mrs Virginia Bottomley's hopes as she enters John Major's cabinet is that her health department will be blessed with a relatively quiet life. As incoming health secretary, one of her chief aims will be 'to try to remove politics from the health service'. What the NHS needs, she says, is a 'spell of stability' in which to beaver away at the government's reforms. In the wake of the bitter War of Jennifer's Ear - during which health was turned into the most abused of political footballs - this might seem a forlorn aspiration but Mrs Bottomley may see it partly fulfilled for three reasons. First, as she argues with some justification, the election result has to some extent 'nailed' Labour's aggressive claims regarding NHS 'privatisation'. At the least, both leading opposition parties now face a period of introspection and possible policy changes. Second, the government's framework of reform is now mainly in place, with the focus switching to implementation as more GPs gear up to become fundholders and more hospitals prepare for trust status. Mrs Bottomley gave an early signal that she will not be doctrinaire over the pace at which the new structures are introduced. 'It is not a kind of rigorous ideological commitment that every unit shall become an NHS trust,' she said on TV-am's Frost on Sunday programme. Third, the formidable Mr Robin Cook will probably not be Labour health spokesman beyond the autumn. Mr Cook's mastery of his portfolio has taxed even such accomplished debaters as Mr Kenneth Clarke. Mrs Bottomley's capacity to perform capably under pressure is not in doubt but although meticulous in mastering briefs she has yet to demonstrate the ability to ad-lib convincingly. There is also a question mark over her ability to stamp her authority on an entire government department.</p>

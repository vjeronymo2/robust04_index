			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 19 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Serbs and the  UN peace-keeping forces today agreed on a temporary cease-fire  in Gorazde, an eastern Bosnian town under intense gunfire over  the past few days.    Bosnian Serb "parliament speaker" Momcilo Krajisnik and  civil  affairs chief of the UN forces in Bosnia Victor Andreev [names  as received] signed a memorandum to the effect late today, which  provides for a cease-fire around Gorazde and the deployment of  some 100 UN Protection troops there.    Under the memorandum, "the Serb side agrees, as long as it  is  not being attacked, to cease fire immediately" within an area  three kilometers away from downtown Gorazde on the left bank of  the Drina river.    The UN protection forces will deploy in the truce area some  100 soldiers, 41 medical personnel, 20 armored cars and 29  non-military vehicles.    The UN forces and staff of other international groups will  be  able to carry out normal humanitarian aid in the area but any  activities to be conducted out of the area must obtain advance  Serb permission.    The temporary accord will remain effective until a permanent  one is reached.    Earlier today, Russian President Boris Yeltsin urged the  Serbs to put down their weapons while UN Secretary-General  Butrus Butrus- Ghali asked for the expansion of NATO air strikes  on Serbs and the U.S. threatened to bomb Serb territory.    The U.S., reportedly ready to issue another ultimatum to  Bosnian Serbs, warned that it would launch a preemptive and  extensive air strike on Serb territory if Serbs continue their  attacks or threaten the safety of any UN peace-keeping soldier.    U.S. President Bill Clinton said in Washington tonight that  he would soon announce further pressure and operation plans  against the Serbs.    NATO launched two air strikes on Serb positions around  Gorazde last week to press for cease-fire, but the Serbs,  undeterred by the bombings, retaliated furiously and entered the  besieged town over the weekend.</p>

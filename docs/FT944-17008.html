			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Virgin to launch cola drink Virgin, Mr Richard Branson's airline and retailing group, is planning to break into cola markets around the world with its own brand of soft drinks. Virgin said last night: 'In partnership with a major north American group, we will operate in a large number of markets through selected multiple retailers.' A formal announcement is expected soon. Cott, the controversial Canadian producer of own-label drinks and foods, is thought to be the partner. It broke into the UK earlier this year by producing the own-brand Classic Cola for J. Sainsbury. Classic Cola embroiled Sainsbury and Cott in a fight with Coca-Cola over packaging. Sainsbury changed its packaging after Coke protested it was too similar to Coke's own distinctive style. The Sainsbury's drink has taken varying shares of the market depending on how heavily it was promoted at any one time. Sales of Coke, produced in the UK by Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, have been hit to some extent. But Pepsi-Cola has enjoyed a rising market share due to the success of its Pepsi-Max. Virgin Cola, plus caffeine-free and diet versions, are believed to be in production at the Ben Shaw plant in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, of which Cott owns 51 per cent. Some 1bn cans are due in the first year, using a different formula from the Sainsbury drink.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] KOMPAS writes that Indonesia has in fact grounds to  voice its objection to the Philippines over an Asia-Pacific  conference on East Timor scheduled to be held at a university in  Manila on 31 May. The Indonesian Government, which learned of  the planned conference last October, subsequently voiced its  objection. The objection was repeated in November 1993 and March  1994. According to Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, the objection  stems from the fact that the conference organizers as well as  the invitees, including Ramos Horta [a leader of the  Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor or Fretilin]  and his friends have a political goal, that is to mobilize  public opinion to question the incorporation of East Timor into  the Republic of Indonesia. Despite our doubts over their  possible success in changing the current status of East Timor,  the conference could in any way affect the efforts of Indonesia,  the United Nations, and Portugal to settle comprehensively the  East Timor issue. Accordingly, the Philippine Government should  immediately move to cancel the planned conference because there  could be a thunderbolt in the broad daylight in  Indonesian-Philippine relations if the conference is held.    Meanwhile, the daily ANGKATAN BERSENJATA says that the  conference can be categorized as a forum of discussions on human  rights rather than an academic one by whatever standards. Based  on pamphlets circulated by the conference organizers, the  delegates will discuss ways of achieving the independence of  East Timor -- a political goal. Accordingly, the Indonesian  Government and people hope that Philippine President Fidel Ramos  will change his stand over the extremely sensitive issue that  may undermine Indonesian-Philippine relations.    SUARA KARYA stresses that Indonesia understands the dilemma  faced by the Philippines. For the sake of close bilateral  relations, the Philippine Government, however, may in any way  prevent Philippine territory from being used as a base by  Fretilin and its supporters to launch anti-Indonesian campaigns.  As a comparison, the Indonesian Government will, for example,  never allow Indonesian territory to be used as a base by the  Moros [Moro National Liberation Front] to conduct  anti-Philippine activities. The daily believes that as a  preliminary step, the Philippine Government may deny entry to  Fretilin leaders who want to attend the conference.</p>

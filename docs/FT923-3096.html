			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Leading players ponder party's role: Philip Stephens joins delegates in considering where the 'third force' can go from here THE DILEMMA was encapsulated by Mr Charles Kennedy. The Liberal Democrats, the party president declared recently, must decide whether they still hold out as their objective, short or long-term, replacing Labour as the principal alternative to the Conservatives. If not, they must redefine their role in British politics. Six months after a general election that saw Britain's third party step back from the abyss of the late 1980s but then fall well short of its aspirations for the 1990s, it is far from clear that the Liberal Democrats are willing to confront their predicament. The headline on the Conference issue of Liberal Democrats News tells the story: No to Pacts, it declares, Yes to Progress. In other words, the issue that swamped Mr Paddy Ashdown's general election campaign - would he do a deal with Labour to get the Conservatives out? - is now dominating the post-mortem. Liberal Democrat leaders protest that talk of pacts or deals is the obsession of the media. It offers an easy excuse to lazy journalists to ignore the more complicated analysis of the party's policies. But in the approach to this week's conference in Harrogate, no one has been more obsessed than the leadership with how a party with 20 MPs can exercise influence unless it is ready to strike a tacit understanding with Mr John Smith. In a breathless leap of imagination, Mr Simon Hughes, the party's environment spokesman, has sought to concertina the whole debate by dismissing talk of a pre-election pact - and then moving on to discuss the party's tactics if Mr Smith heads a minority government after the election due in 1996 or 1997. There is no concession to the possibility that the world might have changed rather dramatically by then. Mr Hughes is not alone. Mr Ashdown insists that talk of pacts is a diversion. Yet at the core of the speech in Chard that began the pre-conference debate about the party's role was a presumption that the Liberal Democrats could no longer afford to be exclusive in their approach to politics. A realignment of the opposition to Mr John Major was essential. Among the party's MPs, memories of the election campaign - when the party was drawn into a fruitless and damaging discussion of how many seats it might demand in a cabinet presided over by Mr Neil Kinnock - appear to have faded. So, too, apparently, has concern that it was the perception that Mr Ashdown was ready to hand the keys of No 10 to the Labour leader that drove many wavering voters back into the arms of the Conservatives. The final election result was not a disaster. The party's 20 seats and 18 per cent of the vote was deeply disappointing when measured against the aspirations of the old Liberal/SDP Alliance - but it was tribute also to Mr Ashdown's success in rescuing the party from the wreckage of the now Lord Owen's destructive departure. Three years ago, its support was down to 5 per cent. The problem for the party leader is that with Mr John Major back in Downing Street the political reality does not distinguish between 5 and 18 per cent. The Liberal Democrats are powerless, and Mr Ashdown sees no point in politics for a party that is forever denied the capacity to implement change. Not all the party's activists agree with the analysis. A submission to the conference from the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors - representing the party's 3,500 local councillors and, more important, its strong roots in community activism - calls for the party to devote its energies to discussing 'new ideas, not dead-end deals'. Mr Ashdown has sought to finesse the threat from some of the more vociferous local activists of open warfare within the party. He insists that his appeal for a less exclusive party is directed towards the creation of a broad-based movement to win the battle of ideas against the Conservatives rather than do a cosy deal with Mr Smith. The party leader has been careful also to emphasise his parallel concern that the Liberal Democrats maintain and develop a distinctive policy agenda. The policy document that the conference will debate later today sets out the party's commitment to market economics, to an effective environmental strategy and to enlightened social and education policies as well as the more familiar themes of electoral reform and decentralisation of power. Mr Ashdown is serious about the policies, although he too frequently obscures them in slogans about choice and opportunity and television sound bites about the 'new politics' or the 'new agenda'. But talk of positioning the Liberal Democrats at the centre of a new anti-Tory coalition is a smokescreen. There is no sign of a huge untapped reservoir of support for such a movement among the don't knows and don't cares in the British electorate. The demise of the Greens can be attributed in part to that party's self-destructive tendencies, but it reflects also the apathy of an electorate still content to see politics as a non-participatory game. The only realistic possibility is an understanding with Mr Smith - based on the hope that Labour will be ready to embrace electoral reform before the next election. It is that option that Mr Ashdown wants to keep open. But neither he nor his party seems prepared this week in Harrogate to answer Mr Kennedy's question.</p>

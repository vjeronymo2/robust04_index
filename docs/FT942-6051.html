			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: US likely to boost world demand for coarse grains World consumption of coarse grains could rise by about 19m tonnes in 1994/95 on growing demand from the US, the International Wheat Council said in its latest grain market report. 'Although the declining trend is likely to continue in the former Soviet Union, a significant upturn is expected in the US,' it said. Growing livestock industries would also increase demand for coarse grains in developing countries, particularly in Asia, where their use for all purposes 'could set a new record'. However, early calculations of consumption of 840m tonnes depended on a good US harvest. 'Should the latter fall significantly below expectations, consumption would drop because of the limited volume of existing supplies in exporting countries,' it said. Stocks at the end of 1993/94 were estimated to be only 111m tonnes. The IWC forecasts 1994 world production of coarse grains at 837m tonnes, up 48m tonnes on last year. 'Although crops are expected to decline or show little change in most countries, output should be boosted by a recovery in the US and another large harvest in China.' No recovery in demand is expected this year from Russia, where animal numbers and meat consumption have dropped in recent years.</p>

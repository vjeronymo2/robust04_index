			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Amstrad to pay Pounds 60m for direct sales PC company Amstrad, the consumer electronics group run by Mr Alan Sugar, yesterday agreed to pay around Pounds 60m in cash to acquire Viglen, a private company which builds and sells personal computers directly to its customers. The deal marks a significant change in direction for Amstrad which has seen its own PC sales and profits tumble in the face of growing competition in the high street market. Mr Sugar, Amstrad's chairman and founder, said the acquisition would add 'an exciting new dimension' to the group's existing business. Amstrad's shares closed up  1/4 p at 31 3/4 p. Viglen ranks about third in UK direct PC sales with about a 7 per cent share of the market. Direct sales last year accounted for about one-third of all PCs sold. Last year the group posted pre-tax profits before directors' emoluments and exceptional items of Pounds 9m in the year to March 31 on turnover of Pounds 72m, up 33 per cent over sales a year earlier. Mr Sugar said gross margins at Viglen were around 25 per cent. Amstrad is acquiring assets worth Pounds 13.6m. 'The acquisition provides Amstrad with the opportunity to purchase a fast-growing business which both complements and strengthens Amstrad's existing business,' he said. Viglen will continue to operate as 'an autonomous unit' within the group and will maintain its current management structure, selling methods, products and customer service. The senior management team is being 'locked in' with new service contracts for a minimum of 42 months. Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to Amstrad shareholder approval, the group will pay the vendors Pounds 30m in cash initially and a further Pounds 30m over the next three years, subject to Viglen's profitability. If Viglen's profits exceed Pounds 27m in the first three years the vendors - five key members of Viglen's management team - will receive a share of the additional profits. Amstrad will finance the acquisition using part of its cash reserves which were Pounds 135m last month, but which total around Pounds 150m on a normalised basis. Mr Sugar said the Viglen acquisition was being made in order to provide a new source of profits and growth for the group and that the price represented a price/earnings multiple of 10.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It has been learned that even though North Korea  enacted laws aimed at attracting foreign capital in 1992,  including a law guaranteeing foreign investment, only three  joint-venture businesses have been set up in North Korea.    In addition, the number of joint-venture companies doing  business in North Korea has diminished from 120 to 20, Yi  Yong-tok, deputy premier and national unification minister, said  on 10 January in a report to the National Assembly Foreign  Affairs-Unification Committee.    According to the report, the three joint-venture companies  that were established in the last year are Aeguk Adhesion Plant,  Aeguk Color Television Assembly Plant, and Myongsim  Joint-Venture Company manufacturing graphite, which are all  jointly invested with Japanese companies.    The report revealed that there is a great possibility that  North Korea has transferred initiative for economic policies  from the Workers' Party of North Korea to the Administration  Council as part of a policy attaching great importance to  professionalism rather than partisanship.</p>

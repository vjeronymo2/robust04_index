			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Genetics provides clues to history: British Association for the Advancement of Science BRITAIN'S history of conquest and colonisation is reflected in genetic differences within the population, the meeting heard. Professor Derek Roberts, a genetic anthropologist at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, demonstrated how Orkney islanders are a breed apart, while descendants of Vikings could be alive and well in the Lake District. Prof Roberts explained how, using blood grouping and other variable protein markers, he has traced the British population's heterogenous origins. He suggested that a trend in the distribution of people with the blood group O reflects the push of the original neolithic Britons north and westwards, ending up isolated in Scotland, Ireland and Wales, while Orkney islanders could be the relics of an ancient population relegated to the far north. They were found to be genetically distinct from mainland Scotland, with a very high frequency of the rare blood group B and the highest level of multiple sclerosis in the UK. People who live in the central Lake District resemble Norwegians more closely than their neighbours in Carlisle and could be descendants of Viking raiders, he said. US researchers have identified 12 distinct genetic boundaries in the UK, implying a different heritage for each group. Prof Roberts said these probably represented remnants of settlements in the distant past.</p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: IF THE RIVER WAS WHISKEY BY T. CORAGHESSAN BOYLE (PENGUIN:  $7.95)  </P> <P> Like teddy bears wrapped in barbed wire, the characters in T. Coraghessan  Boyle's award-winning collection of short stories conceal an aching  vulnerability behind a thorny shield. Boyle is an often devastating commentator  on Los Angeles and the weirdos, wanna-bes and mountebanks who congregate here.  </P> <P> A down-and-out immigrant stunt man risks mutilation and death to achieve  fleeting immortality in the supermarket tabloids. A sleazy press agent faces  the monumental task of improving the Ayatollah's public image. A  security-system saleswoman preys on yuppie paranoia with carefully orchestrated  stories of psychotic attackers: A murder she inadvertently provokes becomes the  choicest grist for her mill. This acerbic, scrupulously observed portrait of  contemporary Southern California is apt to confirm the reader's most dire  suspicions about the people next door.  </P></p>

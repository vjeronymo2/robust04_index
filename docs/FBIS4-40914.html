			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "GOLOS ARMENII" dailies),  06/18/94 -- Three delegations of the World Bank have arrived to  Yerevan together with its representative to Armenia Vahram  Nersisyan.    Before implementation, World Bank projects need to have  analytic basis, which is being prepared by mentioned delegations.    One of them will be dealing with a social investment  program,  mainly to alleviate the consequences of privatization and,  particularly, to slow down the increasing unemployment rate.  The other delegation will prepare a project of economic  structural changes. Third will investigate the current economic  conditions in the republic and prepare measures for economic  improvements.    In Vahram Nersisyan's opinion, some $50-100 mln are needed  for general economic improvements in Armenia. Nevertheless,  large credits are difficult to obtain, as sources of finances  are not quite sure they will be able to get their money back  consistently and in time.    Credits for mentioned preparatory operations are given not  to  the government of the republic, but to executive organizations  and their foreign specialists. In other words, the credit is  given to Armenia, but the money is paid to foreign specialists,  who work for development of projects for Armenia. The debt is,  naturally, to be paid by Armenia.    Armenia is not the only country in the region, which  appeared  in such conditions. The World Bank will give a similar credit  to support structural changes in Azerbaijan, which will have to  pay it back in the same way.    According to the Armenian representative of the World Bank,  these are "first window" credits. "Second window" credits will  provide money to financial structures of the republic. Similar  credits have been particularly received by Russia and Baltic  republics. Armenia has never received such credits so far.  Structural changes credit of $12 mln., $28 mln. credit for the  earthquake zone and $40 mln. for the irrigation system project  have been allocated for Armenia. The latter has not been  affirmed yet, but $1.5 mln. have already been allocated for  analytic work. Another $30 mln. of energy credit is to be  acknowledged by the end of the year.    Vahram Nersisyan promises that, if peace is stable, he will  aspire to doubling and tripling the credits to Armenia so that  it receives $200-300 mln. from the World Bank yearly.</p>

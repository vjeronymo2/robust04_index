			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- Russian Vice-Premier Sergey  Shakhray does not rule out that the president of Chechnya "can  become a political leader who would normalize relations with the  Russian Federation." Talking to newsmen, Shakhray did not name  the dates of the meeting between the leaders of Russia and  Chechnya, but noted that such a meeting should be prepared.    Taking part in an all-Russia Conference on Federalism and  Interethnic Relations, Shakhray emphasised that relations with  Chechnya will be regulated on a negotiatory basis with bodies of  power and all political forces, and will include free and fair  democratic elections in the republic as a legal way out of the  political crisis."    Shakhray said that the State Duma had accepted the Russian  president's logic and has reproduced it in a resolution. The  government has been directed to hold consultations with  Chechnya's power bodies and political forces. The object of the  consultations will be the draft treaty on the delimitation of  subjects of control and authority. The treaty will be signed  under the condition that Chechnya holds the elections, the  deputy emphasised.    There is no other way to "overcome the decision adopted by  the Fifth Congress of People's Deputies on the illegality of  elections in Chechnya," according to Sergey Shakhray. At the  same time, he explained that at the present, no ultimatum is  being issued as to when and under what conditions the elections  are to be held.</p>

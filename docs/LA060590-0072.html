			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> APPEAL COURT UPHOLDS JAIL TIME FOR ANTI-ABORTION ATTORNEY;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: THE RULING AGAINST OPERATION RESCUE'S LAWYER IS THE GROUP'S SECOND  SETBACK IN TWO WEEKS.  </P> <P> Anti-abortion lawyer Cyrus Zal, slapped with a 90-day jail term by an El Cajon  judge, was ordered Monday to report to jail by a San Diego appeals court that  found his sentence justified.  </P> <P> The Folsom-based lawyer was ordered to show up at the San Diego County Jail on  June 15 by the 4th District Court of Appeal, which rejected his appeal of the  contempt-of-court citations that El Cajon Municipal Court Judge Larrie R.  Brainard imposed at a February trial.  </P> <P> Zal was cited for repeatedly ignoring Brainard's order not to discuss abortion  in the case, in which the lawyer represented six anti-abortion advocates  convicted of trespass in connection with a protest last October in La Mesa.  </P> <P> Zal had been dispatched to the trial by the anti-abortion group Operation  Rescue, which he then served as general counsel. The rejection of his appeal  marked another in a recent series of legal and financial setbacks suffered both  in San Diego and around the nation by the militant organization.  </P> <P> Known for his ever-present Bible and for making it clear that he wishes to use  the trials of abortion protesters as a platform for debating and condemning  abortion, Zal, 42, said Monday that he was "saddened but was not surprised" by  the appellate court decision.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid that the judicial system seems to have lost its conscience and any  sense of morality, and they are simply protecting a system that protects  child-killing," he said.  </P> <P> The 4th District court delayed the imposition of Zal's jail term by 10 days,  giving him time to appeal to the California Supreme Court. Zal said Monday he  will probably pursue that avenue if he can raise $10,000 to cover his costs.  </P> <P> But the three-judge 4th District panel also suggested Zal is unlikely to  succeed in a subsequent appeal. In its opinion, the panel detailed the reasons  for its decision -- an unusual action, considering the case was the kind in  which courts commonly announce only a summary approval or rejection -- and  called Brainard "patient and even-handed."  </P> <P> The trial stemmed from a protest last Oct. 21 at the Family Planning Associates  clinic in La Mesa. Before the trial began, Brainard ordered Zal not to discuss  the morality of abortion in court, saying it was not relevant in a trespass  trial.  </P> <P> After citing Zal for contempt 20 times during the trial for disobeying that  order, Brainard sentenced him Feb. 2 to 90 days in jail and a $10,000 fine.  </P> <P> Zal's sentence could reach 290 days. The lawyer told the judge he could not  afford the $10,000 fine -- and wouldn't pay it even if he could -- so Brainard  gave him the option of paying it off at $50 for each additional day in jail, or  200 days.  </P> <P> In its opinion, the 4th District court noted that Brainard immediately held a  hearing each time Zal violated his order not to refer to abortion and gave the  lawyer a chance to explain his conduct.  </P> <P> Although Brainard cited Zal 20 times, the judge "did not act precipitously or  capriciously," the appeal court said. "Indeed, (Brainard) was patient and  even-handed."  </P> <P> "The jail sentence and fines do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment,"  Judge Gilbert Nares said.  </P> <P> Judges Howard Wiener and Patricia Benke also took part in the appeal. The  opinion did not indicate whether the ruling was unanimous or split.  </P> <P> If he can afford to appeal Monday's decision, Zal said, the appeal will rely on  a technicality of legal procedure.  </P> <P> Though Brainard issued a written order Feb. 1 detailing the contempt citations,  Zal said proper procedure demands that the judge issue a written order each  time he issued a contempt citation. The 4th District court, which was presented  with that claim, rejected it.  </P> <P> In another trial last fall in Fresno, Zal was handed a 16-day jail term for  contempt but never served it, winning an appeal.  </P> <P> The court decision Monday handed Operation Rescue its second significant court  loss in two weeks.  </P> <P> On May 21, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a ruling banning Operation Rescue  activists from blocking access to New York clinics and fining the organization  $70,000 for harassing women seeking abortions.  </P> <P> The fine seems certain to add to the financial and management difficulties the  militant group has experienced in recent months.  </P> <P> In April, Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry announced that he was stepping  down from day-to-day leadership of the group. Two months earlier, Terry had  disclosed that the group was closing its Binghamton, N.Y., national  headquarters because of debt.  </P> <P> Zal said he resigned as general counsel to Operation Rescue last month, forced  to "branch out in other fields to try to pay the bills."  </P> <P> In San Diego, meanwhile, anti-abortion protesters arrested last year at clinic  blockades suffered overwhelming losses in jury trials last fall and earlier  this year, prompting dramatic alterations in the style and form of local  demonstrations against abortion.  </P> <P> Rather than rally at one clinic, where police would arrest dozens of people,  anti-abortion advocates have taken to brief, simultaneous protests at a number  of clinics, where arrests have been minimal. Abortion protests also have been  staged along Harbor Drive, with thousands of activists holding signs and  forming what they call a "life chain."  </P> <P> In March, confirming the change in strategy, Zal said San Diego anti-abortion  forces were no longer interested in putting police and courts "through all this  unnecessary work."  </P></p>

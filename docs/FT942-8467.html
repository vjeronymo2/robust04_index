			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / People: More changes at CountyGlen There appears to be a game of musical chairs going on in the boardroom of CountyGlen, the Dublin-based property investor. Alan Sherry, the chairman who was appointed last September, has announced the replacement of Richard King, the chief executive, by Niall Duggan, a British-based Irish businessman, and has requested the resignation of another director, Clayton Love. Love has refused to comply with the request however, which Sherry said he 'very much regretted'. Daniel Hardie, a Canadian stockbroker, quit as a director at the beginning of this month, less than three months after joining the board. Hank Vanderkam, a US lawyer, resigned from the board in April. He had joined at the same time as King last September, after the largest shareholding in the company - a 16.2 per cent stake owned by John Teeling, a former chairman - was sold to a British Virgin island company Wyndham Trading, beneficially owned by Sarah Buzze Sharpe, a US stockbroker, for IPounds 500,000. A High Court inspector was appointed in January, at the request of the minister for enterprise and employment, to investigate whether CountyGlen's own money was used to finance that transaction, in violation of company law and which, if proven, might have been prejudicial to other shareholders. Trading in CountyGlen shares was suspended on the Dublin stock exchange last October 'until such time as the company has a business which satisfies the requirements of the official list'. Sharpe, who was appointed to the board in February, this week left the board and sold her stake to Duggan for an undisclosed sum. The inspector is to present an interim report of his investigation to the Dublin High Court next month.</p>

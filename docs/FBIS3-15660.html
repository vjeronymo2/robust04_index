			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov and </F> Vyacheslav Tomilin]    [Text] Beijing, 8 Mar -- The Chinese leadership has  reiterated its firm stance that violent alterations of borders  and attacks against the territorial integrity of states are  inadmissable. This approach is exceptionally important for  Baku, Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev said in Beijing today.    The visit, which has made it possible to establish good  relations at the level of the two countries' top leadership, has  opened up new prospects for the further development of ties  between China and Azerbaijan, which is going through a difficult  period in its history, he stressed at a news conference. "We  attach great significance to this, bearing in mind the important  place China occupies in the international economic system and in  world politics," the president of Azerbaijan said.    Geydar Aliyev said that the talks with PRC President Jiang  Zemin and today's conversation with State Council Premier Li  Peng enabled him to talk in detail about the situation in the  republic and the region as a whole and, primarily, about the  Armenian-Azerbaijani armed conflict.    "Azerbaijan," the president stressed, "does not want a war,  is striving for a cessation of hostilities, and wants a  settlement of the conflict by peaceful means. However, the  unconditional withdrawal of Armenian armed formations from the  occupied territories of Azerbaijan and the guarantee of  Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and the inviolability of its  borders are absolute conditions." He linked the possibility of  reviewing the status of Nagorno-Karabakh with fulfillment of  these conditions.    Replying to a question from an ITAR-TASS correspondent,  Geydar Aliyev said: "Azerbaijani-Russian relations are normal,  good, and friendly. Until recently, there were difficulties  between the two countries, mainly because of the stance of the  former leadership of Azerbaijan. Since the second half of last  year relations have been improving. During my recent meeting in  Moscow with President Boris Yeltsin, we agreed on measures to  remove obstacles to the development of ties." Touching on the  role of the Russian Federation in halting the Karabakh conflict,  he noted that Russia has been constantly participating in the  settlement process but so far there have been no results.  During the recent meeting between the defense ministers of  Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow, an accord was reached  on a cease-fire from 1 March and the withdrawal of Armenian  armed formations from the territory of Azerbaijan. However,  because of the actions of the Armenian side, this has been  breached, Geydar Aliyev said.    Tomorrow the president of Azerbaijan flies to Shanghai.</p>

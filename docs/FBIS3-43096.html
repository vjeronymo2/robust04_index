In many  situations changes in the value of h_n_[.sup]m[/] with  irradiation can also be caused by the dependence of the  h_n_[.sup]m[/] on the excitation intensity of the  photoluminescence L, i.e. on the concentration of excess  minority current carriers. The concentration is significantly  reduced with increased irradiation dose , resulting in a  shift of the position of maximum luminescence h_n_[.sup]m[/]  with irradiation, and appearance of a dose dependence  h_n_[.sup]m[/](), if h_n_[.sub]m[/]=(L). Graphs were   obtained of the maximum position of impurity radiation  h_n_[.sup]m[/] as a function of the irradiation dose by fast  neutrons , measured in p-GaAs(Zn) for various excitation  intensity L and concentrations of excess electrons n. The  graphs indicate that in the irradiated crystals, the  luminescence maximum h_n_[.sup]m[/] is shifted into the  low-energy region, if measurements are made at large L. However,  the maximum does not change its position if the measurements are  made either at small L, of under conditions n=const. Figures  2, references 12: 7 Russian, 5 Western.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / With strings attached: Does the independence of UK auditors require greater protection What is the difference between an auditor and an airport luggage trolley?' asks Sir David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, the body which decides how financial information is presented in the UK. 'The trolley has a mind of its own.' The jibe does not endear him to many of his colleagues. But their sensitivity illustrates a nagging problem facing the profession: is the independence of auditors being compromised by the commercial relationship they have with the executive managers on whom they report? The debate has rumbled for many years but today the Auditing Practices Board, which sets auditing standards, moves a step closer to proposing changes to the way in which the profession works that could protect the independence of the accountants. It is to discuss a series of proposals for reform, expected to be published later this year. 'It is the tension in auditing,' says Mr David Hatherly, professor of accounting at Edinburgh University and a member of the board, who presented a paper suggesting radical measures for enhancing auditors' independence to the European Accounting Association in Venice earlier this year. At the heart of the debate is an auditor's legal duty to give shareholders an assurance that a company's accounts present 'a true and fair view' of its financial position each year. The possibility of a conflict of interest arises because auditors normally report to, and are paid, hired and fired by, the company's directors. Management often has an interest in presenting financial information in a way that differs from the insight into corporate performance desired by shareholders. Two years ago a 'green paper' by the Auditing Practices Board, which led to today's discussion, noted that auditors often referred mistakenly to executive management, rather than shareholders, as 'the client'. Increasing the pressure for some kind of reform in the past few years has been the failure of a number of fraudulent companies which had their accounts approved as 'true and fair' without qualification by the auditors. Examples include Polly Peck International, Maxwell Communication Corporation, and the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Other companies have had their accounts approved by auditors only for the Financial Reporting Review Panel, which enforces accounting standards, to order amendments because of breaches of the rules. In the past three years, almost 20 companies have been forced by the panel to restate their accounts. Auditors admit privately to sometimes stretching accounting standards to the limit to further the interests of directors without breaking formal obligations to shareholders. Many auditors 'approve things that just about cross the line (into acceptability) but do not serve the shareholder,' says Prof Hatherly of Edinburgh University. The pressure auditors face is that if they refuse to bend to the wishes of a company's management, they may lose their contract. The process can be subtle. The directors will rarely fire the auditor. Rather, Sir David says, they will suggest that the firm's costs are too high and the audit should be put out to tender. The incumbent firm rarely wins. One senior accountant says: 'Some of my colleagues scratch their heads, suck their pencils and look at the audit fees.' A partner in a large accountancy firm mentions the name of a large, well-known organisation and says: 'If I lost it as a client, I would have to consider my future with the partnership.' As competition between accountants has intensified, fears of upsetting companies have risen. 'I think in the 1980s commercialism really almost overtook professionalism,' says Sir David. 'The sheer competition outweighed judgment. Auditors would approve accounts that were acceptable rather than right.' Many accountants argue the climate has now changed. In the 1980s auditors often found that companies were prepared to bring in lawyers to exploit to the full loopholes in the professional standards. Mr Ian Plaistowe, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board and senior partner with accountants Arthur Andersen, says: 'It was much more difficult in the 1980s to resist pressure. There were no yardsticks, accounting standards were looser, and lawyers were not doing us any favours.' Now, Mr Plaistowe argues, standards have been tightened and the setting up of the FinanCial Reporting Review Panel in 1991 has strengthened the hand of the auditors. Furthermore, he says, while auditors' independence will always create tensions, his firm has never allowed pressure from directors to jeopardise its objectivity. Like many accountancy firms, Arthur Andersen brings in other partners, not directly involved in the audit, to adjudicate when a company proposes contentious accounting techniques. Nevertheless the Auditing Practices Board believes that the potential for conflict remains serious enough to warrant a thorough review. One radical suggestion to be discussed today is the creation of a government - or Stock Exchange - controlled audit commission which would be responsible for the annual appointment and remuneration of auditors to all companies. But even strong critics of the current system, such as Prof Hatherly believe this idea would create a remote, impractical and bureaucratic system. He suggests instead a 'shareholder panel' selected from among a company's investors, to which auditors would be directly accountable. The panel might also be responsible for the selection and payment of auditors. Prof Hatherly is unlikely to win a majority for his proposals at today's meeting. Instead the Auditing Practices Board is expected, in its report later this year, to call for a strengthening of the role of independent, non-executive directors in supervising auditors. It is likely to press for a greater role for audit committees of non-executive directors, already recommended as 'best practice' for companies, suggesting these committees should be responsible for appointing and paying auditors as well as receiving the auditor's report. Prof Hatherly, however, says that establishing a direct link between auditors and shareholders through a shareholder panel is the only real long-term solution if the interests of investors are to be paramount. 'I feel that if something is conceptually wrong you can patch it up but in time the cracks show again.'</p>

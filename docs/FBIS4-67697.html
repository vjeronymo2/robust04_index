			<p>CSO     [Text] Guayaquil -- Edgardo Montalvo, president of the  College of Physicians of the Province of Guayas, has stated that  the country is experiencing an epidemic of malaria. He announced  that there are at least 100,000 cases of the disease, of which  46,200 have been reported by the National Service for the  Eradication of Malaria (SNEM).    Montalvo said that he is deeply concerned. He stated that in  1992 39,600 positive cases of malaria were reported to the SNEM,  which means about 72,000 total cases, since it is estimated that  for each reported case of malaria there is another case which  has not been reported.    In 1993 46,200 positive cases were reported to the SNEM,  which would amount to a total of 100,000 persons affected by the  disease. He stressed that in Guayaquil alone 12 persons died of  malaria in 1993. He attributed the increased number of cases to  the fact that there has not been a continuous process of  spraying within and outside the home. He said that the principal  officials of the SNEM are not specialists in the matter, and  AID, the Agency for International Development, has stopped  providing assistance to the SNEM, due to a series of labor,  morale, and economic instability problems which have arisen.  Montalvo said that the Province of Esmeraldas, where there are  more than 12,000 cases of malaria, has become the area most  seriously affected by the disease. Of those cases of malaria  about 7,000 are of the so-called malignant type (Falsiparo) and  more than 5,000 cases are of the so-called benign type (Viva).    The Province of Guayas comes next with somewhat less than  12,000 cases, 6,000 of which are of the benign type and 5,000 of  the malignant type. In the Province of Manabi there are 7,000  cases of benign malaria and 3,000 cases of malignant malaria. In  the other coastal Provinces of Los Rios and El Oro, as well as  adjacent upland areas in the Province of Austro, there are also  about 15,000 cases of malaria.</p>

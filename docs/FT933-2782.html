			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Election delays Greek sell-off: Fears grow that socialist victory will mean a reversal of policy GREECE'S privatisation programme has ground to a halt ahead of next month's election, amid fears that if the socialists come to power it will be immediately abandoned. The programme, which was expected to raise more than Dr400bn (Pounds 1.1bn) by next spring, had started to pick up speed. Despite fierce trade union resistence, legislation was passed during the summer permitting the partial privatisation of OTE, the state telecommunications monopoly, and the private operation of new power plants. A senior Greek official said yesterday that it would be impossible to keep the privatisation procedure alive during the election campaign. 'Potential bidders are not interested because of the uncertainty,' he said. Senior privatisation officials have already submitted their resignations. The sale of a 35 per cent stake in OTE to an international telecoms operator, due to go through at the end of the year, is now in doubt. The socialist Pasok party, which is ahead in the opinion polls, has made opposition to the sale an important election issue. The socialists are also against private power generation for all but small-scale projects to develop solar and wind energy resources. The future of a Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 970m) project to build a new airport for Athens, awarded last month to a German consortium led by Hochtief, also looks uncertain. At the very least, the start of construction will be delayed because the deal must be ratified by the incoming parliament. However, the terms agreed by the government, which give the German partners a majority shareholding in a new company set up to build and manage the airport, would be subject to review if there was a change in government. Socialist parliamentarians have already called for an investigation. They claim that there is a lack of transparency in the deal. Procedures for the sale of two state-owned oil refineries, which are high on the government's list of priorities for disposal, have been frozen. The bidding process for a series of casino licences, due to be awarded this year, is also on hold. Observer, Page 17</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Goldsmiths active Goldsmiths Group, the multiple jeweller, provided the first hard news on Christmas and pre-Christmas sales, telling the market that UK sales for December were 13 per cent up on the same month last year and that sales for the 10 months to date were around 11 per cent higher. Goldsmiths also said that profits 'will be in excess of market expectations.' The company's shares raced up to 100p, but quickly encountered selling pressure and closed 2 off on balance at 89p. Food retailers provided one of the market's best performers in Kwik Save which built on Wednesday's good showing and closed a further 6 up at 624p. J Sainsbury, however, encountered hefty profit taking and settled 6 off at 449p as did Tesco 5 off at 215p. Bank shares, which played a major part in the upsurge in the market over the pre-Christmas period as investors focused on the probability of a sharp increase in profits and dividend payments as the property market improves, ran into bouts of profit-taking yesterday. The prospect of another reduction in UK interest rates in the short term also boosted sentiment. Much of this was said to have been triggered by the expiry of a significant over the counter options trade involving large numbers of bank shares. HSBC proved an exception, however, with the shares marked sharply better and touching a record 982p at one point before closing a net 12 higher at 958p; turnover in HSBC reached a hefty 5.4m shares. Standard Chartered, rushed up in recent weeks amid spurious takeover stories, fell 13 to 1234p. TSB, due to announce results on January 13, came under fire from selling from one of the big US investment banks and closed 11 off at 243p. Barclays, meanwhile, lost 8 to 634p, Lloyds 18 to 666p and NatWest 7 to 621p. Abbey National fell 5 to 513p on 2.4m traded. Merchant banks were hit by profit-taking and worries that some market trading firms could have been badly hit by the wild swings in the equity market in recent sessions. SG Warburg, one of the most influential marketmakers dropped 10 to 934p. Smith New Court eased 4 to 421p and Hambros gave up 10 to 392p. Shares in CE Heath, the insurance broker, slumped 11 to 403p as the company responded to recent intense takeover speculation by confirming it had been involved in takeover talks with Inchcape during the summer but that the discussions were suspended in September. Inchcape were hit by the news, closing 17 off at 562p. Press suggestions and recent building society indications that the housing market is poised for a significant upturn triggered a flurry of strong support for the housebuilders. Among the sector leaders Berkeley rose 5 more to 533p, and Wimpey 3 to 189p. But Wilson (Connolly) took pride of place in the sector, the shares steepling higher to close 13 up at a record 230p, still boosted by the recent Kleinwort Benson buy recommendation. Wilson Bowden 13 put on 10 to 509p and Alfred McAlpine 8 to 249p. CRH, the Irish building materials group was the outstanding performer in the sector, the shares closing 6 ahead at a year's best of 354p, after keen support from UK and Irish institutions. The big UK stocks, on the other hand, were affected by persistent bouts of selling pressure. RMC dropped 26 to 937p and Redland 10 to 584p. SmithKline Beecham failed to benefit from the announcement that it had received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to market Kytril, an injection to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with certain cancer therapy. The approval which covers use of the product in cancer patients of all ages, including children and the elderly but had been widely anticipated. The shares rose slightly after the news but fell with the market to close 5 off at 402p. Recently depressed Micro Focus, the computer software group, staged a strong rally after the Prudential insurance group increased its holding in the company by 1.13 per cent to 7.62 per cent. Micro Focus closed a net 28 higher at 1003p. They reached a peak Pounds 30 in mid-February, but plummeted to 903p at the beginning of December after the group issued a profits warning. Greycoat, the property group, saw its shares edge up a penny to 19p after the rump of the rights issue, was placed at 18p by SG Warburg Securities. Eurotunnel reaped the benefit of Wednesday's late announcement that the French and UK governments were extending the franchise period in exchange for dropping legal actions, The units gained 34 to 597p. Leisure group Granada lost 15 pence to 519 as the group extended its hostile Pounds 660m offer for LWT (Holdings) by two weeks. LWT which continued to advise shareholders to reject the bid, fell 20 to 605p. The market expects Granada to improve its terms with more attractive shares and cash options. Euro Disney, roughly handled earlier in the week after comments by Walt Disney chairman Michael Eisner, rallied 20 to 378p. Talk of bumper holiday bookings drove Airtours, the UK's leading holidays group, 2 better to 492p. Rank Organisation dipped 10 to 978p. MARKET REPORTERS: Peter John, Steve Thompson.

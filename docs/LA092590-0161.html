			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 2 VIEWS IN THE STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS;  </P> <P> DOCUMENTARIES: FILMMAKERS EXAMINE THE LIVES OF TRAILBLAZER ADAM CLAYTON POWELL  JR. AND THE LEGACY OF EARL WARREN AND COURTROOM ACTIVISM.  </P> <P> There could scarcely have been two more different men in public life than Earl  Warren and Adam Clayton Powell Jr., yet both had a profound effect on civil  rights legislation in the 20th Century.  </P> <P> Their remarkable and engrossing stories are well-told in Richard Kilberg's  54-minute "Adam Clayton Powell" and Bill Jersey and Judith Leonard's 88-minute  "Super Chief: The Life and Legacy of Earl Warren," which screen together  tonight at 8 at UCLA's Melnitz Theater as the first offering in the Academy of  Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and UCLA Film Archive's Academy/Contemporary  Documentary series.  </P> <P> Powell, who was to head the largest Protestant congregation in America and  become the country's most powerful black politician, was a tall, movie-star  handsome orator-playboy born to wealth and position. For decades, he fought  boldly and effectively for the rights of his people while at the same time  living high with a succession of beautiful wives.  </P> <P> His story is the stuff of tragedy, his downfall brought about by his flagrant  self-indulgence and tax troubles -- both of which played into the hands of his  enemies. How sad it is to hear this man, who did so much to lay the groundwork  for the civil rights revolution of the '60s, sneer at Martin Luther King Jr.  </P> <P> The many people who knew and worked with Powell suggest persuasively that, for  all his well-publicized peccadilloes, he was more sinned against than sinning.  Sadly, the hard-drinking man we see aboard his yacht during his Bimini exile  surrounded by a bevy of women and nearing the end of his life brings to mind no  one so much as Errol Flynn.  </P> <P> In dizzying contrast, Warren -- who rose from Alameda County district attorney  to California attorney general, then governor and finally chief justice of the  United States -- was a staunch, devoted family man whose sense of fair play led  to the activist Warren Court, which handed down one civil rights decision after  another that would have enormous and ongoing effect upon American society.  </P> <P> The great irony of Warren's life, which the filmmakers cannot avoid (but leave  you feeling strongly that they wish they could have) is that as California's  attorney general (and soon-to-be governor), he strongly advocated placing  Japanese-Americans in concentration camps. The filmmakers emphasize that Warren  subsequently regretted this stand deeply and was haunted by it for the rest of  his life.  </P> <P> Yet they downplay this dark chapter in Warren's otherwise exemplary life to the  extent that it tends to undercut the case they make for Warren as a great man,  someone who in the view of his own grandson, stood for that which was "beyond  the expedient."  </P> <P> For more information: (213) 206-FILM, 206-8013, 278-8990.  </P></p>

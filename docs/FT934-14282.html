			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Economics: French interest rates under pressure A POOR figure for French manufacturing output in July and August this week, may intensify pressure on the French authorities to relax interest rates. The decline in industrial production this year has been the fastest for 10 years, yet the government has held interest rates high to protect the value of the franc. Falls in the car and household goods sectors have been mainly responsible for the sharp drop in overall output, and in recent months there have been signs that the deterioration of the two sectors is slowing. None the less, a poor figure will reinforce the case for monetary easing. Similarly significant is this week's release of German money supply figures. The consensus puts the annualised rise of M3 in September at about 7 per cent. In August, M3 rose an annualised 7.2 per cent, boosted by the Bundesbank's foreign exchange interventions during the European exchange rate mechanism crisis of late July. Since then, the central bank appears to have made good progress in sterilising inflows of D-Marks by keeping liquidity tight. Many analysts believe M3 will come back towards the upper end of its 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range by the end of the year. Other highlights of the week follow.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In initiating action to revoke the recognition of an NRTL to perform testing and evaluation to MSHA requirements, the proposed rule would require that the procedures for revocation established in Appendix A to 1910.7 be followed. Under those procedures, OSHA is required to provide the recognized NRTL notice in writing of the alleged deficiencies, giving the NRTL the opportunity to rebut or correct the alleged deficiencies within a reasonable period. If the deficiencies are not corrected or reconciled within the time period provided, OSHA would propose, in writing, to revoke the recognition. The revocation would be effective in 60 days unless within that period the recognized NRTL corrects the deficiencies or requests a hearing in writing. If a hearing is requested, it would be held before an administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Department of Labor according to the rules specified in 29 CFR part 1905, subpart C. In the hearing, the burden of proof would be on OSHA to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the recognition should be revoked based on the causes alleged in the proposed notice of revocation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under paragraph E.3., Final Decision, of Appendix A, the ALJ would issue a decision based on the entirety of the record as to whether the recognition should be revoked. Exceptions to the ALJ decision would be accepted for 20 days. If no exceptions were filed, this would become the final decision of the Assistant Secretary of OSHA. If exceptions are filed, the ALJ decision, the exceptions filed, and the entire file would be forwarded to the Assistant Secretary for OSHA for final decision. A copy of the Assistant Secretary's final decision on the revocation would be provided to the NRTL and a notification would be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  announcing the decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.20 Use of Equivalent Testing and Evaluation Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;6.20 (a) and (b) would permit MSHA, and appropriately recognized NRTLs, when requested by the applicant for product approval, to use international, consensus, or other recognized approval requirements that differ from those set forth in existing MSHA regulations to test and evaluate certain mining equipment after MSHA has determined that such requirements are ``equivalent'' or can be enhanced to provide equivalency. Part 7 would not be affected by this proposed provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that this proposal would encourage a more rapid introduction of mining products embodying new technology with enhanced safety features. In addition, testing and evaluation to ``equivalent'' requirements, that provide the same or a greater degree of protection to miners as those set forth in the various MSHA product approval regulations, would stimulate metric conversion, lead to greater compatibility with international standards, and provide a more competitive posture for U.S. products in the international market. Implementation of this provision would enable manufacturers of U.S. mining equipment or products to obtain MSHA's certification that their equipment meets both the MSHA regulatory requirements and the equivalent international, consensus, or other recognized requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MSHA would decide which alternative requirements for product approval it would evaluate for ``equivalency.'' This decision would be based on factors such as the potential to provide enhanced safety, the extent of usage of the alternative requirements, the needs of the U.S. mining industry, the complexity of the candidate requirements, the difficulty in ensuring equivalency, and the Agency resources available to address the determination. The evaluation would be conducted by the Agency's Approval and Certification Center using personnel with expertise in the approval requirements involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposal, once MSHA has determined that equivalent requirements exist or that certain requirements, other than those in MSHA approval regulations, can be enhanced to provide equivalency, the applicant would be given the option of requesting that MSHA accept testing and evaluation of the applicant's product using the ``equivalent'' requirements rather than those found in the applicable product approval regulations. This option would permit the manufacturer to design a machine or product to a single set of requirements acceptable to both MSHA and other market areas, rather than designing separate machines to comply with the separate requirements of each market place in which business is sought.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because this proposal would permit approval of mining equipment intended to compete in multiple market areas with differing approval requirements, the approved product design would incorporate the highest level of safety required by any of the intended market areas. For example, if the target markets include the United States and another nation that has more stringent approval requirements for a specific product, MSHA would have the authority, at the request of the applicant, to issue an approval based on testing and evaluation to the more stringent requirements. The approval documentation would state that the product had fulfilled the more stringent requirements in addition to those of MSHA. In this case, the approved product sold in the U.S. would have a higher degree of safety than that specified by MSHA under existing requirements. Should the targeted foreign market area have product approval requirements which are, in some aspects, less stringent than those of MSHA, the applicant would be required to fulfill the foreign target area's requirements and, in addition, any other tests, evaluations, or enhancements necessary to ensure that the product is at least as safe as that demanded by the MSHA approval requirements. In this situation, the approved product would exceed the safety requirements of the foreign target area and be no less safe than required by MSHA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

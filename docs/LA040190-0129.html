			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENOUGH WATER FOR EVERYBODY?  </P> <P> Visionary that he was, William Mulholland was never content with having only as  much water as Los Angeles and Southern California needed, but to always have  more than enough so that the region could accommodate the growth that was sure  to come. Not only did Mulholland bring the Owens River more than 200 miles to  Los Angeles early in the century, he created the Metropolitan Water District of  Southern California in the 1920s to reach across the desert to pull in an  even-grander supply of Colorado River water. In the 1960s, Metropolitan went  further afield to pursue another notion of Mulholland's: to capture an  additional supply from Northern California.  </P> <P> As historian Kevin Starr has written, Southern California invented itself  through these great water projects. And the California dream could be nourished  and expanded seemingly forever if there always was enough water. But today,  even the lineal keepers of the Mulholland flame are realizing that such dreams  have limits. In an extraordinary seminar this past week, the 51-member  Metropolitan board of directors debated openly for the first time the wisdom of  Met's most fundamental tenet: Whether the agency should, or could, continue to  promise water to all additional comers within its 5,200-square-mile service  area ranging from Ventura County to San Diego.  </P> <P> There was no formal action, but the fact that the Met board of directors would  even ponder such an heretical premise is significant. In the past, the board  has been criticized as a creaky bastion of a putative establishment held  captive by the dreams of a bygone era.  </P> <P> Not that there's a revolution imminent at Met headquarters on Sunset Boulevard:  The challenged annexations to Met territory are relatively insignificant. Still  intact is the "Laguna Declaration" of 1952 that codified the Mulholland ideal  that Met, as the monopoly water importer for Southern California, would meet  all demands. Nor has revisionist thought polluted all Met directors. One  declared Wednesday: "Let's get the damn water and deliver it." But Met's  supplies are being crimped from all sides. The shortages caused by the current  four-year drought are but a symptom of what will be normal in the near future  unless new supplies are developed. That water will not come from more giant  projects but through modern management that includes conservation programs,  water exchanges with agricultural users and the ability to work with old  Northern California adversaries.  </P> <P> To these ends the Met staff under General Manager Carl Boronkay already has  shown some leadership. And the new board chairwoman, Lois Krieger of Riverside,  has demonstrated a willingness to lead Met in new directions. With the support  of an enlightened and flexible board, Met can structure itself to provide the  water this region will need in the 21st Century. This process may lack the  grandeur of the big water projects of the past, but it is no less visionary.  </P></p>

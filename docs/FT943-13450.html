			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Survey of Japan (10): The triangle breaks - A look at the end of a political era Seismic upheavals in Japanese politics over the past year have caused the old power structure to shift and crumble, but a new one has yet to take its place. The dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has just returned to power after spending nearly a year in opposition for the first time in its 39-year life, has been terminally damaged. Unstable coalition governments may be the norm for the next few years. Japan's conservative post-war rulers were only able to seize power three weeks ago thanks to the support of their lifetime enemies in the left wing Social Democratic Party, a telling sign of how completely the old balance of power has been upset. It could take several general elections before stability returns. As so often in Japan, underlying change is not as fast as it looks on the surface. The LDP's defeat in a general election last year, precipitated by the defection of reform-minded politicians from its own ranks, led by Mr Tsutomu Hata and his mentor Mr Ichiro Ozawa, ushered in what looked like a radical seven-party coalition. Led by an idealistic former prefectural governor, Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, it embraced a wide range of interests from the religious right to the extreme left and promised to introduce a new poltical style and structure. Mr Hosokawa won instant popularity by staking his job on achieving parliamentary agreement on a new political and electoral system designed to curb corruption. The Keidanren, Japan's powerful business federation, recognised that the old system was really on the way out when it decided, days after Mr Hosokawa's arrival, to stop channelling funds to political parties. Keidanren cash, in return for a guarantee that government would be sensitive to big manufacturing industry's voice, was crucial to binding the so-called iron triangle of business, politicians and the bureaucracy together. The LDP's return in no way tempts the Keidanren to change its ban on political donations, says its new chairman, Mr Shoichiro Toyoda. Failure to deliver on political reform, under debate for the previous five years, had contributed to the decline of two former LDP prime ministers. So it was no surprise that Mr Hosokawa had to water down his proposals to obtain agreement from the reluctant LDP and SDP old-guards, many of whom fear they will lose their seats under the new system. The final plan, agreed in January, will tightly regulate political fund raising and replace Japan's unique multi-seat constituency system with a mixture of single seat districts and proportional representation. All that remains is for new electoral boundaries to be drawn, to reflect the new system and to increase the power of under-represented urban voters. The new government of Mr Tomiichi Murayama aims to complete this by the autumn. Soon after Mr Hosokawa's political reforms cleared parliament, his coalition was plunged into a divisive argument over tax. At this point, old style Japanese politics began to take its revenge. The LDP, resorting to a tactic used against itself while in government, blocked parliamentary debate on this year's budget to put pressure on Mr Hosokawa to disprove two not so serious allegations of personal financial impropriety. An increasingly tired and frustrated Mr Hosokawa joked over dinner with friends that he might as well resign. Two days later, in early April, he did just that, to the surprise of both his allies and enemies. The old order, in which decisions are made by consensus in backrooms rather than debated in open parliament, began to reassert itself. Evidence of this was a secretive deal between centre-right members of the coalition to form a parliamentary group, called Kaishin, or innovation, with the blessing of Mr Ozawa, the government's brilliant but accident prone backroom strategist. The SDP, the largest member of the coalition, promptly walked out in anger at being excluded. This deprived the government of a majority only hours after it had selected - ironically with SDP support - Mr Hata, the former foreign minister, as the new prime minister. From that moment, the Hata administration was doomed. The opposition consented to keep it in power only until the current year's budget, already three months overdue, had cleared parliament. Rather than lose a no-confidence motion supported by both the LDP and an angry SDP, Mr Hata stepped down after the budget and after just two months in office, in the hope of forming a majority coalition behind the scenes. It had been the shortest-lived Japanese government since 1945. In the event, Mr Hata and Mr Ozawa failed to attract the SDP back to their camp. In a desperate final bid for power, they fielded as their leadership candidate Mr Toshiki Kaifu, a reform-minded former LDP prime minister. The stratagem failed. Mr Kaifu lost a parliamentary vote to Mr Murayama, chairman of the SDP who agreed, in a flurry of last minute bargaining, to form a government with his old foe, the LDP. The wily Mr Ozawa's miscalculations consigned him - no doubt temporarily - to obscurity, just two years after he was poised to inherit the LDP's most powerful faction. The LDP-SDP marriage is strange by any standards. It remains to be seen whether the LDP's leader, Mr Yohei Kono, is better at working with a divided and erratic Socialist party than was Mr Hata, or whether the alliance will break up like its predecessor. The desire to stay in power may be strong enough to suppress policy differences. The past year's political power struggle has been greeted with polite bafflement by Japan's foreign partners. There is, however, a pattern to the chaotic political events of the past 12 months. Most political experts think that Japan is evolving from the one-party rule of the LDP era to a more or less evenly balanced system of two or three parties, capable of taking it in turns to govern. The LDP has been weakened, with the first round of defections that provided the foundations for the Hosokawa coalition and with the latest defection by Mr Kaifu, who wants to form a new party. All this has created a fragmented opposition of small moderate parties, which have begun to coalesce, with the formation of Mr Ozawa's Kaishin. The SDP and the tiny Japan Communist Party form a third group. The LDP's return to government might look like a step back in Japan's search for a new political system. Against that, there have been several steps forward in the past year. Firstly, there is the passage of the new laws on political reform. This makes change irreversible so long as this unpredictable new government does not have second thoughts about completing the new electoral boundaries. Secondly, there is the creation, for the first time since the war, of a moderate opposition capable of running a government. Finally, Japan has seen the beginnings of an open television and newspaper debate on policies, previously the domain of smoke-filled backrooms.</p>

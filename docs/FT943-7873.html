			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Barbarians at the Great Wall: Tony Walker and Shi Junbao on attempts to protect the Chinese language from foreign words China, which has striven in its long history to preserve the purity of its culture from 'barbarian' influences, appears to be girding itself for another battle against foreign invaders. This time, the arbiters of good taste and correct thought are increasingly concerned about what is seen as a foreign assault on the sanctity of the Chinese language, both written and spoken. Writing in the Guangming Daily newspaper this week, Mr Wang Tiekun, director of the Language Usage Bureau of the State Language Commission - guardian of the purity of written and spoken Chinese - warned that the adulteration of language revealed 'people's blind faith in things foreign'. 'One or two exotic words in conversation these days seems immediately to raise the speaker's status,' he said. 'Fix an exotic (foreign) name on a home-made product and it becomes a quality item.' Academic custodians of China's linguistic traditions appear no less concerned. At Beijing's Normal University, Professor Zhu Jinshun, professor of Chinese language, noted despairingly that the work of Cang Jie, regarded as the inventor of China's ideograms or word pictures, was being contaminated by those taking liberties with the written word. 'It seems there are many would-be Cang Jie's around today,' he observed. At a deeper level, officials and educationalists worry that the eagerness with which Chinese are grasping things foreign - from fashion to language - reveals a crisis of confidence in local culture. Like France, which has legislated to protect the French language, China is proposing to do the same with a draft bill, known as the Language and Characters Law, that would seek to prevent further adulteration of the written and spoken word. Standards would be laid down for the national spoken language of putonghua, literally standard Chinese, which is based on the Beijing dialect. Putonghua was adopted officially as the national language in 1956 in what China's communist rulers regard as one of their main contributions to unifying the country. Written Chinese would also be protected under the law by making it an offence to use foreign words in official publications, and in the media, which increasingly has been experimenting with exotic modes of expression. 'Foreign words,' said Mr Yuan Zhongrui of the State Language and Characters Regulatory Commission, 'should be banned from government reports, text books, government-sponsored newspapers and children's books.' But the authorities face enormous difficulties purging written and spoken language of foreign influence, not least because of the difficulties of translating everyday technical terms used in the west into Chinese. For example, Chinese publications have simply begun using the letter 'X' combined with guang meaning light, to refer to x-rays instead of characters giving a phonetic approximation of X. Likewise, ultrasound, which is extremely complicated to represent in Chinese ideograms, is symbolised by the letter 'B' combined with chao, meaning ultra. Compact disc, which would require four characters translated as ji guang chang die, literally 'laser singing disc', has become CD, quality control has become QC, and so on. The dawning of the age of modern communications in China has also brought with it words and sounds that defy easy translation. Thus a beeper, which has become a standard item in telephone-starved China, is referred to as a 'BP' combined with ji, meaning machine. No attempt has been made to transliterate Motorola, one the main purveyors of beepers which is pronounced simply 'Motuo-luo-la'. Among the more susceptible areas of Chinese language are those describing the night culture that has permeated China's cities since the passing of the gloomy Mao era. People now simply refer to a bar as a bar, instead of the traditional jiuba or 'wine shop'. A nightclub is, well, a nightclub, not a ye zhong hui. The pervasive karaoke bar is represented by Chinese characters for kala with OK tacked on. Language purists accuse the advertising industry of being one of the main culprits in the perversion of written and spoken Chinese, including an assault on basic grammar. Thus, advertising copywriters are turning adjectives and nouns into verbs in their effort to get their message across. For example, it has become fashionable in the advertising trade to employ the word health as a verb as in 'to health'. China's arbiters of language blame not only the west for the slide in standards, but also their brothers and sisters from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Cantonese soap operas have made a big impact across China, introducing words like 'mummy' and 'daddy' in place of 'mama' and 'baba' which are conventional putonghua. Official attempts to stop the rot do not necessarily find favour with modern Chinese writers. Wang Shuo, China's most popular modern writer whose earthy idioms have made him something of a cult figure, is scornful of the linguistic bureaucrats. 'It's inevitable that more and more foreign words should come into the language which is ever-changing,' he said. 'Let me ask those who are trying to safeguard the purity of the Chinese language: what and where is the purest Chinese? Show me] Even the Beijing word hutong (alleyways that criss-cross the old city) is borrowed from Mongolian.' Geremie Barme, an expert in Chinese language and author of books on art, literature and politics in China, is another who scoffs at the linguistic puritans. 'The purity of modern Chinese language is a fiction,' he says. Spoken and written Chinese during communist rule had been deadened by political jargon from Marxism-Leninism and the accompanying mass propaganda campaigns. Modern Chinese was 'immature' and tended to be devoid of subtlety of expression. By contrast, Mr Barme says, the use of language in Hong Kong and Taiwan is much richer. In one respect spoken Chinese has resisted foreign influences and that is in the use of profane language. 'We have many more swear words in Chinese so we don't need to borrow any more,' said Mr Yuan of the State Language and Characters Regulatory Commission.</p>

			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21): The cost is still outpacing inflation - Financing the Family / School fees / Only 20 per cent of parents are said to make plans. The rest pay out of capital or taxed income, or borrow Parents who want their children to attend private schools can be under no illusion as to the financial mountain ahead of them. Those who are now cooing over a pram could face a bill of more than Pounds 200,000 if they want their infant prodigy to be educated at a boarding school for 10 years. In today's money, that is roughly three times the cost of the 'average' house. Yet despite a recession that has cut a swathe through the incomes of many of the professional middle class, more than 600,000 children, or 7.5 per cent of the school population, now attend independent schools. One positive piece of good news for their parents is that annual school fees inflation, which has been in double figures for the past three years, has eased to around 4 to 5 per cent, according to the Independent Schools Information Service (Isis). If the government manages to make its public sector pay-freeze stick, this should also spill over into the independent sector. Labour costs absorb 75 to 80 per cent of a day school's costs, and 55 to 65 per cent of the expenses of a boarding school. But school fees inflation is down, not out, and it continues to outstrip price inflation. Dick Davison, deputy director of Isis, says: 'The most consistent piece of advice remains. Whatever the RPI, parents should assume that school fees inflation will be higher.' The message for parents who want a private education for their children is therefore simple: it is never too early to plan for future fees. Anne Feek, managing director of specialist financial adviser, the School Fees Insurance Agency (SFIA), says: 'If you are going to make the commitment to educate your children privately, you should make some provision. And there is a double value in planning. You not only reduce the costs; you secure your child's future. If anything happens to you, the money is there.' However, only 20 per cent of parents do any advanced planning, according to Joe Collins, managing director of specialist financial adviser Invest for School Fees. The others travel in hope, either paying immediate fees out of capital or their taxed income, or postponing the pain by using a loan scheme. Parents with capital have the easiest planning task - funding school fees in advance out of a lump sum can reduce the eventual bill by one half or even two thirds. Unfortunately, the economic times have dented the attractions of educational trusts, one favoured planning route. Payments from a trust are tax-free under current legislation, but contributions are used to buy an annuity and there is little incentive to lock into such an arrangement with interest rates at almost a 30-year low. As Charles Levitt-Scrivener, director of financial adviser Towry Law, says: 'At the moment, educational trusts are only for the really risk-averse investor.' Today's low interest rates have prompted the SFIA to launch a Versatile Education Plan that does not require funds to be locked into a fixed rate. Feek says the plan 'is still based on an annuity and still provides the tax advantage of an educational trust, but it has potential for growth while you are waiting to take the fees.' Composition fees, schemes operated by many schools, provide a discount on fees paid in advance. If the child will not attend the school for, say, four years, there could be a 50 per cent reduction in fees. Schools in the throes of a large expansion programme, and hungry for cash, tend to offer particularly keen deals. However, composition fees schemes can be inflexible, and parents who have any doubts as to whether their child will attend a particular school must ensure that a scheme is transferable. Apart from these two specialist vehicles, there is nothing abstruse about the component parts of a school fees plan. The trick is to package a mix of investment vehicles to provide secure funding when this is needed, while retaining sufficient flexibility to respond to changed needs. As Levitt-Scrivener says: 'The nightmare school fees clients are those who are mortgaged up to the hilt; involved in a divorce; and have just lost their job.' The design of any school-fees plan is dictated by four factors: the likely size of future bills; the parents' means; their attitudes to risk; and whether plans are to be funded out of capital or income. Traditionally, a series of with-profit endowment policies, maturing each year during the child's school life, have provided the backbone of many plans. But poor surrender values, and the possible tax consequences of early discontinuance, make the contracts unsuitable if fees are needed within 10 years, and Levitt-Scrivener believes that with-profits endowments 'are not very flexible now white-collar jobs are not as secure as they used to be'. Joe Collins remains an enthusiast, however. He says: 'In terms of planning ahead, the tried and tested with-profits system still works well, and much of the recent criticism has been unfair and unjustified.' Tax-privileged vehicles - Tessas, National Savings certificates, friendly society policies and personal equity plans - are also widely used in school fees plans, although Peps may not suit parents who want to secure a specific sum of money at a specific time. Collins warns: 'Those who rely on Peps are being lured by the tax relief. They are not looking at the inherent nature of the contract. Parents should not use only Peps and unit trusts for school fees planning when the market is so high.' In today's low-inflation, low-interest-rate environment, school fees planners should guard against over-optimism about future investment returns. It is also sensible to underpin investments with an insurance scheme, such as the Isis Educare, Future Term and Feesure arrangements. The death, disability or unemployment of a parent can torpedo the best-laid school fees plan. Borrowing is the last-resort option for parents who cannot pay fees out of their current resources. For instance, the Isis School Fees Special Reserve Account, a scheme offered in conjunction with financial adviser Claremont Savile, provides a borrowing facility secured on residential property. Interest rates mirror mortgage rates. Louise Challis, Claremont Savile's managing director, says that 80 per cent of those who use Special Reserve 'have not been able, or have not chosen, to plan ahead or haven't done enough. But Special Reserve is also suitable for those parents who can afford the fees, but do not choose to pay them at the present time.' Inevitably the slump in the housing market means that some parents have insufficient capital in their home to provide security for an additional loan. They must move into more expensive loan territory. For example, Sun Life's Policy Secured Plan provides a loan facility with the Royal Bank of Scotland, secured by a Sun Life policy. The interest charged is base rate plus 4.5 per cent, with a floor of 10 per cent. Finally, parents who run into fee-paying difficulties should not be too embarrassed to investigate whether there is scope for some horse-trading, particularly if they have more than one child. As one adviser says: 'Schools are like airlines, with the same high fixed costs and the same need to keep bums on seats. More sophisticated school bursars recognise this.'</p>

			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Dislocated professionals consider a bleak future: The white-collar crisis brought on by America's longest downturn since the 1930s EVEN UNDER grey winter skies, the US recession seems far removed from the wealthy enclave of sprawling summer homes and condominiums on South Carolina's lush Hilton Head Island. Business is brisk at the local pottery store, where tourists are hunting bargains at a 'half-price' sale. 'The recession is not the problem,' says the shop manager. 'It's jobs.' She gestures towards the inventory, imported from Portugal and China. Americans could produce the same pots, she says, but those jobs - like thousands of others - have gone elsewhere. At that moment, President George Bush was flying across the Pacific to try to open markets for US products. Even so, the shop manager felt he was neglecting the US domestic market, in which well-paid Americans once provided the base of US prosperity. Polls show the manager's concern is shared by Americans across the country. Job losses - or fear of them - cast a long shadow. The president's quest for 'jobs, jobs, jobs' through exports seems to offer only distant promise. Official government statistics suggest that this, the ninth US recession since the 1930s, is less severe than its predecessors. The Bureau of Labour Statistics says the total number of unemployed - 8.5m  - is less than it was a year ago and lower than at similar points in the 1981 and 1973 recessions. But it is the longest downturn since the Great Depression and is reaching beyond those manufacturing workers who are accustomed to lay-offs. The restructuring of the services sector and the trimming of management in the country's leading industries has inflicted job losses on middle-class, middle-aged managers and professionals. In November, 16 months after the US economy officially went into recession, employment of managers, technicians and other white-collar workers had fallen by 209,000, according to the Labour Department Household Survey. The same group had gained 836,000 jobs 16 months after the recession that began in 1981, and 794,000 after the one that started in November 1973. There is, however, widespread scepticism about the official unemployment figures. Mr Howard Rosen, a research associate at the International Institute of Economics, said the Labour Department figures tend to count only the 'immediately unemployed'. The long-term jobless are less likely to be included. One who would not be counted is Mr George Proper, 57, a former personnel director, who related a bleak saga of his job searches to the Congressional joint economic committee. 'This is not just a crisis of the unemployed,' he said. 'It is a crisis of the middle class, and the middle-management employees throughout the United States.' When he lost his job in 1984, Mr Proper sent out hundreds of curricula vitae but failed to get one offer. Declared a 'dislocated worker' by New York state, he was retrained as a typesetter. This new profession lasted until December when the system in which he was trained became obsolete. He was retrained again to operate computers in five areas of software, but computer-operator jobs go mostly to women. Mr Proper went back to college and earned a master's degree in theology, hopeful of a job in counselling or administration in a church parish. Most interviewers now say he is 'over-qualified'. American college graduates, who once viewed a diploma as a passport to a secure future, are also getting a cool reception in the job market. A Northwestern University survey concluded that 1992 college graduates will face the worst job market in 20 years. 'An overwhelming 69 per cent of corporations expect their business to decline or - at best - stay even during the new year,' said Mr Victor Lindquist, author of the survey. More middle-class job cuts are still to come. The 74,000 job losses - many of them white-collar - at General Motors make up one of the most recent examples. These losses mean declining tax receipts and further lay-offs in state and local government. Many white-collar workers will never regain good jobs. Mr Proper is now working as a clerk-typist for the Kelly Girl temporary employment agency, earning Dollars 10 (Pounds 5.40) an hour - not quite enough to cover his mortgage. His wife and two grown-up, college-educated daughters contribute to the family income with their own modest wages from clerical jobs. Mr Proper says he will mark time to survive until he reaches 62 and can supplement his income with a state pension - 'and then I will work until I die.'  ------------------------------------------------------------------                    US EMPLOYMENT  ------------------------------------------------------------------         % change 16 months after economic peak                                  Nov 1991   Nov 1982   Mar 1974 White-collar                      -0.3        +1.6       +1.9 Managerial, professional          +1.4        +2.8       +2.3 Tech, sales, admin                -1.7        +0.2       +1.5 Blue collar                       -3.6        -8.8       -7.2 Precision production, craft       -4.9        -5.1       -4.8 Operator, fabricator, labourer    -2.5       -11.6       -8.7  ------------------------------------------------------------------ Source: US Bureau of Labour Statistics  ------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

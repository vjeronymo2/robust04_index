			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith calls for rethink of G7 role A CALL for a radical rethink of the role and institutional status of the G7 industrial nations was made yesterday by Mr John Smith, the Labour leader. Speaking on the eve of the Tokyo summit at a meeting of the socialist international, he said the G7 had degenerated into an 'over-hyped photo-opportunity', losing in the process its ambition to be a serious point of international decision-making. Citing the group's failure over four consecutive years to give a substantive impetus to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, Mr Smith said that its failure to follow up publicly-stated agreements had weakened its authority. But more fundamentally the G7 should review its membership criteria and its relationship with United Nations-related agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Mr Smith said the present members should consider 'folding' the G7 into an economic equivalent of the UN Security Council with a slightly larger membership which would not be drawn exclusively from the industrialised world. Such a move could enhance the credibility of international policy co-ordination while satisfying Japan's desire for greater participation in decision-making by the UN. Mr Smith said that the group should in the meantime set as its first priority agreement on firm steps to strengthen growth and employment. He said a further co-ordinated reduction in borrowing costs was needed to boost demand in the G7 countries.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / US warns N Korea of trade sanctions The US said yesterday it might seek to organise international trade sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear weapons programme even if such action failed to win United Nations backing. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, also confirmed the US had built up its troops in South Korea, although he said there was 'no immediate danger of military confrontation'. He said on US television: 'We are not seeking and we will not provoke a war, but, at the same time, we will not invite a war by not being ready. We have a commitment to defend South Korea; we are prepared to defend South Korea, and we are capable of defending South Korea.' Mr Perry said Washington would consult its allies this week over proposals to impose trade and economic sanctions against Pyongyang over its failure to co-operate with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Mr Perry said, however, that if sanctions were blocked in the UN, it was 'entirely possible' the US would seek formation of an allied coalition to proceed. President Bill Clinton said last night that 'the door is still open for them (the North Koreans) to become part of the world community'. But he has already begun to consult Russian president Boris Yeltsin and senior US officials believe Russia would not block sanctions. They also consider it possible that China, North Korea's sole ally and main source of oil, might co-operate. China has given no public indication that it was becoming exercised over the crisis. Last week, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said: 'At this time, we do not favour the resort to means that might sharpen the confrontation.' US, Japanese and South Korean officials agreed in Washington that sanctions were an appropriate response to Pyongyang's refusal to co-operate. The US said last week it would begin consultations in the Security Council. The talks concluded that North Korea's most recent refusal to allow IAEA inspectors to examine fully a nuclear reactor confirmed suspicions that North Korea was developing nuclear weapons. The three said: 'the situation demands that the international community, through the UN Security Council, urgently consider an appropriate response, including sanctions'.

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Hope for Polly Peck Cypriot settlement Mr Michael Jordan, an administrator of Polly Peck International yesterday expressed hope of a settlement next year on the assets of the collapsed conglomerate in the Turkish part of Cyprus. 'We hope there will be in early 1993 a resolution on Polly Peck's problems here,' he said after meeting for the first time Mr Salih Cosar, the Turkish Cypriot finance minister. Turkish Cypriot authorities had refused to put the assets of Polly Peck and its founder Mr Asil Nadir, originally a Turkish Cypriot, on the selling block, after Mr Nadir's empire collapsed in 1990. Polly Peck's properties include two hotels in north Cyprus, its Sunzest citrus packing unit and Uni-Pack, a cardboard box manufacturer.</p>

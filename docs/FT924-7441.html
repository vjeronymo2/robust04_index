			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Cancer clouds Singapore political future THE POLITICAL succession in Singapore was thrown into question yesterday when the government announced that both the island's deputy prime ministers have cancer. The two men are Mr Lee Hsien Loong, the son of Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's elder statesman, and Mr Ong Teng Cheong. The younger Mr Lee was widely expected to succeed Mr Goh Chok Tong as the country's next prime minister. Mr Goh's office announced after a day of turmoil on the Singapore stock market that both deputy premiers were suffering from forms of cancer. The Straits Times Industrial Index fell 32.53 points or 2.25 per cent yesterday to 1,414.27. At the weekend Mr Goh said his most urgent task was to find talented ministers to revitalise his ageing cabinet. Yesterday's statement said doctors thought the two men had excellent chances of recovery because their cancers had been diagnosed at an early stage. There was no immediate suggestion that either of the two would step down. Singapore has announced an easing of restrictions on a political prisoner detained without trial for 23 years until his conditional release in 1989, AP reports from Singapore. Mr Chia Thye Poh, who has been restricted to a tourist resort island less than a mile away, may live on Singapore from November 28.</p>

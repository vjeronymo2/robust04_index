Tsiolkovskiy, turns 60 years old.    The editorial board of NEZAVISIMAYA MOLDOVA joins in the  numerous congratulations that are being addressed to the  celebrator.    At present Moldova, like all the former Soviet republics, as  well as the countries of Eastern and Central Europe, is going  through the difficult, excruciating period of the transition  from one socioeconomic state to another, from a totalitarian  regime and a centralized economy to a democratic society and a  market economy. This period has proved to be very complicated,  with a large number of most urgent problems of the most diverse  nature, with a sharp production slump and crises not only in the  economy, but also in all other spheres of social life.    Now a task of vital importance is to find means of getting  out of the present situation, the task of establishing a  rule-of-law state with a normally operating economy. All  structures of society, including, of course, science, are  interested and should take part in its accomplishment.    In the modern dynamic world further progress is altogether  inconceivable without science. It should provide answers to all  urgent problems and, what is more, should foresee and predict  the emergence of new problems and the means of their optimal  solution. Our scientists are working in such vitally important  areas as economics, ecology, interethnic relations, the  restoration of the historical truth of our past, the observance  of the principles of social justice, and the raising of the  prestige of human values. The same, at any rate no less,  attention is also being devoted to other directions of academic  science. We see in precisely this the role of scientists of the  republic at the present stage of its historical development.    The Academy of Sciences of Moldova at present is the leading  scientific center of the republic. About 1,300 associates,  including 140 doctors of sciences and 770 candidates of  sciences, are now working in its 25 subdivisions.    At the scientific institutions of the Academy research is  being conducted on urgent problems of physics and mathematics,  engineering, geology and seismology, chemistry, biology,  agriculture, geography, medicine, economics, history, language,  literature, ethnography, the culture of Moldova, and so on. Our  applied research and development are aimed at the solution of  the most urgent problems in the area of ecology, agriculture,  and power engineering and at the development of new materials  and technologies.    Of the most important developments in recent years, which  are  of directly practical importance, it is possible to name an  advanced technology of the cultivation of alfalfa, flow charts  of the obtaining of two or three crops a year from the same  area, technologies of the production of various biological  preparations for the protection of plants, a whole-milk  substitute for the feeding of calves, a technology and equipment  for the electrospark machining of metals, a set of equipment for  the electric refining of vegetable oils, Plazmoliz equipment and  technology, a technology of the production of aromatizers from  the waste products of the essential oil industry, multicomponent  materials for optoelectronics and microelectronics, a technology  of the production of synthetic wollastonite, various  preparations for medicine, and much more.    In recent years at the Academy of Sciences of Moldova  important steps have been taken to bring science in line with  the new tasks facing the republic. A new concept of the  development of science was adopted. A detailed analysis of the  basic directions of research was made. The organizational  structure of the Academy was improved. The Government of the  republic approved its new charter. The international ties of the  Academy of Sciences of Moldova were expanded substantially.    I want to direct attention to one (among many others)  important change in the structure of the activity of the  Academy, which, we hope, in the future will have a substantial  influence on the functioning of all science of the republic. At  the end of last year and the beginning of this year three new  departments of sciences--the agrarian, technical, and medical  departments--were established at the Academy. They are called  upon to fill the gaps, which existed until now, in the degree of  coverage by the Academy of those fields of knowledge, which  until now had practically no ties with it. As a result the  research, which was being conducted at sectorial institutes and  higher educational institutions, was not coordinated at the  proper level on the scale of the republic, which decreased the  significance of the contribution being made by science to the  national economy of the republic.    At present the coordination of the directions and themes of  science in the republic is one of the main tasks of our science.  A few years ago such coordination existed, although it was  carried out mainly from the union center and to a significant  extent was formal. After the collapse of the Soviet Union this  coordination also disappeared, although its need in principle is  obvious. Precisely for these reasons we believe that the  building up of the Academy with the three indicated departments  of sciences is called upon first of all to change the state of  affairs in this area and to promote the orientation of our  entire scientific potential toward the comprehensive and  coordinated solution of the most urgent problems of the republic.    At the present stage of civilization science, as an explorer  and builder of the future and as an extremely integrated result  of creative activity, cannot develop in isolation. It has become  an area of joint activity with common results for all mankind.  In other words, science is profoundly international and can  develop only in case of constant contacts among the scientists  of different countries and only through the constant sharing of  ideas, opinions, results, and experience.    Our Academy of Sciences already has considerable experience  in international ties. However, until the proclamation of the  independence of the republic the ties were confined for the most  part just to the former union republics and were in many  respects of an episodic nature, with the exception, perhaps, of  Ukraine and Belarus, with whose scientists we cooperated more  intensively, and this cooperation is continuing. In practice we  did not have direct ties not just with capitalist countries, but  even with the countries of the former Soviet bloc. While the few  ones that were maintained were carried out only with the  permission of the All-Union Academy or with its aid.    The situation changed after 1990, when the real opportunity  appeared to establish direct scientific ties with any countries  of the world, including in the form of contracts and agreements,  including the elaboration of joint themes, the establishment of  international laboratories, and so on. In 1992 alone we  concluded a new agreement with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences  and Athens National Polytechnical University and agreed on joint  scientific research with scientists of Poland. Steps were taken  toward cooperation with scientific centers of Italy, Sweden,  Great Britain, France, Germany, China, India, and Turkey. Our  traditional ties with the former Soviet republics are also not  being severed.    In the same 1992 our Academy of Sciences participated in an  international meeting of academies of Great Europe in Stockholm,  at which there was an interested discussion on the means of  developing cooperation, on the exchange of information and  specialists, and on the participation of the academies in the  joint elaboration of global problems in such areas as ecology,  airspace, and health care. I want to note that at the academies  of the countries of Western Europe they are greatly alarmed by  the formed situation in science and, in particular, in academic  science in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. In  connection with this the conference participants came forth with  an appeal to governments and international organizations to  support science in every way in the countries of the former  Soviet bloc.    This year our Academy has already taken part in the  international conference "Scientific Policy in the Service of  Great Europe," which was held in Germany. Here the Academy of  Sciences of Moldova was recommended for membership in the  Association of the European Community for the Support of Science  in Eastern Europe. Last September we became cofounders of the  International Association of Academies of Sciences--a  nongovernmental self-administered organization that was  established for the combining of the efforts of scientists of  the sovereign states, which have been newly established on the  basis of the former republics of the USSR, and other countries  in the solution of the most general scientific problems, for the  coordination of scientific strategy, for the support of the most  promising research, and for the joint use of unique and  expensive equipment. The holding in July of this year in  Chisinau of the 18th Congress of the American-Romanian Academy,  in the organization of which we took a direct part, is evidence  of the increased international authority of the Academy of  Sciences of Moldova.    In recent years our ties with scientists of neighboring  Romania have been developing particularly fruitfully. At present  all the institutes of our Academy are cooperating with Romanian  scientific centers, research is being conducted on more than 60  themes.    Thus, at the Academy of Sciences of Moldova the same  reorganizational processes are taking place as throughout the  republic. We have already achieved much, but much still has to  be done so that science would become a more significant support  in the accomplishment of the tasks facing the country.    At the same time I cannot but direct attention to the  difficult conditions, under which we have to work, and to the  problems with which we are faced. First of all I want to  indicate the continuing lack of receptivity of the national  economy to the achievements of science--an unheard of phenomenon  in developed countries. Here the orders of the national economy  for scientific research and development have decreased sharply.  Whereas in 1985 the amounts paid to our account from the  fulfillment of economic contracts came to about a third of the  entire amount of financing of the Academy, in 1992 they came to  only 7 percent and are continuing to decrease. Today we can  offer for introduction more than 60 scientific developments.  However, in spite of all our efforts, they are not being taken.  The lack of interest in the results of the activity of  scientists and, consequently, the decrease of economic contracts  are sharply aggravating the financial support of science, which  today is based in practice only on budget financing.    We know the difficult financial situation of the republic  and  understand that Parliament and the Government can allocate for  us only very modest funds. Moreover, they are unstable, their  real significance is steadily decreasing. The budget allocations  for science in our republic in their real significance decreased  from 37.6 million rubles in 1990 to 15.6 million rubles in 1992,  that is, to less than half, although in nominal terms they  increased substantially. For comparison let us note: Last year  the allocations for science in Moldova came to only 0.45 percent  of the national income of the republic, while, for example, in  Germany back in 1989 such allocations came to 2.8 percent of the  national income.    Due to financial difficulties first of all the research  process is suffering, inasmuch as we cannot acquire the  necessary hardware, equipment, chemicals, and other materials.    Due to the lack of assets, especially currency, it is  becoming more and more difficult to support international  scientific ties, especially trips of our scientists abroad. And  I cannot but agree with the president of the Academy of Sciences  of Ukraine, who stated that at present a real economic "iron  curtain" has arisen before scientists of the former union  republics.    Inadequate financing, the lack of housing, the general  uncertainty as to the future of science, and, in connection with  this, the decline of the prestige of science as a sphere of  activity, particularly for talented young people, have given  rise in recent years to another problem--the problem of  personnel. Scientists are abandoning science, are leaving for  other spheres of activity, and are going to other countries.  Last year 80 associates from the Academy of Sciences alone left  the republic, of them two were corresponding members of the  Academy, six were doctors of sciences, and 31 were candidates of  sciences. This year only 72 people, who wish to devote  themselves to science, were admitted to graduate studies of the  Academy.    It is possible to continue the list of today's problems of  science, including academic science. However, scientists fully  realize that their very own efforts are required for the return  to science of its role as the motive force of progress. Today  the basic task of academic science is to correctly direct its  attention to the solution of the most urgent problems facing the  republic, to the strengthening of the ties with sectorial and  VUZ science, and to the expansion of international cooperation.  The main thing is not to lose the achieved potential and  scientific personnel.</p>

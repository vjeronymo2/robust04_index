			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 10 (YONHAP) -- The Vietnamese Government  has informed South Korean lawmakers of its official position  that it opposes North Korea's nuclear development program, the  chairman of the National Assembly Foreign Affairs and National  Unification Committee said Tuesday.    Chairman Chong Chae-mun and five other committee members  visited Vietnam from May 2-7. Chong, speaking to reporters  about his tour of the Southeast Asian country, said, "the  Vietnamese leaders made clear that nuclear weapons should not  exist on the Korean peninsula and even though Vietnam has a  communist system like North Korea, it does not support North  Korea's lines."    On the unification issue, Chong quoted Vietnam's leaders as  saying that South and North Korea will eventually accomplish  reunification through peaceful dialogue.    During their trip the Korean lawmakers met with senior  Vietnamese leaders, including former Chief Secretary of the  Communist Party Nguyen Van Linh, House Speaker Nong Duc Manh and  First Deputy Prime Minister Pham Van Khai, and discussed  expanding economic cooperation, supporting children fathered by  Koreans, locating Korean soldiers lost during the Vietnam war  and returning the remains of Korean soldiers.    Also visiting Hanoi were Reps. Pak Chong-su and Kim Tong-kun  of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party, Pak Sil and Chin  Nam-kung of the opposition Democratic Party and independent Yi  Chong-chan.</p>

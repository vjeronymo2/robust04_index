			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Reynolds ready to amend claim to Ulster The Irish government has told its British counterpart privately that it is willing to amend the most sensitive element of its constitutional claim to Northern Ireland. But draft amendments suggested by Dublin to article 2 of the constitution - which defines Ulster as part of the republic's 'national territory' - do not go far enough to meet the UK government's demands. The amendments have been tabled as part of the intense negotiations on a framework document to provide the basis for a political settlement for the province. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, has signalled that he is ready to submit to a referendum changes to the less controversial article 3 of the constitution, which also refers to the jurisdiction claimed by the republic. But publicly the Dublin government has strongly resisted the suggestion that it might change article 2 which states simply: 'The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas.' British officials hope Dublin's private acceptance that article 2 is no longer inviolate will help break the deadlock in the talks on a framework document. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, told Mr Reynolds earlier this week that an overall deal acceptable to Ulster's moderate unionists would be impossible without a radical revision of the constitutional claim. But it is understood the two possible revisions so far suggested by Dublin do not meet the central unionist demands that Ulster must be recognised as outside the 'national territory' and that they no longer be defined as members of the 'Irish nation'. These indications of Dublin's position came on the eve of the first Commons debate on Northern Ireland since the republican and loyalist ceasefires. During the debate, ministers may be pressed on last week's move by Mr Major to separate plans for an Ulster assembly from wider talks on the province's status. The move appeared to irritate Dublin, although the prime minister said at Chequers on Monday that it would be a 'misreading' to suggest he was trying to detach one from the other. If questioned today on whether the 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed' formula governing political talks on the province still applies, ministers are expected to say that the basis upon which talks began in 1991 will stay in place unless and until the participants decide other-wise. Mr James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, told party members earlier this month that the formula, which is strongly supported by nationalists, was 'now unworkable'.</p>

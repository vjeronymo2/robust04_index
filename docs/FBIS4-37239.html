			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Fathi al-Qatta' in Sanaa] </F>   [Text] Early this week, the Yemeni Foreign Ministry  stopped financial remittances through the Yemeni Central Bank to  some of its diplomatic missions and embassies abroad. Those  include the embassies in Washington, New Delhi, Rome, Havana,  Cairo, Muscat, Tehran, and Nairobi. The measure was adopted  because the majority of the staff of those embassies supports  the secessionist step declared by 'Ali Salim al-Bid on 21 May.    Last week, Najib al-Haddi, a leader of the Yemeni Reform  Grouping [YRG] and brother-in-law of Shaykh 'Abd-al-Majid  al-Zindani, member of the Presidential Council, was killed in  the battlefield. Muqbil al-Fil, a member of the Yemeni House of  Representatives and a leader of the YRG, was also killed.    Official and semiofficial Yemeni newspapers, as well as some  parties that support unity, have launched fierce media campaigns  against Saudi Arabia after its involvement in the Yemeni crisis  and support for the secessionists diplomatically and militarily.    During President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's visit to the two  newly created camps of Zafar and al-Fatah in Dhamar last week,  it was noticed for the first time that there were tanks having a  different color of soil and desert. It was learned that these  tanks were sent by Saudi Arabia to the secessionist forces  through the Sharurah region, under Saudi occupation, near  Hadhramaut. The forces of legitimacy seized those tanks but did  not announce this.    There have been some changes in the military leaders. Some  commanders who are close to President Salih were dismissed.  Those included Colonel Ahmad Faraj, commander of the Khalid  Bin-al-Walid Camp, and Colonel 'Abdallah al-Qadi, commander of  the Infantry Brigade. The two camps are in Ta'izz. The  commanders were dismissed because of the losses sustained by the  forces of the two camps on the fronts.    It is also rumored in Sanaa that there has been a recent  dispute between President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and Brigadier  General 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur Hadi, the defense minister, because  the latter refused to storm Aden justifying this by the great  losses that the forces will incur, as well as the civilian  losses. Hadi thinks what should be done is only to tighten the  siege around Aden for some time and consequently bring about a  change within the leadership and the military command of the  Yemeni Socialist Party.    Sanaa restored direct contacts with the outside world  yesterday.</p>

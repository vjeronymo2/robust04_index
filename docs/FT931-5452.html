			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Keppel up 3% despite marine slowdown KEPPEL, the Singapore group mainly involved in shipping, engineering and financial services, has announced pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31 of SDollars 279m (USDollars 171m), a 3 per cent increase on 1991's SDollars 271m. Net earnings rose 14 per cent to SDollars 165m. Mr Teo Soon Hoe, group finance director, said the increase in earnings took place against the background of a slowdown in marine business and despite a 7 per cent drop in group turnover. Keppel Shipyard, Keppel Finance, Straits Steamship and Keppel Integrated Engineering all improved their performance over 1991. Three other companies within the group - Steamers Maritime, Far East Levingston and Singmarine - recorded substantial declines in earnings. Mr Teo said that the group's dependence on ship repair, accounting for about 44 per cent of revenues, would decline as other sections of the group grew over the coming years. 'Financial services will see the strongest growth as Singapore becomes more entrenched as south-east Asia's financial centre,' said Mr Teo. Overseas earnings would also become more important to the group.</p>

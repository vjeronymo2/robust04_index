			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE: "Sweden, Finland, and Austria Place </F> One Foot in the European Union"; as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Brussels, 2 Mar (BELGA) -- On Tuesday [1 March],  several hours after the planned deadline, and after four days of  exhausting bargaining, Sweden, Finland, and Austria entered the  door leading into the European Union (EU), but they will remain  in the vestibule until the 12 national Parliaments of the  members states of the EU, the European Parliament (EP), and  their own respective electorates have given their backing to  these new memberships.    At 2100 GMT on Tuesday evening, after having "tied up" the  Swedish and Finnish dossiers, the Twelve managed to conclude the  talks with Austria, which balked for a long time on the question  of the transit of EU trucks across its high mountain pastures.    Thus, on Tuesday the EU entered a new era, that of the  community of 15 member states, or even 16 if the negotiations  with Norway, which are still stymied over the obstacle  represented by fishing, are brought to an end within the next  few days.    "I have rarely felt as happy as I did after going 100 hours  without sleep," said Hans Van Den Broek, the European  Commissioner responsible for external political relations, at a  press conference.    The success of the negotiations with these three countries  "demonstrates that the EU is not a closed space," emphasized  Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos, whose  country has the presidency of the Council of the Twelve for six  months.    "We have laid the foundations of a greater Europe which now  needs to be consolidated and strengthened at its structural  level, as is due to happen at the intergovernmental conference  planned for 1996," he added.    The slight delay in the negotiations, compared with the  planned schedule, should not prevent the EP from receiving the  treaties of accession and ratifying them on 7 May, indicated  Hans van den Broek.    According to Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, the  financial concessions made by the Twelve, especially with a view  to "sweetening the pill" of the brutal opening of the borders of  the candidate member states to the Community's agricultural  products, which are much cheaper than their domestic produce,  and in order to satisfy their desire to see the Arctic regions,  with their low density populations, sustained, will merely limit  the profits that the EU will obtain when they join.    "From the very first year, the new member states will be net  contributors to the Community budget," assured Mr. Claes.    For example, Sweden will be granted a transitional period,  allowing it not to contribute 100 percent to the EU budget.  Moreover, Stockholm has secured financial aid for its farmers  worth ECU435 million (17.4 billion Belgian francs [BFr] -- BELGA  editor's note) over a four-year period.    Meanwhile, Finland will see 85 percent of its farmland  deemed  eligible for European agricultural subsidies, with the remaining  15 percent being able to benefit from national subsidies.  Between 1995 (the planned date of accession -- BELGA editor's  note) and 1999, Helsinki will also receive ECU340 million  (BFr13.6 billion -- BELGA editor's note) per annum in regional  aid, in order to boost the development of the poorest, least  populated regions of the country.    On Tuesday evening, the negotiators for the EU and Austria  succeeded in eliminating the last bone of contention which was  preventing Vienna from following in the footsteps of its  Scandinavian fellow candidates.    The prickly question of road transit was finally settled.  The solution allows for the possibility of maintaining the  current agreement until 1 January 1998, then extending it until  1 January 2001, barring a unanimous decision to the contrary by  the Council, which is virtually impossible, since Austria will  then belong to it.    The final stage, also lasting three years, will be linked to  a preliminary study by the European Commission. If this study  concludes that the Austrian requirement that polluting emissions  be reduced by 60 percent has been fulfilled, then the agreement  will be abolished. Should this not be the case, the transit  agreement would be relaunched for three years, unless a  qualified majority in the Council decided on an alternative  system enabling the same objective to be reached.    However, the Norwegian case remains to be solved. The  negotiators managed to clear an appreciable amount of ground,  reaching agreement on the dossiers on taxation and agriculture,  indicated Greek European Affairs Minister Theodoros Pangalos.    On the other hand, the question of access for Community  boats  to the extremely fish-rich Norwegian waters remains in abeyance,  but Mr. Pangalos let it be known that he hoped to conclude a  global political agreement as early as next Tuesday, or at any  rate by the end of the month.    The Twelve will still also have to agree on the adaptation  of  the institutions, and especially the apportionment of the votes  within the Council of Ministers, as well as on the question of  the inclusion of the new member states in the convergence  criteria planned within the context of Economic and Monetary  Union (EMU).    "However, that will not prevent the enlargement process from  being concluded. Moreover, work on drafting the treaties of  accession already started one month ago," concluded Mr. Pangalos.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / International Company News: Mexican financial groups plan merger Two of Mexico's largest financial groups, Grupo Financiero Serfin and Grupo Financiero Inverlat, plan to merge in a move that will create the country's second-largest bank. The merger plan, approved by shareholders yesterday, will begin a process of full integration between the two groups, which control the Serfin and Comermex banks. The new institution will have assets of about Dollars 36bn, placing it just above the current second-placed bank, Bancomer and behind the largest, Banamex. The two groups will also fuse their brokerage houses and factoring companies, creating the largest Mexican institutions in those two areas with assets of Dollars 14.3bn and Dollars 1.1bn respectively. Under the terms of the merger, Serfin will carry out a capital increase and there would then be an exchange of shares with Inverlat shareholders. No further details were given. The holding company for the new institution would be controlled largely by Serfin, analysts said. The merger will also bring together two of the country's most strong-willed financiers, Mr Adrian Sada, the Monterrey-based businessman who is chairman of Serfin, and Mr Augustin Legorreta, chairman of Inverlat. It has yet to be decided who will be chairman of the new group.</p>

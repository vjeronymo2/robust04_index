			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: India admits further five foreign broker firms Five foreign stockbroking firms have been given permission to deal in Indian markets on behalf of foreign investors. The move is the the latest in a series to open India's economy to the rest of the world. The five approved by the securities and exchange board of India, the securities watchdog, will join four others who won permission late last year. The latest batch are Jardine Fleming, the UK/Hong Kong-owned investment bank, Citicorp and Lehman Brothers of the US, Crosby Securities from Hong Kong, and the British-based Baring Securities. The companies which won approval last year are James Capel and Kleinwort Benson of the UK, Credit Lyonnais Securities, an arm of Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and Marlin Partners of Hong Kong. The foreign brokers are not permitted to deal on behalf of domestic investors; nor are they joining the Bombay stock exchange, which so far has not admitted any foreign members. About Dollars 900m in foreign portfolio investment has flowed into India since foreign institutions were permitted to invest just over a year ago. Their entry has fuelled a surge in equity prices. However, of 132 investors approved by the securities board, only about 15 are active. The remainder are still establishing and launching funds. The active foreign investors are mostly using Indian brokers as they allow foreign brokers time to establish themselves in Bombay.</p>

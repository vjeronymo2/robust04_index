			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / Central Asian states join ADB THE Asian Development Bank (ADB) yesterday said it had admitted the three central Asian former Soviet states of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan as members, bringing its total membership to 56, Reuter reports from Manila. The three would subscribe to a total of 31,476 shares with a par value of Dollars 10,000, raising the Manila-based bank's authorised capital stock to Dollars 24.1bn, the ADB said. Their membership would become effective once they had completed payment of their capital subscription and other formalities, the bank said. The three are already members of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Their ADB membership is expected to give them access to more concessional development loans. Three other former Soviet states - Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan - last year indicated their interest in joining the ADB.</p>

Some of the marchers  shouted for the resignation of Houphouet-Boigny, who has ruled this West  African nation since its independence from France in 1960. Defense Minister  Jean Konan Banny had issued a warning that security forces would "use all  necessary measures" to prevent the opposition parties from threatening public  order.  </P></p>

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A firm opening on Wall Street, together with a more positive performance in bonds, helped to underpin an advance in stock index futures seen from the outset, writes Joel Kibazo. Early buyers for the Liffe March contract on the FT-SE 100 which opened at 3,280 sent it forward in thin trading. But for a brief mid-morning sell order, March continued to push gently forward. Just when a lull in trading appeared, the strong performance of Wall Street brought renewed demand, particularly from independent traders, and a gentle squeeze was noted in March towards the close. Having traded at a premium for most of the session, March ended at 3,295, a 3-point discount to its fair value premium of about minus 8 points. Turnover was 17,533 contracts. Substantial rolling forward into June saw volume in that contract of 7,922 lots. The FT-SE Mid 250 March futures contract on the Liffe stood at 3,950 at the official close, with 156 lots having been traded. On the rival OMLX, the same contract finished at 3,937.7 on volume of 9 contracts. In the Liffe traded options, volume fell to 32,813 contracts, including 13,955 in the FT-SE 100 option. J. Sainsbury, the most active stock option, traded 2,287.</p>

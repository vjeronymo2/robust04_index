			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Media Futures: Elvis found in cyberspace - Digital jukeboxes are set to have a big impact on the music industry It was almost exactly a year ago that Rob Lord and Jeff Patterson, a couple of Californian computer science students, launched their digital jukebox, IUMA, alias the Internet Underground Music Archive. IUMA has since used the Internet to send samples of alternative rock music everywhere, from Arizona to Australia. It charges each band of musicians Dollars 20 to Dollars 75. Listeners tune in for free. All they need is access to the Internet to download the music on to their computer sound cards before transfering it to an ordinary cassette. Lord and Patterson are cyber-buffs who used their skills and a Dollars 20,000 computer system to reach out to fellow music fans. Their concept has since been copied by hundreds of other digital jukeboxes all over the world, and is attracting the attention of the multinationals that dominate the Dollars 30.4bn music industry. The major record companies now recognise that digital diffusion is a serious phenomenon that will, eventually, account for a significant chunk of music distribution. What they do not know is how quickly it will take off - or how to approach it. 'We're working in the dark,' says Sara John, director of legal affairs for the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in London. 'There's no doubt that at some stage digital diffusion will become a major part of the music market. My personal opinion is that it could happen very, very quickly.' At present the industry is in the unenviable position of not knowing whether digital diffusion is a golden opportunity to boost profits, or a threat to its financial stability. The global music market is dominated by six companies - Sony, Time Warner, Matsushita, Bertelsmann, Thorn-EMI and Polygram. If a compact disc sells for Pounds 12.99 in the UK, the artist earns 88p, the producer 44p, the publisher 44p and the manufacturer Pounds 1.05. The retailer takes Pounds 3.25 and the record company Pounds 4.66 (mostly to cover distribution costs), leaving Pounds 2.27 for VAT. This means that if a record company can deliver a compact disc directly to the consumer's home, it will save the chunk of the Pounds 4.66 previously spent on distributing it to the record shop and the retailer's Pounds 3.25. In short, it will be able to sell the same product for the same price much more profitably. Such calculations have encouraged the major groups to dabble in digital diffusion. Warner Bros, part of the Time Warner group, now offers on-line access to some of its recordings through America Online and CompuServe, the US on-line services. Geffen Records, a Matsushita subsidiary, also releases material on CompuServe. This summer it became the first major record company to produce a CD-Rom game. Geffen joined with Jasmine Multimedia, a small Californian software house, to create Vid Grid, a visual jigsaw that enables the user to assemble videos from artistes including Red Hot Chili Peppers, Aerosmith and Jimi Hendrix. These projects are still seen as experiments. The current generation of on-line music services is not sophisticated enough for mainstream use. It can take as long as 15 minutes to download a three-minute song from IUMA on the Internet. The sound quality is patchy (more like FM radio than compact disc) and the visuals limited to black and white. Some of the new digital diffusers - such as pHreak, a dance music format run by Intermedia, a multimedia consultancy in London - deliver their services by computer modem rather than the Internet. This means that pHreak has a more limited market than the Internet's web of 25m users, but it can make the most of the vivid colours and sharp definition offered by computer graphics. The Internet will become progressively more efficient. Digital junkies will also soon be able to transfer music to compact discs, rather than cassettes, with the launch of recordable video-CDs. The expansion of digital cable radio, now a fledgling medium in the US and UK which relays dozens of specialist music stations to the home on cable TV connections, will provide another digital delivery system. Each home could eventually have its own 'virtual record shop'. The viewer would be able to order an album by remote control via a digital cable box fitted to the TV set, pay for it by credit card and record it on to a compact disc, rather than buying it from a retailer. However, there is a risk that, rather than benefiting from digital diffusion, the record companies will be marginalised by it. At present, their major artistes need them to secure access to their vast retail distribution systems. If digital diffusion became a major medium, the artistes might be tempted to break away and handle their own distribution. There is also the threat that digital diffusion will continue to develop in its current fragmented form as an underground movement with devastating consequences for the music industry's revenue. The first wave of digital diffusers are effectively pirate operations. They should, in theory, be licensed to 'sell' music by the appropriate industry authority, such as the UK's Performing Right Society (PRS). They should also pay royalties to that authority and the record company. Otherwise they could simply buy one compact disc and send it to be copied by thousands of subscribers. The PRS estimates that 'literally hundreds' of on-line services have surfaced in the UK this year. So far it has been approached by only three and has licensed one, Cerberus, which received official sanction last week. 'We're not Luddites,' says David Uwemedimo, head of legal affairs. 'We encourage new technology within the regulatory system. We want to find a fair way for these new services to pay for their music. We're still working on it.' Time is running out. The BPI's research suggests that once people have access to on-line services such as digital cable radio, their expenditure on compact discs and cassettes declines dramatically. 'Record companies have historically made a lot of money from distribution and if they don't act quickly they could lose it,' said Ms John. 'The problem is that, as usual, technology is moving much faster than the law - and the industry's process of thought.'</p>

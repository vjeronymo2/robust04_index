			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Triumph in Geneva"] </F>   [Text] Pakistan's decision to withdraw its controversial  resolution, criticising India's human rights record in Kashmir,  from the United Nations Human Rights Commission meeting in  Geneva is a singular triumph for Indian diplomacy. All those who  participated at the Geneva event, from the finance minister, Dr.  Manmohan Singh, and the minister of state for external affairs,  Mr. Salman Khursheed, to the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]  leader, Mr. Atal Behari Vajpayee, and various officials deserve  praise for their persuasive role as indeed do the Prime Minister  and the external affairs minister. Procrastination followed by  resolve is typical of the Indian style but it also has to do  with the nature of democratic polity that functions best under  pressure. After years of agonising and indeed dithering, India  finally spelt out the bottom-line on Kashmir by telling the  world what the Pakistani game was all about. The most important  point related to the fact that Pakistan was attempting to use a  U.N. forum for propaganda purposes despite its clandestine role  in sponsoring terrorism. If it was genuinely concerned about the  plight of the Kashmiris, it could have taken up India's offer  made in January for talks rather than concentrate all its  energies on the Geneva meeting. Eventually it took Iran, along  with China, Syria, Indonesia, Malaysia and a number of other  countries not unfriendly to Pakistan to tell it that such an  issue is best handled through bilateral discussions. The  congruence of interests in this context among India. Iran and  China has portents for the future which Pakistan needs to  examine carefully.    It is not very clear why Pakistan chose such a desperate  course. Perhaps Ms. Bhutto was acting under domestic pressure;  perhaps Islamabad misread the signals from Washington. There is  more than a grain of truth in the government of India's charge  that the United States by its recent utterances on Kashmir is  responsible for the sharp deterioration in India-Pakistan  relations. But Ms. Bhutto has no one but herself to blame for  the distasteful and shrill tone of Pakistani statements last  month. By calling Mr. Salman Khursheed a "rented Muslim," they  were insulting a Muslim community bigger than their own and in  calling India the "sick man of Asia," they ultimately compelled  the latter to show the world where the basic cause of the  disease lay. For years, India had been unable to utilise  properly the mountain of material at its disposal, confirming  Pakistan's involvement in the terrorist activities in the  Kashmir valley. With the challenge in Geneva, it was able to do  so in a convincing fashion, a task no doubt assisted by its  willingness to encourage the representatives of various nations  to see for themselves the grim realities of the state. Perhaps  India felt compelled to act in Geneva because it could have been  the beginning of a process that would have seen India being  pilloried by the Organisation of Islamic Countries as well as by  the U.N. general assembly later this year. By effectively  countering the threat of being blamed for the wrong reasons, and  by spelling out the limits of what it is willing to offer in  Kashmir, India has forestalled such a possibility. Its next move  should be to act swiftly to restore normality in the state.</p>

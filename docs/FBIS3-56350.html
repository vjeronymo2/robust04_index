This structure was set up  very recently in accordance with the Russian president's decree  of 30 December 1993. It is headed by Colonel General Andrey  Nikolayev, commander of the border troops. At a recent briefing  he summed up the results of the work of the border troops in  1993, and also defined future tasks. In particular, it was  stressed that the Russian border troops will continue to defend  the external borders of a number of CIS states. This is what  Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev said on this subject:    [Begin Nikolayev recording] In 1994 the units and subunits  of  the border troops will continue to defend -- on a contractual  basis, worked out on an inter-governmental and interstate level  -- the state borders in Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and  Tajikistan, and to participate in the defense of state borders  in Turkmenia. The documents on the joint defense of the borders  have been signed, and now they must be put into practice.    In this connection it is important to stress that, first,  the  defense of the external borders of the commonwealth states is  being carried out, first and foremost, for us Russians, in the  interest of Russia itself. Second, this involves the guarantee  of its national interests in the most important geo-political  regions, where Russia's strategic interests exist, existed, and,  hopefully, will continue to exist.    I agree that cooperation in defending the border, when  sovereign independent states cooperate in defending the border,  is a completely new thing. There is no such precedent in  history. But history also has seen no such thing as a state  breaking up into 15 states in the twinkling of an eye. You  understand, two years have gone by, and we finally realized that  it is very important to have not only rights in the CIS, but  probably obligations as well. [end recording]</p>

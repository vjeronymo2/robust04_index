The Palestinian official added that one person was martyred  in Bethlehem and 12 were wounded, most of them natives of Bayt  Jala, a town with a Christian majority. In the Qalandiya  township three martyrs fell and several people were wounded.    Al-Qidrah announced that he conveyed messages today from  Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat to al-Azhar Imam Shaykh  Jad-al- Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq, Awqaf Minister Muhammad 'Ali  Mahjub, and His Holiness Coptic Pope Shanudah III explaining to  them the details of yesterday morning's massacre at the Ibrahimi  Mosque in Hebron, which later spread to the rest of the occupied  territories.

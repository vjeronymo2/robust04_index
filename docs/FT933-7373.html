			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Finance and the Family: Keep an eye on friends - Diary of a Private Investor EARLIER this month, I got a welcome pay-out. In 1983, my wife and I each agreed to invest the maximum Pounds 240 a year in a family investment plan with the Lancashire and Yorkshire assurance society. Part of it paid for life cover while the rest was invested in a 'balanced portfolio.' According to the promotional literature, this might produce for each of us a sum of Pounds 4,661 after 10 years 'based on a gross rate of 12 per cent a year compound growth.' One of the main attractions of the plan was that, because the L &amp; Y is a 'wholly tax-exempt friendly society,' the sum paid out at the end of 10 years would be 'completely free from income tax, corporation tax, higher-rate tax and capital gains tax.' All seemed well until late last year when the society issued a statement saying several problems had come to the attention of its new committee of management. Perhaps the most serious was the revelation that Pounds 4.3m had been lost on property deals by the society's Capital Secure fund. Many of the policies based on this fund were written (in the society's words) 'on a basis specifying the areas of investment in terms which did not include property. These policies should not, therefore, have been exposed to the loss on property investment which has, in fact, occurred.' I was very concerned - especially when I checked my records and saw from the original promotional literature that 50 per cent of the balanced portfolio was supposed to be invested in Capital Secure (although, fortunately, the other 50 per cent was to be invested in Gartmore's British trust which, over the six-year period to January 1 1983, was reported to have returned 266 per cent). The 50 per cent of the fund to be invested by L &amp; Y managers was said to be in 'trustee status investments such as government securities and fixed interest stocks.' Capital Secure's property losses were not the only thing to alarm me. If it was found that the society had to compensate the holders of those policies, then, I wondered, how would that compensation be calculated? Would there be a levy on its members, since a friendly society is owned by its policy-holders? And since L &amp; Y is quite small - at the end of 1992, it only had 71,541 policies in force - would it have to merge with another society? The other problems with L &amp; Y were largely associated with uncertainties over the tax treatment of various policies, although my own were not affected. And, fortunately, the pay-outs my wife and I got this month were Pounds 4,781.85 each - slightly more than the example cited originally. Many of the uncertainties regarding the tax treatment of other people's policies have now been resolved, and the High Court is expected to rule late next month on compensation over the property losses. But, as JC Ramsden, chairman of the society, pointed out in his statement to members in April this year: 'The society together with its assets or liabilities does, by its very nature, belong to all members. Thus, if a number of members seek compensation against the society, in a sense they seek compensation against themselves.' (Personally, I would have hoped that any compensation could have been recovered from the society's former managers and advisers who had permitted a fund to invest in property when it was not supposed to.) When the court hands down its ruling, various proposals are likely to be put to members about the future of the society. The chairman has given assurances that 'every option will be considered'. As I have ceased to be a member, having taken the cash pay-out under my policy rather than letting the society retain the funds for further investment, I will not have a vote. But I do hope the society survives in some form as I have been especially impressed with the way in which Ramsden  -who was not on the board when the problems first arose - has tried to sort them out. Friendly societies have existed in one form or another for hundreds of years, based on the proposition that groups of people should contribute to a collective fund that will provide benefits to members in times of need. With the government seeking a review of various aspects of the welfare state, perhaps there will be an even greater role for these societies to play.</p>

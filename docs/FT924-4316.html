			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Patents pirates 'still dodging the rules': US complaints over enforcement of anti-counterfeiting measures FOUR years after the US Congress passed tough legislation aimed at foreign piracy and counterfeiting, American companies complain that they are still losing billions of dollars because of inadequate protection of intellectual property rights by other governments. 'The improvements have been marginal,' says Mr Johannes von Schilcher, executive director of the International Anticounterfeiting Coalition (IACC). 'The US trade representative moves in and gets a wonderful agreement on paper, which everyone signs. They promise the world, but whatever they promise, they put into place for about six months and then everyone forgets about it.' The coalition represents more than 100 of the largest US exporters, including American Brands, Time-Warner, IBM, the Motion Picture Association of America, Monsanto and Walt Disney. The companies are urging the US government to provide more manpower to monitor international agreements and fight the increasingly sophisticated pirates of everything from bogus birth control pills and Levi Strauss blue jeans to counterfeit brake linings and machine parts. Mr von Schilcher says the US has made 'significant progress' through the use of the 'Special 301' section of the 1988 trade law in getting countries to sign agreements. 'But the US needs to hold their feet to the fire' to ensure enforcement of those pacts. Special 301 directs the US trade representative to 'name names' of those countries failing to protect intellectual property rights. After negotiations, sanctions can be imposed, but it has only once come to that. Last year when India refused to protect pharmaceutical and chemical patents, Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative slashed Dollars 60m worth of Indian products from the US duty-free preference scheme for poor countries. This, she said, was 'meant to be a rifle shot absolutely focused' on the beneficiaries of patent theft. Mostly countries have succumbed to US pressure once they are named. Indonesia never made it on to the list but cut a deal with Hollywood film makers to avoid the disgrace. The other Asian tigers have fallen into line, one by one. China - in 1991 named the worst offender for protecting neither product nor process patents, copyrights, trademarks or trade secrets - gave in last January. It promised to improve protection of computer software, sound recordings, pharmaceuticals and agri-chemicals, to join the Berne Copyright Convention and the Geneva Phonogram Convention, and to grant copyright protection for 50 years. While companies have been impressed by these successes, they say there has been little follow-up. Mr von Schilcher cites South Korea, which in 1989 was removed from the list of worst offenders after agreeing to amend its laws to give broader protection to intellectual property rights and to step up enforcement. In the first year after the agreement, US Customs seizures of counterfeit merchandise from Korea dropped dramatically, but in 1992, they began to rise, approaching the levels of 1989. 'Merchandise seized by Customs is the tip of the iceberg since Customs only examines a small portion of the merchandise entering the US,' Mr von Schilcher said. Eight trade associations represented by the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) are so frustrated by Taiwan's failure to cope with copyright pirates, that it has vowed to oppose its membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In particular the IIPA complains that Taiwan encouraged the financing and construction of seven compact disc manufacturing plants, which allegedly use their excess capacity to manufacture pirate CDs for export. The pirated products have appeared in the Middle East, Africa and Europe 'distorting the legitimate market in these regions'. The IIPA is also calling for government action in Latin America, where pirates are cutting into the profits from US films, music, audio recordings, computer software and books. A US trade official said the administration had been working hard to improve enforcement of promised laws but 'all these things work in fits and starts'. Governments tried to put local pirates out of business but the pirates were well organised and often dangerous. Although multinational rules on intellectual property rights might be agreed in the Uruguay Round, the fight against pirates is likely to get tougher, the official said. 'The more technology changes, the easier it becomes to steal the stuff.'</p>

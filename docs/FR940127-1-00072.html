			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA believes that if the identities of reporters or patients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were made public or available to third parties, health care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professionals would be much more reluctant to submit voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse event reports for fear of involving themselves and their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients in litigation. It is well recognized that many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physicians are concerned about the potential for involvement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> litigation by their patients or third parties. In a 1992 survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of physicians regarding adverse event reporting, over 37 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the respondents agreed with the statement that reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases the risk of becoming involved in litigation; 18 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the respondents listed fear of becoming involved in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative or legal process as an important reason for not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting adverse reactions (Ref. 7). Several other surveys  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been conducted which asked physicians what factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> influenced their decision not to report an adverse event (Refs. 8, 9, and 10). Between 8 and 14 percent of the respondents in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the studies stated that concern over legal liability was one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reason why they did not report an adverse event. Moreover, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the reporter is a health care professional, particularly a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician, the reporter may fear that disclosure of his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identity would increase the chances that a patient's identity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be discovered, thus risking a breach of the confidential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician-patient relationship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recent years FDA has learned of a number of product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability lawsuits in State courts in which manufacturers have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been requested or ordered to provide the names of persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting adverse reactions to particular products. In some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances, the names of the affected patients have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested. The manufacturers involved in these cases vigorously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed discovery requests that sought the disclosure of patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and reporter identities. Occasionally, when the disclosure issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was being litigated, the manufacturers requested that FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formally express its views on the disclosure of these identities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the effects such disclosure might have on the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> postmarketing surveillance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA firmly believes that the success of its postmarketing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance efforts is dependent upon protecting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality of individuals involved in adverse experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports. Thus, FDA took the unusual step of becoming involved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a number of these cases by filing, with the assistance of the Department of Justice, a statement of the Federal government's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest. The statement informed the courts of the potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage the agency believes would be done to its postmarketing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveillance program and the public health if the identities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patients and reporters were released to plaintiffs in these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases. The agency believes that its efforts have contributed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continued protection of reporter and patient identities in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the cases in which FDA has participated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. The Need for Federal Regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FDA has determined that in order to help assure beneficial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and consistent reporting of adverse events to the agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MEDWATCH program, State and local rules that would permit or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require disclosure of the identities of reporters and patients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> named in the reports must be clearly preempted by FDA's amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laws that permit disclosure of the identities of health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional reporters or patients identified in the reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directly interfere with FDA's ability to collect information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required under sections 505(k) and 519 of the act (21 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 355(k) and 360i). Section 505(k) requires manufacturers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit information about approved drug products in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enable FDA to monitor the safety of the product and ``facilitate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination'' of whether the drug should be withdrawn from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market. This provision is implemented in &sect;314.80 (21 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 314.80) of the FDA regulations, which establishes mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting requirements of adverse reactions for manufacturers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drugs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

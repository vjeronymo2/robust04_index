Freight transport volume in the first two months of this  year  went up only 4.7 per cent, a much slower growth rate than the  10.9 per cent rise in January, but still far above the 0.2 per  cent decline for the whole of last year, a report from the  bureau said.    Meanwhile, passenger transportation slumped again. A 2.9 per  cent decline was reported for the January-February period. The  drop for January alone was 2.8 percent, while the dip was 11.9  per cent for last year.    Freight transport volume stood at 432 million tons in the  first two months of this year, the report said.    Of the total, rail freight registered a growth rate of 3.8  per cent to 246 million tons. Last year's total was 1.57  billion tons, 2.9 per cent more than in 1992.    Truck freight in the period slid by 2.2 per cent to 81  million tons, compared with the decrease of 9.5 per cent last  year over 1992.    Boat freight witnessed a growth of 13.3 per cent in the  first  two months, to hit 104 million tons. The growth rate last year  was only 1.5 per cent.    Air freight soared 23.8 per cent to 109,000 tons in the  January- February period, compared with the 20.9 per cent  increase registered in 1993.    Freight turnover in the two months--an important indicator  in  monitoring unit labour productivity and economic efficiency--  witnessed a growth of 7.7 per cent to hit 412.21 ton-kilometres.  (One ton-kilometre is one ton of cargo transported one  kilometre.) Last year's increase was 2.6 per cent.    Of the total, railways reported a 6 percent rise to 188.38  billion ton-kilometres, while truck freight turnover inched up  1.9 per cent to 4.71 billion ton-kilometres.    Air freight turnover generated 248 million ton-kilometres, a  20.8 percent jump, and boat freight turnover climbed 9.3 percent  to 218.87 billion ton-kilometres.    Total passenger volume stood at 862 million in the  January-February period, the report said.    Volume breakdown shows 175 million people travelled by rail,  up 1.2 per cent, while 656 million travelled by buses, down 3.6  per cent.    Some 27 million people travelled by boat, down 13.8 per  cent,  while 4.9 million people flew, up a soaring 22.8 per cent.    The passenger turnover in the period reported a 3.4 per cent  decline to 99.26 billion person-kilometres.    Of the total, passenger turnover by rail went down 0.9  percent to 58.87 billion person-kilometres, while bus travel  turnover dived by 9.9 per cent to 31.13 billion  person-kilometres.    Boat travel turnover slid 21.2 per cent to 2.47 billion  person-kilometres, while air travel chalked up a 20.8 per cent  increase to 6.79 billion person-kilometres.    In February alone, the railways transported 115 million tons  of cargo and 88 million passengers.    Major coastal ports handled 103 million tons of cargo in the  first two months of this year, 11.4 per cent more than in the  same period last year. The growth rate for the whole year of  1993 was 11.2 per cent.    The statistics also indicated that business turnover of  China's posts and telecommunications registered a sharp rise of  49.0 per cent in the period to 8.45 billion yuan ($971 million).</p>

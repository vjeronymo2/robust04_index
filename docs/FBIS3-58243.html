			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Western European Union (WEU) Secretary </F> General Willem van Eekelen by Leonardo Malsano in Brussels; date  not given: "`Three Reasons for a Success'"; first paragraph is  IL GIORNALE introduction]    [Text] Brussels -- "It will be a success, a fantastic  success, a turning point in the policy of the Atlantic  alliance." Willem van Eekelen, the former Netherlands defense  minister and general secretary of the WEU [Western European  Union], which in Maastricht found the fertile ground allowing it  to liberate itself from an uncertain political and military  arrangement to grow into the "armed wing" of Europe, is exultant  about the outcome of a summit that, for the most part, had  already been predicted.    [Malsano] Why a success?    [van Eekelen] Great progress was made in three areas: the  adoption by NATO of greater flexibility in its internal  structures; giving the WEU permission to use the structure of  the Atlantic alliance; and the Partnership for Peace aimed at  benefiting the countries of Central and East Europe. The first  and second points are interrelated and have a precise  significance: The summit will open the road to the creation of  multinational interarmy groups. This means putting at our  disposal (the Western European Union comprises the Twelve except  for Ireland and Denmark, whereas Greece has to finalize its  parliamentary ratification in order to gain full membership --  IL GIORNALE editor's note) the NATO headquarters for these  operations which are the responsibility of Europe alone.    [Malsano] So this is the theory of the "two caps," which  says  that the NATO structures could, from time to time, be put at the  WEU's service.    [van Eekelen] Exactly. This is the hypothesis on which I  have worked for years, and which will put NATO in charge of  collective defense and us in charge of undertaking our missions.  However, the aspect that must be emphasized is the political  rather than military. This summit will lead to a full and  unconditional "yes" by the Americans regarding the existence of  the WEU, a "yes" that had never been clearly stated in the past.  In the second place, the United States acknowledges that there  could be scenarios in which ground forces would not participate,  as is the case in Bosnia now. This facilitates cooperation, and  makes everyone more flexible -- including NATO, which in the  event of noninvolvement by the United States in military  operations, could offer its bases to the WEU, which, in turn,  would not have to worry about creating new logistical structures  but could use already existing ones. Lastly, it lets everyone  save some money. It is truly a fundamental step in the  transformation of the Atlantic alliance.    [Malsano] Does it not seem to you to be the gradual  withdrawal of the U.S. commitment from the European stage?    [van Eekelen] There is a mutation under way in the  geopolitical scene. The United States is primarily interested  in Russia and there is nothing wrong with that. We Europeans,  of course, cannot deal with Moscow alone; we need NATO for that.    [Malsano] Does the go-ahead which the summit will give to  the  creation of multinational interarmy groups put an end to the  plan to develop Eurocorps (French, German, Spanish, and Belgian  troops which are already organized in a common structure -- IL  GIORNALE editor's note)?    [van Eekelen] Eurocorps is at NATO's disposal for collective  defense and at WEU's disposal for our missions. It is not the  seed of the future European Army, but just one of the elements  in the WEU, as are the multinational interarmy groups. In this  connection, it must be said that the summit will only give the  general consensus, the political approval. Subsequently, we  must define the technical aspects, and the methods that will  enable the WEU to have access to the alliance's logistical  structures.    [Malsano] One of the reasons that you predicted for the  summit's success was the Partnership for Peace -- the  cooperation and collaboration agreement that will bring the  countries of Central and East Europe closer to NATO. In  reality, the expectations of the Poles, Hungarians, Czechs, and  Slovaks were disregarded to a great extent. Do you too think  that it was not possible to concede more?    [van Eekelen] Of course, the countries of Central and East  Europe will be disappointed, but the leaders of the alliance  adopted a realistic approach. The Western world cannot say, as  has happened for quite some time, that Russia is no longer a  threat and therefore give guarantees to the other countries  vis-a-vis Moscow. I believe that this is a fair decision: It  does not create new borders in Europe and it develops the  military cooperation that will be extremely useful in view of  future membership. The West made a mistake in letting too many  expectations arise. Moreover, the most important problem in  Central and East Europe is economic, not military. These  countries must be allowed to grow progressively closer to the  European Union, to become members of it, and then to be able to  join the WEU and perhaps NATO too. In today's global context,  one cannot think solely in terms of defense and security, there  must also be political convergence in accordance with the logic  of European integration. In this kind of scenario, Russia would  perhaps no longer have any reason to object. On the contrary,  the mere fact of any former members of the Warsaw Pact joining  NATO, which was and still is an instrument of the Cold War in  people's minds, would be viewed by Moscow as a hostile act.    [Malsano] What you are presenting is an indefinite slide.  Can the countries of Central and East Europe afford to wait for  a long time?    [van Eekelen] They will need six, maybe eight years, but  these countries must be given the prospect of European  integration. This is a multistage path that leads to a gradual  rapprochement and builds the foundation for a future that is  somewhat more solid than what could be offered by mere  guarantees of security.</p>

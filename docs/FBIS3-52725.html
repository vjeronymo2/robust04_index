			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Syrian Vice President 'Abd-al-Halim Khaddam  recently spoke in public about the possibility of Syria  recognizing Israel and normalizing relations with it within the  framework of the peace negotiations. These issues, Khaddam  said, are part of the negotiations, and it is too early to  decide on the format of relations.    Political sources in Jerusalem told our political  correspondent Shlomo Raz that this is the first time that a  senior Syrian statesman has spoken about normalization. The  sources noted that prior to the meeting between Presidents  Clinton and al-Asad, there has been an increase in positive  statements coming from Damascus with regard to the peace process.</p>

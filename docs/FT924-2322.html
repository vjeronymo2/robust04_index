			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Truth of the Matter: The church and divorce - Philip Crowe explains the Church of England's confusion about divorce and what that might mean for a divorced monarch who is also head of the church 'Whether a man marries or not, he will live to regret it.' - Socrates SUCH CYNICISM is not confined to the fourth century BC. It extends also to royal marriages in the 20th century. It was not the tabloid press which exposed what the archbishop of the day referred to, rather delicately, as 'The King's Matter,' in 1936. The press, in the person of its proprietors, was committed to what now seems an extraordinary anachronism, a gentleman's agreement to keep silent. But when the storm broke, and the king abdicated, it was Archbishop Lang who voiced the most severe criticisms. His God-speed was a notorious broadcast, a dour blend of sympathy, snobbery and self-righteousness as the former king 'in the darkness left these shores'. Lang dismissed the king's motives as 'a craving for private happiness,' and then he said this: 'Even more strange and sad it is that he should have sought his happiness in a manner inconsistent with the Christian principles of marriage, and within a social circle whose standards and ways of life are alien to all the best instincts and traditions of his people.' So much for our American cousins. Next day Stanley Baldwin, the prime minister, sent Lang a letter written in his own hand, praising what he had said and ending: 'It was the voice of Christian England.' Many in 'Christian England' thought otherwise. The majority of letters were so critical and so abusive that they were kept from the archbishop. There were some in Christian England who thought that less cant and more charity might have been in order. Today's archbishops are more understanding of marital difficulties in the royal household. They are different men, and the climate of opinion has changed. Dr John Hapgood, archbishop of York, manages to take comfort from thinking that the separation, rather than something more dramatic, indicates a desire to remain faithful to the marriage vows. But if two years of separation leads, as it probably will, to divorce, and divorce leads to a wish to remarry, the archbishops will be in a very different position. At present, there is no bar at all, either constitutional or emotional, to Prince Charles becoming head of the Church of England. But that Church still maintains the strictest marriage discipline of any church in the world. Its official position, debated with such anguish over the past 20 years, is that 'in order to maintain the principle of life-long obligation which is inherent in every legally contracted marriage, and is set out in the plainest terms in the marriage service, the Church should not allow the use of that service in the case of anyone who has a former partner still living.' The resolutions which set out this position were passed in the aftermath of the abdication crisis. Before 1938, divorce was rare and carried severe social penalties. The law required that people who needed to escape from bad marriages must either commit adultery or pretend, convincingly, that they had done so. Even Lang recognised that this was a bad law, although he could not bring himself to vote for change because any change would, in his view, contradict the mind of Christ. The Divorce Reform Act, introduced successfully by AP Herbert in 1937, widened the grounds for divorce just a little, but enough to worry the Church. At the same time, the leading member of the royal family, then even more than now the embodiment of ideals, overthrew those ideals for the sake of private happiness and threatened to make divorce fashionable. The C of E responded with neither grace nor understanding but with criticism and rules, confident that such rules were true to the teaching of Jesus, The Church did so for the best of motives, to maintain the sacredness of marriage. Some of the bishops, Henslay Hanson of Durham in particular, were realistic. They knew that to lock people into bad marriages by means of strict divorce laws only created a miserable society in which adultery and prostitution flourished. Marriages fail, divorce must be possible, but those who fail must maintain the ideal by living a life of celibacy after divorce. Jesus had said so. Did he not teach that 'anyone who divorces his wife, and marries another, commits adultery against his wife?' We think that divorce in our society, on almost any grounds, after just one year of marriage, is lax. But at the time of Jesus, Jewish law allowed men to divorce women (although not the other way round) on trivial grounds, such as burning the toast; recommended divorce for more serious matters, like talking with a man in the street; required divorce for sexual offences, like flirting; but after any act of illicit sex, the law demanded that the woman be stoned. She had made herself unclean and no one must touch her, neither her husband nor her executioners. In this context, Jesus is utterly outrageous. You men have made these divorce laws for your own convenience, he says, because you are so hard-hearted, so unforgiving. Your laws allow you to throw women out on the streets, even to kill them, to preserve your own manhood, even when you yourselves are unfaithful. But the God-given ideal is that if you marry, it is for life. Even if your wife is unfaithful, you should forgive. Small wonder that the disciples of Jesus found this so deeply shocking. Better not to marry, they said, than to forgive adultery and take an unclean woman back into the marital bed. To take this teaching out of its context in Pharisaic Judaism, and make it the basis for regulations about divorce and remarriage in the 20th century, misses the point. It turns Jesus into another Pharisee. Gradually, the Church is coming to recognise that marriage is a personal relationship requiring forgiveness as well as faithfulness, and that the ideals of marriage cannot be preserved by means of negative regulations about remarriage. Those resolutions, which captured the mind of the Church as it was in 1932, were confirmed in 1957. But in 1985, the general synod of the Church of England, after long and anguished debate, was asked to confirm the resolutions again. The synod declined to do so. So it was asked to rescind the resolutions. It declined to do that as well. It was not a particularly elegant piece of fence-sitting; rather, it was a grim, and probably last, attempt to maintain the ideals of marriage by means of ecclesiastical rules. Holding to the ideal will be marginally more difficult now that the family which is supposed to embody those ideals has found them so difficult to sustain. But the reality of knotted and broken relationships which form such a large part of the human condition, will press upon the Church more strongly, the more so because of the understanding of the two archbishops. Those who experience the pain of divorce, and wish to remarry in church, often do so, as I know from experience, from mixed motives. But, almost invariably, there is some reaching out for an ideal, dimly understood, so far elusive, but possibly something to do with God. To meet such longings with ecclesiastical rules is to deny the grace, the fidelity and the forgiveness which may, after all, be the essentials of what Jesus taught about marriage.

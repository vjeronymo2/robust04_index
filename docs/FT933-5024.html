			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Survey of Reinsurance (8): The tax man cometh - Financial products still sell despite tighter rules WHILE demand for financial reinsurance is on the increase, there is also greater regulatory concern over how it is being used. Lloyd's is currently attempting to ring-fence its old year liabilities in a specially created entity, NewCo. The exercise is like that of some financial reinsurance products, aiming to stabilise the effect on current trading and capital management of a past book of long-tail business while making full use of the time value of money. The financial reinsurance jargon for this is obtaining 'surplus relief'. At the same time, the Serious Fraud Office is examining the use by syndicates formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency of Time &amp; Distance policies (T&amp;Ds), under which a predetermined set of payments exceeds premium paid. Formally accepted in the UK as a reinsurance policy, T&amp;Ds are pure funding instruments whose main function, according to the Institute of Actuaries, 'is to avoid admitting that reserves have been discounted'. The Inland Revenue permits T&amp;D premiums as a tax deduction, but also insists that credit be taken for the full value of the policy immediately, creating an apparent (but taxable) current year profit. The Inland Revenue has been suspicious of Lloyd's funds flowing offshore for over a decade since it put a stop to 'rollovers', reinsurance policies on which one year's premium was the previous year's profit commission. This enabled tax free funds to be built up offshore. This is also the main aim of financial reinsurance, according to an Inland Revenue/Department of Trade &amp; Industry (DTI) discussion paper on equalisation reserves published last month, this time achieved by 'somewhat artificial transactions to exploit loopholes in the accounting conventions'. Prudential concerns like those concerning T&amp;Ds are also apparent: assets are transferred beyond local jurisdiction, and there is a risk of distortion in insurers' financial statements. At its simplest, financial (or 'finite risk') reinsurance is a T&amp;D with timing risk. Loss Portfolio Transfers (LPTs) enable an insurer to book a current credit while reinsuring a block of old business. For the reinsurer, they are almost risk-free, and they can be structured to operate much like a rollover. LPTs may be useful in managing the run-off of a discontinued account, but were also a popular method for US insurers to obtain 'surplus relief', causing regulatory concern that a precarious financial position was being disguised. Prospective Aggregate Covers (PACs) are similar, but apply to business yet to be written. These and the more sophisticated spread loss contracts are intended to provide continuity of cover at a predetermined price. A further development is experience funded accounts, where the reinsured has access to an agreed credit as well as the current balance in the 'experience account' which records the progress of the contract. Spread loss and experience funded contracts have become increasingly common in London, creating legitimate concerns by regulators about off balance sheet underwriting losses. In April 1991, the DTI reminded UK insurers that the Association of British Insurers Statement of Recommended Practice indicated that reinsurance deals where risk transfer was not significant should be accounted according to 'economic substance'. The Accounting Standards Board is considering a regulation which would strengthen this requirement (similar to the rule in Australia), an apparent death sentence for the T&amp;D and transactions aimed at 'surplus relief', and with potential implications for more sophisticated covers. UK insurers must also record negative experience account balances as liabilities in their 1992 returns. The EC Insurance Accounts Directive may help to clarify some of these issues by outlawing implicit discounting, requiring separate identification of reinsurance, assets and liabilities to be stated gross, and limitation of provisions to a 'necessary' level. US prudential concerns are identical to those in Europe. At the end of 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB standard 113, addressing transfer of risk among other reinsurance issues. This required liabilities to be stated gross, reinsurance recoverables to be treated as assets, reinsurance transactions of which the substance is not provision of an indemnity (based on considerations such as risk transfer and the reinsurer's risk of loss) to be accounted as a deposit, and enforced separate accounting of provisions for the prospective and retrospective elements of hybrid covers. Most importantly, it forbade immediate recognition of a gain or loss from any retrospective contract, which must now be spread over the term of the policy. More recently, FASB, through its Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF), issued new accounting rules affecting 'multiple-year retrospectively rated reinsurance contracts'. These require ceding companies to record experience account balances on such contracts as assets or (when negative) liabilities. The EITF acted in response to concern by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that following Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki, insurers may have placed underwriting losses off balance sheet by not recording negative experience account balances in so-called funded catastrophe covers. One company which has restated its 1992 results to take account of the task force's recommendations is Phoenix Re, which had a funded catastrophe cover with USF&amp;G. As a result, its 1992 operating loss increased from Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 3.68m, and its net premium income fell by 10.9 per cent to Dollars 48.4m. 'The EITF conclusions eliminate many of the GAAP advantages of funding property catastrophe losses through multi-year contracts,' says Mr Dan Marren, president and chief executive officer of Commercial Risk Re-Insurance Co, the financial reinsurance subsidiary of French reinsurer SCOR. 'For property catastrophes, the incurred event becomes known and losses are paid quickly, so there is no avoiding the asset or liability issue,' he adds. However, Mr Marren believes that multi-year arrangements continue to be attractive for long-tail casualty business, for which losses are accrued on an incurred but not reported (IBNR) basis and there is considerable uncertainty in the estimates. According to Mr Marren, 'for casualty lines, shared risk programmes provide an effective means to protect against adverse loss development while allowing companies to benefit from favourable development'. Funded catastrophe covers, however, have been written less by specialist financial reinsurers than by traditional reinsurers seeking new kinds of business. Three years ago, Ms Maralyn Fichte, now vice president, insurance derivatives, at Banker's Trust, criticised 'the bandwagon of funded catastrophe reinsurance'. While buyers might use it on an opportunistic basis, adoption by reinsurers of credit risk, sometimes with automatic reinstatements doubling the exposure, 'could lead to a disaster,' she suggested.</p>

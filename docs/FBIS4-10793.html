			<p>BFN     [Text] Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly  of the People's Government, in an address at the 6th plenum of  the National Association of Small Farmers [ANAP], referred to  what it would mean to Cuban farmers if the exploiters from the  prerevolutionary period were to return to power. He made  reference to two articles in a magazine published in Florida.    [Begin Alarcon recording] Farmers had no showers or proper  housing, not because they were simple minded or because they did  not care to live any better but because they were being  exploited. They were being exploited by those who left Cuba.  Now, some of those people are harboring aspirations in the face  of the great difficulties and problems that Cuba is  experiencing. Some of them are watering at the mouth to take a  bite. I do not blame them.    In this magazine there are two articles: The one on the left  page is titled "This Land is My Land" and the other is titled  "Reclaiming." The first deals with a man who seems to have owned  a great mansion in Havana or Havana Province -- it is unclear  which. He says that his house was awesome -- it is apparently  now a school -- and that his back yard is no longer private  [play on words of a children's nursery rhyme] because it is the  school's sports field. This seems to bother this man a great  deal, people playing and having a good time. The man goes on to  explain that when the Revolution collapses his home will have to  be returned to him, because it is his home. He says he will  regain his house through legal channels because he is civilized,  decent, and quiet. He goes on to say that he knows that there  are many people in Miami who would go about this in a violent  manner, kicking off their properties whoever was living there  because those properties still belong to them. They were stolen.    The other article refers to a leader of the association of  Cuban landowners in exile; this concerns the ministry of  [Alfredo] Jordan. There are people who claim the sugarcane mills  and fields, as well as the farms you are now using for  miscellaneous crops, which we hope will multiply and grow more  quickly and which the ANAP is going to discuss in August. Thus,  it is not we who are saying: If the Revolution were to  collapse....[changes thought] We do not say this to convince  anyone that we must be patriotic, we must be revolutionaries.  They are the ones saying and repeating that. [end recording]</p>

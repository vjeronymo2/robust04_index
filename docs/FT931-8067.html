			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Gardening: Impatient japonicas turn winter into spring - They're at the forefront of a year when Nature has divided itself into slow and fast lanes ONCE AGAIN, the world is running on fast-forward. Almonds are supposed to flower in March and narcissi ought to wait until spring. You might expect a snowdrop but it is much too early to be encountering primroses. They are out, nonetheless, because the year is anticipating spring in winter. I have just seen a sugar-pink prunus called Okame, smothered with light clouds of pink flower, in Oxford's botanic garden. Magnolias are about to break into bud; and against climb-proof paint on railings in London, you can already see some wisps of yellow Forsythia. In this accelerated year, there are slow and fast lanes. I think I can see why. Anything which has to emerge from main roots in the soil is slower to join the stampede. The ground is still cold, not least after so much wet. Misleading signals are rather fainter, although there are dark flowers on my forget-me-nots and on pulmonarias which ought to have waited until April. Higher up, the story is different, as if mild weather reaches the framework of buds on a shrub more directly than the roots below a dormant border plant. Early cherries have leapt from their starting blocks and the winter honeysuckles have been spectacular. It is all quite mad but, within a week of Valentine's day, I have just seen flowering quinces (known popularly as japonicas). They are two months early and well into their show of flowers. Japonicas have all the sensible virtues: they are completely hardy and indestructible, even by non-gardeners in the middle of London, and they are not just plants for difficult walls. The family falls into two groups, with various colours and a longer season than most of the catalogues describe. One group is tall, gangling and best pinned against the wall. In the wild, it grows in central China, but Japanese gardens have always favoured it and perhaps it once had wild connections there, too. The botanical name in lists is Chaenomeles speciosa, but gardeners have developed named varieties, of which three are characteristic. Nivalis is the best snow-white for training up a dark wall, even a north wall. Moerloosii is particularly charming because its flowers look like pink and white apple blossom and appear slightly later in the summer. It was bred in Belgium in the 1850s, but it still looks enchanting against a dark background and it grows quite well when facing east or north if it has enough light. I have an even softer spot for Phylis Moore, a rather leggy japonica which flowers in a charming shade of salmon pink. This one is particularly good against a wall where sunlight brings out the charm of its colouring. These Chinese japonicas are great fun to train and prune. From their early days, they can be fanned out like fingers on a hand and clipped into shape late in May after flowering: if necessary, clip off any long shoots which grow forward throughout the season. The stems develop a fairly straight line if they are fanned in this way, and the flowers are visible on an open arrangement. Nothing is ever entirely tidy, and I am being over-tidy by leaving out a good, bushy relation. Known as Simonii, it must commemorate somebody's Simon somewhere, but its habit is quite distinctive. It is low-growing and spreads into an arching bush which is excellent on a sunny bank or in a mass as a japonica thicket. Simonii does not grow more than 3ft high but the flowers are a lovely shade of dark red, semi-double and held flat against the spreading branches. On the other side of the family, we have garden hybrids known as superba. They all arise from crossing a wild Japanese and a wild Chinese variety. Both of their parents grow wild on the slopes of cold mountains; thus, they are well up to life on the Celtic fringe, even without thermal underwear. Until recently, I used to believe that the reds were best and that Rowallane was the best variety of all, especially on a low bank where it spreads to a width and height of 4ft. I now realise that there is a very fine white called Jet Trail which is good in the same situation and greatly neglected by people who like thickets of white flowers before the roses begin. This year, there will even be a greenish-yellow variety. In 1989, Notcutts of Woodbridge, Suffolk, developed stocks of a sudden accident which appeared in a customer's garden. It was named Lemon and Lime and, when I saw it last year, I thought it had possibilities. Like Simonii, these superba varieties are excellent shrubs for a low tangle, a thicket on a bank beside a drive, or as a broad group beside a flight of bold steps. I defy you to kill them and I also believe that they will grow in fairly dry summers: the late Russell Page sometimes used big blocks of them in gardens in southern France which he described to me as very dry. Gardeners who think of this family only on a wall are missing their best use. Japonicas will knit together and make a low plantation which excludes weeds. Most of the varieties throw off suckers which you can simply cut off with a spade and replant. Otherwise, all of them will root very easily if you take the low branches and fix them down on to bare earth so that they make a root system of their own. Then, you simply cut off these layers and move them to another place. The next three or four weeks are the right time to begin this simple multiplication: with their exceptional goodwill, japonicas are flowering early in order to remind us to make the most of them.</p>

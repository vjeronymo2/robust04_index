			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. CHANGES POLICY, BACKS U.N. OBSERVERS FOR GAZA, WEST BANK  </P> <P> The State Department said today that the United States will support sending a  U.N. team of observers to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to  report on the human rights situation.  </P> <P> The statement, by spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, was described by her as a  shift in the previously declared U.S. policy.  </P> <P> Last week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the United States "would  be prepared to discuss" a U.N. delegation, without defining the size or mission  of the group.  </P> <P> Tutwiler said today that U.S. support will be limited to a small delegation  under the mandate of the U.N. Security Council or the secretary general,  similar to the mission to Israel led by Marrack Goulding, a U.N. official, in  January, 1988.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Israeli government said Israel will oppose any U.N.  presence as an infringement on Israeli sovereignty as an occupying power. A  spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy in Washington said she wants to study the  Tutwiler statement before commenting on the new policy.  </P> <P> The U.N Security Council, back in New York after hearing a statement by  Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, is expected to take  up the matter later today.  </P> <P> Tutwiler also said the statements by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in which  he once again vowed to use chemical weapons against Israel in case of an  Israeli attack.  </P></p>

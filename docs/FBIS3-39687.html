			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- The Free Democratic Party of Germany  [FDP] does not want to commit itself to a date for deciding on a  statement concerning a potential coalition after the 16 October  Bundestag elections. After the FDP Presidium's weekly meeting  on Monday [21 February], FDP Chairman Klaus Kinkel only said  that the FDP will announce "where we will go" at an "appropriate  time" before the elections.    He left it open whether this is to be done at the federal  party congress in September. The Presidium decided on Monday to  move the date of the congress, which was originally planned for  17-18 September in Berlin, to 3-4 September in Nuremberg in  order to gain more time before the Bundestag elections. The  liberals want to make an election appeal in Nuremberg. The  election program is to be adopted at a preceding federal party  congress in Rostock on 3-5 June.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 17 (XINHUA) -- The U.S. Government  has reaffirmed that it recognizes Tibet as part of China and  that it will continue to follow a "one China" policy.    The remarks were made by the State Department spokesman,  Michael McCurry, in a statement released on Monday [16 May].    He said, "It is long-standing U.S. policy that Tibet is part  of China. Neither the U.S. nor any other state regards Tibet as  a sovereign nation. The U.S. does not recognize a Tibetan  government- in-exile."    In a bid to clarify some provisions contained in the  "Foreign  Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995" adopted  by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Clinton in  late April, McCurry also made it clear that "as both a practical  and legal matter, it would not be possible for the U.S. to  establish offices or conduct programs (in Tibet) without the  permission of the Chinese Government."    The spokesman continued that the United States will continue  to follow a "one-China" policy. "The language in the act  referring to official visits, including cabinet-level exchanges  with Taiwan are 'sense of the Congress' and not binding," he  said in the statement.    His statement also described the wording of the  authorization  act that the Taiwan Relations Act takes precedence over the 1982  communique as "equivalent to a `sense of the Congress' and not  binding."    "We continue to honor our commitment to the August 17, 1982  communique with respect to arms sales to Taiwan and regard it as  one of the three pillars supporting our bilateral relationship.  Nothing in the Foreign Relations Authorization Act will  interfere with our continuing to honor this commitment," he said.    The United States remains, he stated, "fully committed to  the  three joint communiques between the PRC and the U.S. as the  framework of our China policy. Nothing in the Foreign Relations  Authorization Act changes this."    The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman has expressed  appreciation of the above-mentioned statement and hoped that the  U.S. Government will honor its commitment in real earnest.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: French pensions French capitalism continues to struggle without adequate capital. The combined market value of domestic equities last year was equivalent to just 40 per cent of GDP. That compared with the UK's 128 per cent. The problem will partly be alleviated by the privatisation programme which, it was hinted, might include the massive France Telecom. But France's equity culture will be strengthened far more by pensions reform. At present, pensions are distributed directly by contributions from the active workforce: there are no capitalised pension funds to invest in the market. But the present system is unsustainable: the welfare deficit, which last year reached FFr40bn, is set to deteriorate rapidly as France's population ages. The reforms, which are politically contentious and whose structure remains unclear, should be enacted after the presidential elections next spring. Whatever is decided, the insurance companies' role will be pivotal. The acquisitions of Sun Life by UAP, and Equity &amp; Law by Axa were partly motivated by the need to gain fund management experience. The bourse will be significantly strengthened as fund managers are attracted by equities' better long-term returns. With more stable long-term shareholders, France's corporations will no longer have an excuse for their complicated cross-shareholdings which protect management from the market's discipline. None of this will happen overnight. But reform should eventually provide France with twin benefits of adequately funded pensions and a stronger stock exchange.</p>

Correa  Isaza was the regional director of the Antioquia Prosecutor's  Office technical corps. The assassins were traveling in a white  Renault 9 and fled the scene after killing Correa Isaza. So  far, authorities have been unable to locate the perpetrators.    Correa Isaza was traveling in a gray Renault 18 when several  men attacked his car near a building at No. 82-24, 49B Street  and shot him several times. The Antioquia Prosecutor's Office  official was immediately taken to Pablo Tobon Uribe hospital in  Medellin, where he died in the emergency room a few minutes  later. Correa Isaza's driver was also seriously injured in the  attack. Correa Isaza was reportedly going to look for his  girlfriend when he was attacked.    Luis Fernando Correa, a 34-year-old lawyer who graduated  from  Medellin University, was a key government figure in obtaining  the surrender of several criminals and implementing the witness  protection program. He was widely known in legal circles for  helping get Nicolas Escobar Urquijo, nephew of Medellin Cartel  drug lord Pablo Escobar Gaviria, out of the country, and for  helping transfer Escobar Gaviria's relatives to Santa Fe de  Bogota. Moreover, Correa Isaza was conducting important  investigations of people accused of belonging to the Medellin  Cartel.    According to witnesses, Correa was shot by a young, stocky  man dressed in blue who was picked up a few seconds later by a  white Renault 9. It is therefore suspected that more people are  involved in the crime.    Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said he regretted the  incident and although the reason for the crime and the  perpetrators are still unknown, Correa Isaza was involved in  many delicate investigations that could have prompted the  murder. The ranking judicial official said the regional  director of Antioquia Prosecutor's Office technical corps was a  brave man who took too many risks because, despite his delicate  position, he liked to move about the city alone or only with his  driver.    Ivan Felipe Palacios, secretary of the departmental  government, said "one cannot understand how such things happen  to people who are only honestly and positively working in favor  of justice and the country." He asked the Prosecutor General's  Office to begin immediately an investigation of the crime,  because "we cannot progress without finding the real culprits."  He asserted: I am going to be very conscious of everything  related to this case because it is very painful for justice and  for the people of Antioquia."    During one of Correa Isaza's latest operations, 70 kg of  dynamite were seized from the estate of the father of late  Medellin Cartel member Alfonso Leon Puerta Munoz, alias "El  Angelito."</p>

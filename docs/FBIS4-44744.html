			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Optical Thin Films: CEA/REOSC </F> Optical Licensing Agreement"]    [Text] Paris--The French company REOSC Optique [Optical  Research and Studies and Allied Sciences] will industrialize a  process developed by the Atomic Energy Commission's (CEA)  directorate of military applications to produce optical  anti-reflection or high-reflectivity thin film deposits.    On 24 February, the CEA announced that the licensing  agreement that was just signed will enable REOSC to use this  "sol-gel" process to make scientific optical components and  anti-reflection glass panes, especially to protect art works.  The technique was developed at the Limeil-Valenton center in  connection with research on military power lasers and is covered  by several patents; it consists in depositing by capillarity  high-performance thin films, a few microns thick.    The "sol-gel" process uses submicron particles of oxides or  fluorides in an alcohol- or water-based medium. After  evaporation of the solvent, these particles form a brittle  porous optical film, but one of the anti-reflection coatings,  Flucosil, is a dense abrasion-resistant and water-repellent  composite film.    The process works at ordinary temperatures (around 120xC)  and  even at room temperature, so that it can be applied to mineral  or plastic media. According to the CEA, it can also treat large  areas at very competitive prices.    A subsidiary of the French aircraft equipment manufacturer  SFIM-Industries [Measuring Instruments Manufacturing Company],  REOSC Optique is a world-renowned specialist of high-precision  optics for satellites such as Spot. It is currently grinding the  first eight-meter diameter mirror of the Very Large Telescope  (VLT) that will be installed at the European Southern  Observatory (ESO), on top of Cerro Paranal, in Chile.</p>

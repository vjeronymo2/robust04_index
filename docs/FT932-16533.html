			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Small retailers face higher card charges from Barclays bank BARCLAYS has told about 40,000 small retailers that the amount they are charged for each credit card purchase is to rise by 8 per cent from this month unless they pay Pounds 35 a month to rent electronic card checking machines from the bank. The increase is part of an effort by high street banks to raise charges to retailers for card transactions because their card-handling subsidiaries - known as merchant acquirers - have been making only small profits, or losses. National Westminster said it had not raised charges, but the bank is expected to re-examine them next month. Lloyds said it was raising credit card transaction charges by an average of 0.2 percentage points of purchase values. The rises were disclosed as Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, called on banks to freeze fees and charges for the rest of the year. Although the transaction charges do not apply to consumers they could be passed on in higher prices. Mr Brown is also planning to lead an attempt by Labour MPs to ensure that consumers are better informed about the borrowing charges on credit cards by inserting provisions in the Finance Bill implementing the March Budget. Barclays has told half of the 80,000 small customers of its merchant acquirer that credit card transaction charges - which are between 1.2 and 4.5 per cent of purchase value - will rise 8 per cent unless they switch to electronic checking. It has also raised its charges by 1.4p per debit card transaction. It says this equals an average rise of 4 per cent for smaller retailers, who were paying between 20p and 60p per transaction before the rise in charges last week. Mr Richard Reay-Smith, chief executive of Barclays' central retail services division, said the bank was trying to give small retailers an incentive to take on electronic checking systems that would reduce fraud. Mr Reay-Smith said debit cards remained 'fundamentally under-priced' because fraud losses matched the amount gained on charges. Barclays' fraud losses on debit cards for the first six months of last year were Pounds 10.8m. Barclays said retailers might save money by hiring the electronic checking machines.

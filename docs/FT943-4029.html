			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Collecting: Cotswold dealers see the light - After four hard years, Antony Thorncroft finds that optimism is returning to the antiques trade After four years of chill winds and battened down hatches, the first rays of sunshine are brightening the lives of the Cotswolds' 60 or so serious antique dealers. The recovery in demand is still described as 'spasmodic' but most dealers are more relaxed about the future. One of the largest, Jack Baggott of Woolcomber House, Stow-on-the-Wold, says: 'I will be making my first profit for three years.' The Cotswolds is easily the biggest antiques centre in the country outside London. It is also the pleasantest to visit. The charm of the country is a big factor in persuading dealers to set up shop there and customers, both dealers and private collectors, to trawl around the clusters of shops in Stow and Burford, and the good showings in Broadway, Cirencester, Witney, Moreton-in-Marsh and the smaller villages. In some sectors, such as oak furniture, there are probably more fine pieces on offer than in London. And because the operating costs of Cotswold dealers are lower than their London rivals, their prices tend to be more attractive. Anyone interested in antiques, especially for home decoration, but over-awed by London dealers and the auction rooms, can find a wide range of antiques, mostly costing less than Pounds 5,000, in the Cotswolds. Most dealers will also negotiate on marked prices, but only within 10 per cent. This year demand has picked up, even in July and August - usually quiet months when the towns and villages are crawling with tourists who clutter the shops but usually do little more than browse. This year, though, some actually bought. Private collectors, who in the past decade have replaced dealers as the main customers, have recovered their confidence. An important factor has been the increase in house sales in the region, particularly in the upper price range. People buying a new home tend to refurbish, and they like the country furniture which is available readily in many shops. Some of the houses will have been sold by hard-hit Lloyd's Names, but expectations that these would dispose of their art and antiques to a trade desperately short of fine items have not materialised. Lloyd's has hit the Cotswolds mainly by depriving dealers of regular buyers. Of course, many dealers like a moan and, with trade improving, their grievances are directed now at grasping and unsupportive bank managers who continue to raise charges; spiralling business rates; and the shortage of good stock. Certainly, dealers must work harder - by touring the UK and abroad; by cultivating clients in the hope these will sell back items; and by attending obscure auctions - to ensure that they can re-stock with quality goods. It is not surprising that, with real incomes rising, there should be an improvement in demand. But many dealers are sounder financially because of their success in cutting costs. Stephen Jarrett of Witney Antiques, who has one of the finest stocks of 18th century (and later) furniture in the area, has managed to reduce operating expenses from Pounds 280,000 a year to Pounds 190,000. Others, like Robin Shield, have given up their shops (he used to operate in Burford) to trade from home - in his case, Cricklade. But dealers are still attracted to the Cotswolds. In Stow, which has more than 20 antique shops, numbers have been swelled recently by the arrival from London of Arthur Seager, who concentrates on pre-1800 furniture and carvings, and Roger Lamb, who covers the field of decorative items. Both are delighted with their move. Seager swopped a Kensington lease for a Stow freehold and saw his costs fall 20 per cent. He is one of the dealers who locks his door against casual callers: he relies on his regulars, many of whom are American collectors who appreciate a pair of 16th century carved wooden heads for Pounds 2,200; an early-18th century tavern settle for Pounds 1,250; and a cosy Elizabethan farmer's chair for about Pounds 13,500. Lamb has turned over his stock since February. He concentrates on small, decorative antiques, all priced below Pounds 5,000, such as a Regency chiffonier for Pounds 3,000 and a games table at the same price. Both show off well in the homes of his principal customers, the weekend country cottages of the wealthy. Costs apart, the Cotswold dealers have survived better than London during the recession partly because they are happy with more modest margins (30 per cent and sometimes less) and partly because many concentrate on furniture. 'Demand is still out-stripping supply in English furniture,' says Baggott, although it is only the finest pieces which command the premiums. Even so, he reckons prices have not moved up in the past year. Baggott has a huge stock, of almost 5,000 items, mainly priced between Pounds 1,000-Pounds 5,000. At the moment buyers want useful furniture, like the Gillow pedestal desk priced at Pounds 2,850, and the circular, Coalbrookdale garden seat, which rings a tree, priced at Pounds 3,450. Like many dealers, he regrets the disappearance of good 18th century walnut and Chippendale pieces. Prices for them at auction can be so high that, by the time a dealer has smartened up an item, there is no profit in it. Few local buyers like to venture above Pounds 10,000. Those that do, end up at Witney Antiques, which carries a stock that rivals London's Bond Street. On offer now are a magisterial pair of Regency desks made by Gillow, priced at Pounds 58,000. This is exceptional, though. As a sign of the times, Witney Antiques is seeking a wider market, and most items now cost less than Pounds 25,000, such as an attractive group of four tables that slip beneath each other and carry a Pounds 5,500 tag. Among the specialist Cotswold shops, Manfred Schotten in Burton has one of the widest ranges of sporting antiques in the UK. One of the smallest items for sale at present, a feather golf ball of around 1940 made by James Gourlay, is one of the most expensive in the shop at Pounds 7,500; while one of the largest items, a late-19th century full-sized snooker table, is priced at Pounds 3,000. Here, you can find enticing presents for sports-mad partners: late-Victorian golf clubs at Pounds 185 (and Edwardian at Pounds 95); Victorian tennis rackets for Pounds 145; and 1930s' cricket bats for just Pounds 45. Across the road is another specialist, Richard Purdon, who sells rugs and carpets - the genuine, pre-1900 articles, not modern substitutes. This market has received a new lease of life with the disappearance of the Soviet Union. Many fine rugs and textiles are now coming out of places like Uzbekistan. Purdon is offering a fine, colourful Uzbek coat for Pounds 350: he sold an even better one to the US for Pounds 3,000. Purdon goes for a small profit and a quick turnover and his prices rarely climb above Pounds 10,000. An exception is a fine Bijar carpet on offer at Pounds 14,500: he bought it from a local family which had acquired it in 1979 for Pounds 4,000 - so proving that many antiques, even those you walk over, appreciate in price. There are not many specialist picture dealers in the Cotswolds but, just outside Cheltenham, The Priory offers decorative late-19th and early-20th century art, while John Noot and Richard Hagen of Broadway trade in similarly popular works. Noot has just opened a third outlet inside the Lygon Arms hotel. In Stow, the biggest gallery belongs to John Davies. He has adapted to the more selective market by adding limited edition prints to his stock alongside works by Dorothea Sharp and Harold Harvey, now on offer well below their 1989 saleroom peaks of Pounds 60,000 or so. On October 19, Davies is showing watercolours of Venice by two respected artists, David Gluck and John Linfield, priced between Pounds 350 and Pounds 2,500. Typical of Cotswold premises overflowing with every conceivable antique, from Victorian snuff boxes to Georgian dressers, are Rankin Taylor in Cirencester and Jonathan Fyson at Burton. Leslie Taylor has crammed her shop with items she likes, ranging between early glasses from Pounds 8 to a leather-covered chair of around 1680 priced at Pounds 1,250. Fyson likes to turn over his stock four times a year. Among his curiosities is a collapsible teak table of around 1800 used aboard ship: price Pounds 3,000. Other shops are more severe. Keith Hockin in Stow loves early oak, and here you can buy 18th century candle boxes for Pounds 300 or less; large pewter flagons for Pounds 2,000, and an 18th century wine bottle from All Souls' common room for Pounds 95. And back in Cirencester, at William H. Stokes, you get equally early items aimed at the higher end of the market. He is offering, for Pounds 22,500, a 1580 table which he sold 25 years ago for Pounds 1,900. People now know that antiques can be a good investment. But their real attractions are that they are beautiful, often useful, and cheer up a home. Equally pleasurable is hunting for them in a region as quintessentially English as the Cotswolds.</p>

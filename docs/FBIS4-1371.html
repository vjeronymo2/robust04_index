			<p>BFN     [Text] Mozambique experienced a cruel war for 16 years. It  killed many people and left in its wake real legions of  war-displaced people and refugees. That war ended with the  signing of the Rome peace accords in October 1992, but Carlos  Reis, president of the Mozambican National Union [Unamo], has  said that a fourth war could break out if a federal system is  not introduced in this country. The Unamo leader also made  hitherto unheard of disclosures. For instance, he said that the  political opposition parties could nominate Afonso Dhlakama,  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader, as their  candidate in the upcoming presidential elections. Like Unamo,  those parties are defending a federal system.    Unamo President Carlos Alexandre dos Reis said he had warned  Afonso Dhlakama that, should he fail to follow the path of  federalism and should another war break out in this country, a  war like the one in Angola, he -- Dhlakama -- would be to blame  for the blood to be shed by the Mozambican people.    [Begin recording] [Reis] I have already told President  Dhlakama that if he does not follow that path and we are faced  with another war such as the one that has beset Angola, he will  be to blame for the blood that is shed by the Mozambican people.  Afonso Dhlakama fought for 16 years for change to come to  Mozambique. We recognize that. Now, he should agree to a  federal system. That would prove that he does not crave power.  That would show that he does not want power, that he is not  doing it all just to replace Chissano. Should he fail to do so,  he is quite certain to lose all his credibility among the  Mozambican people. It will show that he wants to come in and  play the same game the Mozambique Liberation Front [Frelimo]  used to play: It took over and fulfilled none of the promises it  made.    If he fought for the benefit of the Mozambican people, then  he should agree to a federal system. Should he do so, with our  support, we would be certain to dislodge Chissano from Ponta  Vermelha Palace [words indistinct].    [Unidentified correspondent] In one of his latest statements  to the national media, Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama suggested  that the candidate with the second highest number of votes  should be appointed vice president.    [Reis] No, that is not democratic. The Frelimo Party has  already rejected it. That will depend on the party that wins  elections. As the ruling party, it must resolve the problem of  government. It will form its government and it will ask whoever  it pleases to be part of government. Now, no elections would be  needed if someone could just come along and dictate the  composition of government to the ruling party. I do not agree  with that position because I do not perceive it to be  democratic. [end recording]</p>

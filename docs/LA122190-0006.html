			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER DOLPHINS  </P> <P> In this world of homeless and starving people, the expensive full-page ad  headlined "Nationwide Consumer Advisory" (Dec. 4) paid for by the Earth Island  Institute Save the Dolphins Project headed by David Phillips really irked me!  </P> <P> Whatever his dispute is with the Bumble Bee canning company I don't really care  nor would I contribute or could afford his request for donations of $15 to $500  or more to support his cause. As a simple day-to-day grocery shopper and using  manufacturer's food coupons, I manage to eke out a living. To Phillips I ask,  what is next? Save the cattle, save the sheep or save the turkeys on  Thanksgiving Day?  </P> <P> ARTHUR J. BREZAE  </P> <P> West Hills  </P></p>

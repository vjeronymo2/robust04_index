			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft raises CDollars 460m Metallgesellschaft, the troubled German metals and engineering group, is to raise almost CDollars 460m (USDollars 336m) from the sale of its controlling stake in Metall Mining, the international mining group based in Canada. The German group's 40.7m shares in Metall will be bought for CDollars 11.25 each by an underwriting consortium before being sold. The deal marks the end of complex negotiations between Metallgesellschaft and Metall which involved several other companies with interests at stake, and a further stage in the restructuring of the German group. The main stumbling block was Metall's 35 per cent stake in Norddeutsche Affinerie, which operates a large copper smelter in northern Germany. Metallgesellschaft is to buy back this holding for CDollars 152m in accordance with its contract with the other shareholders in Norddeutsche, MIM Holdings and Degussa. Under this arrangement, Metallgesellschaft was obliged to take back the stake if it ceased to control Metall. Metallgesellschaft is to pay CDollars 40m in cash and the balance, covered by an interest-bearing promissory note, is to be paid by the end of December next year. Metall said yesterday that it planned to file a prospectus with Canadian securities authorities to qualify the shares previously held by the German group for sale to the public in Canada. The stock will also be sold in Europe and distributed through private placements in the US.</p>

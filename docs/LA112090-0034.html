			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ TO SEND MORE TROOPS INTO KUWAIT  </P> <P> The Iraqi government Monday ordered 250,000 more troops to Kuwait and decried  American criticism of its plan to release foreign hostages over three months  beginning Christmas Day.  </P> <P> The military command, in a statement released Monday evening, said seven more  divisions will be sent to Kuwait and additional reserves will be activated.  </P> <P> Talking peace and preparing for war, President Saddam Hussein's regime sent  mixed signals to the Western alliance and its Arab allies.  </P> <P> The estimated quarter-million troops will join the reported 430,000 Iraqi  troops already in Kuwait and southern Iraq.  </P> <P> In addition, 150,000 reservists will be sent into training, the command  statement said. Western diplomats here say that Baghdad is drawing on its last  reservoirs of reserves.  </P> <P> In Washington, Defense Department officials played down the significance of the  new Iraqi deployments, noting that they will likely come from the ranks of  reserve forces that are poorly trained and ill-equipped.  </P> <P> While Iraq's vaunted million-member army would permit Hussein to field greater  numbers of troops than the United States and its allies, only a risky decision  to divert forces from the Iranian or Turkish borders would free effective new  troops for a fight to keep Kuwait, the officials said.  </P> <P> Roughly 3,500 of Iraq's 5,000 tanks already are committed to Kuwait and the  surrounding area, and officials expect that the new influx of troops will run  the remaining armored vehicles. Analysts have said that these vehicles are the  oldest and least reliable of the Iraqi force and already have been raided to  supply parts for front-line armored forces.  </P> <P> "He is starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel," said one senior defense  official of the announced Iraqi increase.  </P> <P> The Pentagon, citing past increases and significant improvements in the Iraqi  deployment, recently announced that it would dispatch a second wave of U.S.  troops to Saudi Arabia, numbering more than 200,000.  </P> <P> Western forces in the Persian Gulf region, mounting steadily since the Aug. 2  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, will total more than 430,000 once American  reinforcements are in place in January.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Information Minister Latif Jasim rejected American criticism of the  proposed hostage release as "cynical manipulation."  </P> <P> "We expect evil of all these persons and are taking precautions," he said. ". .  . We think they are in a crisis and an impasse. The only outlet is peace and a  peaceful dialogue."  </P> <P> The American hostages got word of the proposed Christmas holiday release from  one of their colleagues who was on the telephone to his family when the report  was aired Sunday night in the United States.  </P> <P> Roland Bergheer, 62, a traffic and logistics consultant from Las Vegas who was  working on contract for the Baghdad government when Iraqi troops invaded  Kuwait, said the Americans sheltered in diplomatic quarters here viewed the  Iraqi announcement with restraint.  </P> <P> "It's nice to think about," said Bergheer, who serves as a press liaison for  the U.S. hostages. "But it really didn't generate a great deal of excitement.  It (the diplomatic shelter) was very subdued.  </P> <P> "A lot of things have happened here in the past that might have suggested the  same thing," he said, characterizing the mood as one of caution "so we may not  get our hopes up too high, or false hopes."  </P> <P> "It really didn't generate any jumping up and down," he said.  </P> <P> Another Western hostage, an unidentified physician, agreed. "Sure, if it  happens, I'd go," he said. "But how can you believe this government?"  </P> <P> Despite Sunday's conditional pledge to release all hostages beginning Christmas  Day, Jasim made clear Monday that the trade in foreign captives remains open in  the interim.  </P> <P> The hostage bazaar, as some diplomats call it, is still in business for a  speedy release of some of the hundreds of Westerners denied exit permits here,  he disclosed at a morning press conference. "It depends on the representation  made for them," he told reporters.  </P> <P> Jasim denied that the Iraqi government made a political mistake in holding the  foreigners hostage in the first place. "We still consider ourselves doing  something appropriate and correct towards ourselves and humanity in general,"  Jasim said of the government's Aug. 17 decision to deny Westerners the right to  leave Iraq, subsequently sending hundreds of them to potential military targets  as so-called human shields.  </P> <P> Hussein's ruling Revolutionary Command Council announced Sunday that all the  hostages would be released in batches from Christmas Day to March 25.  </P> <P> Several tests of the starting date were on the table as Jasim spoke. A  five-member Swiss delegation, led by Edgar Oehler, a member of the National  Assembly here ostensibly as a private citizen, was urging Iraqi officials to  free 24 Swiss hostages, 25 foreigners working for Swiss companies and 150 other  foreign nationals.  </P> <P> Oehler said the Iraqis had told him the release was under consideration. Asked  at his press conference about the prospect, Jasim said "there were several  other considerations," mentioning Oehler's suggestion of Switzerland as the  site for a peace conference on the Persian Gulf crisis and the possible  shipment of Swiss medical supplies to Iraq.  </P> <P> Western sources, without identifying the country, said a European government,  presumably Switzerland, is preparing to send a large shipment of medical goods  to Baghdad. Supplies of medicine are permitted under the U.N. Security Council  trade embargo of Iraq.  </P> <P> French and Canadian political delegations also have arrived in Baghdad. French  citizens have already been given permission to leave, but the Canadian group  will be seeking the release of Canada's estimated 50 hostages in Iraq.  </P> <P> The Iraqi pledge was conditioned on the absence of any disturbance of what the  ruling council called "the atmosphere of peace."  </P> <P> Asked what development might derail the release of the hostages, Jasim  responded with the obvious -- war. "When the groups start to leave . . . and an  attack takes place, the process would be affected," he told reporters.  </P> <P> Regarding a prospective U.N. Security Council resolution endorsing military  action to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait, he said, "We will have to watch  that."  </P> <P> But he insisted that the plan means release for all hostages, even those held  as human shields at military targets. "This is our policy, and nobody will be  excluded from this policy," Jasim remarked.  </P> <P> The information minister appeared to dodge a question on whether American men  hiding from the Iraqi authorities in Kuwait would be permitted to leave. "This  is a procedural thing not related to the political attitude," he said,  insisting that the hard-pressed fugitives in Kuwait are required to turn  themselves in to Iraqi officials "so they can be put under the protection of  the Iraqi government."  </P> <P> So far, every American man in Kuwait who fell into the hands of the Iraqis has  been sent out as a human shield.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Melissa Healy in Washington contributed to this article.  </P></p>

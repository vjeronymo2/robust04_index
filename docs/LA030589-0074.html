			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIAL WORKER'S TRAGIC DEATH  </P> <P> The tragedy of Robbyn Panitch's death is overwhelming to her parents as well as  all of us. Hopefully, her tragedy will not prevent others from pursuing the  noblest goals of helping people in distress.  </P> <P> It is disturbing, however, to note the reactions of her parents in distress.  Her father, "a Democratic Party activist," was liberal in his blame of Prop.  13, Gov. George Deukmejian and former President Ronald Reagan. Never mind that  a guard at the entrance of the facility would most likely have had little  effect, that the ACLU has to a large degree been responsible for keeping  violent, psychiatric people in the streets if they do not agree to be  hospitalized, that Ms. Panitch voluntarily and altruistically entered a  profession with a high degree of potential violence (even responding to 911  emergency calls to strange behavior), that her parents' politics probably were  a factor in steering her to devotion to the public good with an increased  exposure to potential violence.  </P> <P> Mr. Panitch, there are many problems in our society which need correction and  improvement. All of us, liberal as well as conservative, deplore tragedies such  as occurred to your daughter. We obviously have different ideas and concepts on  how to approach many of society's problems. However, your liberal heart ought  to include the ability to intellectualize that good is not captive of liberals,  while evil is not pervasive in conservatives. Honest men honestly differ.  </P> <P> SAUL H. SANDERS  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

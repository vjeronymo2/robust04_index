			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Trimmer Rolls-Royce at Pounds 40m - Cost cutting and restructuring behind 29% advance despite sales fall Rolls-Royce, the aero engine and industrial power group, yesterday reported a 29 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1994 despite a 14 per cent decline in sales. The higher profits of Pounds 40m (Pounds 31m) reflected the company's cost cutting and restructuring drive, which offset continuing difficulty in the aerospace and industrial power markets. Sales fell from Pounds 1.75bn to Pounds 1.5bn. Sir Ralph Robins, chairman, said he did not expect any improvement in market conditions until 1996. The company's restructuring programme, however, involving the closure of six plants and the shedding of 6,500 jobs by next spring was running ahead of plan, placing the group 'in a good competitive position to take advantage of the orders which are expected over the longer term'. 'Conditions remain extremely challenging in all our markets, but our greater productivity coupled with the completion of the major part of our Trent civil engine development programme will enable us steadily to improve performance,' Sir Ralph said. Trent engines will power the new Boeing and Airbus wide body airliners. Sales in the group's aerospace activities fell from Pounds 1.08bn to Pounds 924m with profits before interest of Pounds 3m (Pounds 5m). However, the company expected civil engine deliveries for the year to be similar to the 1993 level. As expected, military engine deliveries were lower. Sales in the industrial power operations fell to Pounds 576m (Pounds 674m), while profits before interest rose to Pounds 37m (Pounds 35m). The company's cost cutting drive has led to an improvement in operating margins to 9.9 per cent (8.9 per cent). The current order book totalled Pounds 5.9bn, excluding a further Pounds 1bn of announced orders not yet subject to formal contracts, the company said. The balance sheet remains strong with net cash of Pounds 309m at the end of June. Excluding last year's rights issue, net cash has improved by Pounds 134m over the last 12 months. The interim dividend is held at 2p, payable from earnings per share ahead to 2.53p (2.21p restated). COMMENT Although Rolls-Royce shares closed 8p down yesterday at 180p, the interim figures were in line with most City estimates. The company is still having to ride the bottom of the aerospace cycle which is unlikely to turn before 1996. However, extensive restructuring and productivity improvements should put it in a strong position to take advantage when the upturn eventually occurs - after a recession in the industry which started in 1990. The company has also continued to invest in expanding its aero-engine product range, which has placed it in a much stronger competitive position against its US rivals than in earlier industry cycles. But there are unlikely to be any short-term miracles and the company is likely to face another 12 to 18 months of hard slog before it finally sees some tangible improvement in its main markets. A full-year forecast of Pounds 100m pre-tax, against Pounds 76m last year, leaves the shares on a forward multiple of nearly 29 even after an 18p fall in two days.</p>

Baena Soares added that the possibility of including drug  trafficking on the agenda of the meeting he will hold with  President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella on 18  March "depends on the decision" of Argentine officials.    As to armed forces' participation in the antinarcotics  effort, he said: "It is up to each country to decide about that  because several countries believe this is a task to be fulfilled  by police."    The OAS has a special commission to deal with this issue,  and  Baena Soares said he is in favor of "concentrating efforts to  reduce demand for drugs."    He said: "To reduce this demand means to educate and  rehabilitate drug addicts and reinstate them into society."  [passage omitted]</p>

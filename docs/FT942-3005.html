			<p>940616 FT  16 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Open-ended emerging markets fund from F&amp;C Foreign &amp; Colonial, the investment management group, is launching an open-ended fund which, it says, will provide investors with a diversified exposure to emerging markets. F&amp;C, which already has a Pounds 130m closed-end emerging markets investment trust, has not set any firm targets for the new fund, in view of the downturn in emerging markets. However, the daily dealing at net asset value, and the increased liquidity provided by the open-ended structure, should appeal to investors wanting more efficient and less risky access to markets which are intrinsically volatile. The Luxembourg-listed fund will follow the asset allocation models used by F&amp;C. The launch period for the shares, which are priced at Dollars 10 each, runs until July 1. The minimum investment is Dollars 5,000.</p>

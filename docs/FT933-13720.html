			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Food in US deal with Del Monte YORKSHIRE Food Group, the Bradford-based food processor floated in March, has quickly fulfilled its promise to expand by announcing a Pounds 17.8m deal with Del Monte Corporation, the US food company. It is setting up a joint venture to acquire the US group's Californian-based business, Del Monte Dried Fruit, which is one of the largest participants in the US market, processing a variety of dried fruit and fruit snacks under the Del Monte brand. Mr Mike Firth, chairman and chief executive of YFG, said: 'The business is one we know very well. It has a strong retail presence and we believe its quality product range can be extended to non-retail markets. We also believe there is scope for substantial cost-savings under our management.' The Californian business will be acquired by a newly incorporated company, Yorkshire Dried Fruit, of which YFG will control 80 per cent and DMC the rest. The consideration will be about Dollars 26.7m (Pounds 17.8m), to be satisfied by Dollars 20.2m in cash and the balance by shares in Yorkshire Dried Fruit. In order to fund its investment, YFG will raise Pounds 11.4m through a placing and open offer to shareholders; up to 10.48m shares will be issued at 114p each. The company's shares were placed in March at 110p, but immediately jumped to 138p. They yesterday rose 4p to 129p. The new shares have been conditionally placed with Charterhouse Bank, the group's financial advisers. Shareholders can claw back on the basis of 4-for-13, with Panmure Gordon as broker to the issue. The issue will represent about 23.5 per cent of the enlarged capital. The joint venture will be licensed to use the Del Monte brand in the US, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean, in perpetuity, for specified products including dried fruit, processed nuts, and seeds. For the 11 months to May, Del Monte Dried Fruit made operating profits of Dollars 7.3m on sales of Dollars 51m, but Mr Firth was confident profits could be quickly increased. Mr Bob D'Ornellas, president and chief operating officer of DMC, said: 'YFG's blend of skills and management style will bring a new dimension to Del Monte Dried Fruit. The joint venture will enable us to retain an ongoing involvement in this branded products range whilst furthering our objective of focusing on our core activities.' DMC is controlled a private US consortium led by Merrill Lynch which bought Del Monte's produce business for Dollars 1.54bn in 1990 from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US buy-out specialists. KKR had bought RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco group which exclusively owned the Del Monte name, for Dollars 25bn in 1989. KKR broke up Del Monte into two parts, selling the fresh fruit business in September 1989 to Polly Peck International, the fruit and electronics conglomerate which collapsed in 1990. Last year PPI Del Monte Fresh Produce, the fresh fruit side of Polly Peck International, was sold for Dollars 499m to a mainly Mexican investor group.</p>

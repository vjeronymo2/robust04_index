			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / RTZ up 26% and pays foreign income dividend RTZ, the world's biggest mining company, yesterday pleased the London stock market by reporting interim profits at the top end of analysts' expectations and announcing that it was to be the latest big British company to pay a foreign income dividend (Fid). Fids allow significant advance corporation tax (ACT) savings for companies that generate nearly all their income outside the UK. In the first half, only 1 per cent of RTZ's net earnings arose in Europe, including the UK. Mr Bob Wilson, chief executive, said a combination of lower tax, higher volumes, improved metals prices and reduced costs helped to lift pre-tax profits by 26 per cent from Pounds 339m to Pounds 427m in the six months to June 30. Volume increases boosted net earnings by Pounds 25m compared with the first half of 1993, mainly from new or recent investments such as the Flambeau copper and gold mine and the Powder River Basin coal operations, both in the US, and the first two expansions of the Escondida copper mine in Chile. Higher prices contributed an extra Pounds 16m. Cost savings totalled Pounds 17m. Mr Wilson said the underlying world economic outlook was brighter than it had been since the 1980s. The US economy was firm, Europe was recovering and Japan at least had hit bottom. Other Asian markets remained promising, although there were some doubts about China. First-half turnover rose by 10 per cent to Pounds 1.86bn. Earnings per share were up 6 per cent from 24.9p to 26.3p. Excluding exceptional items, they rose by 30 per cent from 17.5p to 22.7p. Operating cash flow remained strong at Pounds 336m. Net debt fell to Pounds 196m from Pounds 384m at the end of December, and represented only 5 per cent of total capital. The tax charge fell from 39.5 per cent to 31.9 per cent, mainly because there was no provision for write-off of surplus ACT. Mr Chris Bull, finance director, said it would be prudent in future to assume the charge would be about 33 1/3 per cent. RTZ increased its dividend by the amount of ACT saved. Mr Bull insisted that the move to Fids would leave UK tax-exempt shareholders no worse off but taxpayers would be 25 per cent better off. He said it was not possible to offer a scrip alternative to a Fid but at the year-end RTZ intended to recommend a mixture of Fids and conventional dividends which would allow it to continue to make the scrip alternative available. The Fid per share is 9p. The 1993 interim dividend was 13.5p, but RTZ said this was not comparable because of the way it structured last year's dividends. RTZ shares closed 13p higher at 885p.

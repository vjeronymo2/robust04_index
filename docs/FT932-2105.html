			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Japan must act to cut trade surplus says Bank governor JAPAN should deregulate its economy to open its markets and make its trading practices more transparent in response to US pressure for a cut in its trade surplus, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor, said at the weekend. Mr Mieno, in an interview with the FT, said no more could be done at the moment to stimulate the Japanese economy and boost demand for imports. He warned that any attempt to reduce the surplus rapidly with expansionary macro-economic policies would lead to higher inflation in Japan which would damage world growth prospects. As a result, Japan had to respond with structural reforms to match measures taken by its trading partners to reduce the trade surplus, which is expected to reach Dollars 150bn this year. Mr Mieno's comments come at a critical time, with the Japanese political system in turmoil and a general election due on July 18, following the government's defeat in a no-confidence vote on Friday. Talks with the US over a framework to discuss trade tensions are reaching a critical point with the outline of an approach covering macro-economic policies and structural measures due to be agreed by a summit between President Bill Clinton and the Japanese prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, on July 5. The US alleges imports into Japan are restricted by closed business practices which discriminate against foreign companies. Mr Mieno said the Japanese economy would start a moderate recovery in the autumn but he warned that even sustainable growth in Japan would leave a large trade surplus. He said: 'We should not reduce the trade surplus because the US says so but out of responsibility for the world economy and to promote the global liberal trading system.' Mr Mieno continued: 'We should, first, keep our economy on a non-inflationary stable growth path and, second, deregulate and reconsider our trading practices.' He said Japan had done as much as it could to promote growth with pump-priming measures and low interest rates. As a result other action would be needed to respond to international criticism of the surplus. Mr Mieno said the important point was to heighten the transparency of 'our market and our economic system.' Disciplinarian with a vision, Page 16</p>

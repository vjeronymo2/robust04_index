			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / UK Company News: British Alcan's losses plunge to nearly Pounds 46m ANOTHER 1,200 jobs were lost at British Alcan Aluminium last year as the worst aluminium industry conditions in living memory plunged the group into a Pounds 45.6m pre-tax loss. This was after an exceptional charge of Pounds 29.6m for reorganisation and plant closures and compared with a deficit of Pounds 12.3m for 1990, including a Pounds 10m exceptional charge. Mr Douglas Ritchie, chairman, said: 'There are some signs that the UK recession may have bottomed out but none of these amounts to a return to the growth conditions experienced in earlier years.' He pointed out that British Alcan had generated a positive cash flow for three quarters of 1992 and that it ended last year with debt only 36 per cent of equity, which was 'acceptable for this stage of the business cycle.' British Alcan is wholly owned by Alcan of Canada and there were clear indications that the UK company both benefited and suffered at the hands of Alcan's international strategy last year. As aluminium prices fell to their lowest-ever level in real terms, partly because of the recession and partly because of a sudden flood of imports from the former Soviet Union, Alcan cut its world-wide primary aluminium production by 8.5 per cent. The brunt was borne in the UK where one of two 66,000 tonnes a year potlines was shut down at British Alcan's Lynemouth smelter and output at the Lochaber smelter in Scotland was cut by 10 per cent. However, Alcan also brought into operation Europe's first dedicated aluminium can recycling plant at a total cost of Pounds 28m at Warrington. Mr Ritchie said this was performing above budget. He said the recession quickened the pace of change made in line with the group's long-term investment and development strategy and led to redundancies elsewhere in the group. British Alcan withdrew from production of aircraft sheet at Falkirk which it said was 'labour intensive and environmentally unsatisfactory,' and closed Pentagon Radiator because it showed no sign of returning to profitability. The group also consolidated its mainstream aerospace operations and put all its commercial extrusion and tube operations into one business. Sales last year were down 11 per cent at Pounds 730.8m, with falling volumes in the UK partly offset by rising export tonnage, particularly to the rest of the European Community. There was a tax credit of Pounds 3.5m against a Pounds 2.4m charge, giving a net loss of Pounds 42.1m (Pounds 14.7m).</p>

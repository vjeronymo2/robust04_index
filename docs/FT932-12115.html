			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Survey of Baden-Wuerttemberg (5): Streets where time moves slowly - Ulm STANDING on the main square of Ulm, Mr Ivo Gonner, the mayor, points to the medieval clock on the town hall with its revolving statuettes and 12 mechanical dials, writes ARIANE GENILLARD. 'This is the most complex clock ever made in medieval Europe,' he boasts, unwittingly echoing the claims one also hears in old Prague about a venerable timepiece in the Czech capital. Ulm is a small medieval town on the Danube 100 km south of Stuttgart. Besides the clock, it also claims the highest church spire in Europe. And on the hill, it has built the largest modern science park in Baden-Wurttemberg. Like Baden-Wurttemberg as a whole, it offers a spicy blend of history and technological progress. It is the birth place of Albert Einstein, (though, as a victim of Hitler's racism he spent most of his life far from his native land). Now the city is wallowing in the recession felt in most of Germany. It once housed subsidiaries of large industrial companies such as Volkswagen, AEG and Iveco. But job cuts and relocations have caused unemployment, now standing at 6 per cent and rising. Admittedly, Ulm earns money from tourists, attracted to its ancient twisting streets. But Mr Gonner, a former lawyer who became mayor two years ago, worries about the future. He hopes that the new science park on the edge of the town will generate new jobs. 'But it is a little like a fantasy,' he admits.</p>

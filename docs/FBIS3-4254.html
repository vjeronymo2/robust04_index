This sharp contrast has given rise to speculation that China  may well fail to sustain its economic momentum in the long run.    But a senior Chinese economist believes a quick fix is at  hand.    "And, it's no surprise to see enterprises deep in trouble as  our economy is in a transition from a planned to a market one,"  said Li Wuwei, a professor at the Shanghai Academy of Social  Sciences.    The nation's gross domestic product (GDP) has maintained  double- digit expansion in about three consecutive years.  Meantime, State enterprises have watched their profits slide.    About one-third of State industrial enterprises are running  in the red, siphoning off 50 billion yuan ($5.75 billion) in  subsidies from the government each year.    How so?    "The profits of State industries have been squeezed by  higher  production costs resulting from soaring prices of raw  materials," Li explained.    Take Shanghai, for example. The city's State enterprises  spent an extra 8 billion yuan ($920 million) in the late 1980s  to offset higher prices for raw materials.    But these enterprises recouped only 7 billion yuan ($800  million) even after raising prices for their own products.    Thus they faced a deficit of 1 billion yuan ($115 million).  At the same time, though, the raw material sector profited by  the same amount.    Li says that 15 to 20 percent of the revenue of the city's  State industrial enterprises went into the hands of the raw  material and transportation sectors, which had raised their  prices by a huge margin.    Still another 30 per cent of revenue was absorbed by the  service sector, including banks, insurance companies and  advertisement agencies.    Incomplete statistics show that the service trade made up 38  percent of the city's GDP last year, compared with only 25  percent 10 years before.    Higher wages have also reduced the profit margins of State  enterprises.    Despite the price increases for raw materials, State  enterprises in many cases cannot raise the prices of their  products freely.    For instance, the prices of oil products cannot be raised  even though a big increase in crude oil prices is due in a few  months.    State industries had their heyday in the 1950s and 1960s,  when the prices of raw materials were kept artificially low by  rigid central planning. The service trade was almost  nonexistent.    But at the same time the enterprises, unlike those in  Western  countries, were responsible for the welfare of their employees.    This was once deemed the superiority of socialism.    "A shrinking profit margin due to the booming raw material  and service sectors is not the real threat to State industrial  enterprises because the latter can adjust their products' prices  over time," Li said.    "The real way out now is to relieve the enterprises of the  extra burden by setting up a sound social insurance system.</p>

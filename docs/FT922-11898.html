			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Downturn at GT Management GT MANAGEMENT, the investment management group which is owned by the Bank in Liechtenstein, saw pre-tax profits fall by 7 per cent in 1991 despite strong growth in its US mutual fund business. Funds under management rose from Pounds 5.3bn to Pounds 6.6bn, but commission and fee income rose only 4 per cent to Pounds 67.3m (Pounds 64.7m). That reflected a reduction in initial commission income (the charge made when funds are purchased by retail investors) from the high levels achieved in 1990. In addition, the 1990 profit figure of Pounds 20.9m included an exceptional item of Pounds 2.9m. If that item was excluded, the 1991 pre-tax figure of Pounds 19.4m actually represented a 7 per cent rise. The US mutual funds business, based in San Francisco, saw funds under management rise 31 per cent to nearly Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn). US retail funds now represent a third of assets under GT's management. Mr Peter Stevens, chief executive, also said that the UK pension fund business grew by 25 per cent last year. GT has set up an operation in Dublin, where it intends to concentrate the administration of its offshore funds, which are currently domiciled in a wide range of locations - including the Cayman Islands and the Netherlands Antilles.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a recent announcement of the  Government Office, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has expressed his  views on the disciplinary measures against the director general  of the Saigon Beer Company as follows:    While considering the degree of administrative measures and  party disciplinary action against Comrade Hoang Chi Quy, one  must take into full account the strong points and efforts of  cadres and office and manual workers of the Saigon Beer Company  to overcome difficulties. By upholding the spirit of  self-reliance, everyone has stepped up production, enhanced the  condition of production lines, expanded facilities, improved  product quality and design, and combined production with  marketing. As a result, the Saigon Beer Company has become one  of those state business establishments that have made  substantial contributions to the state budget over the past  years. Comrade Hoang Chi Quy has positively contributed to the  overall achievements of the company.    The shortcomings mentioned by the inspection team are  related  to management. Comrade Hoang Chi Quy and the Saigon Beer  Company must be fully aware of those shortcomings and must take  serious measures to rectify them. The Ministry of Light  Industry must draw practical lessons from this incident to  better direct the production and business operations of other  units under its charge.    For the Saigon Beer Company to stabilize production and  business operations at an early date, the prime minister of the  Government has instructed the Ministry of Light Industry to use  its cadre management power to determine the degree of  administrative measures against Comrade Hoang Chi Quy and to  bear responsibility before the Government for this action.    The party Central Committee Organ of Control is hereby  requested to determine the degree of party disciplinary action  to be taken against Comrade Hoang Chi Quy based on the party  statutes and the views of the Ho Chi Minh City party committee  standing body, the party affairs committee of the party  organization of the Ministry of Light Industry, and the party  installation of the Saigon Beer Company.    Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet has requested the Ministry of  Culture and Information in its capacity as a state organ in  charge of press control to coordinate with the party Central  Committee Ideology and Culture Department and Ho Chi Minh City  in reviewing and drawing experiences from reports and articles  relating to this incident, take action against cases of  violations against the press code, and keep the prime minister  of the government informed of investigation results.</p>

			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRINGING CHAOS OUT OF CHAOS;  </P> <P> THE ECONOMICS OF CHAOS ON REVITALIZING THE AMERICAN ECONOMY BY ELIOT JANEWAY  (TRUMAN TALLEY BOOKS/ E.P. DUTTON: $22.50; 352 PP.)  </P> <P> What iconoclastic gadfly Eliot Janeway means by the economics of chaos is  Reagonomics, and he offers a whirlwind of prescriptions to cast out the ills  that he perceives. Some of them seem simplistic and many are likely to raise  hackles among more orthodox economists, regardless of their ideological  persuasion. For the lay reader, the book offers a stomach-churning  roller-coaster ride of highs and lows, twists and turns and loop-the-loops that  may have him hanging on for dear life.  </P> <P> Janeway postulates that the problems of the economy are due to a parallelogram  of eight forces and that "they invite solutions in pairs": hence the four-sided  figure. This comprises 1) agricultural exports and oil imports; 2) the budget  deficit and the trade deficit; 3) Social Security and the growth of the  underground economy that results from regressive taxation; 4) defense and  social programs.  </P> <P> The trade deficit, Janeway asserts, is the product of lagging agricultural  exports and excessive oil imports. More direct intervention than the  devaluation of the dollar, which has failed to produce anticipated results, is  needed. We should pay for oil not in dollars, but with farm exports; in other  words, resort to barter. To stimulate domestic oil production, we should put a  quota of 50% of the U.S. market on oil imports, paying $18 a barrel to domestic  producers and $5 to foreign. Janeway cites U.S. sugar quotas as precedent but  fails to mention the devastating effect that these have had on the economies of  such nations as the Philippines or their inflationary impact in the United  States. As for what oil-producing nations would do with the mountains of U.S.  food that they would have no use for, Janeway suggests that they could dispose  of them, in more or less philanthropic fashion, in populous Muslim countries.  </P> <P> By paying for fuel imports with agricultural commodities, the farm sector would  be stimulated and federal subsidies reduced. Increased oil production would  revitalize the Southwest and tax revenues would be enhanced. Both the trade and  budget deficits -- another pair cemented together as a facet of the  parallelogram -- would be reduced.  </P> <P> An additional benefit, he conceives, would be "encouraging more people to buy  more cars and trucks, and to use them more, especially for longer-distance  commuting. . . ."  </P> <P> But no mention of what this would do to air pollution, the additional strain  that would be put on the deteriorating highway system, or the probability that  a portion of those burgeoning cars and trucks would be imported and thereby  exacerbate the deficit.  </P> <P> Throughout, Janeway is long on sweeping proposals but short on details of  administration or practical implementation. Free trade is moribund, he posits,  and we should reemphasize reciprocity -- unrestricted imports of any product  would be limited to 25% of the U.S. market. It is a nationalist-Populist  approach, stressing what is good for America, but giving short shrift to the  effect on other economies; and it is hardly likely to be swallowed without some  serious regurgitation by foreign nations. Even if it did not precipitate, as  would be likely, a trade war, it might well produce a trade lock that would be  just as bad.  </P> <P> Janeway's position is that the U.S. market is too important and the U.S.  economy and financial clout are too great for us to concern ourselves with the  possibility of retaliation -- a confidence that seems misplaced in the age of  an integrated European community that is more than a match for the United  States. Indeed, he sees the Soviet Union as a virtual client state of the  United States, as well as hostage to Western Europe's "grid of nuclear power  plants. Any shoot-out over Western Europe would scorch Russia from the skies  with a giant-size Chernobyl reaction more deadly and more difficult to defend  against than any launched by Genghis Khan, Napoleon, or Hitler on land." It is  an odd view that a major deterrent to a nuclear holocaust would be the effect  on the Soviet Union of radiation released by devastated commercial nuclear  plants in other nations; but this is an odd kind of book. It fades in on  Alexander Hamilton and focuses on Thorstein Veblen, the turn-of-the-century  prophet who predicted the effect of the technological revolution on society and  economy. It surveys a progression of economic theorists and so proffers a  panorama of political economic history.  </P> <P> But, repeatedly, Janeway takes the reader on detours that bewilder more than  they enlighten. Not only do we get Albert Einstein, we are offered  disquisitions on Dmitry Mendeleyev (the deviser of the periodic table),  Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (who suggested "twin screw propellers rotating in  opposite directions"), and Ernst Mach (an Austro-Hungarian physicist and  ballistics expert who has given his name to the terminology of supersonic  speeds). In such roundabout fashion, Janeway eventually concludes: "Both the  manufacturing and the services sectors of the American economy travel on  wings." Economic revitalization, he says, "is bound to start with the  aeronautical segment of her political economy. . . . Fear of flying is fatal to  the economy, and so is failure to organize aeronautics. . . . The need to land,  on Earth and in space, will outpace the growth of landing fields." Ergo, we  should have fewer airports and more VTOL -- vertical takeoff and landing --  aircraft.  </P> <P> By such digressions, Janeway detracts from the overview of the American economy  and its future direction that he intends to present. But then, perhaps, the  corollary to "The Economics of Chaos" has long been the chaos of economics.  </P></p>

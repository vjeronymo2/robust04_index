			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: Losses at Saab Automobile deepen LOSSES at Sweden's Saab Automobile deepened to SKr2.69bn (Dollars 343m) last year as the car maker was hit by worsening market conditions worldwide and heavy restructuring costs. The worse-than-expected result is 20 per cent down on the 1991 deficit of SKr2.24bn and follows a doubling of losses in the final three months of the year when conditions in the car industry deteriorated sharply. The group also took a one-off restructuring charge in the final quarter following its decision to cut 2,000 jobs, more than 20 per cent of its workforce, as part of a new rationalisation programme. It declined to specify the size of the charge yesterday. Saab, jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, is predicting a 'substantial improvement' in its 1993 figures but it still expects to remain in the red. This would be its fifth consecutive year of losses. Revenues fell to SKr14.7bn from SKr15bn, as car sales slid to 86,800 from 87,500 in 1991. The group's three main markets, Sweden, the US and the UK, were all depressed although there were upturns in areas including Italy, Belgium, Spain, Australia and Hong Kong. In 1993, the group is hoping for a better result in both the US and UK, although it expects the Swedish market to remain difficult and other markets like Germany to be tough. It believes its overall result will also be helped by its rationalisation programme, which aims to cut costs by SKr2bn; the devaluation of the Swedish krona, and the launch of a new car model. Details of the new car have been kept under close wraps, although there is no doubt that a success is needed to ensure the group's revival. The model replacement for the 900 series- will be unveiled at the Frankfurt motor show in September before going on sale in the autumn. Partly because of the disruption which introduction of the new model will cause, and partly because of a less intensive marketing drive, the company is forecasting car sales of only 80,000 this year. The group's new chief executive, Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, has already stated he would like to see the group's break-even production level reduced to 70,000 units. Last month, Saab's owners each promised to inject SKr1.4bn in new capital during 1993 to help the group return to profit. They have already ploughed in SKr5.5bn since mid-1991.</p>

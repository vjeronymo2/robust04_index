			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Bank operations tight UK INTERBANK operations were tight ahead of a record sized government bond auction today, writes Peter John. The Bank of England forecast a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 550m in the money market, later revised to Pounds 650m. The shortage was smaller than many in recent days, with the result that the Bank of England did not offer early assistance. However, there was an unwillingness among market participants to accept Bank help at a second round at midday, when only Pounds 3m of bills were purchased. A further Pounds 219m of band one bank bills were bought in the afternoon, with discount houses principally meeting the liquidity shortage. After the official close the Bank gave late help of Pounds 190m, bringing the day's total to Pounds 412m. Also, short sterling moved within a very narrow range in spite of a gloomy economic survey which might have given further impetus for a UK interest rate cut. The latest Confederation of British Industry quarterly industrial trends survey showed that UK manufact-urers' orders and output were flat and export orders lower. One dealer said: 'You can make a very good case for a one-point cut now and short sterling is still only discounting a half-point reduction. I think the market is overbought and people are holding back ahead of today's gilts auction.' The short sterling futures contract for December was up at 94.65 in early trading but slipped back to close two basis points weaker on balance at 94.59. German and French short-term interest rate futures held steady ahead of today's securities repurchase by the Bundesbank. German call money was quoted at around 6.5 per cent, little changed from Monday's level, and dealers said the market was well offered. The German Euromark contract for December was slightly easier at 93.88 by the close and the French December contract finished unchanged at 93.73. Market opinion was split as to the likely level of the repo funds allocated, but the amount is expected to be similar to last week's DM74.1bn and most dealers said the award would have no significant impact on short interest rates. Call money was seen holding above the repo rate of 6.40 per cent this week.</p>

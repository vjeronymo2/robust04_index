			<p><P> September 15, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> WE'RE WELL-TANNED BUT TRASHY  </P> <P> Wouldn't it be good if everyone who enjoyed the recreational benefits of the  ocean gave something back, the way a group of divers in South Laguna did last  weekend?  </P> <P> A lot of people volunteer their time for worthy causes, but it would be nice to  have more follow the example of 40 divers who regularly enjoy the beauty of  golden fish and kelp forests off the Orange County coast. They put their dreams  of underwater explorations aside for a day to explore the junk left by careless  people along the waterfront, most of it on the beaches.  </P> <P> Their booty of beer cans and plastic bags provided ample proof that the acronym  they selected -- SLOBB -- was aptly chosen. It stands for, Stop Littering Our  Beaches and Bays, which is good advice for all of us to follow.  </P> <P> The custodial feeling that people have for the waterfront ought to be  encouraged, so that those who benefit from the ocean give something back. On  both Pacific and Atlantic coasts in recent years, dedicated groups such as the  divers in Laguna have been showing the way. As more people enjoy the water,  there is more and more of a threat posed to the delicate marine environment.  </P> <P> And if we can't participate in an organized cleanup, at least we can pick up  after ourselves. You didn't have to look hard to find cigarette butts, paper  cups and other litter on Orange County beaches this summer.  </P> <P> Much is said about the larger threats to the ocean environment, especially  dramatic oil spills. But the day-in, day-out pollution from littering takes a  toll on the marine environment, even despite the ocean's capacity for  regeneration.  </P> <P> Cans, balloons and trash pose a hazard to marine animals. Birds can choke on  plastic soda can rings disposed of haphazardly along the waterfront. It doesn't  take a major environmental disaster to alter the marine environment.  </P> <P> Those who brought out rakes and shovels and bags to clean up the environment  last weekend in South Laguna have shown the way.  </P></p>

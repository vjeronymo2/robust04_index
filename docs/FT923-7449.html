			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Buoyant Wesfarmers advances 77% WESFARMERS, the diversified West Australian agricultural group, lifted earnings and dividends strongly in the year to June 30 on the back of acquisitions, higher sales and falling costs. The company posted a 77 per cent net profit rise from ADollars 35.8m (USDollars 25.8m) to ADollars 63.1m in the period. Operating revenues rose by 35 per cent from ADollars 953m to ADollars 1.8bn for the same period. The annual dividend has been boosted from 14.5 cents to 26 cents a share, lifting the payout from ADollars 26.7m to ADollars 48.5m. The company benefited from the consolidation of Bunnings, the timber group. It increased its stake in Bunnings from 24.5 per cent to 45 per cent and included an ADollars 11.3m pre-tax earnings contribution from the timber company in its latest results. The coal business was the biggest pre-tax earnings contributor, with ADollars 62.6m, followed by fertilisers and chemicals with ADollars 48.6m. The company's interest bill eased from ADollars 35.8m to ADollars 32.6m. The result also benefited from a big reduction in abnormal losses which dropped from ADollars 24.1m to ADollars 722,000.</p>

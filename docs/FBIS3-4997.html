In its schedule that was turned in late last month, the  United States offered to cut overall duties on certain items  rather than abolishing them as promised in the Uruguay Round  negotiations, Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Kim Chol-su  said Thursday.    Seoul has acquired a copy of the U.S. schedule and will  finish analyzing it in a day or two, he said.    If certain revisions are deemed to affect Korean exports  adversely, Seoul will act accordingly, the trade minister said,  strongly hinting at changes in Korea's commitment to the UR pact.    Korea may eliminate some items on which it had offered to  abolish duties and hand in the revised version, or consult with  the European Union, Japan and other countries before submitting  its amended list, he said.    Assistant Trade, Industry and Energy Minister Chang Suk-hwan  pointed out that the United States made fewer tariff concessions  than planned because Japan decided not to scrap tariffs on wood,  leather and non-ferrous products.    Therefore, he said, Washington and Tokyo may strike a deal  before April, when the UR accord concluded in December is due to  be signed and sealed.    Korea will also wait and see how other countries respond to  the U.S. schedule before making a decision, Chang said.    The negotiations on the non-tariffication provision are just  a small part of the UR tariffication sector and the agreement on  under-33-percent tariff cuts on industrial goods is effective,  he explained.    Although there may be slight friction over the zero-tariff  efforts, it is unlikely to impede the signing of the UR  agreement on April 5, he said.    He said the U.S. revisions are not all harmful to Korean  exports, adding that for some items they may even be  advantageous.</p>

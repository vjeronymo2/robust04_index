			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: JAZZ PIANIST HANK JONES IS A MAN WITH A  NOTABLE PAST  </P> <P> Pianist Hank Jones has a resume that reads like a jazz Hall of Fame. How many  musicians can tell first-hand stories about Charlie Parker, Coleman Hawkins and  Lester Young?  </P> <P> Jones, the eldest brother from a musical family which also produced drummer  Elvin and big band trumpeter Thad, opened two weeks at Elario's on Wednesday  night, backed by San Diegans Bob Magnusson on bass and Jim Plank on drums.  </P> <P> Known as a sensitive accompanist and superb improviser with a controlled,  melodic style, Jones remains vital at 71.  </P> <P> He recently recorded an album under the Great Jazz Trio name he founded in the  early '80s with bassist Ron Carter and drummer Tony Williams. This time around,  Jones worked with Danish bassist Mads Winding and drummer Billy Hart. In  February, he participated in the tribute to Ella Fitzgerald at Avery Fisher  Hall in New York, along with a Who's Who of jazz. He plays often in such top  New York clubs as Fat Tuesday's, Indigo Blue and the Village Vanguard.  </P> <P> You'd expect to hear tales of bruised egos about growing up in Pontiac, Mich.,  in a family of such formidable talents, but Jones said there were no conflicts.  </P> <P> "There was no competition. We were all in the same family. I was the only one  interested in piano. Thad was always interested in trumpet, and Elvin  interested in drums. I had the piano to myself. We didn't play together a lot  growing up. I was ahead of them, and I left home six or seven years before they  did."  </P> <P> Jones said he doesn't see any contemporary jazz artists equal to the geniuses  he worked with during the '40s and '50s.  </P> <P> "Certainly, it was a once in a lifetime type of thing. Hawkins, Young, Parker  -- how often do you have this kind of genius in a century? I don't know anyone  today who can compare. They were distinctive because they had a distinctive  style."  </P> <P> Hawkins was "proficient in any key, he had marvelous jazz instincts," Jones  recalled. Young had a distinctive tone and a weird way of holding his horn --  horizontally, like a flute.  </P> <P> As for Parker, he more than challenged his fellow players with his lightning  be-bop lines.  </P> <P> "Challenge is a mild term," Jones said. "He had a marvelous ability to play  very fast and execute flawlessly. His tone was superb. Most people who play  fast suffer in tone. His tone on alto was one of main things you noticed. He  had the ability to play both rapid tempos and beautiful ballads."  </P> <P> Jones was looking forward to his stay in San Diego. He hasn't been here since  the late '40s.  </P> <P> San Diego guitarist Hank Easton's nine-song CD will be in local music stores,  including Tower Records, within the next week. Easton hopes the recording will  land him a distribution deal. Positive responses are already coming. The Wave,  the national Chicago-based radio network, wants to put his song "San Diego  Sunset" into rotation, but Easton wants to wait until his album is more widely  available.  </P> <P> At 26, he is one of San Diego's most promising guitarists. Technically, he's  got all the tools. In his work, you can hear snippets of those he considers his  mentors: George Benson, Carlos Santana, Jeff Beck, Robben Ford, Larry Carlton,  Stanley Jordan, Jim Hendrix.  </P> <P> In "The Kitchen Sink," the one blues tune on the CD, Easton departs from his  penchant for technical fireworks to show that less can be more.  </P> <P> All of the songs were written by Easton and reveal a promising FM radio  riffmaster at work. Easton has opened for Michael Brecker, Acoustic Alchemy,  Kirk Whalum and Lee Ritenour, and it wouldn't come as a surprise if he  eventually enjoys the same kind of success.  </P> <P> This Sunday, Easton plays the Mission Bay Hilton Hotel's Sunday brunch from  10:30 to 1. On March 23, 24, 30 and 31, he'll be at the Del Mar Hilton from 9  p.m. to 1 a.m. On April 7, his Easton West Band will be one of four rising  young bands showcased at the Bacchanal.  </P> <P> RIFFS: Baritone sax master Nick Brignola drew a less-than-capacity crowd to  last weekend's concert at the San Diego Convention Center. Roughly half of 400  seats were taken. Some fans who called Ticketmaster were mistakenly told that  the concert was sold out. Friday and Sunday nights, Brignola sat in with  buddies Dave McKenna and Scott Hamilton at Elario's. . . .  </P> <P> San Diegans Bob Magnusson (bass) and Randy Porter (piano) joined former San  Diegan John Guerin on drums to back up jazz singer Diane Schuur in Los Angeles  last weekend. Porter, 27, plans to release a self-produced CD of mostly  original music in about a month. Porter, Magnusson and San Diego drummer Jim  Plank will back jazz trumpet legend Art Farmer at Elario's for two weeks  beginning March 28. . . .  </P> <P> Some local light jazz stalwarts are also versed in straight-ahead jazz. At the  Mission Bay Hilton's 4-month-old Tuesday night jazz jams, hosted by  percussionist and vocalist Mike Kelleher of Reel to Real, top local musicians  play a mix of light jazz and straight-ahead standards. Hank Easton, guitarist  Kiko Cibrian, bass man Charlie Chadwick and sax man Mark Lessman have been  among the more than 100 locals who have jammed so far. Lessman's band plays the  Catamaran's "Jazz Trax Nite" next Wednesday. The next of the monthly "Lites Out  Desert Weekends" at La Casa Del Zorro in Borrego Springs is April 27 to 29. For  the price of accommodations, guests will enjoy performances by Hollis Gentry  and Most Valuable Players, including a Friday night jam session. Visitors  frequently join the musicians for a game of basketball. This Sunday's special  guest on "Jazz Trax" is saxophonist Sam Riney, whose newest album has been  running a close second to Kenny G.'s on the national "contemporary jazz"  charts. . . .  </P> <P> Cibrian and other member of Gentry's band Neon have left to form their own  group called True Stories.  </P></p>

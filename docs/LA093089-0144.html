			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DANA HILLS WINS DESPITE SLOW NIGHT OFFENSIVELY  </P> <P> Dana Hills High School Coach Don Douglass had his defense -- and a  controversial call -- to thank after a 9-7 victory over Santa Ana Valley Friday  at Dana Hills.  </P> <P> Douglass praised his defense after the game, which put Dana Hills record at  4-0, the best start of the coach's eight years at the school.  </P> <P> "Offensively, we didn't do a thing; we were fortunate to win," Douglass said.  "But defensively, we played great."  </P> <P> Dana Hills managed just one scoring drive all night, going 79 yards in 12 plays  on a march that wound up with a nine-yard touchdown pass from senior  quarterback Grant Taylor to senior tight end Andy Marrone with 4:27 left in the  third quarter.  </P> <P> That, along with Ryan Harrison's 28-yard field goal in the second, accounted  for all of Dana Hills scoring.  </P> <P> The touchdown drive began on a controversial play. Santa Ana Valley punter  Jesse Brooks had punted from his own 28 to the Dolphin 1-foot line, but Santa  Ana Valley was called for a personal foul for batting the ball out of bounds,  and the ball was re-kicked.  </P> <P> This time Dana Hills took over on its 21-yard line, where it started its  winning drive.  </P> <P> "Calls are calls; every once in a while you get a key call that can change a  game," Santa Ana Valley Coach Dan Castanon said. "This one made a big  difference."  </P> <P> Santa Ana Valley (1-2-1) scored first when defensive back Rome Manson  intercepted Grant Taylor's second pass of the night and returned it 60 yards  for a touchdown with 4:04 left in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Dana Hills was led by Matt Carvalho, who had 101 yards on 26 carries.

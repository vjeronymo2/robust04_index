			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / De Beers accuses Russia of Dollars 500m gem 'leak' De Beers has accused Russia of 'leaking' up to Dollars 500m (Pounds 322.5m) worth of uncut diamonds on to the world market, seriously violating the agreement between the South African group's Central Selling Organisation and the Russian producers. The company believes the contract, vital to maintaining control of rough diamond prices, may not be renewable after the end of next year, when it expires. Talks in Moscow this week between De Beers executives and the Russian Committee on Precious Metals, together with Mr Anatoly Golovaty, the deputy finance minister, on the huge level of unofficial sales brought the two sides no closer together. The company's executives remain pessimistic about future co-operation. Russia is the second-largest diamond producer after De Beers' own production in Botswana and South Africa. Its defection from the De Beers-controlled cartel would be likely to set off a price war that could send prices tumbling. The CSO sold a record Dollars 2.6bn of diamonds in the first half of 1994. De Beers has limited scope for reasserting order in the market, in spite of its traditional domination of diamond sales. If it refuses to renew the agreement, it will be faced with a large producer capable of launching a sustained attack on its prices. If it renews the contract, it may have to accept a level of indiscipline that might also threaten price levels. It would also send the wrong message to other cartel members such as Zaire, Australia, Namibia and Angola. The belief in Russia that producers could achieve a higher return outside the cartel has been strengthened by the retirement of a generation of officials used to working with De Beers in the cartel system - and the rise of nationalist politicians hostile to the agreement on political and economic grounds. Mr Leonid Gurevich, formerly head of a parliamentary committee on gold and precious metals and now vice-president in charge of diamonds at the State Precious Metals Committee, believes the agreement with De Beers is too restrictive and should be renewed only if it allows much more scope for free sales. De Beers executives, who have held a series of talks with the Russians this year, presented evidence that the unofficial sales had lowered prices worldwide - or at best kept them at last year's levels when increased consumer demand would normally have caused an increase. According to De Beers, the Russian officials accepted that there was substantial unofficial selling and that prices were depressed, adding that these sales were causing concern to the Russian authorities, which were investigating how to stop them.</p>

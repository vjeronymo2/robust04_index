			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Delors to attend summit despite illness MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, is on extended leave after suffering an attack of sciatica, but he is still expected to attend next Monday's EC summit in Copenhagen. Mr Delors cancelled a pre-summit news conference scheduled for today in Brussels, his fourth day off work. But aides quashed rumours that he might be too sick to deliver a presentation on Europe's unemployment crisis in Copenhagen. Mr Bruno de Thomas, his chief spokesman, said he could not imagine Mr Delors missing the summit: 'The president continues to work at home.' Mr Delors' views on why the EC has failed to create jobs at the same rate as the US and Asia is expected to be one of the highlights of the summit. Diplomats are watching to see if Mr Delors is ready to countenance some reduction in Europe's generous social provisions in order to improve European competitiveness. Aides said this week that Mr Delors would take an honest approach, offering analysis rather than prescriptions. 'He will not ask whether the EC can continue to afford the welfare state, rather how we can maintain it under the present conditions of low economic growth,' said one Commission official.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Election brings hope of change for Guatemala THE ELECTION this month of Mr Ramiro de Leon Carpio as Guatemala's president has raised hopes of a lasting change in the practice of politics in a country plagued by corruption and decades of political violence. Mr de Leon, 51, was brought to power on June 6 by a coalition of unlikely bedfellows: conservative businessmen, political parties and leftist groups. Together they forced the Guatemalan military to support a return to constitutional rule, after the ousting of President Jorge Serrano, who had seized authoritarian powers, and to reject Mr Serrano's vice-president as his successor. While some observers have seen the victory of civil society as an example of Guatemala's growing political maturity, the coalition may prove to be nothing more than an ad hoc alliance of self-interest that is unlikely to hang together. The business community was well aware of the lost aid, the removal of US trade benefits and the probable difficulties with Guatemala's loan programmes with the Washington-based international financial institutions that would have ensued if Mr Serrano had stayed in power. But, with high popular expectations and suspicious armed forces, and without a political party behind him, Mr de Leon, a former human rights ombudsman, faces enormous obstacles. Until his election, he was a fierce and uncompromising critic of the armed forces, which have one of the worst human rights records in the western hemisphere. Now as commander-in-chief, he has quickly changed tack. He sacked General Jose Domingo Garca Samayoa, the defence minister who initially supported Mr Serrano's coup, but replaced him with another hardliner, General Roberto Perussina. The powerful army was weakened by the two weeks of political turmoil in which it backed Mr Serrano and was unable to prevent Mr de Leon's election, but it still demands respect. Nevertheless, finding a modus operandi with his old adversaries in the military, while meeting the expectations of national and international opinion, will be a central preoccupation for his presidency. 'He is in a difficult position. But what he does have is immense moral authority,' said a European diplomat. Mr de Leon will need more than this to implement policy and it remains unclear how he will be able to operate with the Congress that elected him. The political parties had pledged to purge themselves of corrupt congressman, but there is little evidence that they have done so. 'He runs the risk of being overwhelmed by the mafias in Congress which he needs to approve legislation and make reforms,' says Mr Gabriel Aguilera, a political analyst. In a televised address last Sunday, Mr de Leon said his priorities would be to fight corruption and combat poverty. 'In 2 1/2 years we will not be able to solve all of the country's problems but we will be able to solve some of the most urgent ones.' Guatemalans will be looking for swift improvements. Eight out of 10 live in poverty, and only four in 10 have access to electricity. 'If he does not fulfil our needs, we will all be out on the streets.' says Mr Byron Morales, a union leader. As an opposition leader, Mr de Leon was frequently critical of increases in the price of basic services, and the strictures of the government's standby agreement with the IMF. But he will need the support of the international financial institutions to restore confidence after recent instability. Mr de Leon has so far been slow to put together a cabinet and vague about what he proposes to do. But he is still riding a wave of popularity not seen since the election of Mr Vinicio Cerezo Arevalo as president in 1986. However, by the time Mr Cerezo left office his presidency was in disarray. While few doubt Mr de Leon's integrity, he has his work cut out if he wishes to be remembered as more than just another disappointment.</p>

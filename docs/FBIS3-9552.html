He added that he still believed that since the new state  emerged it had been out of place to develop the idea of a joint  entity, he added.    The idea was presented by Chairman of the Czech Social  Democratic Party Milos Zeman at a seminar organized by the  Slovak Social Democratic Party last year, Moravcik reported. He  dismissed the rumors that he met Zeman during his Monday's [21  March] visit to Prague.    "I think that the European Union is our future," said  Moravcik, adding that closer co-existence of the two countries  will be possible within a wider framework.    "None of the Slovak and Czech political parties represented  in the government are really contemplating the union," stressed  Moravcik. "These are reminiscences, revived from time to time,  but without any real substance," he added.    Zeman allegedly reiterated the issue during his recent  meeting with a "part" of the Slovak Democratic Left Party (SDL).  SDL chairman Peter Weiss did not deny the offer was tendered,  but stated that the SDL was respecting the situation emerged  after the split of the common state.</p>

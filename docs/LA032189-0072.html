			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEPPERDINE GOES AFTER SWEEP OF NEW MEXICO IN NIT TONIGHT  </P> <P> Pepperdine's basketball team hopes that its tour of the National Invitation  Tournament doesn't end where it began, in New Mexico.  </P> <P> The Waves started NIT play last week with an 84-69 first-round victory over New  Mexico State in Las Cruces.  </P> <P> Tonight at 6:30, PST, Pepperdine (20-12) will play the University of New Mexico  (21-10) in a second-round game here at University Arena, nicknamed the Pit. The  Lobos are coming off a 91-76, first-round victory at home over Santa Clara.  </P> <P> The winner will advance to the quarterfinals, which will be played Wednesday  through Friday at campus sites. The semifinals will be March 27 and the final,  March 29, at Madison Square Garden in New York.  </P> <P> Last year, the Lobos ended Pepperdine's NIT bid in the first round with an  86-75 victory here. New Mexico forward Charlie Thomas, now a senior, finished  with 20 points in that game and helped spark a comeback with 14 second-half  points, including two slam dunks.  </P> <P> The 6-foot 7-inch Thomas leads his team this season with averages of 17 points  and eight rebounds a game. Sophomore guard Rob Robbins is averaging 16 points,  and 7-2 center Luc Longley of Australia is averaging 12.6 points and 6.4  rebounds.  </P> <P> This is New Mexico's sixth consecutive NIT appearance, and its fans have been  upset because the Lobos, despite good records, have been rejected in the 1980s  by the National Collegiate Athletic Assn.'s tournament committee.  </P> <P> Said Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury: "We played our best game of the season last  Thursday night at New Mexico State.  </P> <P> "We showed tremendous patience and poise on the offensive end, and that  resulted in high-percentage shots. Our team defense was excellent, and we were  extremely active on the boards."  </P> <P> Against the Aggies, Dexter Howard and Craig Davis led the Waves in scoring,  each with 16 points, and Casey Crawford added 13 points and a team-high nine  rebounds.  </P> <P> Asbury said that the Lobos have "tremendous size, and they have shot the ball  extremely well all season. We will need an outstanding defensive effort in  order to win."  </P></p>

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Outlook bright for ads Worldwide advertising expenditure during 1994 looks as if it will have grown 6.4 per cent in current prices over the year, up from a July forecast of 5.5 per cent, reports Zenith Media Worldwide, the Saatchi &amp; Saatchi-owned media-buying group*. Zenith now says that the four-year outlook to 1997 looks the brightest since 1988, with 'vigorous growth in prospect, even in mature advertising markets'. In the US, spending is set to rise 4.7 per cent in 1995 and 5.4 per cent the following year, stimulated by the presidential election and Atlanta Olympics. The spending recovery in Europe is 'gaining consistency and momentum,' says Zenith, and heading for 11 per cent growth by 1997. The Japanese market will see modest annual growth of 2-3 per cent between 1995 and 1997, after a recovery of 0.3 per cent this year. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, spending growth continues to accelerate and will reach 16.4 per cent by 1997, according to the forecasts. Compound growth between 1994 and 1997 in the region, excluding Japan, should reach 26.5 per cent. Overall, advertising expenditure worldwide is set to grow 8.1 per cent in 1995, 9.8 per cent the following year, and 11.7 per cent in 1997, all at current prices. Separately, Lintas Worldwide, the Interpublic-owned agency network, warns this week that the recession may be over economically in Europe 'but psychologically it's not'. There remains great caution among consumers and subsequently among advertisers. Says Terry Rosenquist, head of Lintas Europe: 'The recession has led to fierce competition, with the retail trade sector putting immense pressure on FMCG manufacturers. These in turn have cut ad spending.' *Advertising Expenditure Forecasts. Zenith Media Worldwide, Bridge House, 63-65 North Wharf Road, London W2 1LA. Fax: 071 402 3891. Pounds 195</p>

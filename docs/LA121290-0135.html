			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKING AHEAD / PAUL SAFFO: PROS NEEDN'T FEAR NEW TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> The prospect of losing one's job to a machine has rarely troubled white-collar  professionals, secure in the assumption that computers powerful enough to  threaten their livelihood exist only as science fiction fantasies.  </P> <P> In fact, the threat may be more immediate, as a designer friend recently  concluded. He thought that the arrival of desktop publishing in the late 1980s  would drive him out of work.  </P> <P> The essence of his fear is that modest computer technology has taken the skill  out of design and packaged it into software. The same pattern is affecting  other professions: Spreadsheet programs perform tasks once reserved for  accountants; on-line databases invite users to become their own librarians;  even lawyers are getting the jitters as companies introduce software programs  that help users write their own wills.  </P> <P> But let's look at what is really happening. Spreadsheets are commonplace in our  offices, yet accountants and bookkeepers are busier than ever. And advanced  desktop publishing tools are quickly becoming fixtures in design offices.  </P> <P> It appears that only the simplest part of what professionals do is being  packaged into programs. At the same time, however, computers are also changing  the nature of professional work in profound and unexpected ways. Today's  librarian is occupied helping users thread their way through databases that  were supposed to make library work obsolete. Lawyers have become profligate  users of on-line research systems and personal computers are quickly replacing  calculators as the accountant's most basic tool.  </P> <P> My designer friend fears the consequences of seeing the skills of his trade  sold as software, but the real headache for professionals is more likely to be  the constant "reskilling" required for professional survival in an information  age.  </P> <P> The challenge lies not in finding work to do, but in finding the time to do  work between continuing education seminars and efforts to learn how to use new  computer systems before they become obsolete. Effective professional use of  information technologies also requires more than just retraining. More often  than not, getting value out of a new computer system involves fundamental  changes in organizational structures, furthering professional anxieties about  the impact of machines on jobs.  </P> <P> In the long run, our new information tools are certain to change the nature of  professional work beyond recognition. More than a few job categories will  disappear, but newer tasks enabled by computer technology will emerge as well.  This will be painful for those averse to change, but the impact on those who  make the effort to keep up will be minimal.  </P> <P> Signs of this shift are visible in many professions today. More than a few  librarians have abandoned institutional jobs to become highly paid electronic  information consultants, and accountants routinely advise clients on computer  matters.  </P> <P> Editors and writers have found new jobs in corporate publishing made possible  by laser printers and word processors. Stock traders and financial analysts are  discovering new ways to go into business on their own by leveraging computers  and communications links to gain the sort of information leverage once  accessible only to big players.  </P> <P> Even designers are getting into the act. My friend is so busy teaching design  principles to desktop publishers that he hardly has the time to worry about the  now-remote possibility that he will be replaced by a machine.  </P></p>

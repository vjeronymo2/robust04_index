			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting The definition of company earnings proposed by the Institute of Investment Management and Research last week is unlikely to limit the confusion caused by the new UK accounting standards. Its calculation of 'headline' earnings differs from alternatives favoured by City firms. The IIMR includes major restructuring costs in headline earnings, for example, even though such costs are unlikely to recur. The definition favoured by BZW excludes such costs on the grounds that the expenditure is something akin to a one-off capital item. In many cases either approach will come up with the same result. But without consensus on such issues investors will be confronted by a plethora of conflicting earnings figures, notably in cases where companies are in a period of change and consistency matters most. It would be helpful if one side or other could fall into line. That said, the idea of requiring companies to disclose IIMR earnings as a condition of listing could be counter-productive. Companies are already required to disclose earnings according to FRS 3, the new accounting standard which virtually abolishes extraordinary items. The standard also allows companies to present an earnings figure of their own. An institutionalised IIMR earnings figure would add a third 'official' measure. The Accounting Standards Board is right to argue that no single measure of company performance is adequate. But three alternative earnings figures - with variations put forward by City firms - can hardly be what it had in mind.</p>

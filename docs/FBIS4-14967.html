			<p>BFN     [Text] At the House of External Economic Relations today,  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali held talks with  Belarusian Foreign Minister Krawchanka. In the course of these  talks, various aspects of international life were discussed, as  well as issues concerning Belarusian participation in the  activities of this authoritative international organization.  Given that the talks were held behind closed doors, I asked the  officials for a short interview.    Could you brief us on the essence of your conversation?    [Begin recording] [Butrus-Ghali, in English fading into  Belarusian translation] We have had a very constructive and  positive meeting with the Belarusian minister of foreign  affairs. We discussed the activities of the United Nations, the  disaster at Chernobyl, and the possible participation of  Belarusian peacekeeping forces in various operations around the  world. We will have a second round of discussions, during which  we will continue with the agenda of different items agreed for  the exchange of information.    [Krawchanka] I have presented [Butrus-Ghali] with two  concrete drafts -- not mere declarations, not just general  words, but two documents. The first project, worth  approximately $12 million, provides for radiological and  ecological monitoring on Belarusian territory. We hope that the  UN Headquarters will find funds for this endeavor. The other  project, which is worth $8 million, is aimed at building a  factory to produce ecological baby food for Chernobyl children.  We take quite an active part in many international activities,  and the arrival of Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is proof that  the international community recognizes the complex problems  facing our motherland. [end recording]    Later today, the UN general secretary held a meeting at the  CIS Executive Secretariat. CIS Executive Secretary Ivan  Karatchenya expressed gratitude to Butrus-Ghali for finding time  to visit the CIS Headquarters in Minsk. He thanked the guest  for the resolution passed by a UN session and the UN Secretariat  on granting the CIS observer status in the United Nations. This  will undoubtedly increase the prestige of the CIS as a regional  international organization. The executive secretary also  briefed Butrus Butrus-Ghali on the structure of the coordinating  bodies of the CIS, as well as their tasks and goals. These  include the reduction of conflicts on CIS territory and  multifarious activities in the sphere of economic integration.    Secretary General Butrus-Ghali, in his turn, pointed out  that  granting the CIS observer status in the United Nations is just  the first step toward recognizing the CIS as an entity of  international law. The United Nations is closely observing the  activities of the CIS, and is interested in increasing the  latter's peacekeeping and humanitarian role. According to Mr.  Butrus-Ghali, the UN Secretariat is ready to closely cooperate  with the executive bodies of the CIS in various spheres.    At the end of the first day of his visit, Butrus  Butrus-Ghali  visited the UN mission in Belarus. Incidentally, this is the  first UN mission opened in a CIS state.</p>

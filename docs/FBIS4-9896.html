			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 4 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Costa Rican  Security Minister Luis Fishman played down a U.S. State  Department report that "money laundering" and drug trafficking  and consumption are on the rise in Costa Rica. Fishman said the  report admits that "there is virtually no corruption" in Costa  Rica's police force, which is prevented from taking more  effective action against drug trafficking because of a lack of  financial resources. "I am proud because they say there is no  corruption," the minister told ACAN-EFE, saying that contrary to  what Washington says, Costa Rica has dealt "harsh blows" to drug  traffickers in recent years despite the limited resources.  Fishman said he "disagrees" with the assertion that Costa Rican  policemen are unprofessional. He said that Puerto Limon on the  Atlantic coast is a problem area and added that many resources  have been allocated to fight drug trafficking and consumption.    The State Department's annual report, released today,  highlighted the progress made by Central American governments,  with the exception of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, in the fight  against drug trafficking and money laundering. The report says  the "laundering of drug money" is particularly serious in Costa  Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua, but virtually nonexistent in El  Salvador.    The State Department praised Guatemala the most for its  cooperation with Washington in several campaigns to eradicate  cocaine and opium and to arrest drug traffickers. According to  the State Department, meager resources and a lack of  professionalism among security services preclude significant  progress in the counternarcotics struggle in Costa Rica. The  report says Puerto Limon has become the main point of contact  between the Colombian island of San Andres, the Nicaraguan coast  on the Caribbean, and the United States. At the same time,  however, the report said there is virtually no corruption.</p>

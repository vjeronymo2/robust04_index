			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Ecuadoran Government announced today that its  policy on paying the debt with the international financial  institutions remains unchanged and that the government will not  make any payments whatsoever to international commercial banks    Finance Minister Cesar Robalino said: We are making payments  to the multilateral financial organizations on the principal and  interest and will continue to do so with or without the crisis.  He added: We have also maintained a policy toward the  international commercial banks, which I have repeated over 100  times, and that policy remains the same; it has not changed.    Robalino said that negotiations with the commercial banks  are  still under way and that no agreement has yet been reached with  the creditors grouped in the Paris Club. He said the government  will soon present a refinancing plan to the Paris Club, but he  did not outline what that plan would be.    Robalino said that problems emerge whenever there is a  plunge  in the prices of basic products such as oil, which is so  important to Ecuador's economy. But, he added, the negotiation  process with the banks must continue. He said that it is not  easy to reach an agreement with the banks, but the country has  been working on the refinancing process for many years and will  continue to do so. "We hope to reach an agreement and the date  on which that happens is important because it is a complex  process," Robalino said.    The finance minister admitted that the commercial banks are  asking Ecuador to resume interest payments so that an agreement  can be reached but not because they want to hold serious  discussions.

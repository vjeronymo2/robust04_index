			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO GETS VICTORY IT WOULD RATHER FORGET  </P> <P> One point-playoff victories rarely are considered disappointments. Usually they  are cherished and talked about for years.  </P> <P> But in the case of El Camino Coach Herb Meyer, he'd just as soon forget  Friday's 17-16 victory over visiting Escondido in the section 2-A quarterfinals  as soon as possible.  </P> <P> His team reverted back to their early-season penchant for mistakes by turning  the ball over three times. They allowed 10 points in the last minute of the  first half, which included an 82-yard kickoff return by Escondido's Keith  Williams. The extra-point try failed when the holder fumbled the snap. And  Meyer's top running back, Von Robinson, broke his hand in the first half. He  likely is out of next week's game against La Jolla or West Hills.  </P> <P> The game was in doubt until El Camino defensive backs Mike Flanagan and Lamont  Girton blocked Escondido kicker Travis Sinohui's 47-yard field-goal attempt  with 1:08 remaining in the game.  </P> <P> Sinohui made a 47-yarder on the final play of the first half. But with the game  on the line, the snap was high and by the time Sinohui got to kick, Girton and  Flanagan were on top of him.  </P> <P> But the blocked kick was one of the few bright spots for El Camino (8-4), which  was outplayed for much of the game by a team it defeated, 31-7, only two weeks  ago.  </P> <P> "(Escondido) played about the same way as last time," Meyer said. "We're back  10 weeks ago. This is not the way it's supposed to be. We're regressing. The  way we played looked like we didn't belong here. This is ridiculous. It's  disappointing."  </P> <P> The most disappointing aspect for Meyer was his team's turnovers -- two fumbles  and an interception. El Camino quarterback Noel Prefontaine's fumble with 3:30  remaining in the fourth quarter on the Escondido 37 gave Escondido a chance to  win the game.  </P> <P> Prefontaine's interception in the first half set up Sinohui's field goal.  </P> <P> But the most costly turnover belonged to Escondido. With seven minutes left in  the third quarter and Escondido close to taking the lead, running back Eddie  Iglesias fumbled on the El Camino one-yard line. Once again Flanagan and Girton  were the culprits. Flanagan stripped the ball and Girton recovered.  </P> <P> "I thought he was in the end zone, until I realized Lamont (Girton) had the  ball," Flanagan said.  </P> <P> Escondido made it look easy early as it took the opening kickoff 64 yards in  seven plays for a 7-0 lead. On the drive quarterback Jerry Singleton completed  his only two passes of the half for 23 and 28 yards to Williams and Richard  Cardoza. Iglesias scored the touchdown on a one-yard run.  </P></p>

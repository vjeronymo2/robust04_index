			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Kohl threatens tax rise to fund unity CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday spelt out for the first time the dramatic increase in the costs of German unification, and threatened early tax rises if government, opposition, employers and trade unions could not agree rapidly on a 'solidarity pact' to help finance them. Opening the annual congress of his Christian Democratic Union in Dusseldorf, he confirmed that new government revenues will have to be found from 1995 onwards to finance debt servicing costs of at least DM40bn (Pounds 16bn) a year on accumulated east German debts of DM400bn. Even more urgently, the cost of a radical reform of the German railway system, including the integration of services between the two halves of the country, cannot be financed from existing resources, he added. That is likely to mean some form of tax increase, probably a petrol tax rise, in the course of 1993, according to senior officials. It all added up, the grim-faced chancellor told his party faithful, to 'the hour of truth' for a united Germany. The country could manage only if every sector of society took part. Mr Kohl also warned that a slowdown in the economy next year will reduce tax revenues by DM10bn, without allowing for any increase in spending in the east. The Economics Ministry is forecasting growth in western Germany of only 1.0 to 1.5 per cent next year, against previous forecasts of 2.5 per cent. However, advance indications were that the country's five main economic institutes, in their annual report to be released today, were projecting even slower west German growth next year, at only 0.5 per cent. One of the five, the Ifo institute in Munich, also gave separate figures yesterday showing a sharp fall in industrial confidence. Mr Kohl said the central government and the 16 federal states also had to agree urgently on a new formula for sharing the burden of an extra DM50bn to DM60bn in spending in the east of the country, to come into effect by 1995. Stopping short of talking openly of tax increases, he said that 'improvements in revenues are urgently necessary to cope with the financial inheritance' of the former East Germany. In 1995 the government must take over a debt of at least DM400bn, he said, DM250bn from the Treuhand privatisation agency and a further DM150bn in accumulated debts of the Communist regime, with a debt servicing cost of around DM40bn a year. He made it clear the increased state revenue in 1995 should be directly linked to servicing those debts, but did not say how the money should be raised. The threat of tax increases has angered Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister and leader of the Christian Social Union, the coalition partner in the government. He is furious that it will mean immediate pressure for drastic budget savings. Mr Waigel is due to appear at the congress tomorrow amid considerable anxiety over what he will say. So far his only comment has been to describe the proposed tax increase as 'about as useful as a hole in the head'. German economy 'in critical state', Page 2</p>

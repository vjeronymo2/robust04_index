			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / State aid to boost Seat: VW wins battle to gain subsidies for Spanish subsidiary Volkswagen, the German car group, has won Pta40bn (Pounds 195m) in state subsidies for Seat, its loss-making Barcelona subsidiary, after 10 weeks of bargaining with the Spanish government. The cash injection is some Pta20bn less than Volkswagen wanted, but it is a climbdown from the government's previous refusal to bail out private sector groups. Other companies, particularly those in the car industry such as the troubled Suzuki plant in the south of Spain, are now likely to press for similar funding. However, officials say Seat is a special case, partly because it is the biggest domestic car producer and because it is the only manufacturer which has a Spanish trade mark and uses a high level of domestic technology. The Spanish government will provide Pta32bn and the Barcelona-based Catalan government the rest. The Catalan Nationalist party, which runs the regional government in Barcelona and supports the minority Socialist government in the Madrid parliament, had consistently backed official subsidies for the area's most important employer. In the first big clash between the Spanish administration and a multinational, Volkswagen had hinted it might wind up Seat as a separate unit unless it got government aid. The formerly state-owned car producer, which was acquired by Volkswagen in 1987, lost Pta151bn last year and expects to lose Pta75bn this year. A key element in the agreement, which will be formally signed today, is that the funds must be invested in technology for Seat and may not be used to lay off the company's employees. The Volkswagen subsidiary intends to shed some 4,500 jobs, a quarter of its labour force. The government has also obtained important concessions from Volkswagen: The proportion of Spanish-made components used by Seat is to rise from a present 54 per cent to 68 per cent. Seat will be maintained as a separate trade mark within the Volkswagen group and the German parent will keep up the company's design and technology centre together with its capacity to produce new models. Any new manufacturing plants opened by Seat in the future will be located in Spain. Volkswagen will nevertheless press ahead with its plans, announced at the end of December, to close Seat's 40-year-old plant in the port area of Barcelona and shift production to a new factory in the town of Martorell, 30km north-west of the city.</p>

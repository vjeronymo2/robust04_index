			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [Announcer] Slovak Economy Minister Peter Magvasi  returned from Moscow last night. He signed a protocol there on  trade and economic relations for 1994. Today, in Bratislava, he  talked to journalists in greater detail about his negotiations  in the Russian Federation, about whose markets a view prevails  here that they are insolvent. Economy Minister Peter Magvasi  was interviewed by our editor Ivan Bielko.    [Begin recording] [Bielko] Our trade balance with Russia has  been negative in the past few years. Is it going to improve  after your negotiations in Moscow?    [Magvasi] The protocol that I signed with Oleg Davydov, the  Russian foreign economic relations minister, will open up some  new opportunities for our enterprises to penetrate Russian  markets.    [Bielko] For example?    [Magvasi] Above all, there is a chance for enterprises to  open their own accounts in selected banks of the Russian  Federation and in the Slovak Republic.    [Bielko] A view prevails here that the Russian market is  insolvent. What about it?    [Magvasi] I think this is an opinion that prevailed from  1990-91, when it was true that the disintegration of the whole  system in Russia did lead to the insolvency of some partners.  On the other hand, today the position is clear. There are  partners in Russia who are highly solvent. In view of the fact  that the ruble is convertible and there is an opportunity for  our Slovak businessmen to open their own accounts, there is far  better payment security in trade with Russia than there is today  within Slovakia--with insolvency there--and in trade with the  Czech Republic. I consider this to be a decisive window of  opportunity that our businessmen should exploit very intensively  and immediately.    [Bielko] You held talks at the Russian Ministry of Atomic  Energy relating to supplies of nuclear fuel and to Russian  participation in the reconstruction of Jaslovske Bohunice  [nuclear energy plant in central Slovakia], as well as to some  other issues.    [Magvasi] The Russian Federation confirmed its continuing  interest in supplying nuclear fuel. Second, we reassessed the  state of readiness of the intergovernmental agreement on nuclear  energy that should be ready to be signed by the end of April or  the beginning of May. Third, I think it is very important that  the Russian Federation is eminently interested in participating  in the construction at Mochovce [nuclear plant in southern  Slovakia].

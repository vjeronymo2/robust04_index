			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Books: Sir Rex, island hero MY FALKLAND DAYS by Rex Hunt David &amp; Charles Pounds 18.99, 488 pages TEN years ago, commanders of the Argentine troops invading the Falklands encountered Sir Rex Hunt, then governor of the islands, dressed in full Colonial Office regalia which included a plumed hat. One of the commanders was to reprimand Sir Rex for behaving 'very ungentlemanly' by refusing to shake his hand. Sir Rex retorted: 'It is very uncivilised of you to invade my country.' With few exceptions, Argentina's military men had little time for Sir Rex. The junta, conveniently forgetting their own illusions of grandeur, claimed that Sir Rex was arrogant and self-deluded and a personification of colonialism which the world could well do without. It was a view shared by some Foreign Office mandarins - although certainly not by all - who thought such lingering relics of empire were out of step with the subtle diplomatic priorities of Britain's changing role in the world. Yet the islanders consider Sir Rex a hero for defending their wishes not to belong to Argentina during the 1970s. It was a decade when most British ministers seemed prepared to sell them down the River Plate, or at the very least give Buenos Aires such ambiguous signals as to make invasion a plausible option. In June the islanders will welcome Sir Rex back, with Mrs Thatcher, to celebrate their liberation. The colonial regalia may have been retired to the Imperial War Museum, but islanders say they are even more British today. Sir Rex, now retired and living in Berkshire, belonged to a dying breed of British Crown servants who found himself in the eye of a political storm more by accident than design. He was appointed Governor of the Falklands in 1979 following a decade when the Colonial Office to which he belonged had gradually been subsumed in the Foreign Office. In the Falklands, as in other islands such as St Helena and Mauritius, the old colonial functions had survived with grandiose titles. In practice, however, the individuals who occupied them were second division players in a foreign service which had more use for diplomats than administrators. Sir Rex was a veteran of several postings in Africa and Asia. He considered he had reached the pinnacle of his career with his appointment to the Falklands. 'How ironic, I thought . . . to be responsible for fewer people than at the start, when, as Assistant District Commissioner in Uganda, I had been responsible for 100,000 souls.' It was, as he notes, a reflection on the decline of the British Empire over the same period. Briefly, during the Falklands war, people such as Sir Rex may have been forgiven for believing that such a trend was being reversed. The sending of the naval Task Force, to the strains of Rule Britannia, brought tears to those unused to accepting the UK reduction in status. But Sir Rex did not have a very good war at all. Booted out of Las Malvinas by Generals Menendez and Company after nearly getting his head blown off, Sir Rex arrived at the British Embassy in Montevideo to be telephoned by Mrs Thatcher. Why, he was asked, had he not sent word to London when the Argentines arrived on the Falklands? In fact Sir Rex had done a pretty good job of holding island morale together against enormous odds. While Whitehall was huffing and puffing about what to do next, it was Sir Rex and a small band of Marines who put up a brief but defiant last-stand against thousands of invading forces. But Mrs Thatcher's question must have been a hint of what was to come. Number 10, the intelligence services, the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence would try hard to find someone to blame for Britain's failure to anticipate Argentina's intentions sooner. On returning to the UK, Sir Rex offered his services as part of the war effort. The day he volunteered for duty at the Foreign Office, he was stopped at the entrance because he did not have the necessary pass. It is a pity that Sir Rex has not allowed chagrin to translate itself into a little rebellion against his former employers. The manuscript of his memoirs was submitted to the Foreign Office for pre-censorship. I wonder, for instance, if there might not be a better explanation as to why the small band of British Marines who were stationed on the islands on April 2 1982 did not escape to the hills rather than surrender to the Argentines? The Marines knew the territory rather better than the Argentines and could have carried out an effective guerrilla operation. It was the kind of heroic exercise Sir Rex would have approved of, but then he was never really in charge. In the end it was Mrs Thatcher who took the credit, however briefly, for the 'Falklands spirit' of renewed national pride. Michael Joseph has re-issued The Battle for the Falklands (Pounds 25, 384 pp.) by Max Hastings and Simon Jenkins, first published in 1983.</p>

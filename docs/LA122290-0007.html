			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERIES ON PRESS AND MINORITIES  </P> <P> I commend David Shaw for his article "Negative News and Little Else,"  (four-part series on minorities and the press, Dec. 11-14).  </P> <P> I am 27 and a black male and even though I am college-educated and have never  been incarcerated, my image is the epitome of a drug addict, drug dealer and  rapist perpetuated by the press.  </P> <P> Ultimately, objectivity must be the goal of any journalist if the press is to  inform and educate. But objectivity can only be achieved if there is  "integrity" in the reporting of facts and context. Incorrect or biased  reporting can only lead to incorrect and biased perceptions. This is true with  any news issue, but especially when reporting on minorities.  </P> <P> TRACY HILL  </P> <P> Van Nuys  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lieutenant General Ehud Baraq, chief of </F> staff, by Lieutenant Colonel Orli Lahat, Yanky Galanti, and  Yo'av Ze'evi; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [BAMAHANE] This year, for  the first time, we faced calls to refuse to obey orders,  including one by a general in the reserves, on a massive scale.  Do these calls hurt the activity of the army, and how is the  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] preparing to deal with such a  phenomenon?    [Baraq] In my view, the IDF will have no problem with  carrying out legal orders at any stage. The IDF does not  determine policy and, as an army, has no stand on the  arrangement with the Palestinians. It has a professional stand  on the security issue and makes that known in the relevant  forums that determine professional issues. The IDF's  professional stand relates to security -- how to defend  ourselves against an external threat; how to defend the  settlements; what security can be provided on the roads -- in  view of the government decision to leave the population centers  and to transfer responsibility for public order and security  there to the Palestinian police force. I reiterate: The IDF  has no stand on the political aspect of the government's  resolutions and will not have one in the future, due to the very  nature of the relationship between the Army and the government.  On the other hand, the IDF, as the Army of a democratic state,  carries out the decisions of the elected government -- any  elected government. That was the situation up to now, that is  the situation now, and that will be the situation in the future.  The IDF carries out the security aspect of the government's  decisions to the best of its abilities.    There are hundreds of thousands of soldiers in the Army and  tens of thousands of officers who, as civilians, express the  entire spectrum of political views held in this country.  Therefore, it is legitimate and even good that as citizens,  they have a view, because after all, they belong to a democratic  state. They express that view once every four years by putting  what they think is the right slip in the ballot box and, by  doing so, elect a government. The elected government is the one  that instructs and guides the IDF.    Recruits, members of the standing army, and officers do not  express political views when in uniform. They implement the  army's orders, which stem from Israel's elected government (that  is the basis of a democracy). Therefore, any soldier, when in  uniform, must carry out all the legal orders he receives from  his commander regardless of his political views. I expect any  group of reservists and any commander who are right-wing  supporters to carry out -- without hesitation or appeal -- an  order to detain a group of Israeli settlers that tries to break  into a closed area near the synagogue in Jericho, because they  are in uniform. To the same extent, I expect any group of  soldiers, regardless of whether they are drafted or in the  reserves, who happen to belong to There Is a Limit or Peace Now  to disperse rioting Palestinian women and children with resolve  and without a second thought.    If an order is given, it must be carried out. That is the  basis of a democracy, and we must all understand that. The IDF  exists in order to defend, and it is ready to do anything to  uphold the right of every citizen to believe what he wants and  to struggle to convince the government and the public of the  rightness of his path.    The citizen must do this in a way that is in total  conformity  with the rules of democracy. Therefore, I occasionally appeal  to the Israeli residents of Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza to try to  express their political protests within the Green Line to the  extent possible, in order to avoid diverting the IDF from its  main mission of pursuing wanted men and safeguarding the  security of the settlers themselves.    [BAMAHANE] Does [former Army chief chaplain] Rabbi Goren not  understand that?    [Baraq] I have not even read what Goren said. From my  viewpoint, what people say is unimportant. Anyone who disobeys  a legal order in the army will find himself in jail -- period --  even if the order touches on an issue which he, as a civilian or  as a member of the government, would have voted for or conducted  differently. In my view, there is currently no danger of  soldiers refusing to obey orders, and if there are isolated  cases among hundreds of thousands of soldiers, they will find  themselves in prison.

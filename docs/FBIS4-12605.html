			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Husayn Sulayman Abu-Salih </F> by Muhammad Jamal 'Arafah in Cairo; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] ['Arafah] Is there concrete  evidence that Israel is supplying the southern rebels with  weapons?    [Abu-Salih] It is a fact that Israeli weapons are reaching  the rebels. We have had evidence in the past. Israel has been  involved in supporting the rebellion since the sixties. All the  rebels' weapons originate in Israel. The incident in which a  plane loaded with weapons was headed for Uganda is just one  aspect of Israel's support for the rebels.    ['Arafah] Have you agreed with Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa on  a date for resumption of the talks on Hala'ib? Why have  negotiations been postponed for so long?    [Abu-Salih] We have been waiting for Foreign Minister Musa  since September. We have sent him an invitation but he has not  come. I told him this when he visited me (in the hotel). No  agreement was reached with him on a date. However, we are  waiting for him at any time.    Regarding the postponement of the talks, why don't you ask  Egypt about this postponement? Why don't you ask Foreign  Minister Musa this question? We have agreed to proceed in  accordance with what Presidents Mubarak and al-Bashir agreed  upon--namely, to draw up a framework for relations between the  two countries. We have not been negligent and we do not want to  blame anyone. Therefore, we did not want to submit the issue of  Hala'ib to the Arab League meetings. We are still waiting for  'Amr Musa to honor us with a visit!    ['Arafah] It has been said that there is U.S. support for  the rebels in the south. On the other hand, Sudanese Foreign  Ministry officials have stated that they are convinced that the  United States does not want to topple the present regime. Is  there a contradiction in the stand of the United States?    [Abu-Salih] We take everyone at their word. The United  States, according to its ambassador in Khartoum, says it does  not support the rebels and does not do anything to topple the  government. Secret actions by other nonofficial U.S. quarters  (for example intelligence) is another matter!    ['Arafah] It has been reiterated that there is a new  dialogue between the United States and Sudan. For this purpose,  the U.S. President has appointed a special representative to  Sudan. He will also send his UN ambassador to Sudan at the end  of this month.    [Abu-Salih] Dialogue with the United States started a long  time ago. U.S. Secretary Christopher referred to this dialogue  even though Sudan is included on the list of the states that  support terrorism. Recently, there has been the impression or  signals that there is hope that this dialogue will be continued.  For our part, we have already stated that we need balanced  relations with the United States. I will meet with President  Clinton's envoy on 31 March. She will carry a message from  Clinton to al-Bashir. I believe that this mission will help  promote dialogue between the two sides. [passage omitted]</p>

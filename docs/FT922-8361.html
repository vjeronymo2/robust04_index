			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / PepsiCo in snack food joint venture PEPSICO and General Mills, the US multinationals, are to merge their snack foods operations in six European countries, creating a company with annual sales of Dollars 640m (Pounds 355m). The joint venture - subject to approval by the European Commission - will combine PepsiCo's snack businesses in Spain, Portugal and Greece, with General Mills's snack and biscuit units in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. PepsiCo's Walkers and Smiths crisps companies in the UK are not affected. The new company will rival United Biscuits' KP Foods for leadership in the Dollars 25bn European snacks market. No cash was involved in the agreement announced yesterday. PepsiCo will receive a 60 per cent stake and General Mills 40 per cent in the new company. PepsiCo Foods International will assume responsibility for day-to-day management with the partners naming directors in proportion to their equity. The venture will employ 4,650 staff and operate eight manufacturing plants in the six countries. PepsiCo has earmarked Dollars 70m for a manufacturing plant at Carregado in Portugal; and General Mills is building a Dollars 55m production facility at Raamsdonksveer in the Netherlands. Mr Michael Jordan, chairman of PepsiCo's international foods and beverages, said the businesses were a perfect fit in terms of geographical markets, technology, distribution systems and product lines. Products marketed by the venture will continue to be sold under their existing brand names. Mr Jordan added: 'The combined strength of PepsiCo's salty and sweet snack production technology and General Mills's expertise in the grain-based snack and sweet biscuit segments will enable us to provide European consumers with a wider choice of products.' Mr Stephen Sanger, executive vice-president of General Mills, said shared research and development would enable the venture to improve product innovation - a key to market growth. It is General Mills's second joint venture in the European food business. The group formed an alliance with Nestle in 1989 to challenge Kellogg's dominance in breakfast cereals. For PepsiCo, the deal is another step in its ambitions to repeat globally the success of its US snack foods business. Its international snacks operations extend to 24 countries and are the group's fastest-growing segment. In New York yesterday, shares in General Mills rose Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 62 5/8 while PepsiCo fell Dollars  3/8 to close at Dollars 35 7/8.</p>

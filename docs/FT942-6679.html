			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Sick - but not terminal - A look at the rocky state of the new issues market Predictions of the imminent demise of the new issue market may have been exaggerated, but it has certainly been looking pretty sick lately. Several flotations were pulled at the last moment and the fall in the stock market dragged more new issues below their offer prices. Yet, there is still a queue of hopefuls waiting to offer shares to investors who, clearly, have had their fill. In order to get the issues away, many vendors are seeing the price of their shares cut back savagely. Even then, few go to a decent premium on first dealings. In these circumstances, it might seem wise for private investors to avoid new issues altogether, or at least wait to see what happens when the shares start trading. For the brave, it is the flops that sometimes offer the best value. 'When an issue flops, investors try to dump stock - which drives the price down further,' says one private client broker. 'The shares then tend to sit around, friend-less, like damaged goods on the shelf.' Sometimes, there is a good reason why investors spurned the shares initially. But shares in sound companies can be depressed artificially for some time after a disappointing flotation. The table lists all those new issues, excluding investment trusts, launched in 1992 and 1993 that fell to a discount within a week of the start of dealings. It then shows the gain or loss, relative to the All Share index, had you bought them at that price and held them until now. They range from the pretty disastrous (Canadian Pizza) to the highly successful (the Telegraph and RJB Mining). On average, the 14 stocks have slightly outperformed the market. This result needs to be treated with some caution. For a start, most of the 14 are small companies which, as a class, outpaced the index comfortably over the period. Yet, it does serve to illustrate that quality companies - such as the Telegraph - which chose a poor time to float, or in some way fail to catch the mood of the moment, can be picked up cheaply if they get off to a bad start. The Telegraph came to the market in the summer of 1992 when a sudden flurry of medium-sized flotations led to disappointing debuts by some very solid companies, including MFI, Kenwood, and Anglian Group. In that sense, it had some similarities with the present. It should be noted, however, that while the Telegraph has gone to a handsome premium and MFI has outperformed the market modestly, Kenwood and Anglian both have lagged. Of course, sometimes the market gets it exactly right. When Canadian Pizza floated in November, investors were wary of the price demanded for a one-product company with a few large supermarket customers such as J. Sainsbury. When, last month, Sainsbury's decided to stop buying the company's pizza crust for its delicatessens, the shares tumbled. Issuing a profits warning shortly after flotation is just not done and offenders get treated very harshly by the market. Shares in both United Carriers and Cementone took bad knocks last week when they admitted trading was below expectations. If the trading problem proves only temporary, as it did in the case of Holliday Chemical last year, those brave souls who buy on the warning can pick up real bargains. But, all too often, an early profits warning is the start of a slippery slope. As always, the key to successful equity investment is being selective. When it comes to picking the top of the flops, more than usual caution is required.  -------------------------------------------------------------- BACKING THE FLOPS  -------------------------------------------------------------- Company           Issue   Price after      Price   Gain against                   price          week    25/5/94   FT All Share  -------------------------------------------------------------- Avonside           106p        102.5p       138p          +4.2% Grosvenor Inns     105p           91p       135p         +26.1% Kenwood            285p          279p       340p          -4.2% Telegraph          325p          298p       553p         +44.8% Anglian Group      210p          202p       244p          -9.5% RJB Mining         250p          239p       350p         +36.6% Anagen             110p           92p        74p         -24.7% Court Cavendish    225p          197p       236p         +10.0% Cantab Pharms      460p          455p       462p          +3.9% Charles Sidney     110p          104p       117p         +13.2% Canadian Pizza     200p          192p       107p         -44.0% Lilliput           135p          126p       108p         -11.0% Fenchurch Gp       180p          178p       152p         -11.1% Celltech           250p          225p       201p          -4.7%  --------------------------------------------------------------                                                       Ave.+2.1%  --------------------------------------------------------------</p>

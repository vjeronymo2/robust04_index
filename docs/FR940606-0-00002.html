Cattle or bison not known to be affected with or exposed to tuberculosis are eligible for interstate movement without restriction if those cattle or bison are moved from jurisdictions designated as accredited-free States or modified accredited States. The regulations restrict the interstate movement of cattle or bison not known to be affected with or exposed to tuberculosis if those cattle or bison are moved from jurisdictions designated as nonmodified accredited States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The status of a State is based on its freedom from evidence of tuberculosis, the effectiveness of the State's tuberculosis eradication program, and the degree of the State's compliance with the standards contained in the ``Uniform Methods and Rules_Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication,'' which is part of the regulations via incorporation by reference in part 77. A State must have no findings of tuberculosis in any cattle or bison in the State for at least 5 years in order to be designated as an accredited-free State.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before publication of this interim rule, New York was designated in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;77.1 of the regulations as a modified accredited State. However, New York now meets the requirements for designation as an accredited-free State. Therefore, we are amending the regulations by removing New York from the list of modified accredited States in &sect;77.1 and adding it to the list of accredited-free States in that section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Immediate Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that there is good cause for publishing this interim rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Immediate action is warranted, as New York currently meets the criteria for designation as an accredited-free State. This action provides prospective cattle and bison buyers with accurate and up-to-date information, which may affect the marketability of cattle and bison since some prospective buyers prefer to buy cattle and bison from accredited-free States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this action are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under these conditions, we find good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effective upon publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . We will consider comments that are received within 60 days of publication of this rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . After the comment period closes, we will publish another document in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . It will include a discussion of any comments we receive and any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 21,000 cattle herds in New York, with a total of about 1,560,000 cattle. An estimated 90 percent of these herds are owned by small entities. Changing the status of New York may affect the marketability of cattle and bison from the State, since some prospective cattle and bison buyers prefer to buy cattle and bison from accredited-free States. This may result in some beneficial economic impact on some small entities. However, based on our experience in similar designations of other States, the impact should not be significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12372  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 19 May (UKRINFORM-TASS) -- The statement  released for publication today by the Main Center for Public  Relations, attached to the Ukrainian Internal Affairs Ministry,  reads the following:    "Certain mass media, `Ostankino' Television and Radio  Company  in particular, have been whipping up the situation around the  Republic of Crimea. Exaggerated importance is consistently  given to the subject of the latest personnel reshuffle in the  leadership of the internal affairs bodies of the autonomous  republic.    The Chief Public Relations Center of Ukraine's Interior  Ministry has been instructed to inform the media and the public  of the Interior Ministry's position on this matter.    The current situation was analyzed at the Interior Ministry  of the Republic of Crimea on 19 May. A team from the Ukrainian  Interior Ministry recently worked in the Republic of Crimea and  documents relating to the practical aid provided to official  bodies and departments of the interior were discussed at the  meeting.    Among the questions discussed was the issue of incorrect  actions that occurred when Aleksandr Plyuta, the interior  minister of the Republic of Crimea, was dismissed from his post  and a former army general, Valeriy Kuznetsov, took his place.  We emphasize once again, as we have done many times before,  that all such issues are to be decided solely by the interior  minister of Ukraine, in accordance with Ukraine's law on militia.    Valentyn Nedryhaylo, Ukrainian first deputy interior  minister, who attended the meeting, read out Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk's decree turning the Crimean Republic's Interior  Ministry into the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's Main Directorate  of Internal Affairs in the Crimea and making it directly  accountable to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. In accordance  with the decree, administrative and service premises, weapons,  vehicles, and other property are being handed over to the Main  Directorate of Internal Affairs in the Crimea.    Also read out was a Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers decision  on changes in the complement and structure of the Ukrainian  Interior Ministry, providing for the introduction of an  additional post-- Ukrainian deputy interior minister, who is  also head of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry's Main Directorate  of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. By order of the Ukrainian  interior minister, the post has been filled by Militia Colonel  Valeriy Chernyshov, a Russian, born in 1952, and a graduate of  what is now the Ukrainian Academy of Internal Affairs, who has  over 20 years' experience of working in internal affairs bodies.  V. Chernyshov was born in the Crimea's Bakhchisarayskiy Rayon  and worked for over 12 years in operational commanding positions  in Crimea's internal affairs bodies. Over the past few years he  has served on the staff of the Ukrainian Interior Ministry as  deputy head of the Main Directorate for Criminal Investigations.    Disregarding the decree of L. Kravchuk, the president of our  state, on 19 May, the Supreme Soviet session of the Crimean  Republic appointed Valeriy Kuznetsov to the nonexistent post of  interior minister of the Crimean Republic.    A dangerous precedent has thus been created that may have a  negative effect on the activities of the internal affairs bodies  as a whole and help to destabilize the peninsula's crime  situation, which is already extremely tense."</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Primerica posts profit up 34% PRIMERICA, the diversified US financial services group, yesterday announced a 34 per cent increase in third-quarter profits to Dollars 165m, or Dollars 1.46 a share. Overall revenues, however, fell from Dollars 1.3bn a year ago to Dollars 1.2bn. Primerica was able to post a strong increase in profits because of lower expenses and investment portfolio gains of Dollars 28.3m during the quarter. The company said the one-off investment gains were part of a restructuring which included a reduction in Primerica's exposure to early paydowns of mortgage-backed securities, designed to maximise the portfolio's long-term return. The best performance came from consumer finance services, which posted a 9 per cent increase in earnings to Dollars 50m, thanks primarily to reduced costs and lower loan loss provisions. Credit quality improved during the quarter, with loan delinquencies and charge-offs both down on a year ago. Insurance services brought in net income of Dollars 45.2m, slightly less than in 1991. Sales of new life insurance were flat, but mutual fund sales improved. Earnings at the group's Gulf insurance property and casualty operations were Dollars 6m, up from a year ago even though the unit set aside Dollars 2m to cover losses from Hurricane Andrew. Smith Barney, Primerica's securities brokerage subsidiary, saw earnings drop slightly to Dollars 33.4m, with lower trading results, lower net interest income and higher expenses offsetting gains in brokerage production, investment banking and asset management fees. The fall in Smith Barney's profits was expected in the wake of the recent slowdown in stock market activity. Corporate expenses fell sharply to Dollars 11.6m in the quarter, due to declining interest rates and lower debt levels. Primerica's earnings were in line with expectations, and its shares eased Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 42 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

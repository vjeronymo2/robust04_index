			<p>BFN     [Text] The day's important news item is that the situation  is again exceedingly aggravated in the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  [NKR]. We have not yet received further details to add to the  report already transmitted by my colleagues. For those who have  not heard our previous newscast, let me say that according to  the press service of NKR Defense Army headquarters, the  Azerbaijani Army launched a large attack in the north of NKR's  Mardakertskiy Rayon yesterday. The large aggressive action was  launched on the eve of the upcoming high-level talks on the  settlement of the Karabakh conflict. Those talks were prepared  by the Russian Foreign Ministry. The attack came a day before  the opening of the CSCE Minsk Group talks on Nagorno-Karabakh in  Prague today.    The Azerbaijani Air Force subjected NKR's peaceful cities  and  villages to massive air strikes yesterday. Three residents were  killed and nine were injured only during the bombing of  Stepanakert's residential quarters. Most of the victims are  women and children. A number of residential buildings in the  city were destroyed. There are victims in the NKR's other  settlements, which also came under air attack.    The Azerbaijani warplanes tried to launch air strikes  against  civilian objects today. In the meantime, battles are continuing  in the northern sector of the front where the Karabakh forces  are halting the enemy's attacks.    The NKR leadership believes that in exacerbating the  situation on the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict zone, Baku is as  usual relying on brute force and is again challenging the  international community which is exerting efforts for the  peaceful settlement of the conflict. They reported from  Stepanakert that because of the air strikes classes were  canceled in educational institutions.    As regards the situation on Armenia's borders, the Defense  Ministry press service reported at 1600 that a relative calm has  prevailed since last night.</p>

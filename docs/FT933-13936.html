			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / UK Company News: TT calls for Pounds 51m via rights TT GROUP, the rapidly expanding electronics company that is emerging from a small diversified conglomerate, is to raise Pounds 51m through a 1-for-4 rights issue. Mr John Newman, a chief executive and former acquisitions manager for Lord Hanson, said the issue will fund further acquisitions, the purchase of new product lines and Pounds 40m of capital expenditure over the next two years. The rights issue comes little more than six months after TT concluded its Pounds 13m acquisition of AB Electronics with the help of a Pounds 7m placing at 167p. The issue is priced at 240p, some 53p below where the shares closed on Wednesday, and is underwritten by Samuel Montagu. TT's share closed down 7p at 286p. Mr Newman said TT had driven a lot of costs out of AB but that it needed now to take advantage of the emerging recovery. 'We have got to the stage where we need to invest in automatic equipment to lower the cost base', he said. TT would also want to buy further product lines and was looking in continental Europe. The group was also interested in making further substantial acquisitions in the electronics field. Without the rights issue, the group would have been constrained by gearing that is now about 47 per cent after a Pounds 12.1m fall in debt since AB was purchased. The group will pay an interim dividend of 2.6p and a total dividend of not less than 6.6p. COMMENT TT's rights issue is proof of what can be done with a City following. Less than six months after the share placing that financed the acquisition of AB Electronics, TT has transformed its balance sheet with a well-received rights issue. The cash call is clearly opportunistic. The shares are trading only marginally off a record high and the group is clearly spinning off cash. But in spite of this cash flow, gearing at 47 per cent would have limited TT's scope for capitalising on its purchase of AB by investing as the business cycle starts to turn up. The opportunity to make further acquisitions and buy more product lines is the additional prize for winning the City's trust. It is now up to TT to repay that trust by showing the proceeds will enhance earnings.</p>

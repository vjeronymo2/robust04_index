			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, June 16 (XINHUA) -- A representative of  the president of the Democratic Kampuchea Party (DKP) Khieu  Samphan said here today that a minimum political platform is  essential to the achievement of the unity of all Cambodian  national forces.    Chan Youran made the remark while clarifying the DKP's  proposal for a minimum political platform at today's round table  meeting on peace and national reconciliation in Cambodia.    However, the government side refused to discuss the platform  and insisted that an agreement on the timetable of the  cease-fire should come first and that the political platform  issue should be tackled later. As a result, the round table  talks broke down at noon without making any progress.    Chan said that the proposal calling on all Cambodian parties  to agree on a minimum political platform "is another testimony  of the sense of responsibility of the DKP and of its willingness  to strive for genuine and lasting national reconciliation."    Earlier, DKP President Khieu Samphan said at the Pyongyang's  round table talks on May 27 that the platform "will serve as the  basis for the formation of a national government and a unified  national army." The co-prime ministers of Cambodia contended  that this would mean the dissolution of the royal government and  the royal armed forces and was therefore unacceptable.    After the collapse of the talks today, the government side  noted that there is no need to meet again as the two round-table  talks held so far have both ended fruitlessly. But the DKP  suggested continuation of the talks.    Nhiek Tioulong, representative of King Norodom Sihanouk,  said  he will report to the king about the talks and Sihanouk would  decide whether or not to continue the talks.</p>

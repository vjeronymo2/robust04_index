The country's annual quantity now takes up about one-sixth  of  the world's total. In comparison, China turned out only  one-45th of the world's aquatic products in 1949, when the  People's Republic of China was founded.    During the past 15 years in particular, a time of economic  reforms and opening up to the outside world, the output of  aquatic products rose by 2.8 times, reaching 17.86 million tons  in 1993.    One distinct change is that the proportion of China's ocean  fishing decreased while the freshwater fishing industry has  grown markedly, the ratio now is three to two.    In addition, 48 percent of the country's output of aquatic  products is from artificially bred stock, according to the paper.    However, on average, China's output is 14 kg of aquatic  products per capita, only equal to two-thirds of the world's  average, the newspaper noted.</p>

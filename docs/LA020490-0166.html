			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LANDMARK WHITTIER THEATER TO BE SOLD  </P> <P> The owner of the rundown Whittier Theater is selling out because he is tired of  fighting with the city and conservationists over the fate of the Depression-era  landmark, according to an associate.  </P> <P> Peter Doerkin will put the theater up for sale this week, making way for a  buyer to either restore or demolish it, said Don Gerstein, an executive and  spokesman for Doerkin Properties Inc. of Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "We're tired of dealing with Whittier," Gerstein said. "We're going to put our  tail between our legs and go on to something else."  </P> <P> Gerstein would not disclose how much Doerkin is asking for the theater, which  he purchased for about $1.1 million from the Pacific Theater chain in 1987. "We  are not asking an excessive amount," Gerstein said. "We want enough to recover  our costs."  </P> <P> The historic film palace at Hadley Avenue and Whittier Boulevard has been at  the center of debate since before the Oct. 1, 1987, earthquake.  </P> <P> When Doerkin purchased the theater in June, 1987, he told the council he was  going to restore it and convert it to a performing arts center. But several  months later, he asked the city for permission to replace the theater with a  $14-million shopping plaza because, he said, fixing up the theater would be a  losing proposition.  </P> <P> The council had not yet acted on Doerkin's request when the 5.9-magnitude  earthquake rocked the area in October, 1987, severely damaging the historic  building.  </P> <P> City building inspectors ordered that the theater be demolished because they  said the earthquake had made it unsafe. A wrecking crew worked on the theater  for about 45 minutes in November, 1987, before lawyers for the Whittier  Conservancy -- which had successfully argued in court that the city had to  obtain an environmental impact report before razing the theater -- arrived with  a restraining order to stop the destruction.  </P> <P> The city completed the environmental impact report in October and voted to tear  the theater down because no one wanted to restore it. The conservationists  vowed to stop the city's wrecking ball and asked the court not to lift the  restraining order.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Doerkin is loosing $15,000 a month on the theater while waiting for  the fight to end, Gerstein said.  </P> <P> He asked the Los Angeles Conservancy to help find a buyer for the theater. So  far, a few people have expressed interest, Gerstein said.  </P> <P> Helen Rahder, spokeswoman for the Whittier Conservancy, said local  preservationists also are scrambling to find a buyer.  </P> <P> "This opens a whole range of possibilities," Rahder said. "This is a viable  piece of property that could be restored."  </P> <P> But City Manager Tom Mauk was less optimistic.  </P> <P> "It (Doerkin's decision to sell) does not make any difference," Mauk said. "The  place is a mess and it needs to be demolished. Anyone who considers buying it  is going to have his hands full."  </P></p>

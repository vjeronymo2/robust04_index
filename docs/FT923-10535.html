			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Letter: Intolerable burden on Blue Arrow judge Sir, I write purely in a personal capacity. That said, let me declare a possible interest: I acted as counsel to a corporate defendant in the Blue Arrow trial, my client being acquitted by direction of Mr Justice McKinnon and therefore not involved in the appeal which was finally resolved on Tuesday. And, please, let me disclaim an interest: my first and only contact with Mr Justice McKinnon was in connection with that trial. It happens that I lack judicial ambition. Thus, in writing as I do, I have neither a personal nor a professional axe to grind. The extent to which Mr Justice McKinnon is to be criticised in respect of aspects of the conduct of the trial is for others to assess. However, it ought at least to be pointed out that throughout, he dealt courteously and promptly with every submission made; he had the courage and integrity to confess that, in respect of corporate defendants, his previous rejection of an application to direct acquittal was 'wrong'; and ultimately he sought to reduce the jury's burden in a genuine, albeit - as the Court of Appeal indicated - erroneous but undoubtedly bona fide attempt to secure fairness. Lord Lane, before his retirement, spoke of the 'intolerable burden' on judges trying serious fraud cases. Those of us who sat through the Blue Arrow case witnessed a supremely honourable attempt to discharge that burden. Edmund Lawson, 4 Paper Buildings, Temple, London EC4Y 7EX</p>

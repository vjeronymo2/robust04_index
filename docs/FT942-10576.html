			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: 'Women in management' is also a little-understood issue for men Sir, Is it not time to face the fact that 'women in management' is not just a women's issue? The male-dominated working practices that Lady Howe refers to ('Resources must not be wasted', May 6) are created by men, not out of anti-feminism, rather out of a different way of relating to the world (Hedda Bird's letter of May 6). 'Women in management' is as much a men's issue] There is very little inquiry into understanding how men really view women coming into management, or the issues this throws up for men. What efforts are there to support and challenge men on the new position that they find themselves in? For example, can men admit to feeling threatened, do they understand the skills that women bring into management, do they actually want to understand these skills? Do men trust the intuitive skills that women can bring into management? In getting to grips with strategy, do men appreciate the strengths that women bring; their abilities to identify the values of the organisation and its commercial environment? When we begin to face up to the real problem, there are many unanswered questions and many questions never asked. One way of dealing with the problem is to encourage men and women to ask questions and express their positions face to face; to dispel myths about each other and gain a real appreciation of their different ways of operating; to discover their complementary qualities as well as those that conflict. Only then will men and women executives engage with each other at a level that can make a positive and permanent difference to men and women together in management.

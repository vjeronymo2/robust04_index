			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES NEARLY SET FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: THEY WORK OUT AT HOME IN PREPARATION FOR FINAL EXHIBITION GAMES. ROB  NELSON SAYS HE'LL STAY WITH ORGANIZATION AT LEAST THROUGH SEASON, EVEN IN  MINORS.  </P> <P> It was a little later than expected -- about a week because of the delay caused  by the spring training lockout -- but the Padres returned to San Diego Jack  Murphy Stadium Friday ready to begin their first regular season of the '90s,  their fourth decade in the major leagues.  </P> <P> It was 21 years ago Sunday -- April 8, 1969 -- that the Padres opened their  first season with a 2-1 victory over Houston in San Diego Stadium. Ricky Bones,  a top prospect cut earlier this spring by the Padres, couldn't possibly  remember it. He was one day old.  </P> <P> On Friday, in front of virtually no one, the Padres took batting practice and  played a six-inning intrasquad game that featured more jocularity than hits,  runs and hanging-star plays. The Padres will play exhibition games against  Seattle tonight at 7:05 and Sunday afternoon at 1:05.  </P> <P> Joe Carter, taking his first swings in the stadium since a December trade from  Cleveland, lined a home run off the facade behind the left-field wall off Mike  Dunne in the first inning. Carter, who did not have the best of springs -- one  hit in his past 11 at-bats -- was jokingly given the silent treatment from  teammates.  </P> <P> "The man waits for an intrasquad game to go deep," Gwynn ragged.  </P> <P> "Hey, I made contact," Carter said.  </P> <P> It was that kind of day. Relaxed.  </P> <P> Manager Jack McKeon might have given the Padres the day off, but he wanted to  give pitcher Andy Benes another start before the season opener Monday at Dodger  Stadium. Benes, who allowed just two hits in six innings, said he's ready.  </P> <P> In off-the-field developments, first baseman Rob Nelson said he signed a waiver  Friday agreeing not to become a free agent, at least until the end of the 1990  season, even if he is sent to the minors before then.  </P> <P> Nelson, who cleared major league waivers Friday morning, could have chosen free  agency if he was sent to the minors because it would have been his second  outright option. He needed to decide by Friday, not May 1, when rosters must be  reduced from 27 to 24 players. Nelson, who played in 42 games last season, is  expected to be on the 27-man roster.  </P> <P> McKeon said he likely would not make roster decisions until after Sunday's  final exhibition game against Seattle for the simple reasons he doesn't have to  and wants to wait in case of injuries. McKeon also said Nelson, outfielder  Shawn Abner and pitchers Steve Peters, Rafael Valdez and Dan Murphy are  fighting for the final three spots.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> There are still more than 10,000 seats available for Tuesday night's home  opener against the Dodgers at 7:05. Tickets for all Padre home games are  available at Gate C at the stadium or through TeleSeat.  </P></p>

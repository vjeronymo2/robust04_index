			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Money Markets: London rates ease INTEREST RATES were a little softer in quiet London trading yesterday. An absence of UK economic data in the immediate future is likely to turn attention to next week's local government elections. At the moment there seems little prospect of an early cut in UK bank base rates, despite Wednesday's claim from the Confederation of British Industry that the economic situation is bad and getting worse. Three-month sterling interbank was quoted at 11 13/16 -11 3/4 per cent against 11 7/8 -11 3/4 per cent previously and 12-month money was unchanged at 11 7/16 -11 5/16 per cent. On Liffe June short sterling futures held above an important support level of 88.57. The contract opened firmer at 88.60 and closed at 88.64 compared with 88.56 on Wednesday. There was no encouragement of lower interest rates from the Bank of England. The central bank did not appear to give enough help to take out the underlying credit shortage on the cash market. A day-to-day shortage of Pounds 600m was initially forecast, but this was revised to Pounds 550m at noon and to Pounds 650m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 499m was provided. Before lunch the authorities bought Pounds 53m bills outright, by way of Pounds 48m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 5m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon Pounds 261m bills were purchased, via Pounds 188m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent and Pounds 73m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 185m was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 1,010m, with a rise in the note circulation absorbing Pounds 105m and bank balances below target Pounds 5m. These outweighed exchequer transactions adding Pounds 520m to liquidity. In Frankfurt call money was unchanged at 8.80 per cent as liquidity remained relatively comfortable near the end of the month. Rates may edge higher today as pension fund payments drain money from the banking system. In Madrid the rate for 12-month Spanish Treasury bills was steady at 12.599 per cent at yesterday's tender. This followed the Bank of Spain's decision to leave its money market intervention rate unchanged earlier this week, despite upward pressure on the Spanish peseta in the European exchange rate mechanism.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Reforming Japan JUST A few weeks ago, it would have seemed implausible, to say the least, that a Japanese government could be brought to the brink of collapse over the question of electoral reform. The fact that it has been, with a no-confidence motion from opposition parties being voted on today, is a sign of how far the issue has moved up the political agenda. It is unlikely to go away, whether the Miyazawa cabinet survives or is forced to call elections, thus jeopardising the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time since 1955. Cynics will say that the struggle now unfolding between conservatives and reformers in the LDP is just another of the factional fights that are the party's life blood. Since the mid-1970s it has been strengthened by numerous challenges from reformist groups because it has eventually embraced their demands and their supporters. The LDP has succeeded partly by delivering sustained economic growth, but also by extending its reach from its original conservative rural constituencies into urban areas. Its instincts for survival should never be underestimated. Yet there are three reasons for thinking that reform is now a real issue. First, many Japanese politicians, business leaders and bureaucrats believe reformed political institutions are needed for Japan to fulfil a larger world role. Second, the Japanese public's disaffection with political corruption has grown with successive scandals: it wants reforms which will deliver less corrupt politicians. Third, neither main party is fully able to give voice to new currents in Japanese society. The Social Democratic Party's largely unreformed socialist ideology makes it an unelectable opposition. The LDP's younger politicians, representing relatively cosmopolitan urban dwellers, are constrained by older representatives of rural constituencies bred on protectionism and pork barrel public works spending. Many younger politicians want reforms which will encourage a split in the LDP and create a modernising centrist opposition party, which would promote liberalisation of markets at home and free trade by standing up to Japanese farming interests. In theory such an opposition could displace the socialists, and mount a challenge to the conservatives who would remain in the LDP. That may not, of course, be the immediate result of the sort of electoral reforms that have recently been mooted. The replacement of large, multi-member constituencies by smaller, single-seat constituencies, for example, could further strengthen the LDP at the expense of smaller parties. Yet the case for making Japanese politics less corrupt and more transparent, less parochial and more outward looking, is becoming irresistible. Even if the current crisis passes, the pressure for reform is bound to arise again in another form.</p>

			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Costumed bank employees in Rancho Bernardo were taken by surprise when a masked  man turned out to be a robber and not someone dressed for Halloween, police  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> A number of bank employees wore costumes Wednesday morning to mark Halloween,  and a masked bandit raised no eyebrows when he ran into the Great Western Bank  in the 16000 block of Bernardo Center Drive, San Diego Police spokesman Bill  Robinson said.  </P> <P> When the man, dressed in a gray sweat suit and gray ski mask, asked a teller  for money, she replied: "You're kidding, right?"  </P> <P> Tellers, however, quickly realized he was a real robber when he waved a  blue-steel semi-automatic pistol. "She (the teller) saw the pistol and knew he  meant business," Robinson said.  </P> <P> The robber ordered the three customers in the bank to lie on the floor. Then he  told two tellers to fill a backpack with money. He left the bank in less than  two minutes, carrying $3,200, Robinson said.  </P> <P> "Halloween came a little early to Great Western Bank," Robinson said.  </P></p>

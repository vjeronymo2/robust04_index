			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (1): A wounded country strives to rebuild  -There are grounds for hope that the winter of 1993 was a low from which recovery has since begun Romania was the last to fall as communist regimes across central Europe collapsed in the fateful autumn of 1989. Unlike the bloodless 'velvet' revolutions elsewhere in Soviet dominated Europe, the transfer of power came violently. Confused days of fighting in the streets came to a climax in the hail of bullets that killed a loathed tyrant and his even more hated wife, after a Christmas Day trial by a kangaroo court. Since the execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu, which ended a 24-year reign of tragic absurdity, the 23m inhabitants of this beautiful, potentially prosperous but deeply wounded countryhave been coming to terms with their painful inheritance. The task has been complicated by a political transition that left many from the old regime in positions of power, and the absence of a period of reform before the abrupt change of government. While Hungary, Poland and even the Soviet Union were experimenting with market mechanisms and pluralistic political structures, the last decade of the Ceausescu regime was a period of increased megalomania, repression and intellectual isolation. Behind the screen of a pervasive and brutal security service, the securitate, the Ceausescu regime decided to repay all foreign debt, while building a presidential palace of pharaonic proportions, and stunning bad taste, in the heart of historic Bucharest. Productive investment for maintaining and modernising industry and infrastructure was halted for the best part of a decade, health and education budgets were slashed and food and raw materials were exported. Romanians went hungry and lived miserable lives in unheated, ill-lit homes and work places. Living standards, already the lowest in Europe apart from Albania, plunged as debt was paid off and the architectural heart of Bucharest was ripped out. It is hardly surprising in these circumstances that the euphoria over the bloody downfall of the Ceausescu clan was replaced so soon by a sense of disorientation and dismay, as the full extent of the psychological, spiritual and physical damage to the nation became clear. Perplexity began with the emergence of Mr Ion Iliescu as head of the National Salvation Front which assumed power in December 1989. He had been a leading figure in the previous regime before he fell out with Ceausescu in the late 1970s, but he was elected president with an overwhelming majority in May 1990. He was re-elected in October 1992, even though many Romanians held him responsible for the rampage of hundreds of coalminers through Bucharest only three weeks after the May 1990 election. The failure of Mr Petre Roman, the prime minister, and his young reformist colleagues to resign in protest against the miners' bloody assault on intellectuals and selected opposition leaders, weakened the position of the younger generation of political leaders. They had the courage and energy to begin the reform process against daunting odds, but were dismissed in September 1991 after a second miners' excursion to the capital. Mr Iliescu, a shrewd, if cynical, judge of his countrymen's political awareness, increased his own grasp on power after the departure of Mr Roman and was re-elected president with quasi-Gaullist powers in the 1992 presidential elections. At the same time his party, the Democratic National Salvation Front, since renamed as the Party of Social Democracy of Romania (PSDR), was confirmed as the linchpin of the political system. It won 28 per cent of the votes cast at the parliamentary elections, compared with the 27 per cent share won by the Democratic Convention (DC) - a loose 18-party coalition of the centre-right, including the ethnic Hungarian party. The coalition is headed by Mr Emil Constantinescu, an academic. Mr Roman's hived off National Salvation Front, since renamed the Democratic Party, won 10 per cent. After the elections, the president tried to put together a grand coalition government to provide a stable parliamentary platform for the difficult reforms required to restructure the economy and create the middle class needed to underpin social progress. The move was repulsed by the 'democratic' opposition, and Mr Iliescu's political allies in the PSDR were obliged to accept a parliamentary alliance with the Socialist Labour Party (the renamed communist party) and two xenophobic nationalist parties. The nationalist bedfellows are the Romanian National Unity Party (RNUP) led by Mr Gheorghe Funar, the anti-Hungarian mayor of the ethnically mixed Transylvanian city of Cluj, and Romania Mare, the ultra-nationalists led by Mr Corneliu Vadim Tudor. The president picked Mr Nicolae Vacaroiu, a former middle-level bureaucrat from the communist central planning bureau, as prime minister. The result has been a mediocre government of drift and indecisiveness, while talent has drained abroad or into the private sector, which has been steadily growing despite the slow pace of formal privatisation. The emergence of half a million small private enterprises is one of the most encouraging signs of renewed economic vitality. But, with political power mainly in the hands of men over 50 brought up in the communist school, foreign investors have held back. International financial institutions have also delayed granting the loans that are so badly needed to finance structural modernisation and infrastructure development. There are grounds for hope that the winter of 1993, when the Leu sank to record levels against the dollar and inflation reached an annual rate of nearly 300 per cent, was a low from which recovery has since begun. If this is so, it is largely due to steady pressure from the international financial institutions and Mr Mugur Isarescu, governor of the National Bank of Romania, who appears to be backed by President Iliescu himself. The central bank's tight monetary policy has led to the emergence of positive real interest rates, a stronger Leu, a sharp decline in inflation and a convergence between the black market and official foreign exchange rate. The convergence has allowed a free-floating foreign exchange system to be established, which will meet one of the International Monetary Fund conditions attached to the granting of a new standby agreement. On April 5 the World Bank board approved a Dollars 175m loan for a petroleum sector project. The bank also disbursed the Dollars 180m second tranche of a structural adjustment loan last month and is prepared to lend around Dollars 400m annually over the next five years. Such lending, which is conditional on continuing privatisation and on market reforms, will be backed up by additional funding from the European Investment Bank and the European bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). The latter has been particularly active in Romania, especially in helping to finance the commercial banking system. At the same time, there are signs of growing foreign investor interest in Romania, which is the second largest country in the region after Poland and possesses considerable natural resources including oil, gas, fertile soil and a largely untapped tourist potential. Romania has an association agreement with the European Union, enjoys a restored most favoured nation (MFN) status with the US and proximity to Middle East markets. It is also a member of the the potentially fast-growing Black Sea economic zone Progress is, however, slow. Only Dollars 800m of foreign equity investment has flowed into Romania over the last four years, small beer for a country which is the largest in the Balkan peninsula. Hungary, with only 10m people but a sophisticated business class and market infrastructure, has attracted more than Dollars 5bn in the same period. Established investors include Shell, Amoco, Enterprise Oil and Canadian Occidental, who are busy exploring both on-shore and off-shore oil and gas deposits, and European and US consumer goods multinationals such as Coca-Cola, Colgate Palmolive and Kraft Jacobs Suchard. The government, prompted by Mr Mircea Cosea, the minister for economic reform, is introducing new legislation which offers especially attractive terms to those investing over Dollars 50m in the country. The first to benefit from the new law should be Daewoo, the South Korean industrial group, which plans to invest more than Dollars 1bn in a series of projects. The biggest is a Dollars 156m car assembly joint venture with Olcit, formerly the assembler of Citroen models under licence from the French car company. But much hangs on the government's ability to convince Romanian entrepreneurs and the international financial institutions and investors that it is fully committed to speeding up the pace of privatisation, reducing the dead weight of over-sized and obsolescent industries and encouraging the emergence of more efficient private farming and privately run service and production companies. With real incomes an average 40 per cent below the already pathetic levels of 1989, and unemployment destined to rise well above the current 11.5 per cent of the work force, the patience and fortitude of ordinary Romanians have been dangerously stretched. A way still has to be found to bring into government and economic management a younger generation less marked by the the communist past and more receptive to the needs of an open society and competitive economy.</p>

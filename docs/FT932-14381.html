			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Awaiting M3 data THE MARKET'S focus will be on events in Germany this week, and in particular on this Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting, writes James Blitz. This week's meeting is the first for three weeks, and there was speculation brewing last week that the Bundesbank would introduce another cut in official rates. Underlining the importance of the council is the fact that the figures for M3 monetary supply in March are also due out this week - and this data may move the Bundesbank in the direction of easing policy again. The February figure for M3 growth was some 0.1 per cent below the Bundesbank's target base, compared to an annualised target range of +4.5 per cent to +6.5 per cent. Another low figure for M3 could give council members an excuse to cut either the Lombard or discount rates. If the Bundesbank leaves policy unchanged, the French franc should be unaffected. The French currency is now trading as comfortably as it has at any time this year in the exchange rate mechanism. Instead, tight German monetary policy might have a depressive effect on the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo both of which have come under selling pressure recently in the ERM. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, did not help the cause of either the peseta or the escudo last week by saying that weak ERM currencies would have to be devalued if high interest rates failed to underpin them. The dollar's exchange rate should also be sensitive to the Bundesbank's decision. The US currency has lost ground against the D-Mark in recent weeks because many dealers believe that the differential between short term US and German rates - which is a little below 5 percentage points  - is unlikely to narrow in the near future.</p>

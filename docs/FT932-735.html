			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Food and Drink: Appetisers A GASTRONOMIC highlight of a visit to Texas two years ago was dinner in the restaurant at The Mansion on Turtle Creek, Dallas, writes Lucia van der Post. It was my first visit to Big Bend country. I knew nothing about south-west cuisine; and as for Dean Fearing, The Mansion's celebrated chef, all I saw was a long-haired young blond who looked more like a rock musician. Despite the alluring menu, jet lag meant that I lacked appetite; but Fearing said he would just bring us little tasters of his favourite things. Delectable titbits followed thick and fast: a soft-shell crab sauced subtly; a filled taco spiced with a vigorous salsa; tortilla salad with little corn fritter; wood-grilled snapper on corn puree. I have forgotten most of the details but well remember the delight. The good news is that Fearing is coming to London's Lanesborough Hotel to cook for a week from July 2-9. In America, he is already the kind of big-name chef that Raymond Blanc and Marco-Pierre White are in Britain. His special accomplishment is to weave together the ingredients and techniques of Asian, Mexican and southern US cooking. The result is spicy, robust and filled with earthy flavours - yet subtle, too. His dishes at the Lanesborough will include warm lobster taco with yellow tomato salsa and jicama salad; wood-grilled red snapper on corn puree with three sauces (black bean, papaya and red chilli); and south-west applejack cheese crumb tart. The dining room and conservatory will provide set-price menus for lunch and dinner: Pounds 20.50 for lunch in the conservatory and Pounds 24.50 in the dining room, while dinner will be Pounds 26.50 and Pounds 29.50 respectively. An American Independence Day brunch in the conservatory on Sunday, July 4, will be Pounds 24.50. The first 20 Weekend FT readers to book for either lunch or dinner (mentioning the Weekend FT) will get a complimentary bottle of either Jordan's Chardonnay or Jordan's Cabernet Sauvignon. Tel. 071-259 5599 for reservations.                         *      *      * Two new names for those in north London fond of good food, writes Nicholas Lander. Beth's is where Keats restaurant used to be at 3a Downshire Hill, NW3 (071-435 3544), with Beth Coventry as head chef. Open seven days a week. More unusual is the first-class traitteur/delicatessen Pagnol, opened recently at 170 Regent's Park Road, N1 (071-586 6988). Open Tues-Fri 10-8, Sat 10-6.                         *      *      * The National Organic Food and Wine Fair takes place at Ryton Organic Gardens, Ryton-on-Dunsmore, Coventry (0203-303 517) on Friday afternoon, July 9, and all day Saturday, July 10.

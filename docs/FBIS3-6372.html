Wisner, in Seoul since Monday, met with Han for an hour-long  talk to evaluate the current crisis over nuclear inspections in  the North and stalled inter-Korean dialogue, said Chang  Chae-yong, director-general of the American Affairs Bureau.    The two officials discussed what to expect next -- either  North Korea meeting the South Korean and U.S. demands or  continuing with its present attitude of refusal, he said.    In case of the latter, Han and Wisner agreed their countries  may need to enter into a new phase of countermeasures.    "Countermeasures are under preparation for such an event,"  Chang said.    Asked whether they talked about deployment of Patriot  missiles and resuming this year's South Korea-U.S. joint  military drill "Team Spirit," Chang indirectly said yes by  adding, "of course, issues related to security in light of the  present situation were addressed."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Selection of Recordkeeping and Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For enforcement purposes, it is necessary to require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records and reports of various parameters at all facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two types of records would be required to ensure compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of facilities required to install controls: (1) Monitoring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results from the most recent performance test and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) results from periods when the measurement of parameters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly deviated from measurements of the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parameters during the most recent performance test. Reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of those periods when monitored parameters were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly outside the specified range would be submitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarterly. These reports are necessary to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control equipment is maintained in good operating condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, owners or operators would be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> keep vapor tightness documentation for marine vessels loaded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on file in a permanent form available for inspection. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner or operator would be required to update the vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tightness documentation at least once per year to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that only vapor tight marine vessels are loaded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owners or operators of affected facilities seeking to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate compliance with the 93 percent emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction standard must maintain records of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of HAP control efficiency and must submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quarterly reports of the source's HAP control efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculated from their actual throughputs. The Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soliciting comment on these requirements. Specifically, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency requests information on the type and method of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation that should be required to assure compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the 93 percent emission reduction standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> J. Solicitation of Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Administrator specifically requests comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> topics discussed in this section. Commenters should provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available data and rationale to support their comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each topic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Subcategories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency has proposed to establish a subcategory for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminals emitting less than 1 Mg/yr of HAP. The Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also requesting comment on whether off-shore terminals and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Valdez Marine Terminal should be placed in separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subcategories under section 112 of the Act. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment regarding whether subcategories should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established for other types of terminals based on particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics of these types of terminals of which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency currently has no information. EPA also requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on whether further subcategorization based on size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is warranted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Offshore terminals.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency does not believe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a facility which is at least one-half mile offshore is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of a land-based contiguous site. Offshore terminals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (both those with subsea lines and platforms) that are part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a contiguous terminal (i.e., offshore terminals less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1/2 mile from shore) present unique regulatory challenges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as the cost and environmental impacts of installing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional subsea lines to carry vapors to land-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment. Size constraints, permitting difficulties, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other concerns may be issues with an offshore control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. The EPA is proposing that offshore terminals exceeding the throughput cutoffs and emission limits be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the proposed regulations and control vapors to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same extent as onshore facilities. The EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soliciting information and comments regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility and cost of controlling emissions from offshore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminals. Comments are also requested on the grouping of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offshore facilities into a separate subcategory with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different control requirements under MACT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Additional subcategory for the valdez marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 29, 1993, the Alyeska Pipeline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service Company (``Alyeska'') sent a letter to the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding this proposed rule (see Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;44, item II&hyph;D&hyph;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 65). In the letter, Alyeska discussed an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory approach that would allow the use of less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent controls at Alyeska's Alaska Valdez Marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Terminal (VMT). Alyeska ``believes that the optimal vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission control system for the VMT is a system that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> captures and recovers vapors from tanker loading, rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than one that incinerates captured vapors.'' Alyeska  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that it can successfully design a vapor recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system for the VMT but intuitively believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction that such a system can achieve will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than the percentage emissions reduction achieved by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly smaller systems and particularly those which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address emissions from refined petroleum products rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than crude oil. Alyeska also believes that a vapor recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system for the VMT is unlikely to meet today's proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of a 95-percent emission reduction of VOC and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP for recovery devices under section 183(f) and section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 112, respectively. In addition, Alyeska states that the VMT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be placed in a separate category or subcategory under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 112(d) because Alyeska believes the VMT is unique  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among U.S. marine terminals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alyeska has also suggested separately (see Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 44, item II&hyph;D&hyph;71) that a recovery device may be available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VMT that could meet a HAP emission reduction requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaching 93 percent but that would likely not meet a VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction requirement above 70 percent. Alyeska suggests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that as it is located in an ozone attainment area in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extreme northern climate where formation of ozone is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical concern, a lesser VOC reduction requirement may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable under section 183(f). The proposed format for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Section 112 emission limit requires the VMT to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all the crude emissions by 95 percent when using a recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device. The EPA requests comments on whether this format  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be changed to allow for a 93-percent reduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions for less efficient control technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA made no changes to the proposed standard in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to Alyeska's letter. However, the EPA is seeking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment on the issues addressed by Alyeska. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, Alyeska intends to provide the EPA with further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation supporting its position before the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public comment period. The EPA will consider this new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information in addition to currently available information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in deciding the final standard. Currently available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information which will be considered is described in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following paragraphs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

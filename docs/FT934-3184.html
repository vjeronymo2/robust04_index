			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Accord in sight with Oslo on oil and gas European Union energy ministers appear close to solving a long-running dispute with Norway, which had threatened to derail EU membership negotiations. The ministers will today seek a compromise on plans to liberalise the licensing of oil and gas exploration. 'Given the amount of progress we have made in the past six or seven weeks, I would be very surprised if it were not possible to do a deal,' said one EU official yesterday. Political agreement today would help clear a potential obstacle to Norway joining the EU. Sovereignty over its natural resources ranks with fisheries and agricultural policy as an issue which could derail entry talks. Norway was not directly involved in talks on the hydrocarbons licensing directive, but it found an EU ally in Denmark. Both countries' systems for granting special privileges to their state-owned energy companies were threatened by the directive. Denmark had hinted it would veto the measure if dissatisfied. It is understood that Norway is now prepared to open new contracts to greater EU competition. Norwegian officials said yesterday they would reserve judgment until they saw the final decision of EU member states. They will also insist that a protocol is added to the treaty admitting Norway to the EU, to stress the importance of its sovereignty over natural resources. Denmark, meanwhile, has agreed to allow open competition into its oil and gas-fields when the existing system comes up for renewal early next century. British and French ministers will today try to ensure that government regulation of the sector is clearly separated from the commercial role of state-owned companies, to prevent covert discrimination. Mr Tim Eggar, the UK energy minister, said the directive would also resolve a long-running dispute and make clear that EU member states have full sovereignty over their continental shelfs. Separately, ministers will have their first discussion of the European Commission's revised proposals on opening EU electricity and gas markets to competition.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast: Video report from Chita </F> Oblast by Aron Bardo and Nikolay Osipov, identified by caption;  figures in brackets denote broadcast time in GMT in hours,  minutes, and seconds]    [Text] [0613.45] [Bardo over video of MiG's on military  airfield, captioned "Chita Oblast"] Apart from the famous air  shows in Le Bourget and Bangkok, these latest MiG-29 fighters  have probably never enjoyed closer attention from journalists.  The Transbaykal Military District Press Center organized a  meeting between the Air Force unit's flight staff and  representatives of the press, radio, and television.    Some 30 combat aircraft have been added to the arsenal of  the  Transbaykal District. The MiG-29 fighters, to which the Russian  Air Force is switching, represent fundamentally new combat  hardware, currently rated as the best in world military aircraft  construction. It appears that we are still capable of producing  something to amaze the planet. And while military analysts are  trying to define the potential enemy and to determine the army's  need for specific types of weapons, the Transbaykal pilots are  carrying out their normal duties and rehearsing air combat  techniques for repelling massive attacks by enemy aircraft.    Incidentally, REUTER recently confirmed the excellent  reputation of this aircraft. It reported that Slovakia received  a shipment of MiG-29's from Moscow in repayment of a Russian  debt.

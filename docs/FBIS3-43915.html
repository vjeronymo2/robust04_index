Indeed, President Henry Konan Bedie received  the Liberian and Malian foreign ministers this morning. Thomas  Bahinchi has the details:    [Bahinchi] Gabriel Baccus Matthews, minister of foreign  affairs of the Interim Government of National Salvation [title  as heard] of Liberia, was accompanied to the head of state's  house by Johnson Tiakwe, charge d'affaires of the Liberian  Embassy in Cote d'Ivoire, and by Dukure Abdulai, President Amos  Sawyer's director of francophone affairs. President Sawyer sent  his foreign minister here to present his condolences to  President Konan Bedie and to brief him on the evolution of the  peace process in Liberia.    [Begin Matthews recording, in English fading into French  translation] President Dr. Amos Sawyer, president of the Interim  Government of National Unity, has sent me here to present his  greetings to His Excellency President Konan Bedie. He also  asked me to present to President Bedie his own condolences and  those of the Liberian people to the people of Cote d'Ivoire for  the immense and irreparable loss that the death of President  Houphouet-Boigny has caused everyone, not only Cote d'Ivoire but  the subregion and the international community. This is why I am  here.    President Sawyer also asked me to brief President Konan  Bedie  on the situation in Liberia -- the evolution of the situation in  Liberia. There are signs that things are not going on well, but  in general -- looking at the general situation -- everything is  going on well and we believe that peace will return to Liberia  and we hope that in 1994 we will be able to hold free and  democratic elections. [passage omitted]    In fact, it was President Houphouet-Boigny who laid the  cornerstone of peace in Liberia. Thanks to him and thanks to  the efforts he made in Yamoussoukro, we were able to make our  present achievements. He always told us to go the school of  patience. It was at his school of patience that we learned to  be patient and to work assiduously. This is why we are saying  that the groundwork and the foundation of peace in Liberia were  achieved through the efforts of Houphouet-Boigny, and Liberians  are very grateful to him for that. [end recording]    It was also to express the pain felt by the government and  people of Mali following the death of President Houphouet-Boigny  that the Malian head of state sent Ibrahim Boubakar Keita,  Malian minister of foreign affairs, Malians abroad and African  integration, to President Konan Bedie. Before assuming this  high government responsibility, Boubakar Keita was Mali's  ambassador to Cote d'Ivoire.    [Begin recording] [passage omitted] [Unidentified reporter]  You are responsible for African integration. After this  devaluation we have just heard about, what solidarity effort  should be made among African countries who have just been shown  the need to count on themselves alone?    [Keita] You are perfectly right. This is a very pertinent  question. I think that this issue is an outright challenge to  us. It has come to remind us of our fundamental duties of  solidarity and concern for one another. I think it was time for  such a decision to be made regardless of the fact that it was  done in such a painful manner. In fact, we have now become more  conscious of the intimate solidarity of our interests hence the  necessity to make sure that today, beyond all petty squbbles and  all sentiments of restricted nationalism, we should pool our  meager resources together for the adoption of a well-meaning  policy of integration and well-deserved complementarity to  enable our people to pass this difficult stage and to envisage  the future with serenity.

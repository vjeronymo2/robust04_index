			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: US retailer lifts profit to Dollars 21.5m Neiman Marcus, the US fashion retailer, lifted net profits by 22 per cent to Dollars 21.5m in its second quarter to January 29. The group was helped by strong sales in its Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores and its NM Direct catalogue division. It said the stores and catalogue had a particularly good Christmas, but there were disappointing performances from the Contempo Casuals and Pastille units, both of which increased losses. Store closings due to the Californian earthquake hindered their performance. Turnover rose to Dollars 650.7m from Dollars 617.2m and earnings per share to 37 cents from 27 cents. For the first half, net income rose to Dollars 36.7m from Dollars 33.7m and earnings per share to 58 cents from 51 cents. Mr Robert Tarr, president and chief executive, said the company expected the usual net loss in the second half.</p>

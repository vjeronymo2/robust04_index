			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Saddam's regime hit as top diplomats flee to UK TWO senior Iraqi ambassadors yesterday inflicted a propaganda blow upon President Saddam Hussein by resigning their posts and joining the Iraqi National Congress, the umbrella opposition group. The two explained in critical and emotional statements that they had fled to the UK because of the 'continuous terror campaign' of the Iraqi regime. Mr Hisham Ibrahim Al-Shawi, a former ambassador to Britain and until yesterday ambassador to Canada, and Mr Hamed Alwan Al-Jubouri, until last week ambassador to Tunisia, said they wanted to live in England with their families, despite possible reprisals. The Home Office said it had granted the two visitor's visas for a six-month stay rather than political asylum, but it would comment no further. Mr Al-Shawi, 62, said the Iraqi regime had 'no other objective but the maintenance of its tyrannical power, notwithstanding defeat, disgrace and total ruin'. Mr Al-Jubouri, 61, accused the regime of dragging the country into two destructive wars. 'In record time, in what seemed like a frightening nightmare, it destroyed a once strong and prosperous country, leaving it morally and financially bankrupt,' he said. Iraqi analysts suggested that the defections indicated a 'peripheral' weakening of Saddam Hussein's regime and another sign of the harsh effects of the sustained economic embargo against Baghdad. Mr Al-Shawi said he had placed Pounds 240,700 of the Ottawa Embassy's operational expenses that 'rightly belongs to the Iraqi people' in a secure trust until after the dictator's downfall. Both diplomats refused to be drawn on the issues that most concern Middle East analysts - Saddam's rearmament programme in defiance of United Nations sanctions and the strength of anti-Saddam opposition within Iraq. Most analysts regard the pair, though distinguished and long-serving, as out of Baghdad's inner circle. Neither had been to Iraq for several years and would not have been privy to the inner workings of the regime. Their actions underlined disaffection within what remained of the diplomatic corps which is suffering from cuts in pay and perks because of Iraq's shortage of hard currency. There was no official reaction from Baghdad but comments from Mr Quassim al-Zuhari, an Iraqi diplomat in the Netherlands, underlined the analysts' views. He rejected any political motives and said the ambassadors 'did not want to face economic privations at home'.</p>

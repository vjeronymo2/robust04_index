			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHARGERS RELEASE MCMAHON  </P> <P> Quarterback Jim McMahon was released today by the San Diego Chargers, less than  a year after the team used a second-round draft choice to acquire the former  Super Bowl star from the Chicago Bears.  </P> <P> McMahon's contract expired earlier this year, and the two sides have been  unable to reach agreement on a new deal.  </P> <P> "It's apparent that Jim's contract situation could become a distraction," Coach  Dan Henning said. "Jim has asked to be released immediately so he can negotiate  with other teams."  </P> <P> McMahon started 11 games for the Chargers last year. He was benched for the  final four games of the season in favor of rookie Billy Joe Tolliver. McMahon  completed 176 of 318 passes for 2,132 yards, 10 touchdowns and 10 interceptions  in 1989.  </P> <P> In addition to Tolliver, the Chargers have three other quarterbacks -- Mark  Vlasic, who joined the team in 1987; David Archer, signed as a free agent last  year; and John Friesz, a University of Idaho star picked up in Sunday's draft.  </P> <P> McMahon never gained the following in San Diego that he had in Chicago, and his  bad-boy image alienated local media. He was harshly criticized by local  columnists after he blew his nose on a reporter in late October.  </P> <P> He refused to apologize for his action, saying, "It was either that or beat the  . . . out of him, but you can't get sued for sneezing."  </P> <P> Henning said today that the contract offered to McMahon contained "possibly a  reduction, or the same salary with escalation through incentives that he could  make a lot more money."  </P> <P> Henning emphasized that the Chargers did not want to relive their experience  with running back Gary Anderson, who sat out last season over salary demands  and was recently traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  </P> <P> "We're not interested in another drawn-out contract dispute as we had last year  with Gary Anderson," Henning said.  </P> <P> Henning said the Chargers' new general manager, Bobby Beathard, "didn't think  that it would be possible" to reach an agreement with McMahon.  </P> <P> Asked about McMahon's performance, Henning said, "We were disappointed in our  season last year and he was only part of it.  </P> <P> "He did a credible job. His statistics were good. . . . I wouldn't say he was a  disappointment."  </P> <P> The Chargers acquired McMahon, 30, in a trade with Chicago last Aug. 18. Though  he was troubled by injuries for much of his time in Chicago, he also was a  proven winner.  </P> <P> From 1984 to 1988, the Bears were 35-3 in games McMahon started, including  their 46-10 Super Bowl victory over New England in January, 1986.  </P> <P> But he was bothered by injuries to his shoulder and knee, missing 23 of the  Bears' 48 non-strike games from 1986 to 1988.  </P> <P> A first-round draft choice by Chicago in 1982, McMahon was a two-year starter  at Brigham Young University, going 22-3 and twice taking the Cougars to the  Western Athletic Conference title.  </P></p>

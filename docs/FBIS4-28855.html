			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports, the United States openly  disclosed recently an attempt to isolate and crush [korip  apsalharyonun] our Republic by force.    At the 9 June hearings of the Subcommittee on Asia and the  Pacific of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs,  Gallucci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, made the  threatening remarks that the United States could impose military  sanctions on our country.    He expressed that the U.S. basic position, that it does not  rule out military sanctions against North Korea, had not  changed. He also repeatedly babbled [chwechossumnida] that if  the UN Security Council failed to pass a resolution on  sanctions, independent [tokchajok] sanctions outside the United  Nations would be possible. He even openly stated that no  DPRK-U.S. talks could take place unless we accepted the  International Atomic Energy Agency's unjust demands.    In the 10 June telephone conversation with South Korean  puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam, U.S. President Clinton had a  conspiracy discussion [mouihago] on imposing multinational  sanctions outside the United Nations and disclosed a plan to  strengthen the U.S. Forces in South Korea on a large scale,  including the early deployment of quick reaction forces.    Meanwhile, the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, conducted  off the coast of Hawaii, a comprehensive combat training,  scheduled to last for approximately one week, began on 10 June.  In reporting on this, Japan's SANKEI SHIMBUN notes that this  exercise is conducted with the United States, Japan, and South  Korea posing as a group and confronting the enemy side and that  this U.S.-Japan-South Korea joint exercise, the first of its  kind, is intended to step up their threat against our country.    The newspaper reveals that U.S. aircraft carriers  Independence and Constellation, which had been participating in  the Rimpac-94 joint military exercise, would immediately be  headed for the waters close to the Korean peninsula after  concluding the exercise.</p>

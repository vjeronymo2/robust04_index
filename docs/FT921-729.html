			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Russians braced for flood of job losses THE Russian government is bracing itself for a flood of bankruptcies and redundancies, as large enterprises grapple with a lack of credit and investment. The government, assisted by the central bank, is determined to stick to a policy of relatively tight monetary discipline, rejecting demands for credits from most enterprises. But it will have to face the political fallout from large job losses and the collapse of some major enterprises. Companies now face interest rates of 50 per cent on six-month loans, and few banks will advance money for longer periods. The central bank has raised its requirements for collateral on loans to commercial banks to 20 per cent. Enterprises are making matters worse by raising their prices beyond the reach of many consumers, instead of lowering them to ensure cash flow. They are trying to maintain prices while demanding new credits from the bank or the government as they did under the old regime. The vast majority are refusing to pay back loans or honour bills, and many are already putting their workers on reduced working schedules. On central bank figures, overdue loans it has made have have soared from Rbs39bn on January 1 to Rbs532bn on March 10. At the same time, institutional mechanisms to channel the savings held by individuals and companies, estimated at Rbs300bn, into profitable investment have not been developed. Mr Georgi Matiukhin, Russian central bank chairman, last month sent an appeal for help in developing such institutions as investment funds and merchant banks to Mr Frans Andriessen, deputy president of the European Commission. Mr Matiukhin was 'concerned about the lack of effective mechanisms to convert savings into productive investments, and the dearth of institutions capable of attracting foreign investments'. Western economic advisers in Moscow are worried by the lack of structural reform undertaken by the government, an omission which could undercut and render useless the stabilisation programme worked out between the government and the International Monetary Fund. The IMF board is due to consider Russia's application to join the fund next week, though agreement could be stalled by a continuing argument about Russia's ranking in the IMF league. Mr Alexander Ruptsov, managing director of the consulting company Vneshconsult and a member of the recently created presidential Council of Entrepreneurs, said yesterday: 'I would think about 80 per cent of big enterprises are now actually insolvent. 'They are not reacting in a market way, by increasing productivity or cutting labour. They are trying to borrow money to pay salaries and no one is paying their bills.' One reason for the refusal by enterprises to lower prices is the expectation of a further dramatic price rise when energy prices are freed, probably in June. The current price of oil, at Rbs350 a barrel, is expected to rise by about eight times to between Rbs2,000 and Rbs2,700 a tonne. One western expert in Moscow said yesterday: 'This is the equivalent of the 1973 oil shock in the west, and more.' Privatisation, the main structural reform, has hardly happened yet, though a 'showcase' privatisation of small enterprises is due to be unveiled in Nizhni Novgorod, Russia's third city.</p>

The meeting is hosted by the  Iraqi Teachers' Union and will last five days.    The President leader Saddam Husayn deputized Vice President  Taha Yasin Ramadan to attend the council meetings on his behalf.    Upon the arrival of the vice president, the band played the  national anthem. The council meeting opened with a recital from  the Koran and an invocation in memoriam for our and the Arab  nation's martyrs.    This was followed by a speech by the vice president. He  said:  "I have the pleasure to act on behalf of President leader Saddam  Husayn, may God preserve, in opening the meetings of the Arab  Teachers' Union Council. I have the pleasure of conveying to you  the greetings of his excellency and his wishes to you and for  the success of your conference."    The president's representative added: "Convening your  conference in Baghdad, the Baghdad of Arabism and victory,  during the critical times your nation is passing through,  abounds with evidence and proof that confirms that the sons of  Arabism always rally in support of their lofty national  objectives in which they believed, adhered to, and struggled for  their sakes throughout the ages. All the treasonous and  treacherous methods have failed to thwart them, nor aggression  and betrayal did. On the contrary, the wider the circle of  treason and conspiracy becomes the more resolved and the  stronger they become.    Vice President Taha Yasin Ramadan added: "The enemies, the  Zionists, the imperialists, and the henchmen from among some of  the traitorous Arab rulers and midgets believe that stepping up  their conspiracies and aggression against Arab nations will  achieve their ulterior objectives and designs for them. These  people have forgotten that they all have joined hands against  one particular Arab country, namely strong and powerful Iraq, in  order to obstruct its path and inhibit its leadership."    He said that they believe that destroying all the economic,  educational, service, cultural, and social structures, which the  Iraqi people have built will break their resolve and will force  them to abandon their principles and raise their hands in  surrender.    He added: "It would perhaps benefit your conference to  become  acquainted with President leader Saddam Husayn's personal  interest in teachers' affairs and the educational sector,  beginning with kindergarten and ending with university. It is  also to get acquainted with the resolutions passed by the  leadership providing benefits for the teachers and university  professors in order to raise the educational standards of  schools and universities and realize a compressive educational  progress. This is in addition to creating the right educational  atmosphere for our students. It is to be borne in mind that the  conditions of the siege and its difficulties did not diminish  the concern to continue to promote education and knowledge."    The secretary-general of the Arab Teachers' Union made a  speech in which he said: Your brother members of the Central  Council of the Arab Teachers' Union are honored to be holding  their meeting on this pure soil, the soil of proud Iraq, the  Baghdad of Arabism, and the Baghdad of challenge under the  banner "God is great."    He added: "Your brother teachers throughout the Arab arena  have stood with you in support of your cause, which is the cause  of us all. Iraq has been the target of treacherous aggression by  30 countries [al-thalathini, reference to coalition forces] and  of the shameful stands the Security Council adopted against Iraq  with its unjust and iniquitous resolutions against the steadfast  Iraqi people."    Fahd al-Shakrah, chairman of the National Union of Iraqi  students, made a speech on behalf of popular organizations  welcoming the Arab teachers participating in the conference. He  wished the conference success in the country of the triumphant  leader Saddam Husayn.    He was followed by Hatim al-'Ukaydi, doyen of Iraqi  teachers,  in which he said the glorious mother of battles will forever  remain a bright page in our contemporary history.    He added: "The educational sector in Iraq, Iraq of  education,  Iraq of knowledge, and Iraq of inspired leader Saddam Husayn,  has enjoyed special care in that the great revolution has  provided this important and vital sector with all the means of  success and comprehensive scientific progress. It also charted a  bright future for this proud nation."    The republican anthem was then played marking the end of the  opening ceremony of the conference. Separate meetings were then  held. The first meeting was held last night to discuss research  papers submitted to it.    Those who attended the opening ceremony included heads of  popular organizations, the governor of Baghdad, and a large  number of teachers.    13305</p>

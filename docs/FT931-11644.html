			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Mulroney says he may not go PRIME MINISTER Brian Mulroney of Canada has moved to quell speculation that he will resign before a general election later this year. However, his message, to his Progressive Conservative party caucus and to several possible contenders, falls short of a commitment to stay. Mr Mulroney is said to have told MPs that in the absence of an announcement of his resignation, they should assume he is staying on. Some political observers still think it possible that the prime minister, in office since September 1984, will quit in a month or so. Tories continue to lag far behind the opposition Liberals in opinion polls, and Mr Mulroney's personal popularity is at rock-bottom. The latest Gallup poll gives Liberals the backing of 49 per cent of decided voters, compared with 19 per cent for the Tories.</p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / IMF and Philippines fail to reach accord THE PHILIPPINES yesterday concluded negotiations with the International Monetary Fund without reaching agreement on a successor programme to the one that is due to end next month. An IMF team has expressed doubts over growth targets in the government's new plan which had been presented to the fund for financial support. It had proposed a three-year, programme designed to push the economy toward double-digit growth rates by the middle of the 1990s. The IMF's extended fund facility would be tapped for the programme's financing. The IMF over the past decade has extended credit support for a series of 18-month programmes for the Philippines. The tight conditions that accompanied them have been criticised for having constricted growth opportunities for the economy. Under the proposed medium-term programme, the Philippines is targeting an overall growth of 4.5 per cent this year, rising to about 10 per cent towards the end of the present government in 1998. The IMF team that is due to end its Manila visit today sought a lower growth target of 3 per cent at the most. The talks, according to the two panels, will be reopened in April. However, the IMF, according to officials close to the negotiations, may not be inclined to resume the talks unless the Philippines government is able to secure congressional approval of new tax measures as a precondition. Also, the IMF wants final implementation of power rates increases that were announced last year by the government, but ordered temporarily frozen by the Supreme Court after oppositors filed a legal suit was filed against them.</p>

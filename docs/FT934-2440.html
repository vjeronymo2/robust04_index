			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Arts: Little Red Riding Hood - Pantomime The pantomime season at The Theatre Royal, Stratford East kicks off with Little Red Riding Hood which has picked up The Three Little Pigs somewhere on the way to granny's house in the forest. This is a traditional, enjoyable and, at two hours flat, a child-friendly panto: no lewdness and only a bit of cartoon violence. But it is still short of the laugh riot it could be. The amalgam of characters includes a Wolf in the Noel Coward lupine mould, all furry fury plus smoking jacket, lisp ('Wed Widing Hood'), an occasional song and an overall excuse: 'Ah, it was a kwhy for help.' Then there is Nigel the Woosterish woodsman hewing down the forest in plus fours and weilding the axe like a sand iron; he is the love interest for Red, and sings a parody of Luther Vandross so good that the object of his desires notices, 'You've been eating those mushrooms again . . . Maybe we could be pen friends'. Red herself is formidable in a gingham tablecloth of a dress alongside her father who seems to have clothed himself in chessboards. Of course there is an apple-cheeked granny, some crackling good porky piggies who manage a fine trotter jive, a couple of wandering Cockney 'barrah persons' and a Liverpudlian dog which needs bolstering with a special 'Bravery song' from the audience. The opposition are the Wicked Witch (who turns out to be Red's long lost abducted mother) and her sidekick Earwax who are, luckily, powerless beyond the storybook forest set. The panto comes alive when the characters turn to the audience. They ask what is going on, or taunt them, or in the Wolf's case, are blown off stage by them. The music (Anthony Ingle) keeps the atmosphere going, especially with a louche Wolf theme in the tracks of Henry Mancini's 'Panther' and a good James Brown number for the Witches. The script is spattered with gobbets of Shakespeare, Hollywood ('The company of wolves') and pop reference ('I'm too sexy for my fur' says the Wolf). The actors seem to enjoy the evening, especially when they have something to work with and react to. The first casualty on the audience side was an infant escorted away mewling and puking for an early bath after five minutes of the first half; but happily she was the only dissenter in an evening of genial warmth and good spirits.

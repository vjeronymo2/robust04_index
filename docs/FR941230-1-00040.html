			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Use <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . For purposes of determining the amount of private payments, all related uses of proceeds of an issue by one person are treated as one use. For example, proceeds used to make a grant and a loan to the same person to be used to construct a facility are aggregated in determining the portion of the loan repayments taken into account as private payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allocation of payments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allocations among issues <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If a payment is made for a facility financed with two or more issues, that payment must be allocated among those issues according to the relative amounts of proceeds of each of those issues that are allocated to that property. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Repayments of equity <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . A payment from a private business user of property may be allocated first to repay the issuer for any equity investment of the issuer in that property (that is, amounts invested by the issuer that do not, directly or indirectly, involve an expenditure of amounts borrowed). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Private security <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This paragraph (d) contains rules that relate to private security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Security taken into account <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The property that is the security for, or the source of, the payment of debt service on a bond need not be property financed with proceeds. For example, unimproved land or investment securities used, directly or indirectly, in a private business use that secures a bond provides private security. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pledge of unexpended proceeds <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Proceeds qualifying for an initial temporary period under &sect;1.148&hyph;2(e) (2) or (3) or on deposit in a reasonably required reserve or replacement fund (as defined in &sect;1.148&hyph;2(f)(2)(i)) are not taken into account under this paragraph (d) before the date on which those amounts are either expended or loaned by the issuer to an unrelated party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Secured by any interest in property or payments <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Property used or to be used for a private business use and payments in respect of that property are treated as private security if any interest in that property or payments secures the payment of debt service on the bonds. For this purpose, the phrase  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any interest in <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is to be interpreted broadly and includes, for example, any right, claim, title, or legal share in property or payments. However, in order for an interest in property or payments to be taken into account as private security, that interest must secure the payment of debt service on the bonds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Payments in respect of property <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The payments taken into account as private security are payments in respect of property used or to be used for a private business use. Thus, to be taken into account as private security, payments need not be made by the private business user. Therefore, payments made by members of the general public for use of a facility used for a private business use may be taken into account as private security (for example, payments by persons using a facility that is the subject of a management contract that results in private business use). Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph (d)(5) and paragraph (d)(6) of this section, the rules in paragraph (c) of this section apply to determine the amount of payments treated as payments in respect of property used or to be used for a private business use. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Allocation of security among issues <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If any property or payments are taken into account as private security for two or more issues that are equally and ratably secured  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (parity bonds), <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the property or payments securing those issues must be allocated among those issues on a reasonable basis that takes into account the relative amounts of debt service on each of the issues. For this purpose, any of the ratable allocation methods specified in &sect;1.148&hyph;6(e)(6) (relating to allocations of commingled reserve or sinking funds for arbitrage purposes) are treated as reasonable. For bonds other than parity bonds, property or payments that are taken into account as private security (but not as private payments) are fully allocated to each issue secured by the property or payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [George Suffert editorial: "Dignity of the Republic at </F> Stake"]    [Text] One can expect tears, some teeth-grinding, and a few  momentous words around the coffin of Yann Piat, the Parliament  representative for the Hyeres constituency and Republican Party  member. The police and judges will be urged to waste no time,  to hunt down the killers and above all, those who sponsored the  murder of a woman whose integrity and courage were acknowledged  by all. Then everyone will go back to their own occupation. It  is a very old flaw in our miserable society: The dead are  solemnly buried, and then soon forgotten.    As for the Hyeres tragedy, the situation may -- alas! --  turn  out to be exemplary. A few hours after the murder, the public  prosecutor said that "everything seems to indicate that it was  done by professionals." No doubt this is true; one would only  wish it will not be made into an alibi.    By definition, professional killers slay their designated  victim without passion but with accuracy; and they make sure  they leave no evidence behind. Millions of detective motion  picture and TV serial viewers know all about such details.  However, there is no hard and fast rule; there are mediocre  professionals and careless assassins. Sometimes, also, chance  interferes with action. We shall see whether the investigation  progresses, whether names can be placed on shadowy figures.    It may be necessary to go even further. This murder is not  only a physical act, it is also a message meant for the whole  political class, for judges, for policemen, for journalists.  Whether the murder's sponsors belong to the French naturalized  Mafia or to the scum of political circles does not make much of  a difference. In France today as in Italy yesterday, someone is  trying to scare people. There are issues which politicians  should refrain from investigating -- drugs especially. Because  the drug trade is a state within states; because millions of  people make a living out of it; because it brings unlimited  wealth to seemingly blameless individuals.    What is a mere Parliament representative in the face of this  huge global industry? Of course, nothing supports this  explanation right now. But it is exactly what must be on the  mind of other deputies who have been meticulously working toward  the defeat of the Mafia and drug traffickers. Once again, the  two motorcycle men who killed the Hyeres representative on a  back road were in fact taking aim at France's whole political  class.    This is an absurd threat, though. Politicians are not easily  terrorized. While they are often cowardly before their  electors, in front of threats they are not. In any case, they  will keep in mind Yann Piat's face. Her death may sign the  beginning of a confrontation between the Mafia and our country's  political system. As we all know, no mercy may be expected from  killers; one would like to see the Republic demonstrating equal  determination. After all, its own dignity is at stake.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tanks but no thanks THE LEASE to my flat requires me to contribute to the costs incurred by the landlord in 'all provision of services referred to in the second schedule.' The second schedule refers to: The maintenance of the main structure and, in particular, the roof, main walls and timber foundations and main drains, gutters and rain-water pipes of the building, including all party walls and structures, sewers or drains used in common. The maintenance of the gas and water pipes, drains, sewers electric cables and wires and apparatus, in and under the building, and used in common. The water tanks on the roof were replaced recently and I am being asked to contribute to the cost. In 1987, I provided my flat with its own independent water tanks. Since then, I have not used water from the tanks on the roof. Am I required to pay my contribution or can I decline to do so because of the particular wording of the clause above? You are still required to make the contribution for which the lease provides, even if you have opted out of using the common tanks. The position is the same as if the owner of a flat on the first floor decided to use the stairs only and then sought not to contribute to lift maintenance. The position would be different if there were only two flats in the building. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

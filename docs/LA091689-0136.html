			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SANTA MARGARITA SHUTS OUT JURUPA VALLEY FOR FIRST WIN  </P> <P> Santa Margarita High School won its first varsity football game on Friday, a  41-0 victory over Jurupa Valley in front of about 1,200 spectators at  Saddleback College Field.  </P> <P> Santa Margarita (1-1) lost its first varsity game last week, to Trabuco Hills,  50-14. This is the third year the school has been open and it has yet to have a  senior class.  </P> <P> Sophomore running back Josh Ireland and junior quarterback Trevor Yankoff  proved to be enough offense for Santa Margarita, playing only the first half  because of the lopsided score. Santa Margarita led, 31-0, at the half.  </P> <P> Ireland scored two touchdowns, one on a 77-yard run in the second quarter.  Yankoff completed five of eight passes for 136 yards and a touchdown.  </P> <P> Santa Margarita led 7-0 at the end of the first quarter on Ireland's one-yard  run and put the game away with 24 points in the second quarter.  </P> <P> The first score came on a 50-yard pass reception by Eric Brown. Ireland's  77-yard run, a 32-yard field goal by Travis Lucero, and Louis Pavlovich's  20-yard run after recovering a fumble completed the second-quarter scoring.  </P> <P> Santa Margarita's final 10 points came in the third quarter on a one-yard run  by Ryan Zalta and Lucero's 37-yard field goal. VINCE AGUL  </P></p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Survey of Mexico (10): Puzzle for farmers - National land-titling programme Deep in some of Mexico's most isolated and poorest regions a strange sight can often be observed: a handful of well-qualified government technicians, equipped with laptop computers, portable satellite dishes, plus prisms on a tripod, can be seen calculating the precise geographical location of a small piece of land of no obvious economic value. Surrounding them will be a group of destitute farmers, trying to work out what they are doing. The topographers - some 14,200 in total - are working on the world's most ambitious land-titling programme. Employed by the government statistics, information and geography institute, they hope to have calculated within the next few years the exact geographical co-ordinates of the boundaries of some 4.6m individual plots of land - about 102m hectares - and 4.3m houses, within the nation's 30,000 ejidos or communal farms. The programme, known as Procede, began after the government changed Article 27 of the constitution over two years ago, giving for the first time members of ejidos - known as ejidatarios - the legal right under certain conditions to sell their plots, rent them out, form associations with agro-businesses, or borrow money using their plots as collateral. The ejidos cover about half of Mexico's national territory, and the 15m ejidatarios and their families more than a sixth of the population. The ejidatarios need land titles if the constitutional changes are to have the desired impact, since at present it is often unclear who owns what land. Without legally recognised land titles, they are not able to sell or rent their land easily, or from associations, or borrow money, as permitted by the law. Once Procede is fully implemented, ejidatarios should have for the first time secure and transferable property rights to their land and homes. While not enough to transform the ailing fortunes of Mexico's agricultural sector, the establishment of property rights is expected to encourage investment in the countryside - uncertainty over ownership rights has make farmers cautious about spending a lot of money improving their land - and promote social peace, by reducing conflicts over land ownership. 'Procede is the instrument to make the changes to Article 27 effective,' says Mr Carlos Jarque, the head of the government statistics institute who is overseeing the technical implementation of the programme. 'Without the titling, the constitutional changes will not have the intended impact of improving the welfare of ejidatarios.' Procede may, in addition, reduce the power of local political bosses by making it difficult for them to take away land from farmers with whom they are in conflict. In the past, local leaders have used the lack of clear property rights, and the government's legal powers to redistribute land, as a way of keeping control of farmers in the countryside. The government technicians move into an ejido to measure land co-ordinates only when the members decide in a assembly to incorporate into Procede, and have agreed between themselves - in front of a special government magistrate  -on where rough boundaries between plots lie. If there is no such agreement, agrarian courts are called into to settle the disputes. Since the courts may take years to resolve a case, which delays the hand-out of titles for everyone, there is a powerful incentive for the ejidatarios to reach agreement - and, so far, most have. Under one method of measurement, the topologists calculate the co-ordinates of the outer boundary of the ejido by standing on several points of it and sending signals to an overhead satellite, and taking from the satellite a reading of the boundary's geographical co-ordinates. A less accurate but faster method involves taking aerial photograph of ejidos, and then asking ejido members to mark the boundaries between their own plots, homes, and communal lands. A scanner reads the marked lines between plots, and records co-ordinates on a computer disk. Data gathered from both schemes is put into a digital computerised national agrarian register which will eventually include land boundaries of all 30,000 ejidos, plus 4.6m individual plots and 4.3m homes within them. Individual titles for plots and homes are printed from the digital agrarian register, which has information not just on the location of the ejidos, but what it is grown there. Mr Jarque says that the programme is unprecedented in its scope and precision, with no other country having anything as big as this computerised registration project - 'it's a pioneering programme for its size, complexity, and for the use of advanced technology,' he says. Nevertheless, Procede has been criticised by some for being unnecessarily complex and long-winded, and for taking too long to complete. So far, about 30 per cent of ejidos have had the boundaries of their plots measured, and members of 15 per cent of ejidos have received their titles - less than the government had hoped for this stage. The programme may not be completed until near the end of the decade.</p>

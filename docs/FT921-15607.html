			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets: Foreign holdings in Mexico hit record FOREIGN investment in the Mexico stock market reached a record Dollars 19.05bn in 1991, an increase of 348 per cent from 1990, according to the Mexican stock market authorities. The very steep rise in foreign investment reflected the Mexican stock market's 118 per cent increase in dollar terms last year; 17 international equity offers by Mexican companies which initially raised over Dollars 3bn - of which Telmex accounted for Dollars 2.2bn; and new investment in existing shares of around Dollars 6bn. Almost three-quarters of the foreign investment - or Dollars 14.15bn - is held in American Depositary Shares traded in New York, of which about 85 per cent is invested in Telmex. Another Dollars 2.96bn of foreign investment is held in non-voting 'B' shares of companies, and Dollars 1.6bn in the Nacional Financiera trust, which allows investors to buy shares not open to foreigners. Investment in the Mexican Fund, listed in New York, rose 82 per cent to Dollars 500m during 1991.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WOODSIDE RIDES EARLY BREAK TO HIS 1ST SPORTSMAN MAIN WIN AT SAUGUS  </P> <P> For three consecutive weeks at Saugus Speedway, the driver who started the  Sportsman Division main event in the pole position had led all the way.  </P> <P> That pattern changed Saturday night in front of 3,528.  </P> <P> This time the pole-sitter, Tom Eurton of Valencia, couldn't finish the first  lap, pulling into the infield.  </P> <P> Larry Woodside of Saugus, starting in the same row as Eurton on the outside,  led the rest of the way for his first Sportsman main-event win at Saugus.  Woodside, who entered the night 11th in the points standings, held off repeated  charges from Dave Phipps of Simi Valley, who is third in points.  </P> <P> So, all it takes to win is having a choice starting position?  </P> <P> "Yeah, and experience," said Woodside, competing in his first full year at  Saugus at the Sportsman level. "Plus Dave Phipps is a good enough driver that  he wasn't going to push me out of the way. He could have several times."  </P> <P> Phipps finished second, followed by Keith Spangler of Northridge and John Cran  of Reseda. Brian Kelly of Arleta, who is not among the points leaders, passed  Arnold Fagan of Palmdale on Lap 10 and held on to win the 25-lap Street Stock  main event.  </P> <P> Eurton won the 15-lap, figure-eight main event.  </P> <P> Dave Blankenship of Reseda, who had the fastest qualifying time, put in a solid  performance, starting in the 14th position and finishing second. John Kirby of  Ventura finished third.  </P> <P> Garrett Yamada of North Hollywood won the 12-lap Mini Stock event, taking the  lead on Lap 2. Rudo Sandoval of Van Nuys finished second, followed by Rock Ake  of Moorpark.  </P> <P> Tim Staubs of Littlerock won the 15-lap Street Stock semi-main event, passing  Jeff Harris of Thousand Oaks on the second lap. Also advancing to the main  event were Rick Winakur of San Gabriel, Craig Jensen of Sunland and Brian  Polzin of Canyon Country.  </P> <P> Trophy-dash winners included John Covan of Simi Valley (Sportsman), Blankenship  (Street Stock), Sandoval (Mini Stock) and Craig Rayburn of Simi Valley (figure  eight).  </P> <P> Mitch Thompson of Sylmar won two Street Stock heat races. Other heat-race  winners included: Phipps and Herb Hill of Simi Valley, and Steve Burdett of  Canyon Country (Sportsman); Greg Benner of Whittier, Ray Mood of Granada Hills  and John Lindley Jr. of Sylmar (Street Stock); Larry Durm of Northridge  (figure-eight).  </P></p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / People: The Institute of Management The Institute of Management, which claims to be Europe's largest management body, has chosen James Watson (above) as its new chairman. He succeeds Sir Derek Hornby, who presided over the amalgamation last year of the British Institute of Management and the Institute of Industrial Managers. James Watson, chairman of NFC, has long been a member of the IM, and firmly believes that improving the quality of management is the key to future prosperity. He sees his main function as chairman of the IM to help ensure that 'high standards of management education are available to managers'. Watson is likely to be more 'hands on' than some previous chairmen. Unlike many of the big names that have preceded him, (Sir Brian Wolfson, Sir Peter Parker, and Sir Bob Reid have been among more high-profile past chairmen) James Watson does not have his fingers in many other pies. He holds no other non-executive positions, and plans to devote about a day a week to the IM. Watson is a trained accountant who has been at NFC since 1977, where he has been finance director and deputy chairman. With 30,000 employees, he says he has insight into what it takes to manage well. 'I believe I'm a good manager. I wouldn't be doing it otherwise,' he says.</p>

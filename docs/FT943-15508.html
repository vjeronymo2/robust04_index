The bank said in its first derivatives report: 'Interest rate derivatives have the largest market share, measured by amounts. The exposures stemming from derivatives lead to relatively limited credit risks for the major Swedish market participants.'

It said the derivatives market was characterised by trading primarily through leading Swedish banks and derivatives exchanges.</p>

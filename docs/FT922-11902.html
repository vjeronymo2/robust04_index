			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / UK Company News: Austin Reed lower after reorganisation costs AUSTIN REED, the clothing manufacturer and retailer, yesterday reported an 11 per cent fall in profits and a cut in the final dividend after trading was badly affected by the recession and the Gulf war. Pre-tax profits for the year to January 31 fell from Pounds 3.6m to Pounds 3.2m on sales down 5 per cent at Pounds 67.9m. This was after Pounds 800,000 of reorganisation and redundancy costs. Earnings per share fell from 9.5p to 7.9p and the company is recommending a 3p (6.5p) final dividend, bringing the total for the year to 6p (9.5p). Mr Barry Reed, chairman, said the dividend was cut to ensure dividends were at least covered by earnings. 'I have not had to cut a dividend in 20 years,' Mr Reed said. Last year, when the dividend was only just covered by earnings the company had thought things would get better. Mr Reed now believed it would be a long haul out of recession for the retail trade despite an election result that was favourable for business. 'Profitability will continue to be under pressure until at least the second half of the year', he said. 'Sixty per cent of our business is in London and the south-east. Regent Street is up, but the three City stores are still running behind last year and recession has gradually spread north to Leeds and Scotland in the last year.' The manufacturing business was also being hit by falling exports as recession bit in continental Europe. During the year the retailing division increased margins and reduced overheads. Sales only fell 2.5 per cent from its 37 continuing retail outlets. The three manufacturing companies - Austin Reed International, Chester Barrie and Stephens Brothers - were all hit by lower retail sales and turnover fell 15 per cent. Lower capital expenditure and falling interest rates helped reduce the interest charge from Pounds 2.9m to Pounds 2.4m and gearing fell from 27 per cent to 21 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORMER MILKEN ASSOCIATE TO TESTIFY FOR U.S.;  </P> <P> SECURITIES: EX-DREXEL JUNK BOND EXECUTIVE GARY WINNICK HAS BEEN ORDERED TO  APPEAR. HE WILL RECEIVE IMMUNITY.  </P> <P> Federal prosecutors have added another prominent close associate of Michael  Milken to the list of government witnesses who will testify against him.  </P> <P> Gary Winnick, 42, the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert's convertible bonds  department, was given a federal court order last week granting him immunity  from prosecution and compelling him to testify against Milken and others in the  criminal racketeering case pending against the former Drexel junk bond chief.  </P> <P> Winnick's lawyer, Gary P. Naftalis, confirmed that Winnick "received compelled  immunity under court order" and said that "under the court order, he has to  answer questions when he's asked."  </P> <P> Sources close to the case said Winnick had been seeking a deal with prosecutors  for some months because of fear that he might become a target of the federal  investigation. The sources said the government has subpoenaed records from  Winnick. But Naftalis said Winnick had never been notified that he was a  target. The lawyer said any testimony that Winnick gives will be as a result of  the court order obtained by prosecutors and not because of a voluntary  agreement to cooperate.  </P> <P> When Winnick left Drexel in 1985, he became head of Pacific Asset Holdings  Limited Partnership, a Beverly Hills-based partnership in which Milken holds a  large stake. The partnership was established to invest in junk bonds and  leveraged buyouts.  </P> <P> Sources said prosecutors expect that Winnick will testify about allegations  that Milken in effect gave kickbacks to managers of mutual funds to induce them  to buy junk bonds of doubtful value. The inducements are said to have included  valuable warrants -- the right to buy stock in a certain company at a certain  price within a fixed period of time.  </P> <P> Naftalis refused to comment on which subjects the government hopes Winnick will  testify about.  </P> <P> Milken, his brother, Lowell, and former Drexel trader Bruce Newberg were named  in a 98-count racketeering indictment returned in March, stemming from alleged  securities fraud and insider trading at Drexel. Milken resigned from Drexel in  June and has formed his own company, International Capital Access Group.  </P> <P> A federal grand jury in New York is expected to return a new, expanded  indictment in the case, although some sources say it may not be finalized until  January. As reported, the indictment is expected to contain additional charges  and name additional defendants, including Warren Trepp, Drexel's chief junk  bond trader; Alan Rosenthal, a former head of Drexel's convertible bond unit,  and former Drexel bond salesman Peter Gardiner.  </P> <P> At least half a dozen former close Milken associates have agreed to testify  against him or are believed to be close to an agreement. Among those who have  already agreed are Cary J. Maultasch, a former Drexel stock and bond trader;  Charles Thurnher, who kept financial records in Drexel's Beverly Hills junk  bond office; Terren Peizer, a Drexel trader, and James Dahl, a former Drexel  bond salesman.  </P> <P> Lawyers for Milken have declined to comment on the investigation or Winnick,  and they have charged that leaks about the continuing grand jury inquiry are  unfair and will make it difficult for Milken to get a fair trial. Prosecutors  also have declined to comment on the investigation.  </P></p>

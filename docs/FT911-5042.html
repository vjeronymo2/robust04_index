			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Pretoria loses its golden parachute: The gold-mining sector, South Africa's traditional source of succour, is in decline The adage that South Africa has advanced politically by disaster and economically by windfall has been turned on its head. As the country starts to rid itself of the political burden of apartheid, a painful recession is gripping its traditional source of succour - the gold-mining industry. The industry faces its worst crisis since gold was discovered on the Witwatersrand more than a century ago. High real interest rates in the main western economies and the proliferation of new financial instruments to protect the wealthy against inflation have combined to undermine gold's safe-haven status. There is increasing concern that recession in the west will reduce jewellery sales, which account for 60 per cent of gold consumption. The precious metal has also failed signally to respond to international political turbulence over the past two years. Forward selling by producers, including the Soviet Union, has helped hold back any rise in the price of gold. Reluctantly, local mining houses have accepted the message - what is bad for the world is no longer good for South Africa's main export. Gold will not be coming to the country's rescue. Indeed, the outlook for the industry is increasingly bleak. In the past fortnight Gencor and Anglo American, the country's two largest mining houses, have announced respectively the closure of the Stilfontein mine and the end of a big exploration programme in the Potchefstroom gap in western Transvaal. The latest results from Gold Fields of South Africa (GFSA), another leading mining house, showed a 7.5 per cent fall in after-tax profits to R219.8m (Pounds 45.7m) for the first quarter of this year. Last week Amgold, holding company for Anglo American's gold investments, announced a 29.2 per cent drop in investment income to R240.7m in the 13 months to March. Gold is a declining force in the economy. Although it still accounts for 25 per cent of the country's exports, its contribution to gross domestic product was down to 8.8 per cent in 1990. More revealing is the fall in tax receipts - from 10.7 per cent of government revenue in 1981-82 to a mere 0.9 per cent in the 1990-91 tax year. Some observers, including Mr Barend du Plessis, minister of finance, view the weakening of gold's influence as likely to help develop the rest of the economy, which they believe has been adversely affected by over-reliance on the metal. Yet the implications of the industry's predicament are far-reaching, particularly in the labour market. Employment in the gold mines has shrunk from 525,000 in 1987 to 440,000 in 1990. A further 40,000-50,000 jobs are likely to be shed this year. With the gold price at R933 per ounce (Dollars 343 at yesterday's exchange rate), only 60 per cent of South Africa's gold would be produced at a profit (if one takes into account capital expenditure). Yesterday the price, at R979, was not far off that level. This haemorrhage of jobs from an industry which has offered mass employment to unskilled workers for decades has powerful social and political implications in a country with an unemployment rate of about 40 per cent. It must also be seen against the backdrop of an economy which declined in 1990, with flat or very modest growth predicted for 1991. The explanation for the industry's straitened circumstances lies in a simple cost/price squeeze. Over the past three years, gold has hovered at about R990 per ounce, while South African inflation has been running at 14 per cent a year. This means there has been a deterioration in the real rand gold price of about 36 per cent in three years. The costs of mining gold have been rising for decades. But in the 1970s, the industry's worsening financial position was disguised by the rising dollar price of gold: it rose on average from Dollars 35.75/oz in 1970 to Dollars 612/oz in 1980. During the 1980s, the exchange rate came to the rescue. The rand/dollar rate rose from 0.78 to 2.59 over the decade, thus helping the rand gold price to more than double from R477/oz to R992/oz over the same period. The chickens came home to roost in the late 1980s. The traditional relationship between a strong gold price and a strong rand, and vice-versa, collapsed as the industry faced weaker prices without any compensating fall in the value of the rand. After peaking at the Dollars 800/oz level in 1980, gold declined to an average of Dollars 317/oz in 1985. Since then it has been in the Dollars 350-450/oz band. The subsequent fall in profits has forced a fundamental shift in the way gold is mined. In the days of rich ore bodies and a healthy gold price, the benchmark of achievement was quantitative: how many tonnes of ore a mine milled. The premise was that however low the grade of ore being mined, it paid to extract it. That premise has now changed. A weak gold price has meant that many lower-grade seams cannot be worked profitably. The focus has thus become qualitative - what ore can profitably be extracted? Mining houses now focus on cost per kg gold produced rather than cost per tonne of ore milled. Activity is focused on the higher-paying parts of a mine. The September quarter last year was the first time in 14 years that the industry had raised the average grade of ore mined. This approach was pioneered by Gengold, the gold arm of the Gencor group. The effect has been dramatic. In 1988 Gengold's mines produced 89 tonnes of gold, employing 93,000 people; in the year to June, it expects to produce 81 tonnes of gold with fewer than 60,000 people. The industry's richest mines are now being managed along these lines. Mining better grades and shedding labour - which accounts for about half of a mine's costs - are the most obvious ways of increasing profitability. Other strategies being employed include: Switching staff from support jobs, such as administration and finance, to direct production activities; Recycling commodities, such as timber, which is used in large quantities for underground support purposes; Keener negotiations with suppliers, which are already charging different prices to different mines for the same goods, depending on the mine's profitability. Managers hope this flexibility will extend to wage talks, where there has been a reluctance on the part of miners' representatives to accept a link between wages and jobs. Mr Jerry Majatladi, of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), disputes the link, saying it would only apply if the industry paid higher wages. Unions allege that mine wages for unskilled or semi-skilled workers are lower than in the manufacturing sector, the reverse of international patterns. This qualified the extent to which the NUM was prepared to trim its wage demands, says Mr Majatladi. Some believe the industry has reached such a sorry state that the government should move in to help it. Mr Lloyd Pengilly, gold analyst at stockbrokers Martin and Co, argues that it would be irresponsible for Pretoria to allow a weak gold price to inflict long-term structural damage on such an important industry. Others disagree. Mr Mike Tagg, general manager at Gold Fields, says the state's role should be kept to a minimum. 'If a mine needs funds it must go to its shareholders or bankers.' Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, says that it is self-defeating for unprofitable mining activities to be subsidised because this encourages overproduction. In turn, this prevents the price from rising and thus renders less profitable those mines which could survive without subsidy. He believes a change of perception 'of the supply of gold as big and growing and inexhaustible' is essential to boost the price. Mines which cannot produce profitably must be closed. A further concern is that while the industry continues to mine about 100m tonnes of ore a year, exploration expenditure has been cut to the bone. Two weeks ago Anglo American, the country's largest mining house, decided to stop prospecting in the north section of the Potchefstroom gap. Comments Mr Pengilly: 'The growth side of the business has stopped. We're not replacing the tonnage we're taking out.' The reason is simply that most of South Africa's better greenfields prospects are deep, costly and unviable at current prices: in a typical prospect mining would start at about 3km below surface and cost R3bn to get into production with a 10-year lead-time before the first bar of gold was poured. It is unlikely that any such mine will be started in the next decade unless there is a doubling of the price. In spite of all the bad news, the industry still has its optimists. Mr Maxwell notes: 'Inherent in the South African gold mining industry is an optimism that the gold price will improve.' For the moment, however, what is dominating attention is 2,000 jobs lost at Stilfontein. With more closures to come, the government will come under increasing pressure to intervene as the effects of the industry's troubles ripple wider.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Venezuela seeks private capital to pull aluminium out of the red - Although they are among the lowest-cost producers the country's smelters are finding profits increasingly elusive THE VENEZUELAN government has announced that it will carry out a major reorganisation of the state-controlled aluminium sector, selling some assets outright and seeking new private investors for existing companies. The assets to be sold include shares held in aluminium product manufacturers in Belgium, Central America, Puerto Rico and Venezuela. Aluminium is Venezuela's second-largest source of export revenues, after petroleum. However, despite being among the world's lowest cost producers of primary aluminium, the country's government-controlled aluminium smelters are generating embarrassing amounts of red ink. Last year the state aluminium sector lost a total of USDollars 168m and losses this year are projected at about Dollars 218m. The sector also was in the red in 1991. The state-controlled aluminium group is made up of Venalum (a smelter with the world's largest installed capacity, owned 80 per cent by the Venezuelan government and 20 per cent by a group of Japanese industrial companies); Alcasa (a smelter with two laminating plants, owned 92 per cent by the government and 8 per cent by Reynolds International); Interalumina (an alumina facility; 98.7 per cent government-owned and 1.3 per cent Alusuisse); plus a bauxite mine (Bauxiven) and an anode producer (Carbonorca), both wholly-owned by the state. Except for Alcasa and Venalum, the other companies are expected to earn profits this year. Venalum has installed capacity for producing 430,000 tonnes a year of primary aluminium (1992 output was 375,214 tonnes), while Alcasa's capacity is 210,000 tonnes a year of primary metal and products (1992 output was 192,928 tonnes of primary aluminium and about 34,000 tonnes of products). Mr Francisco Layrisse, minister of state and president of the Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana, the state holding company that controls Venezuela's largest steel, aluminium, mining and hydroelectric enterprises, says that the government is attacking the aluminium problem by seeking private investors to take over the biggest money loser, Alcasa; selling off some Alcasa assets; and merging three other companies. The CVG also wants to find international investors for other parts of the industrial group, including iron ore, steel, and gold mining. Alcasa, operating with only two of its four pot lines, is the sector's most serious problem. While urgently (perhaps the word should be desperately) seeking an international investor to take over the company, the CVG is trying to sell one of the company's two laminating plants outright and will sell Alcasa's shares in other aluminium companies in Venezuela and abroad. Alcasa is a partner with Reynolds in Aleurope, a laminating and extruding concern located in Belgium, and holds shares in Alunasa (Costa Rica) and Alruss (Puerto Rico). It also has several joint ventures in Venezuela with international companies, including General Motors, Reynolds, and BWA. In addition, the CVG is merging all operations of Venalum, Interalumina and Bauxiven and creating a single management team. It hopes to save money by reducing executive personnel and integrating company strategies and operations. The CVG has been looking for private partners for Alcasa for some time, but the gravity of the company's situation now has added a sense of urgency. In the past, the Venezuelan government has been able to cover losses at Alcasa. Now, however, the government is itself suffering from a large fiscal deficit and cannot afford to finance losses at Alcasa or other state companies. Although the government has not said so, it may be forced to close down Alcasa entirely if heavy losses continue and a white knight fails to appear. Like other world aluminium producers, Venezuela has been hit hard by declining international prices. In the case of Alcasa, for example, the smelter has older, less efficient pot lines (the first line was installed in the 1960s) and suffers from operating and financial problems. During a labour dispute earlier this month, workers walked off their jobs on one production line, forcing the company to close down the entire line until 1994 for major repairs. Basically, Venezuela's two large smelters began to post strong losses after government export incentives were eliminated in 1989-90. They were never able to exploit fully their great advantage: low-cost electric power from the Guri hydroelectric complex located nearby.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin last night held  consultations with a number of cabinet ministers on Palestinian  plans regarding the establishment of institutions in Jerusalem  and creating facts on the ground.    Qol Yisra'el's political affairs reporter says the ministers  were told that the Palestinians are seeking, among other  measures, to establish an economic authority and a university.  They also want to have Orient House -- the unofficial PLO  headquarters -- granted special status and they want to deploy  their own security operatives in the area.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: WESTLAKE'S FISHER TAKES NEW POST  </P> <P> Bob Fisher, former athletic director at Westlake High, has taken over as  principal at Santa Paula High. Fisher, who replaces Hank Johnson, was hired  last week and assumed his new post Monday. Jack Loritz succeeded Fisher at  Westlake.  </P> <P> Fisher, 52, leaves the Conejo Valley Unified School District after 28 years of  service, including 16 years as an administrator, the past four as the Westlake  athletic director. He had been transferred this summer from Westlake to Conejo  Valley High, a continuation school.  </P> <P> Fisher attended UCLA on a basketball and track scholarship after graduating  from Hart High in 1956. He played for John Wooden at UCLA and was a teammate of  Denny Crum, the Louisville coach. He also ran track with Olympian Rafer  Johnson.  </P> <P> Santa Paula celebrated its 100th anniversary last year and the town passed a  bond issue last spring to allocate more funding for education. Fisher, whose  first duties include finding a basketball coach, said he is excited about the  job.  </P> <P> "This is a really great community with a lot of potential," he said. "They've  been a little down in athletics but we expect to improve that."  </P> <P> A Glendale all-star team has advanced to the finals of the junior (ages 11-12)  division of the softball Little League World Series in Kalamazoo, Mich.  </P> <P> Glendale (2-0) will play Tallmadge, Ohio (2-1) at 3 p.m. today. Glendale can  claim the title with a win over the team it beat earlier in the tournament,  6-4.  </P> <P> A Glendale loss would force a deciding game between the two teams Saturday.  Glendale beat Naples, Fla., 2-1, to advance to the final.  </P> <P> Another Glendale team also is still alive in the senior division for players 13  to 15. That team defeated Duncan, British Columbia, 10-2, on Thursday. The  Glendale seniors (2-1) play Georgetown, Mich. (1-1) today at 1 p.m. The winner  advances to Saturday's final.  </P></p>

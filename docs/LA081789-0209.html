Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> TRUMP TO OWN NEW BASEBALL TEAM  </P> <P> Donald Trump, former owner of the New Jersey Generals in the United States  Football League, said he plans to become owner of a New York-area team in a  proposed new baseball league.  </P> <P> "I have agreed to become a part of it, to work with them and make this league a  great success," Trump told the New York Times on Wednesday. Organizers of the  proposed eight-team league hope to begin operations next April.  </P> <P> Trump, who also organized the Tour de Trump bicycle race and several  championship boxing cards, is the first person to acknowledge that he will own  a franchise. He said the team will play in northern New Jersey.  </P> <P> "I see it as a very viable league," Trump said. "We'll have a long-term  contract with a major television network or a number of major networks,  including cable."  </P> <P> A source close to the league said other teams are expected in Washington, Los  Angeles, Miami, Denver, Vancouver, Portland, Ore., and New Orleans or San Jose.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Xiamen, May 10 (XINHUA) -- The Xiamen Taigu  Aircraft Engineering Co. Ltd., jointly funded by Britain,  Singapore, Japan and China, signed a contract with Xiamen  University to set up a special course in plane repair.    According to this contract, Xiamen University is to train  internationally recognized advanced engineering specialists for  modern business aircraft repair to meet the needs of the company.    In recent years, with the increasing demand of advanced  management personnel and special technical experts, many foreign  investors have approached Chinese educational institutes for  training their staff.    Along China's coastal areas, schools and the educational  funds supported by foreign investors are increasing. Many  universities have cooperated with foreign investors in training  their staff by various means. Prominent universities like  Beijing, Qinghua and Fudan Universities are the first choices  for advanced management personnel training.    It is calculated that the expenses in training advanced  management staff in China is only about one percent of that in  the United States.    At present, among the already operating foreign-funded  enterprises, eighty percent of their management staff members  are Chinese. Largely trained with funding from abroad, many  have been assigned to other affiliations in other countries.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Tight guard as Haiti MPs weigh amnesty A special session of Haiti's parliament, protected by US soldiers armed with machine guns, got under way yesterday to consider an amnesty law for the country's outgoing military regime. The parliament had less than two hours' debate after a ceremonial opening, and the business of drafting the amnesty law will resume today. In a fresh burst of violence, a pro-democracy demonstrator was shot and wounded by a Haitian paramilitary gunman just a few blocks from the parliament building. Witnesses said the man was shot in the chest as a crowd advanced towards the headquarters of a paramilitary group. They said nervous members of the paramilitary group, fearing the crowd was seeking revenge, fired to disperse the demonstrators. The Haitian legislature's meeting was the first in over a year, an achievement that seemed to owe more to US efforts to secure the parliament buildings and fly some exiled deputies into Port-au-Prince than the resilience of the democratic institutions. The Haitian deputies appeared deeply divided on whether to endorse a wide-ranging amnesty for crimes committed by the regime that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide three years ago. 'I can't give an amnesty to assassins,' said one of 12 pro-Aristide senators as he was flown in from Miami with an armed guard. But others said only a broad amnesty would allow Haiti to move forward. Crowds outside the barbed-wire-ringed parliament building were boisterous and cheered returning deputies. But inside the assembly, relations were strained. As Mr Jean-Louis Firmin, president of the Senate and National Assembly, welcomed the return to constitutional order and thanked President Bill Clinton for making the re-opening of parliament possible, one deputy erupted: 'It is a shame. It is a national embarrassment.' The special session was convened by Mr Aristide, who is still in exile in the US. The military leadership under General Raoul Cedras is expected to step down once the law is passed, opening the way for Mr Aristide to return to office. The deployment of US troops around the parliament buildings was a sign of the significance the Clinton administration is placing on the amnesty law, which would not only mark the end of military rule but could pave the way for reconciliation of Aristide supporters and Cedras loyalists. The conspicuous US presence has led to criticism in the Haitian press that the nation's democratic institutions are being violated. As a result, there is to be no US army presence inside the chamber. The 82-person Chamber of Deputies has not mustered the necessary 42 members to achieve a quorum in 16 months, as many members were in exile or in hiding. President Aristide, in convening parliament, has called on the assembly to debate not only the amnesty but also six other pieces of legislation, including the separation of police and army powers. Meanwhile, continued looting of humanitarian foodstores elsewhere in Port-au-Prince was a further cause of concern to US officials yesterday. A US embassy spokesman confirmed that the surge in pillaging showed the breakdown of local policing. 'Clearly we are seeing some police stepping back and letting the law and order situation evaporate,' he said.</p>

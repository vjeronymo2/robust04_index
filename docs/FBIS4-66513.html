			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nassim Kouba: "Lowering of Customs </F> Duties"--first paragraph is LIBERTE introduction]    [Text] Mr. Khelifi, director of the Information and  Documentation Center of the General Directorate for Customs,  explains the new measures. A package of changes that should  allow customs to fully play its role in the country's economy  and simplify procedures for users....    Cognizant of the vital importance of lowering customs  duties,  the customs services have opted for new customs clearance  procedures for users. Elimination of the compensatory tax under  the new "customs code" should give the system more flexibility.    That tax is, first of all, fiscal, duty based, and covers  unpaid imports. In fiscal terms, the new system will eliminate  the compensatory tax per se and integrate its provisions  respecting certain classes of goods into the "customs code,"  customs tariffs, the "turnover tax" (TCA), or the excise tax  code.    The measure providing for integration of the compensatory  tax  affects tobaccos and beers. It will also affect domestic  consumption duties (wines, alcoholic beverages, lubricants),  surety duties on all items made of precious metals, value-added  tax on certain products and merchandise not subject to specific  fiscal measures, and finally customs duties.    In this optic, and as a stimulus to the country's productive  apparatus, a reduction of the tax burden is planned for imports  of raw materials and semimanufactures, to "oxygenate"  enterprises and give them the ability to safeguard resources  needed for economic recovery.    Along the same lines, and the better to support domestic  production, a hike in customs duty rates for products made in  Algeria will be effected. This modification will also include  substitution of a specific tax over and above the compensatory  tax for certain nonessential and luxury products to be listed in  an executive decree.    The move to give the regulations (customs code) greater  flexibility entails elimination of all obstacles to users and  makes for better harmonization with international norms, so the  state is not left to bear the burden by itself. The second  measure, which is customs-related, will cover updating of  previous duty thresholds.    Its first objective is to increase exemptions from duties  and  taxes on changes of residence and on nonresidents; authorized  ceilings will be raised from 800,000 Algerian dinars[DA] to 1  million for students and trainees, and to DA1.5 million for  other nonresident nationals. Also, the maximum value of objects  in the possession of travelers that may be summarily confiscated  upon discovery is increased from DA1,000 to DA30,000. These  so-called trivial items consist of perishable goods and clothing  articles that customs may give to hospitals and hospices.    The old law basically forced travelers to appear in court  for  any merchandise exceeding DA1,000 in value, which created an  enormous caseload for customs officials. The reduction of  caseload should spare the customs service a great many headaches.    The second part of this package will give customs a more  powerful deterrent against unlawful capital exports and give  Treasury increased powers to recapture duties. This measure  would contribute to the fight against unlawful capital flight.    It involves extension of the obligatory security deposit,  hitherto required only for temporary importation of materials  and equipment for transformation, repair, etc., and for  temporary exports.    This measure was needed owing to constant abuses in this  domain, with users failing to live up to the terms of their  declarations. Up to now people enjoyed the use of duties and  taxes belonging to the state. In effect, the state was  supporting "one-way inflation." In some cases, products were  never repatriated; in others, materials themselves were never  returned. By way of example, some trawlers whose owners had made  claims for temporary reimbursement never returned to the country.    In some cases, trawlers that had been granted temporary  reimbursement were operating outside Algeria's territorial  waters without there being any means of monitoring to stop these  practices. However, this measure will not be applied  universally, since enterprises of respectable financial standing  will be allowed to post unsecured bond.    Utilization of banking products to execute discount  settlements under the new customs regime is another example of  meeting the customs service's concern for increased efficiency  in handling customs duties.    A first new product has already been introduced. This is  interest on duty credit and delayed interest. Use of this  product allows the state to avoid bearing real losses due to  high rates of inflation. It is an effective contribution that  will help resorb inflation by having everyone contribute.    In addition to eliminating unfair competition against banks  and contributing to better instrumentalization of the market  economy, the new procedures provide incentives for importers to  move merchandise out of depot sites more quickly.    With regard to disputes over vehicles seized at the border  in  cases where they were used for purposes of fraud, the customs  administration announces it will no longer confiscate vehicles  automatically, so as not to inconvenience ordinary citizens.    Risks of vehicle depreciation, the cumbersomeness of  bureaucratic procedures, and the desire of the customs service  to spare citizens unnecessary problems were the principal  motives behind revision of this statute.    The third measure, as previously noted, has to do with  unpaid  imports. The first point relates to revision of the list of  items that cannot be imported or exported.    This involves only products capable of effecting the  Algerian  market as a whole. It was decided to give domestic enterprises  the opportunity to get organized before the country makes the  transition to a market economy.    Also, to ensure the country has an adequate food supply,  exports of food staples have been suspended. The unofficial  exchange rate, notably vis-a-vis Morocco (1 dirham to 8 Algerian  dirhams), is a factor that encourages outflow of foodstuffs from  the country. [sentence as published]    Harmonization of customs laws and regulations should help  protect the domestic economy and achieve a balance between  taxation and social protection. But it remains to be seen how  they will work in practice.</p>

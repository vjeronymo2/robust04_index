			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCULPTURE MAKES A SPLASH AT BREA MALL;  </P> <P> ART: CITY'S 90TH ART IN PUBLIC PLACES PROGRAM PIECE IS A STAINLESS STEEL  FOUNTAIN CREATED BY BELGIAN ARTIST POL BURY.  </P> <P> The first sculpture by an internationally known artist commissioned for Brea's  Art in Public Places program was installed in Brea Mall's Central Court on  Wednesday. The untitled fountain sculpture by Belgian artist Pol Bury is the  90th work of art in the 15-year-old program.  </P> <P> The fountain, which is expected to be fully operational by the weekend,  consists of 15 stainless steel spheres mounted on columns. The action of the  water circulating through the columns makes the spheres rotate, an activity  given added luster by the small, mirrorlike concave area in each sphere.  </P> <P> Early in his career, Bury, 67, was an abstract painter. In 1953 he made his  first movable compositions -- flat black and white planes that could be fitted  together different ways to produce different patterns. A few years later he  added electric motors, which he called "form mixers," to his pieces.  </P> <P> The movement in these sprightly and sensual works tends to be almost  imperceptible. Bury once described one of his pieces as "two slownesses gently  grazing each other."  </P> <P> His work was included in the 1964 Venice Biennale and has been the subject of  numerous museum exhibitions in the United States and Europe. But in recent  decades the sculptor -- who lives in Paris and is married to an American -- has  been eclipsed by artists working in more contemporary modes.  </P> <P> A compact man with the drooping eyes of a basset hound, Bury was busy  supervising a work crew on Wednesday. Asked if he found the mall an odd place  for his art, he said he had made another shopping mall piece a decade ago in  Short Hills, N.J.  </P> <P> "There are not so many differences between this and the public art of the  street," he said. He prefers putting the work in public sites rather than  museums. Why? "More people."  </P> <P> Brea's public art program requires developers of all residential, commercial  and industrial projects above the $500,000 level to fund a permanent work of  art for the project site. Proposals are reviewed by city departments and an art  advisory committee.  </P> <P> The decision to commission Bury was made by the New York corporate office of  Corporate Property Investors (CPI), owners of the mall. Ken Glowacki, CPI's  director of development, said the piece cost "more than $100,000."  </P> <P> Early next month, also as part of the Art in Public Places program, CPI will  install a fiberglass sculpture by Parisian artist Niki de St. Phalle in the  mall corridor between Robinson's and Nordstrom.  </P></p>

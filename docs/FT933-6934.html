			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Asda sees threat from discounters FOOD discounters and US-style warehouse clubs pose a serious threat to large UK superstore operators, Mr Archie Norman, chief executive of Asda, warns today. Mr Norman said in June the 'halcyon days' of UK food retailing were over, with the industry unable to support planned store openings without a downturn in margins and sales growth. On 'In Business', to be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 tonight, he warns that superstores are wrong to assume discounters operate in a different part of the market. 'The reality is we're all selling food. The warehouse clubs will affect the food retailing industry as will the discounters. They'll sure as hell have an impact and will attract a lot of attention because they are a very dramatically different style of retailing.' The three largest superstore chains, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway, have denied that discounters such as Aldi, Netto and Shoprite, and warehouse clubs - which sell goods at very low prices from huge sheds - will damage their business. But they have joined forces to try to overturn planning permission granted to US warehouse club operator Costco at Thurrock, Essex, prompting allegations of collusion and calls for an Office of Fair Trading investigation. Sir Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll, owner of Safeway, says on the programme he 'wouldn't feel uncomfortable' about an OFT investigation. He denies supermarket chains have colluded to fix prices.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / World Trade News: BA seeks to enter China air ventures British Airways is among a growing number of large western airlines stepping up efforts to participate in the modernisation of the fast-expanding Chinese air transport industry through joint ventures and other partnerships with Chinese carriers. BA is already co-operating with China Southern, the Guangzhou-based airline, and is in talks with Shanghai-based China Eastern Airlines, Mr David Holmes, BA's director of government and international affairs, said yesterday. Like other international carriers, BA now sees more promising long-term opportunities in China than in Russia where its project to start a new airline called Air Russia has been placed on hold indefinitely. In contrast to Russia, China offered an administrative framework to conduct daily business while in Russia it was currently difficult to advance on any project until the political situation stabilised, Mr Holmes said. The Civil Aviation Administration of China and Chinese airlines have also become increasingly conscious of their technical weakness and the urgent need to improve safety, punctuality and efficiency standards in the face of explosive domestic air traffic growth which is averaging 20 per cent a year. This week's crash of a China Northeast Airline's Russian-built Tupolev Tu-154, in which 160 people died, has added to the urgency of overhauling the country's aviation system. It was China's worst air disaster. China is also keen to commercialise its state-controlled airline industry and is proposing to sell stakes to foreign investors in its 33 regional carriers. It has also recently suggested the possibility of listing some of the bigger carriers on the New York Stock Exchange in an effort to secure outside financing. BA is not currently pushing to take a stake in one or more Chinese airlines but its longer-term ambition is to negotiate a marketing agreement with a carrier such as Chinese Eastern to co-ordinate services at Beijing airport. BA, however, recently hosted a visit of Chinese aviation officials to the UK to discuss the possible way forward for Chinese airline privatisation. With China Southern, which operates a fleet of Boeing aircraft, BA, which is also a big Boeing operator, has formed an engineering joint venture. It also recently sold China Southern some computering services. BA sees pilot training as another area of possible co-operation with Chinese carriers. BA, which flies twice a week from London to Beijing and is keen to double its weekly services, is anxious to establish a stronger foothold in China at a time when some of its main international competitors are intensifying co-operation with the Chinese airline industry. Lufthansa of Germany already operates six flights a week to Beijing and is involved in a large aircraft maintenance centre in the Chinese capital. Singapore Airlines has earmarked China as one of its three main growth areas for the next decade together with India and Vietnam. It has taken a 40 per cent stake in the company handling ground services at Beijing airport and another 40 per cent stake in Beijing airport's inflight kitchen group. Singapore Airline's engineering subsidiary has also invested in a 10 per cent stake in the Xiamen joint aircraft engineering venture which includes as partners Cathay Pacific and Japan Air Lines. Its recently formed leasing company has leased a Boeing 767 to China Southern.</p>

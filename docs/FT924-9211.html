			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK car sales The 8.2 per cent rise in October UK car registrations compared with the same month of 1991 is simply too good a figure to represent the start of a trend. True, there are structural reasons to expect some demand. Cars put on the road in the boom that followed the end of the last recession are now about 10 years old and heading for the scrapyard. Those sold at the peak of the market in 1989 are approaching the end of their normal fleet life. But there have been blips in the statistics before, and dealers are certainly not displaying the sort of excitement which suggests October's figure may be repeated soon. Part of the explanation may well be an unusually large amount of pre-sale registration by manufacturers anxious to offload existing models before the new rules on catalytic converters enter force in January. As for other sales, it is not known at what price they were transacted. Lower interest rates are unlikely to kindle much additional retail demand given the prevalence of below-market financing packages. Nor, in the absence of a general revival of confidence, are buyers in much of a rush to beat devaluation-inspired price increases. That leaves much of the trade struggling for lack of margin. Vauxhall's price increase announcement yesterday smacks more of desperation than of a firming market.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 12--The Union of Poles in Lithuania  (ZPL), a socio-political organization, will not be allowed to  take part in the local government elections to be held in  Lithuania this autumn. The Lithuanian parliament took a binding  decision on this question on Thursday.    The parliament on Thursday did not agree to vote again on an  amendment to a bill under which only political parties  registered under the law on parties will take part in the  elections. The amendment had been first forwarded to the  parliament by Social- Democrats. The ZPL Sejm faction tabled a  motion to take a vote on the amendment again.    The ZPL members expressed their disapproval of the decision.  The authors of the clause envisaging that only political  parties should take part in the elections deny that it is  allegedly aimed against Poles, but the Polish community received  it like this. Bitterness is all the greater as the decision  came soon after signing the Polish-Lithuanian treaty.    ZPL Deputy Artur Plokszto said the decision was absolutely  incompatible with present tendencies in Europe to de-politicize  local governments. He said the ZPL now would have to decide  whether to register as a political party or whether to give up  participation in ruling in regions inhabited by Poles. The  decision is to be made by the ZPL main board on Friday.</p>

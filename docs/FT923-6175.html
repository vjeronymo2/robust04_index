			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Malaria defies drugs: British Association for the Advancement of Science MALARIA IS becoming resistant to all known drugs, Dr Bridget Ogilvie, director of Wellcome Trust, warned. Evidence gathered over 10 years by a team of scientists based in Thailand and funded by Wellcome Trust demonstrates that anti-malarial drugs are working less effectively in Thai patients. This is because the malarial parasites are mutating and becoming resistant to drugs. The scientists predict that many malarial cases will be untreatable within five years, leading to millions of deaths. Drug-resistant malaria is already widespread in Saharan Africa. Even quinine, an anti-malarial used for over 500 years, is failing. 'I am confident these results are correct. They show a progressive and frightening diminution in the efficacy of the drugs, and it's difficult to interest drug companies into developing new drugs because the research is so expensive,' Dr Ogilvie said. One approach towards developing a therapy was outlined by Dr Adrian Hill, a Wellcome research fellow based in Oxford, who studies the way nature copes with malaria. The body's immune system protects against malaria - cells invaded by malarial parasites become tagged with digested portions of the parasite called peptides, labelling them as infected and targeting them for destruction. Dr Hill said that it was hoped to have in the next five years a vaccine based on a specific peptide 'which will give useful, if not complete, protection'.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market steadier despite Opec worries OIL PRICES moved up slightly yesterday, but the underlying tone remained weak as traders saw no evidence of output cuts from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and demand in Europe stayed low. North Sea Brent crude oil for February delivery was 10 cents higher at Dollars 17.65 a barrel in a fairly quiet market. Severe storms in the North Sea continued to affect oil production and Statoil, Norway's state oil company, said Norwegian production was half its usual 2.3m barrels a day. In addition, Mobil, an offshoot of the large US company, said it had cut production from its 110,000 b/d Beryl field by a half. Production has been reined back because of the difficulties in docking tankers in the gales to pick up the oil. But in spite of problems in the North Sea, market observers say there is still too much oil in the world market. Traders have seen few efforts on the part of Opec countries to staunch their flows of oil in accordance with a plan to cut output agreed in November. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, the industry newsletter, estimated last month that Opec had produced more than 25m b/d compared with the agreed ceiling of 24.58m b/d. It said yesterday that the only cuts evident were price cuts. However, Saudi Arabia has signalled its willingness to reduce its own output at the organisation's February meeting if others cut back too.</p>

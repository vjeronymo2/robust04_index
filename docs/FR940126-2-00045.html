This allowance is a part of the total award, not in addition to the award. The local administrative allowance is intended for use by LROs or Local Boards and not for reimbursement of the program or administrative costs that a recipient's parent organization (its State or regional offices) might incur as a result of this additional funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The Local Board may elect to use, for its own administrative costs, all or any portion of the 2 percent allowance. The decision on distribution of the allowance among LROs rests with the Local Board. No LRO may receive an allowance greater than 2 percent of that LROs award amount unless the LRO is providing the administrative support for the Local Board and it is approved by the National Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE / ANTHONY PERRY: THROUGH WIND AND RAIN -- EVEN IF IT'S 19  CENTS SHORT  </P> <P> William Holmes says he has the Constitution on his side, and so the Post Office  be damned.  </P> <P> Holmes, 41, a General Dynamics/Convair engineer living in Escondido, says he  discovered recently that the 1961 law setting first-class postage at 6 cents  has never been changed. Forget that 25-cent stuff.  </P> <P> Since November, Holmes has sent out 200-plus letters, each with only 6 cents  postage and a stamp that says: "First Class Mail. 81 U.S. Statute L. 613. No  Postage Due." He became a Libertarian a few years back and it changed his life.  </P> <P> "We are tired of administrative organizations making law and ignoring the  supreme law of the land, the Constitution," Holmes said.  </P> <P> Postal officials have heard it all before. Across the land, the Post Office has  gotten 250 court orders against other postal protesters using the 6-cent  scheme.  </P> <P> "It's an old scam," said Ken Boyd, spokesman for the Post Office in San Diego.  If Holmes persists, he'll wind up in federal court, Boyd said.  </P> <P> But the 6-cent flap points out a little-known chink in Post Office armor: the  use of correct postage depends more on voluntary compliance than the public  thinks. All but three of Holmes' letters were delivered undetected.  </P> <P> Sorting machines detect whether postage is being used (by sensing the ink on  stamps) but cannot tell whether the postage is "short-paid." If the letter  carrier doesn't catch it, it doesn't get caught.  </P> <P> Holmes vows to take the 6-cent issue to the Libertarian state convention later  this month in Mission Valley.  </P> <P> He's also decided to stop paying federal income taxes. He found a law that says  only residents of the District of Columbia need to file a 1040 form.  </P> <P> If he thinks the Post Office is unforgiving, wait until he meets the Internal  Revenue Service, said Boyd.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Cross to Bear  </P> <P> It depends on how you look at it.  </P> <P> * The local branch of the American Civil Liberties Union is suing the city of  La Mesa to make police officers remove patches on their uniforms showing the  Mt. Helix cross as part of the city emblem.  </P> <P> This is the same ACLU that finds nothing wrong with nunchakus, now being used  by police against uncooperative anti-abortion protesters. The San Diego City  Council votes $80,000 to increase the Police Department's stockpile of  nunchakus, and the ACLU is silent.  </P> <P> Why do I feel I'm more likely to have my arm busted by a martial-arts weapon  than a shoulder patch?  </P> <P> * The state attorney general's office in San Diego is trying to ensure that  Roger Hedgecock's felony conviction is upheld and Hedgecock goes to jail.  </P> <P> Howard Wayne, a deputy attorney general in San Diego, is running for Assembly.  He hired Tom Shepard, Hedgecock's convicted co-conspirator, as a political  consultant, and Bob Meadow, labeled by the grand jury an unindicted  co-conspirator, as a pollster.  </P> <P> Wayne sees nothing incongruous in this. He says he is not handling the  Hedgecock case and, besides, Shepard and Meadow are not defendants in the case.  </P> <P> Law and order and ethics in government are major issues in his campaign, he  says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Say Pretty-Please  </P> <P> Words, words, words.  </P> <P> * More on the Great City Hall Lockout.  </P> <P> San Diego Councilman Bruce Henderson has asked a council committee to discuss  Deputy Mayor Abbe Wolfsheimer's decision to reduce reporters' access to City  Council offices.  </P> <P> Wolfsheimer this week had the security code changed on the door to the  10th-floor offices.  </P> <P> Henderson is always eager to tweak Wolfsheimer. He issued a statement saying  reporters "don't need a note from their mother or the deputy mayor" to talk to  him.  </P> <P> * The California Highway Patrol could use San Diego's Grammar Policeman.  </P> <P> The CHP form for stolen vehicles asks whether the vehicle's transmission is  automatic or manuel.  </P> <P>  * Bumper sticker spotted in Del Mar: "Free Nancy Hunter."  </P> <P> * In case you thought such thinking was dead in this slow-growth era.  </P> <P> Sign at a shopping center construction site in El Cajon: "Watch Us Grow."  </P></p>

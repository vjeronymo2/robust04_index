			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 6 Apr (INA)--The National Command of the  Arab Socialist Ba'th Party has emphasized that Iraq--with its  civilized depth, distinguished pan-Arab role in the past and  present, liberation achievements, and delicate Arab awareness,  as well as the courage of its Ba'thist vanguard and the  ingenuity of its leader comrade struggler Saddam Husayn--has,  under the Ba'th Party's banner, renewed its position as a center  of strength and a preventive shield for the Arab nation.    In a statement on the 47th anniversary of founding the Ba'th  Party, which will be marked tomorrow, the National Command said  that the responsibility for safeguarding understanding and  promoting the militant state to the highest level requires the  masses' ranks to be equipped with militant thinking and a new  awareness of both the nation's battle and its historic depth and  civilized essence.    The National Command explained that the Arab nation's forces  can foil the schemes of fragmentation and internationalization  of domestic problems, and can also mobilize the nation's  resources to lift the embargo on Iraq.    The National Command also stressed that the jihad in the  Mother of Battles was a slogan for adhering to principles and  insisting on entrenching basic values through liberating the  people and moving international relations to a new level free  from the spirit of trusteeship and the domination of world  colonialism. It called on Arab parties, political  organizations, trade unions, intellectuals, and literary and  artistic people as well as all parts of nation's body to wage  the battle of fateful civilized conflict by maintaining the  spirit of resistance shown in both the Mother of Battles and the  intifadah.</p>

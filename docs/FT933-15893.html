			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Pressure on Italy over steel THE European Commission will today renew pressure on Italy to fall in line with Community plans to restructure the ailing EC steel industry. Concern is growing in Brussels that Italy's reluctance to amend its plans to restructure Ilva, the state steel producer, could derail EC steel policy. To try to force Italy's hand, the Commission is likely to open a formal procedure today to recover state subsidies allegedly being pumped into Ilva. Commissioners will also debate proposals intended to stop the Italian state continuing to finance Ilva's losses, which one Brussels official estimated yesterday at Ecu150m (Pounds 116m) a month. The Italian government says Ilva is not receiving state aid as such and refuses to make the capacity cuts which Brussels is demanding in return for the subsidies. Brussels is already blaming Italian stubbornness - in particular, Ilva's alleged attempts to block an independent study of the company - for the probable postponement of this month's crucial meeting of EC industry ministers. That meeting was supposed to decide on a handful of highly sensitive state aid cases in Spain, east Germany and Italy. It would lay the ground for formal agreement on a wide-ranging overall plan for capacity cuts.</p>

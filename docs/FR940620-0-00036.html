			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Standard of Discipline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the proposed standard of discipline, only violations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;10.34 that are willful, reckless, or a result of gross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incompetence will subject a practitioner to suspension or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disbarment from practice before the IRS. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations further provide that a pattern of conduct is a factor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that will be taken into account in determining whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practitioner acted recklessly or with gross incompetence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commentator suggested that the standard of discipline for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;10.34 be amended to provide that only a pattern of conduct will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject a practitioner to discipline. This suggestion would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permit practitioners to violate the new return preparation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard of Circular 230 at least once without being subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discipline by the Director of Practice. Treasury does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe it is appropriate for Circular 230 to countenance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improper conduct, or to establish a more lenient standard of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discipline in the return preparation context than in other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Circular 230 contexts not requiring a pattern of conduct to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose discipline. Accordingly, this suggestion was not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commentator recommended that a general reasonable cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and good faith exception be expressly incorporated into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard of discipline for &sect;10.34 of Circular 230. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commentators also asked for a more limited reasonable cause and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> good faith exception for reasonable reliance on the advice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another practitioner. The existing standard of discipline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminates the need for an express reasonable cause and good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> faith exception in that willful, reckless, or grossly incompetent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations of Circular 230 are inconsistent with reasonable cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and good faith. Therefore, these suggestions were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> II. Contingent Fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed regulations ban contingent fees for preparing a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return except in the case of certain claims for refund. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed regulations, a practitioner may charge a contingent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fee for preparing a claim for refund if the practitioner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably anticipates, at the time the claim is filed, that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim will be denied by the IRS and subsequently litigated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> client.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of comments were received concerning the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule on contingent fees. Some commentators expressed concerns  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about the administrability of the portion of the rule involving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims for refund. These commentators noted that it may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult to anticipate whether the IRS will deny a claim and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether a client will choose to litigate the claim if it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denied. They also asserted that a claim's prospects for being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denied should be evaluated at the time of the fee arrangement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than at the time the claim is filed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commentators questioned the need for additional rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Circular 230 regulating fees at all. These commentators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that the preparer and accuracy-related penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide adequate safeguards against overly-aggressive positions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed rule is broader than necessary to counter any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of contingent fee arrangements to exploit the ``audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lottery,'' and that the proposed rule could interfere with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable commercial relationships.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury continues to believe that a rule restricting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contingent fees for preparing tax returns supports voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the tax laws by discouraging return positions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that exploit the audit selection process. In response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments received, the proposed contingent fee rule has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modified in the final regulations to permit contingent fees for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims for refund (other than claims for refund made on original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returns) or for amended returns if the practitioner reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anticipates, at the time the fee arrangement is entered into,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the return will receive substantive review by the IRS. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination will be made on a case-by-case basis. Like the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, the final rule bans contingent fees for preparing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original returns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

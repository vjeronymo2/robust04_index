			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading social housing in Hounslow UNITED HOUSE is to refurbish and upgrade a mix of 506 houses, maisonettes and flats on North British Housing Association's Beaver Estate at Hounslow, west London, under a contract worth Pounds 8.4m. Because the internal work is so extensive the occupants will be moving out for the five/six weeks required to install new bathrooms and kitchens, central heating and windows and for the replacement of all wiring and plumbing. All flat roofs are being given new pitched, tiled roofs. Responsibility for the timings and phasing of all movements, over a period of 20 months, rests with United House. The Housing Association is providing alternative accommodation elsewhere on the estate. While all this is going on United House will also undertake a similar upgrading of the Beaver's Ermine Community Centre.</p>

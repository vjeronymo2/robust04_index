			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead TOMKINS, the conglomerate which has just bought Ranks Hovis McDougall, the bakery, milling and baking company, is expected to report on Monday interim profits of Pounds 47m, up from Pounds 43.7m. Earnings per share are expected to be up 8 eight per cent. Tomkins is expected to be enjoying the beginnings of recovery in the US where it has extensive manufacturing operations. TSB Group reports results for the year to October 31 on Thursday. Brokers expect a modest recovery to profits of Pounds 80m before tax, against losses of Pounds 47m in the previous year. The group is thought to have incurred a big charge, estimated at more than Pounds 400m, to cover possible losses on bad and doubtful debts. TSB chairman Sir Nicholas Goodison warned last week that the second half had been unexpectedly bad. Wednesday sees interim results from Dixons Group. They will depend on how the electrical retailing group chooses to treat the Pounds 10m property development profits. Assuming they are not taken at the pre-tax line, taxable profits of about Pounds 10m are expected, against last time's Pounds 17.5m. Good growth in the UK retail side will lift profits to Pounds 20m (Pounds 16m), while in the US, losses will also grow to Pounds 14m (Pounds 11m). Its comments on Christmas trading will also be of close interest. The Rank Organisation, announcing preliminary results on Thursday for the year ended October, is expected to reveal unchanged trading profits for its managed businesses. But lower profits are expected at Rank Xerox, its photocopier joint venture, while profits from its 50 per cent stake in the Universal Studios theme park in Florida should be significantly higher. Group pre-tax profits should be slightly lower at Pounds 245m (Pounds 250.5m), with the total dividend unchanged at 31p. First Leisure is reporting preliminary results on Wednesday for its financial year ended October. Pre-tax profits are forecast to rise from Pounds 30.4m to between Pounds 30.6m and Pounds 32m.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Major pledges more cash for science Science enjoyed an unaccus-tomed day in the political limelight yesterday. Mr John Major made his first big speech on science as prime minister - promising to give research more money next year and a 'high priority' in future spending plans. Mr William Waldegrave, minister responsible for science, used a Commons debate on research to announce that Pounds 15.4m would be allocated in 1994-95 to several initiatives including a scheme to encourage researchers to collaborate with industry. Some of the shine was taken off these announcements last night, however, when Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, announced that his department's chief adviser on science and technology would not be replaced when he leaves next month. Speaking to the parliamentary and scientific committee, Mr Major said that science and engineering had 'too often been undervalued' in Britain. 'In the past 18 months we've done more to redefine science policy than in the last 20 years,' he said. 'We have set a long-term course and now we must hold to it.' Mr Waldegrave said the government would know by the end of April which of its research establishments are suitable for privatis-ation. He said a specialist team had already begun a review and would be recommending candidates for privatisation. Where privatisation was not considered appropriate, the team would suggest more efficient working arrangements. 'It is essential that Britain does not waste resources on out-of-date structures,' he said.</p>

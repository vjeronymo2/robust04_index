			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Clinton to unveil economic plan: Message of 'fair, shared sacrifice' - Limits to be set on health care spending THE White House will today launch an elaborate campaign to sell President Bill Clinton's new economic plan, which provides a modest job-creation package and price controls on medical care for the elderly. President Clinton will make the economy the focus of his first televised speech from the Oval Office tonight. The thrust of his message will be that 'fair, shared sacrifice' is necessary for long-term prosperity. Although administration officials insist that the economic plan has not yet been finalised, details have been slowly emerging. To address flagging employment growth, the president will propose a Dollars 30bn (Pounds 20bn) 'booster shot' programme combining tax incentives and infrastructure spending. It is expected to create about 200,000 jobs. The economic plan will be roughly balanced between new taxes and about 150 spending cuts, Mr George Stephanopoulos, the White House communications director, said. On health, new limits will be placed on payments to doctors and hospitals by Medicare, the health care scheme for the elderly. Reports at the weekend suggested the administration might be looking for savings of as much as Dollars 35bn over four years. There may also be price controls -  perhaps voluntary -  on the private health care sector. The president last week criticised drug companies for the high price of vaccines for childhood illnesses. Mr Clinton will also propose limits on the tax deductibility of executive salaries. The president will unveil some proposals in his state of the union message before Congress on Wednesday. He is expected to emphasise the importance of fairness and the benefits of progressive taxation in trying to shift public attention from the new taxes he will propose. He is also considering a return to Capitol Hill on Thursday for a 'question time' session similar to the one in the British parliament. Mr Clinton will then barnstorm across the country to blunt expected attacks on the plan from groups representing the elderly, doctors, farmers, drug companies and other 'special interests' who will be hurt by programme cuts or new taxes. Mr Leon Panetta, the budget director, said yesterday that Mr Clinton had personally examined every area of the budget. Reductions, mostly in the cost of government, will save an estimated Dollars 34bn over four years. The president supports a proposed space station, he said but 'it won't be done unless its billions of dollars of costs overrun are controlled'. Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, said the economic programme will have 'no gimmicks' like the 'rosy economic scenarios' used to produce the appearance of deficit reduction in the past. It will provide some short-term economic stimulation and long-term investment as well as budget reductions. Unions optimistic, Page 15 Clinton versus special interests, Page 30</p>

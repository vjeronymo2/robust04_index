			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: No cheer Sir, Anyone with knowledge of events surrounding the collapse of the US savings and loan institutions will look askance at the proposal to expand building societies' lending powers to include business loans and loans not secured on land ('Building societies given chance to widen services', July 7). Perhaps as a lawyer in these leaner times I should enjoy the anticipation of another wonderful windfall for my profession: however, I rather fear for my deposits.

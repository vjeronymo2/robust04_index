			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dmytro Korchynskyy, leader of the Ukrainian </F> National Self Defense, by Vitaliy Markovskyy in Kiev; date not  given: "Hemingway Would Definitely Be Sentenced According to  Ukrainian Law" -- first paragraph is UKRAYINA MOLODA  introduction published in boldface; questions published in  boldface]    [Text] Downtown Kiev, the favorite place for many offices  and headquarters... I head straight for an unremarkable --  especially against the backdrop of a white-stone bank office --  small building. The door opens. They gaze at me suspiciously  and, passing through another metal-bar door, I am escorted to  the basement -- the headquarters of the Ukrainian National  Assemble [UNA] and the Ukrainian National Self Defense [UNSO].  A tiny room. An ashtray with cigarette stubs stands on a  table. A portrait of Stepan Bandera [leader of the  Organizations of Ukrainian Nationalists during World War II],  maps of Kiev and Abkhasia, and a picture of Hemingway toting a  machine gun hang on the wall (the motto reads: "Hemingway would  definitely be sentenced to 12 years in prison if he was a  Ukrainian citizen, for participating in the Spanish Civil War")  Somebody looks at me suspiciously, somebody is intimidated, the  majority do not care at all. UNSO leader Dmytro Korchynskyy  gives me a sign, and I turn on my tape recorder:    [Markovskyy] The unforgettable Oscar Wilde used to say that  although people do not like it when somebody speaks about them  too much, they like it even less when somebody does not speak  about them at all. Mr. Dmytro, although I am not sure about  your influence, you are a well-known force in Ukraine's  political arena. Nevertheless, I would like to hear directly  from you: Who are you?    [Korchynskyy] The UNSO was established on 19 August 1991 to  sabotage a coup attempt in our country. At that time, the UNA  initiated the first UNSO units that were already conducting  appropriate work and training. Since then, the organization has  been reinforced and has gained some combat experience. This is  the only organization in Ukraine that has administrative,  political, and military experience obtained under the conditions  of destabilization and serious social conflicts. Participation  in two wars, dozens of strikes, work in the Army, establishment  of a servicemen's union, and social protection of workers are  the results of our activities.... All the other so-called  political parties deal with some shady business.    [Markovskyy] Your are often deemed ultra-radicals, or just  plain ultras. Moreover, your activities are basically illegal.  What is your opinion on such attitudes expressed toward your  organization, and what is UNSO's place in Ukraine's political  arena?    [Korchynskyy] Voltaire once noted that an adequate reaction  to reality and telling the truth is always considered by society  as extremism. The most extremist aspect of our activities is  that we call things by their names and react adequately. A  healthy reaction in unhealthy society is considered extremism.  The UNSO reacts to current events. At the beginning we defend,  and later we try to figure out what we have defended. There is  solidarity among us. Our organization unites people who are  convinced that the outmost houses burn first, and people who are  nonconformists, tired of waiting for someone to spit in their  face in their own country. They strike in response. I believe  that this is quite normal.    [Markovskyy] How many members does the UNSO have?    [Korchynskyy] Not many. There are only several thousand  people. However, we have the best capabilities to mobilize our  members among all parties. All Ukrainian parties have  relatively few members, but when there is a need, when a certain  number of people is needed at a certain place, the UNSO is the  best.    [Markovskyy] We have seen everything in Ukraine, except  for... war, and God forbid this happens. Many people link your  organization with the avenging sword, military uniforms, and  combat.... Are you a ceaselessly fighting force? War is not  enough for you?    [Korchynskyy] The point is that all of East Europe has  ended up in a situation of instability and regional conflicts,  whether we like it or not. These conflicts surround Ukraine,  and unfortunately, government activities may lead to a situation  when such conflicts erupt here as well. To prevent this from  occurring, an extremely active policy is needed. For example,  in case conflict erupts in the Crimea, the same military units  that were sent to Abkhazia will be deployed there -- units of  Russia's North Caucasian Military District and Black Sea Fleet  (the latter was pretty active in Abkhazia, where its shells  destroyed half of Sukhumi). These are the same mercenaries who  will be deployed against the Crimea from bases which Moscow  fought for in Georgia. If we want to have a smaller front in  the Crimea in the future, we have to create a bigger front in  Caucasus to entangle certain forces in combat. This should  become the responsibility of the Ukrainian state, since Georgia  and Azerbaijan are in the sphere of Ukraine's geopolitical  interests -- our national interests. The government, however,  does not understand this, and it even brought disgrace upon  itself allowing marines, who pledged allegiance to Ukraine, to  fight on the side of our potential enemies, despite Kiev's  official line. Do you understand this? It was done at  Ukraine's expense, with Ukrainian fuel and ships. Let us look  at another axis -- Romania -- Moldova -- Cisdnestr -- Ukraine --  Transcarpathia -- Hungary. Apparently, Hungary should be our  ally, since it has serious problems with Romanians. We also  have serious and urgent problems with Romanians in Bukovyna and  Bessarabia. Hungary, however, seeing the sluggishness and  passiveness of Ukraine, began very active work aimed at  Transcarpathia's secession a few years ago. The so-called  Ruthenian movement is financed by Hungary, and the Ruthenian  leaders are of Hungarian origin. In the current situation,  Ukraine must conduct an active policy, it must.    [Markovskyy] What is your combat experience? Where have you  fought, and what were the results of this? Why did you do that?    [Korchynskyy] Officially, we have participated in two  military conflicts: in Cisdnestr and Abkhazia. The decision to  take part in the first conflict was obvious to us, since  Cisdnestr is an ethnically Ukrainian land inhabited primarily by  Ukrainians. Additionally, we know that rapprochement between  Moldova and Romania is under way. It is also known that the  Ukrainian ethnic minority has always been discriminated against  in Romania. If Moldova unites with Romania, we can expect a  similar attitude toward the Ukrainians living in Cisdnestr. We  should be aware that Ukraine cannot be indifferent toward  Cisdnestr. The more so, since as long as Moldova has problems  with Cisdnestr, we will not have problems with Bukovyna and  Bessarabia. We believe that the concept of "a war in our own  backyard," which Ukrainians have been endorsing for more than  300 years, is erroneous. It is too late to fight when the enemy  is already in your backyard. One must wage a war on foreign  soil. However, the point was not a war. Ukraine had to show a  human attitude toward the Ukrainians from Cisdnestr. It was  much harder for us to make the decision on participating in the  Abkhazian conflict. The point was that Russians fought on the  other side in Abkhazia -- both regular units and volunteers. We  endorse the idea of Slavic unity, and we do not like to shoot at  Slavs. But when the situation in the Crimea had sharply  deteriorated -- as a result of the Russian Supreme Soviet  resolution on the status of Sevastopol -- we decided to set up a  front in Caucasus. Unfortunately, we did not manage to  establish an efficiently strong military force there. Our  troops, however, were the best among the Georgian Army units,  and they distinguished themselves in many operations. For the  heroism demonstrated in combat, 30 UNSO troopers were awarded  the highest military order of Georgia.    [Markovskyy] How many casualties did you suffer in those  conflicts?    [Korchynskyy] Despite the fact that it was a very intensive  conflict, there were no casualties in Cisdnestr on our side. We  only had a few wounded. In Abkhazia, unfortunately, seven of  our comrades were killed, and more than 20 wounded. I am deeply  convinced that if there had not been these victims, we would  have had even more casualties here, in Ukraine. Pacifism have  elicited much more misery in our history than militarism.    [Markovskyy] How does the UNSO obtain their weapons?    [Korchynskyy] We are given weapons in conflict zones by  governments of countries in which we fight.    [Markovskyy] What about Ukraine?    [Korchynskyy] We do not need weapons here.    [Markovskyy] Then, what, in your opinion, has provoked the  authorities' recent actions against you?    [Korchynskyy] There has been a trend of merging the  UNA-UNSO with strike committees, free trade unions, and social  protection organizations. The authorities are afraid that an  organized, solidified force is emerging in Ukraine, which can  act as an alternative to them, restore order, and assume  responsibility for the state and reforms. The recent change in  the 187th article of the Criminal Code was aimed against us. It  is interesting that this article had previously provided for  accountability for anti-Soviet activities. Currently, it  provides for accountability for establishing paramilitary units.  The right to join any organization is a man's birthright.  According to this law, it is a crime to simply establish an  organization. Later, sport clubs and scouting camps can be  considered "paramilitary," since they also involve discipline,  training, uniforms -- all that relates to paramilitary units,  according to the law. Weapons? The law does not mention  weapons, and one does not have to possess them to be sentenced.  Although not a single gun was found during the latest arrests,  seven our people are serving time in Kiev.    [Markovskyy] What exactly happened on Bold Hill in Kiev?    [Korchynskyy] A documentary movie about the UNSO is  currently being filmed. At the director's request, our people  demonstrated their military drills. They were arrested while  these scenes were being filmed. The director was also arrested,  and the film was presented as "material evidence."    [Markovskyy] The UNSO was established in 1991. Over these  past few years, you have been doing what you have wanted. Why  have they cracked down on you right now?    [Korchynskyy] Primarily, because our organization is getting  stronger. Whereas we have not been taken seriously before, now,  the regime considers us its main enemy. Second, the regime has  had certain illusions about using us in its battle against trade  unions and strikers. Do not forget that this regime is young --  before 1991, they were nothing more than snitches. The regime  has grown stronger and richer. Every day brings them tens of  millions of dollars -- they have enough money to both waste and  fight for.    [Markovskyy] I have heard that the UNSO was established by  the authorities as sort of scarecrow: Look, this is the monster  of Ukrainian nationalism. Take a look and be scared. The fact  that this monster exists allows the Security Service to tightly  control national-democratic forces in Ukraine.    [Korchynskyy] One must follow current events. Those who  have recently been doing that should notice that our activities  are dangerous and uncomfortable for the authorities, including  the Ukrainian Security Service. As of today, more than 20 of  our comrades are imprisoned as a result of numerous  fabrications. Many of them have experienced prisons and mortar  fire.... People do not do such things for money. As for the  threat to national-democratic forces... Honestly, I am  surprised. The country is in a situation that is worse than  occupation, the idea of statehood has been compromised,  everything that could be robbed and sold has been robbed and  sold, and Ukrainian patriots, state leaders, and democrats do  not feel right. They drive fancy cars, work in luxury offices,  and wear expensive suits.... This resembles a deadly fight with  a lunch break, or, as if they fight against communism only twice  a week. Apparently, this fight is very comfortable for them....  Our activities pose a threat only to the regime and ourselves.  Those who are in between, are only a bluff, facade. Their  existence is more convenient for the authorities, and I will  explain to you why that is the case. There are basically  several hundreds officials who form the regime, and who owe the  main part of the capital that is being taken away from Ukraine.  The rest is composed of small politicians and businessmen who  get the leftovers. The average television viewer, however,  blames not the regime but those people he sees on television.  He watches Supreme Council debates, certain political  parties.... All parties and political leaders try to create an  impression that they can influence certain processes. It is  very convenient for the authorities that, between them and  viewers, there are certain "crawling" political parties which  pretend that they mean something. They are the first ones to  scream: "The democrats have ruined the country."    [Markovskyy] Do you intend to interfere in the developments  in the Crimea?    [Korchynskyy] Of course. We have enough power to destroy  all separatists. We, however, cannot act now, because the first  steps are to be taken on the streets of Bankivska and  Hrushevskoho. They will stab us in the back in Kiev, to prevent  us from acting in the Crimea.</p>

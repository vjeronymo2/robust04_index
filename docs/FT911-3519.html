			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Labour denies poor would be worse off - Family policy LABOUR yesterday rejected Tory charges that its commitment to increases in child benefit and pensions would not help the poorest families, as it stepped up its attempt to take over the Tories' claim to be 'the party of the family'. At the launch of Labour's document on 'family prosperity', Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, said that poorer families would not suffer an equivalent deduction from income support with the rise of child benefit to Pounds 9.55 a child a week. Similarly, he said pensioners on income support would not lose out on proposed increases in state pension. During the Budget debate last month, ministers claimed that Labour's calculations failed to allow for the effect of not clawing back the rise in child benefit from families on income support. The cost of Labour's proposals had been reduced, Mr Meacher added, by the Budget increases in child benefit. The child benefit and pensions commitments, costed at about Pounds 3.25bn, would broadly be met by setting a top tax rate of 50 per cent and removing the ceiling on national insurance contributions. Mr Meacher said Labour would not act retrospectively, but would ensure occupational and personal pensions provided at least as good a deal as the state scheme.</p>

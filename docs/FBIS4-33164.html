			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 1 Jun (PL) -- Honduran Foreign Minister  Ernesto Paz Aguilar will visit Cuba at the invitation of the  Foreign Ministry. An authorized Cuban Foreign Ministry source  confirmed Paz Aguilar's trip to PRENSA LATINA today. The date  for the trip will be coordinated by the two countries soon.    The Honduran foreign minister met with Roberto Robaina, his  Cuban counterpart, in Cairo, taking advantage of their  participation in the meeting of foreign ministers of the  Nonaligned Movement which is being held in the Egyptian capital.    On this occasion, he asked Robaina to convey greetings from  Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina to Cuban President Fidel  Castro and referred to the possibility of a meeting between the  two chiefs of state during the upcoming Fourth Ibero-American  Summit to be held in Cartagena de Indias.    Cuba and Honduras do not have diplomatic relations.  Diplomatic ties were suspended by the Honduran Government in  April 1961 following an OAS agreement.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 14. Applicants propose to waive the CDSC, in whole or in part, in connection with (a) redemptions made within one year following the death or disability, as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ``Code''), of a shareholder; (b)(i) a lump sum or other distribution following retirement, or, in the case of an individual retirement account (``IRA''), Keogh Plan, or custodial account pursuant to section 403(b)(7) of the Code, after the shareholder has attained age 591/2, or any redemption resulting from a tax-free return of an excess contribution pursuant to section 408(d) (4) or (5) of the Code, or from the death or disability of the employee, or (ii) in the alternative, in connection with a distribution following retirement under a tax-deferred retirement plan, or attaining age 701/2 in the case of an IRA, Keogh Plan, or custodial account pursuant to section 403(b) of the Code, or resulting from the tax-free return of an excess contribution to an IRA; (c) redemptions of shares purchased by active or retired officers, directors or trustees, partners and employees of the Funds, the Distributor or affiliated companies, by members of the immediate families of such persons, by dealers having a sales agreement with the Distributor, by any state, county, or city, or any instrumentality, department, authority, or agency thereof and by trust companies and bank trust departments which hold shares in a fiduciary capacity; (d) redemptions of shares made pursuant to a shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted by a Fund; (e) redemptions by shareholders holding shares of a Fund worth over $1 million immediately prior to redemption; (f) redemptions effected by advisory accounts managed by the Adviser; (g) redemptions by tax-exempt employee benefit plans resulting from the adoption or promulgation of any law or regulation; and (h) redemptions effected by registered investment companies in connection with the combination of an investment company with a Fund by merger, acquisition of assets, or by any other transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. If the Funds waive or reduce the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be applied uniformly to all offerees in the specified class. If the Trustees of a Fund determine to discontinue the waiver or reduction of the CDSC, the disclosure in the Fund's prospectus will be appropriately revised. Any shares purchased prior to the termination or reduction of such waiver will be able to have the CDSC waived or reduced as provided in the Fund's prospectus at the time of the purchase of such shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. The Funds may provide a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  credit, to be paid for by the Distributor, for any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares followed by a reinvestment effected within 365 days, or a shorter period, of the redemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an exemptive order to the extent that the proposed Multi-Class Distribution System might be deemed: (a) to result in the issuance of a ``senior security'' within the meaning of section 18(g), and thus prohibited by section 18(f)(1), and (b) to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i). Applicants also seek an exemption from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c) and 22(d), and rule 22c&hyph;1 to the extent necessary to permit the imposition and waiver of a CDSC on redemptions of Fund shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants believe that the proposal will permit the Funds to facilitate both the distribution of their securities and provide investors with a broader choice as to the method of purchasing shares without assuming excessive accounting and bookkeeping costs or unnecessary investment risks. Applicants assert that, under the proposed Multi-Class Distribution System, the Funds will save the organizational and other continuing costs that would be incurred if the Funds were required to establish new separate investment portfolios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants believe that the Multi-Class Distribution System does not raise any of the concerns that prompted the SEC to recommend the adoption of section 18,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  excessive borrowing, inadequate assets or reserves, and increased speculative character of junior securities. Applicants state that the proposal does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Funds' existing assets or reserves. In addition, applicants state that the proposed arrangement will not increase the speculative character of the shares of the Funds, since all such shares will participate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in all of a Fund's appreciation, income and expenses, with the exception of the different distribution fees and any different transfer agency costs payable by each class. Applicants contend that mutuality of risk will be preserved with respect to each class of shares in a Fund. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

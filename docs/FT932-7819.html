			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Doling out good news Once again, the economic indicators seem to be pointing in every direction. After disappointing figures for manufacturing output and retail sales earlier in the week, yesterday brought the unexpected news that unemployment fell in April for the third month in a row. Viewed in a slightly longer perspective, though, the figures are not so confusing. Manufacturing output rose 2 per cent in the three months to March; retail sales were up 1.4 per cent in the quarter to April. That is consistent with a moderate recovery in which the latest figures simply offset earlier months of exceptionally good figures. Similarly, the recent good news on unemployment compensates for the particularly bleak period last autumn when the rate of increase seemed to be accelerating. Only time will tell if there are also structural changes at work, or how far the lower jobless rate also reflects pressure on claimants to leave the register. This time, though, there is a hint of underlying improvement in the small increase in the manufacturing workforce. The unequivocally encouraging point is the further fall in average earnings and the resulting drop in unit labour costs, which are 3 per cent below March last year. That points to a recovery based on improved competitiveness with, as yet, no threat to inflation. It is small wonder that sterling took the figures well. The only trouble is that an exchange rate over DM2.50 does not provide much incentive for overseas investors to buy gilts. As the running in the auctions gets tougher, the government might come to regret that it did not clamp down more in the Budget. It now appears the economy was strong enough to take such treatment.</p>

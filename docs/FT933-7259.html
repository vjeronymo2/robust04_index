			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / People: Harvey, from Habitat to Ibiza Michael Harvey, former chairman and chief executive of Habitat, has taken over as the new non-executive chairman of youth tour operator The Club, a management buy-out of Club 18-30, once part of the now defunct International Leisure Group. He replaces Francis Higgins, a veteran of International Thomson on both the publishing and travel side, who has resigned over a policy disagreement. Jeremy Muller, managing director of The Club and a former director of ILG Travel, had worked for Higgins at Thomson Holidays when the latter was managing director. Muller says the recent parting, the reasons for which were 'connected with growth', was 'perfectly amicable'. Higgins, in his early 60s, is content to spend more time breeding his prize sheep in Surrey. Meanwhile, Harvey, 49, who left Habitat just over a year ago in the course of a management restructuring inspired by David Dworkin, Storehouse's previous, and short-lived, boss, came recommended by NatWest. The venture capital division of the bank put together a Pounds 2m funding package to support The Club's buy-out in the spring of 1991. Harvey has no experience of the holiday business but Muller says that it is his grasp of retailing that is important. 'There is an awful lot of salesmanship and hype that is needed at the sharp end of our business. A great deal of effort goes into understanding the retailing side.' Accordingly, Muller spent the first past of last week introducing Harvey to Ibiza. not sparing him 'the raves and the very late nights' in an 'introduction extraordinaire' for the new chairman. If in need of any extra excitement, Harvey can always compare notes with Michael Julien, Dworkin's predecessor at Storehouse and Harvey's introduction to Habitat. Julien has just been appointed non-executive chairman of Owners Abroad. The latter's Air 2000 supplies about 20 per cent of The Club's flights while Twenty's Holidays, the Club's main competitor, belongs to Owners.</p>

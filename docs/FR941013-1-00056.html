			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second individual unit exemption provision proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the rule would allow an owner or operator to selectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designate, on a site-specific basis, certain individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units to be exempt from the air emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements regardless of the VOHAP concentration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated material placed in the unit. Application of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discretionary exemption by the owner or operator would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited based on regulated material organic HAP content.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this provision, the total annual organic HAP mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content in the regulated materials placed in all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units designated by the owner or operator as exempt units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could not exceed 1 Mg/yr as determined in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the procedures specified in the rule. The EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on the structure of the proposed 1 Mg/yr exemption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for individual units, as well as supporting information for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any recommendation for an alternative exemption level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For tanks, surface impoundments, containers, conveyance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems, and certain treatment units required to use air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission controls under the off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations NESHAP, the owner or operator would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to either: (1) Install and operate air emission controls on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the unit in accordance with standards specified in the rule;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or (2) treat the regulated material before the regulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material is placed in the unit to remove or destroy organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP in accordance with requirements specified in the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For land disposal units and other miscellaneous units  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the air emission control requirements of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, the owner or operator would be required to treat the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated material before the regulated material is placed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the unit to remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the requirements specified in the rule. In addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these requirements, the rule would require that the owner or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator of an affected facility control organic HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from leaks in certain ancillary equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e.g., pumps, valves, flanges, etc.) used to handle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated material streams having a total organic HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, an owner or operator would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed to use any type of treatment process to reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic HAP content of the regulated material that can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continuously achieve the performance requirements specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the rule. Several alternative treatment process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance standards are specified in the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from which the owner or operator could choose to comply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These standards would allow the use of a treatment process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that achieves any of the following conditions: (1) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual VOHAP concentration of the regulated material exiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the treatment process is less than 100 ppmw or the VOHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration limit established for the process, whichever  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value is lower; (2) the HAP reduction efficiency for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment process is equal to or greater than 95 percent,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the VOHAP concentration of the regulated material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exiting the treatment process is less than 50 ppmw; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) the actual HAP mass removal for the treatment process is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than the required mass removal established for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Tank Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The tank standards proposed for the off-site waste and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery operations NESHAP would establish the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for tanks using air emission controls to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general standards of the rule. No air emission controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required under the rule for a tank in which all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated material placed in the unit has been treated to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remove or destroy organic HAP in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements specified in the general standards. Also, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tank standards would not apply to a tank in which biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment of a regulated material is performed under certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions specified in the rule; or to a tank designated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the owner or operator to be exempted from using air emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls in accordance with the rule provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed air emission control requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks would be applied based on the tank design capacity,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tank, and whether the tank is designated an ``existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tank'' or a ``new tank'' under the provisions of 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 63. Both existing tanks and new tanks in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum HAP vapor pressure of the regulated material in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tank is equal to or greater than 76.6 kPa (approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.1 psi), would be required (regardless of tank design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity) to manage the regulated material in a tank using a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover that is connected through a closed-vent system to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device. For affected tanks in which the maximum HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapor pressure of the regulated material in the tank is less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 76.6 kPa, different standards are proposed for existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tanks and for new tanks depending on the tank design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva, March 31 (TASS) -- Talks on complete and  universal nuclear test-ban began "in a good tempo". "Of course,  we would like to move toward our goal more swiftly, but, since  this forum is multilateral and positions of all the states have  to be taken into account, one may say that the start was good  enough," Grigory Berdennikov, permanent Russian representative  to the United Nations, commented om the results of the first  meeting of the annual session of UN conference on disarmament,  which concluded here on Thursday.    Participants in the conference worked out a convention on  prohibition of chemical weapons in 1992 and in January 1994  proceeded to prepare a multilateral agreement on complete  nuclear test-ban.    Although the UN General Assembly unanimously supported the  idea of beginning such multilateral talks in December 1993,  representatives of 37 member states which participate in the  conference are fully aware that they will have to face many  stumbling blocks on their way to mutual accord. Control over  the would-be agreement poses a most difficult problem.    Discussions on total test-ban have been going on for  decades.  The treaty banning nuclear-weapon tests in the atmosphere, in  outer space and under water, signed in Moscow in 1963, was a  landmark agreement.    Russian participants in the Geneva meeting proposed that  this  treaty and other international agreements form a basis for  defining the sphere of application of the would-be agreement on  complete and universal nuclear test-ban, which should include a  ban on underground nuclear-weapon tests.    They declared for interminable and indiscriminate nature of  the treaty, for equality of rights and responsibilities of all  the parties.    In Russia's opinion, an effective mechanism of international  control over the treaty is needed; not only the nuclear powers,  but also the countries, which are capable of creating nuclear  weapons, should get involved.    Russia declared also for envisaging strict measures to be  taken against violators, including the sanctions specified in  the UN charter.    How much time will it take to work out the document? The  Chinese representatives believe, that the work may be completed  by 1996.    "In our opinion, it would be better to accelerate (the  procedures) and coordinate, at least, major provisions by the  spring of 1995, that is, before the conference on the treaty of  nuclear non-proliferation begins," Berdennikov told ITAR-TASS.    "So far, there is no standard wording (of the would-be  agreement). We hope, that it will be worked out in the  forthcoming sessions. To this effect, however, we shall have to  pass through the current preliminary stage, when the  participants state their positions," he concluded.    The session of the UN conference on disarmament is to resume  its work in Geneva next May.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Arts: Master of mystery - Alastair Macaulay reports on the final week of the Dublin Pinter festival You might think that a 'Pinter Festival' was a contradiction in terms . . . And you would be wrong. The festival of six Pinter plays that Dublin's Gate Theatre has just presented was full of laughter, mystery, emotion, and, above, all, humanity. There is talk of another, larger, Pinter festival at the Gate in the future; and it is obvious that England should have one too. All six Gate stagings are first-class and would adorn the London stage. One reason that a Pinter Festival is timely is that, with last year's Moonlight, we have stopped talking of Pinter the playwright in the past tense (as we were doing at the time of his 60th birthday celebrations in 1990). The Dublin Festival ended with Moonlight (performances continue this week). Watching it again was a pleasure, not least because it was often the most hilarious play of the festival. In it Pinter is clearly entering new terrain: with the family divided into three separate stage areas, with death treated from two contrasting angles (the daughter's in the past, the father's approaching) and with the very intense irony of much of the talk. Possibly Pinter has pared too much away from Moonlight; it does not gather in impact or significance as do his greatest plays. But its tragicomic ambivalence is masterly. That Pinter is a master becomes obvious with a festival of his work. How often he deals in mystery] - and leaves us like detectives. We are plunged straight into bewildering scenes whose import is never fully clear; but his language is so haunting, and his characters so full of feeling, that it becomes important to work out the play's hidden implications. Landscape (1968) was to me the greatest revelation of the festival. Seldom if ever performed since it was played by Peggy Ashcroft (Beth's original interpreter), it shows a couple locked into a painful dichotomy. He, facing her and often talking to her but never hearing her, talks of mundane matters in the present and recent past. She, facing away, hearing him (probably), but speaking as if in her own head, reflects only of long ago sensual experience. In several ways, Landscape was a turning-point in Pinter's art: it turned away from the menace which often enters into his earlier work, introduced a new lyricism - and it showed a new kind of feminism in his writing. Beth is so much more lyrical, tactile and imaginative than Duff; and her thoughts elude him. Pinter himself directed Landscape; Penelope Wilton and Ian Holm played Duff and Beth. Sublimely eloquent performances, in which the least nuance took on a wealth of meaning. He spends almost the whole play seated in profile; at the end, he sits there locked in a spasm of rage that gradually becomes suffused by anguish. She looks out front, calmly, as if through the window whose shadow we see on her. Sometimes her eyelids beat through the pauses as if she is close to tears; once she gazes firmly out without blinking, and we sense time differently, and know how different an emotion is now in her heart. She speaks in utter quiet, and the beauty of her diction - pellucid without elaboration - turns every line into poetry. The play's most famous line is her ending 'Oh my true love I said', but Wilton makes equally telling effect in talking of the nature of shadow. As she speaks, so softly, 'Shadow is deprivation of light . . . Sometimes the cause of the shadow cannot be found', she lets the full metaphorical sense of her lines strike home. A most beautiful performance. In Moonlight, Holm repeats the marvellously scathing, ironic, panicky performance of the dying Andy with which last year he returned to the stage. Wilton, excellent as his wife Bel, is slightly warmer than the original Bel, Anna Massey. Karel Reisz, directing, achieves many fresh nuances between the characters; but there are connections and undertones to this play that still have yet to emerge. It takes a long time for a Pinter play to disclose all its meanings. Which is a sure sign of mastery. Moonlight continues at the Gate Theatre until May 28</p>

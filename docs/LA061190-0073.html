			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> SUDDENLY HE HAD A CREDIBILITY PROBLEM  </P> <P> For the past 15 years, the Fair Housing Council of Orange County has worn two  important hats. With the help of funds from the cities and county government,  the nonprofit council has fought discrimination in housing at the same time it  has helped resolve disputes between tenants and landlords. It is that second  mission that has proved troublesome for David T. Quezada, the 40-year-old  executive director who was suspended without pay last week.  </P> <P> Speaking of hats, Quezada discovered for himself in recent weeks just how  complicated things can get when you wear more than one. In addition to being  the executive director of the council, he allowed himself to fall into a  category fraught with potential awkwardness and embarrassment: He's a landlord,  too.  </P> <P> The council's board chairman gives Quezada high marks for his consistent record  as an advocate for tenants rights. He runs an organization with enough  credibility in Fullerton, to cite one place, that the agency is where the  city's code enforcement officer refers tenants who have problems getting  landlords to fix code violations.  </P> <P> No wonder, then, that a city inspector was surprised when she looked at a  duplex on East Truslow Avenue that had rotten floors, cracked windows and  leaking plumbing and learned that the owner was the executive director of the  county's Fair Housing Council. A check of city records also turned up an  illegal third rental unit in the back of the duplex.  </P> <P> Quezada later said he had heard no complaints until he tried to evict tenants  from one of the three units in the building so that he could convert the  building back to a legal, two-unit complex. Yet the executive director of an  organization pledged to resolving landlord-tenant problems can ill-afford to  get caught up in such a dispute.  </P> <P> Quezada's triplex masquerading as a duplex became the focus of a joint  inspection by the Orange County Health Department, the city Fire Department and  the Building Department. That kind of attention a Fair Housing Council doesn't  need. Both the director and his board were embarrassed, as they should have  been, and he was called on the carpet.  </P> <P> The board's decision to suspend Quezada without pay until he corrected  violations was fair enough, considering the high marks he has received for his  work. Yet it should be clear to him now what should have been obvious in the  first place. You can't wear the hat of a fair-housing advocate when you wear  another as slumlord.  </P></p>

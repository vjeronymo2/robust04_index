			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / First miss for 84-year-old Something extraordinary happened in the US Congress yesterday. For the first time in 41 years there was a division in the House of Representatives - on a mundane procedural issue - in which Mr William Natcher, the 84-year-old Democrat from Kentucky, did not cast a vote. That broke a string of 18,401 consecutive votes by Congressman Natcher. This is, naturally, a record. Congressional historians do not know who held it before, nor who holds the current longest streak. Mr Tom Foley, the Speaker, yesterday advised his colleagues not to try to beat Mr Natcher because they could never stand the strain. So anxious were his colleagues to keep his streak going that they had held no votes at all on Wednesday. On Tuesday Mr Natcher had been wheeled to Capitol Hill from his hospital bed to cast a vote or two. Though frail and ill, he has not hinted at retirement.</p>

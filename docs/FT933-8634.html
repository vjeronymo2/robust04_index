			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Letter: Squeeze on coal market has gone too far Sir, In Tony Jackson's article ('No more buried treasure', August 9) there is much tilting at windmills and a key point is missed. This is that a strong case exists for believing that the squeeze on the market for UK coal has gone too far. Many of the gas stations replacing coal-fired generation, however financially attractive to their investors, are doubtfully economic in national resource terms, as the trade and industry select committee has pointed out, once pricing rivalries in the electricity sector are set aside. Magnox stations may or may not be very cheap on an avoidable cost basis - but how long will they continue? Further nuclear investment is likely to cost a great deal more, despite claims to the contrary. So the right size of the UK coal industry in national economic terms may well be larger than the shorter-term market pressure will support at present. Mr Jackson's argument that we can find out by 'letting each pit operate as a separate commercial entity' ignores the strong interaction between pits in market quality and in mining terms, as well as the market power issue to which he alludes. The 'transitional arrangements' that Mr Jackson suggests provide the ground for the present contracts with electricity generators, and for the government's temporary subsidy arrangement if market volume would allow that to function. With the continuing reduction in operating costs of deep mines, British Coal expects to compete fully with imported coal at inland power stations by the mid-1990s. The pressing argument is about how many deep mines would be competitive at that time, but would not be given a chance to be so, given current pressure on volumes from other fuels enjoying more effective protection in the power station market.

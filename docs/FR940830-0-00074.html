			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NAHRO recommended that the reasonable cost determinations still be compared to the cost of new development. They also suggested a viability assessment must allow both approaches, a cumulative approach, such as a comparison of the total cost of modernization as compared to the total cost of new development or as the Department suggests, a cost reasonable test of the work items proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PHADA applauded the removal of the artificial TDC caps, but remained concerned about the level of detail PHAs will have to keep in their files and the form of the annual HUD review. Management choices are an essential part of this process and they were worried about some HUD personnel second-guessing authority decisions, thus leading to huge, unnecessary, battles. HUD was requested to clearly address the level of detail for filing in the handbook revisions. There was also an expressed need to prevent redundant files where work is publicly bid and selected architect/engineers provide cost estimates prior to bidding. No program benefit was found in further administrative procedures that do not impact construction quality or timeliness of expenditures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One PHA was concerned that if HUD does not establish a procedure it will be left to Field Office definition. The PHA suggested that local authorities be given the discretion to define reasonableness and have HUD approve the definition. Once approved, the definition would remain constant. The issue of cost reasonableness also illustrates the need for greater flexibility to do a cost analysis of rehabilitation of the existing units versus demolition and new construction. While a PHA does not want to see HUD reduce its responsibility to provide a steady funding source for new construction of public housing units, they believed that it is important to look at the cost reasonableness. The PHA was also seeking that the revised regulations permit this flexibility in scattered sites. It could be limited to specific units where the cost analysis demonstrated the cost-effectiveness and long-term viability of new construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the rule, HUD has clarified that long-term viability includes ensuring structural/system integrity and full occupancy. For cost reasonableness, HUD has decided that HAs may choose one of two methods to determine cost reasonableness: (1) unfunded modernization hard costs do not exceed 90% of computed TDC; or (2) individual work items are reasonable in accordance with National cost indices, adjusted by local conditions and the HA's own recent procurement experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Five-Year Fungibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All but one commenter supported HUD's proposed five-year fungibility. HAs found that full fungibility will allow HAs more flexibility to undertake and complete rehabilitation and modernization work at their housing developments. The elimination of the need for preparing amendments for HUD approval before work items may be interchanged from one year to another was predicted to save countless hours for both HAs and HUD Field Offices. While HAs wholeheartedly supported fungibility, some indicated a preference for it to be based on the Needs Assessments, rather than the Five-Year Action Plan. HAs stated a general principle that once a HA has established a need in their Needs Assessments, they would not have to request prior approval from HUD to fund that item. The condition of a development's physical plant can change dramatically from one year to the next. HAs, not HUD, were found to be in a better position to decide what work items need to be funded and when. Any extra level of approval was seen as not keeping with HUD's goal of increasing HA discretion and responsibility. It was also asserted that this would enable HAs to better and more rapidly address changing conditions without an extensive, interim public and HUD review process. Such reviews were considered more appropriate at the annual submission and performance and evaluation stages of the CGP. However, some HAs and CLPHA opposed the proposed requirement for HUD approval of any item not included in the current five-year plan as unrealistic, overly restrictive and would negate the benefits intended by full fungibility. Preparing budget revision proposals and the turnaround time involved in seeking HUD approval could result in project delays. With the increased emphasis for timely obligation and expenditure of funds, they were concerned that this restriction would make those goals more difficult to achieve. It was recommended that HAs should be able to add items to their current year modernization activities without HUD approval if these items are shown in their needs assessment (even if not included in the HA's Five-Year Action Plan), or are of similar type to items in their approved plan. HAs should also be able to add emergency items, or items certified by the HA as otherwise eligible and approvable, without further approval from HUD, provided that any items so added will not result in the deletion of any work item from the Five-Year Action Plan. Only if a HA proposes to delete an item from its Five-Year Action Plan should it have to notify HUD, or changes should be allowed for any item identified in an approved needs assessment up to a predetermined percentage cap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One HA supported the proposal to allow a HA to perform emergency work not outlined in its Five-Year Action Plan without prior HUD approval. As an incentive for high performers, one HA suggest that high performers should be allowed to not report on changes in excess of 10% of the grant other than on the yearly P&amp;E Report, along with giving a reason for the change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  HUD has adopted the proposed version of fungibility. HUD has not revised its approach to be based on the Needs Assessments because it would be too broad and would circumvent the resident and local government consultation requirements. HAs are currently able to add emergency work items, and will continue to be able to do so without HUD approval. HAs cannot add other work items to the Five-Year Action Plan without HUD approval. Full fungibility will be allowed within the five-year period spanned by the latest HUD-approved Five-Year Action Plan. It should also be noted that the five-year fungibility eliminates the need to report on changes in excess of 10% of the annual grant other than on the yearly P&amp;E Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

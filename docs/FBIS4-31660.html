			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Miklos Duray, chairman of the Coexistence </F> Movement, by Jana Pankovcinova; place and date not given: "We  Would Be Glad If We Could Support the Government"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Pankovcinova] In explaining  why he abstained during the vote on the signpost law,  Coexistence Deputy M. Feher argued that, after the incorporation  of proposals for changes, the government bill was undemocratic.  Do you agree with him? Does it mean that the other Coexistence  deputies, Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH]  deputies, and deputies of the government coalition parties voted  for an undemocratic law?    [Duray] Unfortunately, Deputy Feher is right in that, had  this draft been adopted, the law would have been discriminatory  and restrictive. I can only express pleasure at the fact that  it was not adopted. I agree with Interior Minister Pittner in  that this problem must be addressed also in order to demonstrate  to the European public that this petty issue will not be the  stumbling block of democracy in Slovakia.    [Pankovcinova] All of the MKDH deputies voted for this law.  The MKDH is your coalition partner, and, in the coalition  agreement, you had agreed to vote unanimously in the National  Council of the Slovak Republic on issues pertaining to  minorities. In the case of the signpost law, this did not  happen. Will this disrupt coalition relations between your two  parties?    [Duray] We are going to hold consultations on this issue,  and there could be a sharp exchange of opinions. However, this  does not affect the substance of our cooperation.    [Pankovcinova] Why have you not yet signed a preelection  coalition treaty with the MKDH, the signing of which you had  heralded to reporters two weeks ago?    [Duray] The treaty is 90-percent ready. Only the final  provisions remain to be drafted, the wording of which depends on  whether there will be an agreement on a three-member coalition  comprising also the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS]. Once we agree  that a tight three-member coalition (which means conditions such  as a joint club of deputies, joint course of action in communal  elections, and joint representation of our voters' interests  abroad) is acceptable to the MKDH, the treaty can be signed in a  short time.    [Pankovcinova] According to the MKDH chairman, however, this  is not acceptable. Will you sign a treaty on a two-member  coalition, then?    [Duray] The treaty is ready, except for the final  provisions.    [Pankovcinova] What is the Coexistence Movement's attitude  toward the government coalition? Will you support the  government until the last day of the last meeting of the  National Council of the Slovak Republic in this electoral term?    [Duray] We would be glad if we could.    [Pankovcinova] Under which conditions will you support it?    [Duray] At today's meeting of the Coalition Council, we will  have talks not only on how to resolve the issue of the signpost  law but also on the restructuring of the Ministry of Education.  If we come to an agreement, we will support the government.    [Pankovcinova] And what if you do not come to an agreement  on the signpost law and a possible deputies' draft of this law  does not pass in the National Council of the Slovak Republic?    [Duray] We had agreed with the government even before it was  formed under which conditions we would support it. I hope we  will not have a reason not to support it.    [Pankovcinova] Let us assume that, at today's meeting of the  Coalition Council, you will agree that the deputies' draft of  the signpost law will be submitted in the form in which it was  approved on 3 June, but without Deputy Kaliska's amendments  [under which communities named after important figures of Slovak  history should be exempted from the bilingual regime]. Will  your deputies vote for such a law?    [Duray] We will propose that the version that was submitted  to the National Council of the Slovak Republic by the government  be used as the point of departure. Proposals for changes that  expand the application of the signpost law are acceptable to us.  We will support the proposal, under which it should be possible  to designate Ukrainian and Ruthenian communities in these  languages on a greater scale as well as the proposal that an  exemption [from the provision, under which a minority must  constitute at least 20 percent of the population for bilingual  signposts to be installed in a community] be granted to  communities inhabited by citizens of German nationality. We  will support the signpost law in that form.</p>

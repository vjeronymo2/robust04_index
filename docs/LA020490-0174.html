			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHELTER'S AIM IS TO LIBERATE  </P> <P> In recent days, Catholic Charities' Long Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless  has come under fire by the newly formed Homeless Organizing Committee, which  claims the shelter is oppressive in its treatment of residents and its policies  and procedures (Times, Jan. 25).  </P> <P> It is unfortunate that the committee perceives the shelter in this manner when,  in fact, the aim of the shelter, its policies and procedures, is to liberate  residents from the cycle of homelessness. It is not now, nor has it ever been,  the intent of Catholic Charities to add further burden to people who are  already struggling with the trauma of homelessness and unemployment.  </P> <P> Catholic Charities today finds fewer and fewer organizations willing to commit  to the financial and administrative tasks of running a shelter. We need the  support of our homeless guests as much as they need our shelter.  </P> <P> Lupe Macker, Catholic Charities regional director in Long Beach, has unjustly  come under fire for her administration of the shelter and been accused of  lacking a true concern for the plight of the residents. Nothing could be  further from the truth. Not only has she shown great concern and compassion for  the needy persons in her region, but she is often their advocate without  promoting other personal agendas. This is clearly evident by the strong support  she has received over the years from the community, the city and county. As  executive director of Catholic Charities, I fully support and applaud Mrs.  Macker's leadership and guidance in administration of the shelter.  </P> <P> Since Catholic Charities began administration of the shelter in 1984, our  underlying philosophy has been to help families stay together while seeking  permanent housing and employment. The Long Beach Family Shelter is one of the  very few shelters in California that houses families together during the crisis  of homeless.  </P> <P> The Long Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless has been successful in helping  families mainstream into society largely because of its organization, structure  and procedures. Any social service agency, in order to be effective, must  maintain standards that not only ensure clients success and betterment, but  protect them and their children from any abusive situations which might occur.  </P> <P> Catholic Charities further acknowledges the residents' right to voice their  opinions and grievances not often heard. We welcome an open, honest dialogue  with the Homeless Organizing Committee to address their questions and needs. We  strongly believe that community input is vital to maintaining quality care for  those we seek to help.  </P> <P> It is difficult to be homeless. It is difficult to be in a homeless shelter no  matter how good the shelter may be. It is difficult to administer a shelter  with ever-diminishing funds. However, despite these difficulties, Catholic  Charities wishes to make this commitment and seeks partnership and support from  the homeless we care for and the community we serve.  </P> <P> Msgr. R. DAVID COUSINEAU  </P> <P> Executive Director  </P> <P> Catholic Charities  </P></p>

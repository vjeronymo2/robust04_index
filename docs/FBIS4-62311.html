			<p>BFN     [Text] The working document that needs to be signed to join  in NATO's Partnership for Peace program is not enough for  Russia. This was stated in Geneva today by Andrey Kozyrev.  According to him the NATO document is very abstract and is of a  preliminary character. Kozyrev stated that Moscow is preparing  its own program for cooperation with the North Atlantic  Alliance. It consists of three component parts and covers  matters relating to cooperation between military departments,  conversion, and interaction in the sphere of peacekeeping.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dangers posed by a larger rouble zone Sir, Your editorial, 'Gaidar departs' (January 17), reports that one reason for Mr Yegor Gaidar's unexpected departure from the Yeltsin camp was his objection to the Russian-Belarus economic merger. You correctly conclude that the resulting monetary union poses a serious problem for Russia because the control of rouble credits will be more difficult. Your exclusive concern with the well-being of Russia and its reformers fails to show the real dangers posed by an enlargement of the rouble zone, however. Since last March, when officials of the Yeltsin government told leaders in eastern Europe not to bother building large embassies in Kiev, Ukraine, because they would be downgraded to consular sections within 16 months, the Yeltsin government's objective of reconstituting the former Soviet Union has been transparent. On January 7, when you reported that Belarus and Tajikistan had been reincorporated into the rouble zone, it became clear the zone would provide Russia with the instrument to put the Soviet Union back together again. With the exception of Estonia, which followed our advice (see: Rahareform Vabale Eestile: Valautafondi Lahendus, Tartu, Estonia: Tartu Ulikool, 1992) and adopted a currency board-like system in June 1992, the independence of the republics of the former Soviet Union is threatened. They are vulnerable to Russian rouble-zone meddling. This is because western institutions and advisers have blindly counselled republics that central banks were the only institutions suited to solving the republics' currency problems. As you reported on January 7 ('Tajikistan swaps Soviet roubles for Russian ones'), this western strategy has been a disaster. Indeed, the failure of central banking in the republics has provided the ever-opportunistic Russian government with the opening it needs to swallow up the republics without firing a shot. The currency board system is the only way republics of the former Soviet Union can ensure stable currencies and their sovereignty. Lithuania, like Estonia, has realised this. Its government passed a draft law on Credibility of the Litas on December 15 1993. If approved by the parliament, Lithuania will have a currency board which will insulate it from predatory tactics.

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Car industry has mixed reaction to impact THE MOTOR industry gave a cautious welcome to the Budget, but car retailers warned of the impact on new car sales of the chancellor's determination to increase the cost of motoring in real terms in every future Budget. The Automobile Association said the government's motoring tax proposals were 'more highway robbery on Lamont's road to recovery'. 'With one hand the chancellor has taken more from the motorist in excise duty than he needs to replace new car tax; with the other, he has made all motorists subsidise new cars, and done little to benefit the environment or industry.' The AA said Mr Lamont had delivered 'a blow below the bonnet'. The average motorist would pay an extra Pounds 60 a year which would hit the lower and middle income motorist hardest. Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall, said 'the increase in both fuel tax and vehicle excise duty further increases the cost of motoring, but, on balance, affects the cost of usage more than ownership, which is our preferred option.' Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said that the reform of company car taxation was 'extremely welcome'. 'We are delighted that the Treasury's earlier indicated preference for a complicated system of price banding as a way of establishing a charging scale has given way to our representations for a fixed percentage of price.' The Retail Motor Industry Federation said the company car tax reforms were 'sensible' and would 'produce a fairer and more transparent tax system than previously.' The motor industry 'could rise to the challenge of developing more fuel efficient vehicles,' said Sir Hal Miller, to compensate motorists in the short-term for the government's plan to raise fuel duties in future by 3 per cent a year in real terms. There was a limit to what consumers should be asked to pay in the longer-term. The Freight Transport Association claimed that industry's costs had risen by at least Pounds 230m a year with the 10 per cent increase in the duty on diesel. 'In real terms this increase in fuel duty will mean that the cost of operating a 38 tonne truck will go up by about Pounds 1,000 a year,' said the FTA. 'The unremitting increase in industry's costs from raising fuel duty annually will put us at the top of the EC road transport taxation league and must make it more difficult for us to compete against our European counterparts.'</p>

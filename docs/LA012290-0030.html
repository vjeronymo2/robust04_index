			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> HESTONS SAIL FOR 'TREASURE ISLAND'  </P> <P> The latest (and, at 131 minutes, not counting commercials, longest) filmed  version of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure Island" -- premiering at 5 p.m.  today and repeating at 8 p.m. on the TNT cable network -- would seem to have  vanity production stamped all over it. Starring as the one-legged pirate Long  John Silver, one of the hammiest roles known to man or beast, is Charlton  Heston, and making a directorial debut with this presumably big-budget  action-adventure is one Fraser C. Heston, who also wrote and produced. Yo ho ho  and a bottle of nepotism!  </P> <P> The surprise, then, is that the younger Heston has turned in a directorial bow  that is both respectable and fun, if occasionally lacking the tension necessary  to sustain the running time. And the elder Heston, following in the filmic  footsteps of Wallace Beery, Robert Newton and Orson Welles, dons sun-scorched  makeup, curls his lips in and chews the island scenery for all it's worth; this  time, at least, he's doing the right thing.  </P> <P> If at times the production actually seems to be taking itself just a bit too  seriously -- unlike the famous Disney version -- with its pretty pictorialism  and graphic violence, it's largely up to Heston's Silver to risk flirting with  high camp and send it over the top every now and then. Way over the top in the  first half-hour are wheezing Oliver Reed and murderous Christopher Lee, both  killed off before the ship ever sets sail; these two overact so gustily that  when Heston turns up, his performance seems almost naturalistic.  </P> <P> The action is once more seen through the eyes of brave young Jim Hawkins, who  almost single-handedly averts a pirate mutiny that threatens an 18th-Century  expedition to an unmanned island laden with stolen loot. Christian Bale (grown  up a bit from "Empire of the Sun") is a good, believably enterprising choice  for Jim; Julian Glover also shows up in a rare good-guy role as Dr. Livesy.  </P> <P> Even as an admittedly long sit, both children and adults with a taste for  period-piece escapism should be sufficiently amused not to commandeer the set's  remote control.  </P> <P> The TV movie will be shown again Saturday, Feb. 1 and Feb. 24.  </P></p>

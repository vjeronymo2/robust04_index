			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Starting tomorrow, a reward awaits any Beninese  who provides information that could help retrieve the arms and  ammunition stolen from the Ouidah Military Camp. This was  disclosed this morning by Minister of Defense Desire Vieyra. He  observed that it was time to curb the growing insecurity  threatening the country.    [Begin recording] [Vieyra] [Words indistinct] especially  when  one holds the defense portfolio. What I can say right away --  with the permission of the head of state -- is that exceptional  ailments call for exceptional remedies. The government is  prepared to handsomely reward anyone who helps it to uncover  where these arms and ammunition are being hidden. A  2.5-million-CFA-franc award is promised to any person who helps  us retrieve these arms and ammunition. This is not an  undemocratic deviation or aberration. It is done in countries  all over the world. So we are not inventing something or doing  anything abnormal. Where the safety of our peaceloving  citizenry is threatened, the government must do all it can to  reassure them. This is exactly what we mean to do now.    [Unidentified correspondent] Which department should  Beninese  wishing to offer information contact?    [Vieyra] The Ministry of Interior. On 14 March, a special  telephone number will be provided at the Ministry of Interior  which people can use to communicate information. [passage  omitted]    [Correspondent] Beninese may also want to be sure that their  identities are kept secret.    [Vieyra] Their anonymity is fully guaranteed. Yes, fully  guaranteed. They run no risk at all. [passage omitted] [end  recording]    France will also be closely involved in handling the  security  situation in Benin. Hence, a French delegation is due to arrive  in Cotonou next week.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Management: China's new wave - The growth in multinationals' Chinese ventures Hundreds of foreign companies have tested the Chinese water with a joint venture or two. The China wave, however, is moving fast as many companies learn from their experience, decide they are seriously committed, and examine how to proceed. Stephen Shaw and Johannes Meier, in the latest McKinsey Quarterly, say it is too early to develop a set of broadly applicable best practices for companies wishing to expand their Chinese operations. But their survey of companies with ventures in China does reveal a pattern in 'second generation' ventures. They also suggest that some advice often given to companies may already be out of date. One factor separating the first and second generations is the amount of money they are committing. Companies still experimenting have an exposure of an average Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.6m) and plan to raise this to Dollars 50m by 1997. Those at the stage of accepting the many frustrations of doing business in China have already invested an average Dollars 50m and plan to increase their exposure to Dollars 200m within three years. 'No longer is experimentation the goal; the new objective is to build and hold a dominant share of the Chinese market, and to pre-empt, if possible, entry by other multinational corporations - and, very importantly, to do so while making good money along the way,' write Shaw and Meier. The Chinese economic infrastructure is so poor that getting bigger necessitates more ventures rather than larger factories and a national distribution network. Second-generation investors have at least four ventures, and some are into double figures. If you want to dominate in one particular industry, you need to establish links with producers spread around the country. The usual 'know-your-partner' guidelines for new entrants mean time-consuming negotiations with many parties. But the McKinsey writers suggest that experienced companies are increasing their clout, which reduces the need to find complementary objectives with each partner. 'The value added by local operating partners is usually quite low to begin with and steadily declines over time,' they say. Instead, companies are forging relationships with the 'mother-in-law' - the commissions and bureaux which stand above Chinese companies. 'These potential mothers-in-law represent the best route to the permissions, tax concessions, 'locked-in' customers, and central funding they need.' Some companies, such as AT&amp;T and Northern Telecom, have signed agreements with the ultimate mother-in-law, the State Planning Commission. More typical will be relationships with the ministry or bureau overseeing an industry. The McKinsey authors note two ways in which companies are mitigating organisational complexities. First, keep product and marketing strategies simple: concentrate on products with proven success around the world and tailor them for the Chinese as little as possible. Most companies have focused on the three leading urban markets of Shanghai, Guangzhou and Beijing and have kept their production facilities in as few places as possible. But they are increasingly seeking to build their own sales forces and distribution networks. Second, the Chinese government has begun to allow foreign companies with several ventures to set up an 'umbrella' enterprise which helps them to co-ordinate the activities and to appoint senior managers to oversee Chinese operations. The purchasing power of Chinese consumers has soared. The market is huge and offers good returns. Shaw and Meier conclude that for those multinational corporations 'that are not yet second generation players, being left behind has become a real and urgent risk'.</p>

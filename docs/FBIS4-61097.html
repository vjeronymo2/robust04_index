			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondents Viktor Demidenko and </F> Mikhail Melnik]    [Text] Kiev, 3 May -- In order to forego starting up the  second generating set at Chernobyl AES [nuclear electric power  station] and to halt the station's first and third sets, Ukraine  will need over $3 billion. This was stated today in an  exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS correspondents by Ukrainian  Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov after a working meeting  behind closed doors between a G-7 delegation and members of the  Ukrainian Government.    He announced that at least $1 billion would be required  merely to rebuild the protective covering of the fourth  generating set. A further $1.2 billion would be needed to  complete the building of new reactors so as to have room to  maneuver in the energy field. Slightly more than 1 billion would  be required for staff training, for conversion measures, and  also for maintaining the Chernobyl AES after mothballing. The  Ukrainian side insists that the Chernobyl problem should be seen  as a single package.    The ITAR-TASS correspondents learned that the G-7  representatives take a different view on a number of the issues  under discussion. Specifically, they refuse to give any help in  the social area. Tomorrow's meeting will show whether the  Ukrainian side is able to talk them round.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / People: MD for FT Former Reuter and Financial Times journalist John Makinson is to become managing director of The Financial Times next spring. He will be responsible for the production, distribution and marketing of the paper worldwide and will report to chief executive David Bell who himself was a journalist on the FT for much of his career. At the moment, Makinson, who is 38, is one of five partners of Makinson Cowell, an independent consultancy which advises 23 British companies, all with capitalisation larger than Pounds 1bn, on their relations with the financial community. One of its clients is Pearson, owner of the FT. Makinson admits that the transition back to employee status might be difficult but says 'it was just such an exciting opportunity,' But, he adds: 'I was not looking for a job; I was approached by David Bell.' While at the FT, Makinson was approached about a job with a large company and asked Maurice Saatchi to give him a reference. Instead, Saatchi appointed him executive vice president of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's US holding company and he stayed with that company until setting up his own consultancy in 1989. Makinson is a graduate in English and History from Cambridge.</p>

Officials said the British  Government, in consultation with the United Nations High  Commission for Refugees, had halted the convoys as a "prudent  precaution."    They said: "We suspended our aid convoys and we gave advice  and assistance to aid workers to make sure that they made their  way to safe locations against the possibility that they might  find themselves in danger."    The suspension took place from Monday and the decision was  taken as part of contingency arrangements for the safety of aid  workers delivering supplies.    Officials said: "With any luck we shall be able to start  them  again as we have in the past."    But they refused to speculate on the role now of British  troops in Bosnia, who are there to provide protection escort to  the humanitarian operation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The repeated detentions of scores of Lebanese Forces  [LF] personnel and officials on flimsy grounds and excuses harms  the national accord, violates the laws and the Constitution, and  disrupts social peace. Because of this and LF's eagerness to  place a number of facts before Lebanese officials and the  public, the LF would like to ask the state what has become of  the accord and understanding agreement. Is the agreement to end  the war and begin a new chapter still valid or is there a  decision to disregard it? If a decision has been made to retreat  on the accord and understanding agreement, who made this  decision and in whose interest?    The LF reminds everybody that the war in Lebanon is over and  that the Lebanese, who have paid dearly for this war, have the  right to be treated accordingly by their own state. The state  should help them speed up the move toward the peace era instead  of giving the impression that it is responsible for continuing  the atmosphere of tension, fear, and the painful legacy of the  past.    The LF would like to ask about the fate of the general  amnesty law and wonders if there is a need to create incidents  that are mostly fabricated, unsubstantiated, twisted, and  erroneously interpreted to serve narrow and cheap political  goals? The LF would like to ask the state if what is being  applied is a policy of reconciliation or a settling of accounts  and the use of brute force? The Lebanese have a right to know  from the state who is responsible for undermining the accord and  understanding agreement and what are the measures adopted to  straighten things out.    The LF emphasizes that the way it is being treated reflects  a  policy that smacks more of political repression than an exercise  of authority against a political current that enjoys broad  public support. Under this policy, unjust and unreasonable  methods are being used, taking advantage of its institutions and  agencies.    The LF, which has long been calling for the need to turn the  page on the past and proceed to build a future, renews the call  to renounce negative, malicious, and narrow-minded policies and  the settling of accounts and to rise above factional and narrow  interests. It calls on the Lebanese state to realize its role  and responsibilities in this regard by helping all Lebanese to  pursue a positive line instead of acting in a negative manner  that runs contrary to laws, charters, constitutions, and norms.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / TV-maker sees end to a local difficulty: Panasonic Europe has been struggling to find European component suppliers Mr Terry Davies, purchasing director for Panasonic Europe's television division, may be on the verge of a breakthrough. He believes he has found a local source for screws, nuts, bolts and washers - two decades after Panasonic's parent, Matsushita of Japan, established colour television manufacturing operations on Cardiff's Pentwyn Industrial Estate. For 20 years the Cardiff plant, which makes 500,000 sets a year, has imported fastenings from Japan. Local manufacturers simply do not turn out a broad enough range of fixings in sufficient volume to compete on price with Japanese makers. Companies such as Matsushita are anxious to buy from local companies - which means anywhere in Europe. The company spends Pounds 140m a year on goods, including video cabinets from Germany, plastics from Sweden and packaging from the UK. In Cardiff the 21-strong purchasing department is continually looking for additions to Panasonic's list of 150 suppliers. There are sound political reasons for Panasonic's policy. The company wants to be seen as a good Euro-citizen, helping avoid trade friction and giving business to local suppliers. There are also good commercial reasons - for example, delivery of a new design of component from the Far East can take five to six months, compared with a few weeks for the same component sourced locally. The Panasonic experience suggests that things have improved since the days when manufacturers such as International Business Machines of the US complained bitterly that they could not buy components of adequate quality locally. But there are still trouble spots and it seems unlikely that some components will ever be sourced in Europe. Last year about 72 per cent by value of the contents of Panasonic Europe's televisions, up to 33in screen size, came from European suppliers. The lion's share is picture tubes - representing about 40 per cent of the value of a set - from Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France. Mr Davies says he wants to increase local content to 82 per cent by 1996, leaving 11 per cent from south-east Asia and 7 per cent from Japan. The electronic cornerstone of the television set - the printed circuit board  -is a case in point. Last year Panasonic sourced all its boards from Japan and south-east Asia. Mr Davies hopes to buy 25 per cent from Belgium by 1996. The plant used to buy all boards locally, but stopped because of poor quality. Now the problem is quantity. Cardiff can use up to 22,000 boards a day in peak months and local suppliers have been unable to meet the volumes required. The most safety-critical component in a colour television set is the flyback transformer, which generates the thousands of volts needed to drive the picture gun. Cardiff buys more than 75 per cent from Japan and south-east Asia, and about 23 per cent from Mieco, a Matsushita subsidiary in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire. The plan is that by 1996 55 per cent of transformers will come from East Kilbride. Mr Leahy says statutory standards for transformers are higher in Japan than in Europe and Mieco builds to Japanese quality. Replacing Mieco's products from a European-owned company would not be a priority. Similarly, he will 'never' buy electrolytic capacitors, devices which store electric charge, from Europe. The complicated mouldings for the cabinets also come from expatriate Japanese companies - Diaplastics of Bridgend and Munekta in Dublin. Mr Davies says Panasonic's insistence on quality and reliability has markedly improved suppliers' performance. Yet he still detects a greater willingness among Asian companies to make the extra effort to satisfy his needs compared with their European competitors.</p>

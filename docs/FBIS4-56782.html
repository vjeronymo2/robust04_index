			<p>BFN     [Text] The Paraguayan Government -- through the National  Antidrug Secretariat (Senad) -- is coordinating drug enforcement  in the Southern Cone. This was announced on 6 May by Brigadier  General Ramon Rosa Rodriguez (retired), the Senad executive  secretary. He highlighted the key aspects that Argentina,  Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Bolivia, and our country will consider  in fight against trafficking.    Rodriguez said: "The first measure we took was to open a  channel of international communications in the Southern Cone.  We have thus adopted a positive line of action to  internationalize the struggle against trafficking."    He expounded the plan of action followed by Southern Cone  countries as of the 12th International Conference on Drug  Control held in Quito, Ecuador.    On that occasion, Rodriguez was elected drug enforcement  coordinator for the Southern Cone.    "We will take positive lines of action. We attended a  meeting sponsored by the OAS in Mar del Plata [Argentina] three  months ago and, in my view, the presentations by the different  representatives were lacking in strength," he said.    "It all ended in expressions of goodwill, brotherhood, and  the like. Now, through the communications channel, we have  established an action mechanism. Any Southern Cone country will  now have recourse to another by fax, telephone, or other  mechanism at hand to ask for help or to exchange information,"  he explained.    The plan's second point deals with the furthering of the  regionalization process by member countries. Rodriguez noted  that "Southern Cone countries have pledged to participate in  joint operations at least once a year."    "This does not mean that we will work in other countries.  Each country will pursue an established and coordinated task  according to its possibilities," he said.    Rodriguez added: "We are interested in two things:  Marijuana,  our number one problem, and cocaine, which we must combat on  account of an international commitment. We can now receive  direct aid -- without much red tape -- through the  communications channel. This means that aid must be granted to  any country in the region that requests it."    Another subject Rodriguez broached pertains to the legal  framework, which in his view, partly favors drug enforcement and  partly does not.    "This is quite a broad subject. The seizure of 2 kg of  cocaine from some Japanese citizens, who offered police  personnel a $10,000 bribe and were released by a judge from the  Caaguazu area after a week in jail, is just one example," he  noted.</p>

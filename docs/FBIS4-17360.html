			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed OBSHCHAYA GAZETA report under the "The Press" </F> rubric: "Knowledgeable People Conduct Investigation on `Version  No. 1'"]    [Text] The General Prosecutor's Office is continuing its  investigation into the libel case, filed on 28 March, against  officials to whom the author of "Version No. 1" ascribed the  preparation of an anti-Yeltsin conspiracy.    The circle of people asked for questioning as witnesses  keeps  widening. The office of Aleksandr Gorbunov, investigator of  especially important cases under the Russian Federation general  prosecutor, has already been visited by both the OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA founder and staffers of its politics desk. Aleksandr  Yakovlev and Oleg Poptsov are expected to testify.    Mr. Gorbunov has stressed specially that the instituted case  has nothing to do with OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. If one is to judge  from his questions, the investigation's attention is centered  not so much on the authors of the notorious document (who  obviously have been identified) as on the need to "pinpoint" the  channels along which it was circulated, and the persons  interested in that. If this is how it really is, the  publication in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA, too, pursued the same goal.    As is known to the editorial office, Gleb Pavlovskiy, the  "legal" author of the analytical note, has stated that he will  decline to testify, believing the prosecutor's office actions  unlawful. His arguments are like this: The text of the  "Version" speaks about an intention to remove the president from  power, not by a forcible and unlawful way but by legal means.  Hence the prosecutor's office has no grounds for instituting a  libel case that entails charges of committing an especially  dangerous crime against the State (Article 130, Part 3, Russian  Federation Criminal Code). Pavlovskiy maintains that he and his  colleagues are being subjected to groundless pressure primarily  from the Federal Counterintelligence Service. It is this  pressure, as well as direct threats, according to Pavlovskiy,  that force him and his colleague, Simon Kordonskiy, co-director  of the "The 20th Century and Peace" analytical center, whom  KURANTY recently named (together with Andrey Makarov, Mikhail  Lukin, and Pavlovskiy himself) as a co-author of the "Version,"  to hide from the authorities. In Kordonskiy's opinion, the  scandal around the publication has generally been used by the  Federal Counterintelligence Service to convince the president of  its loyalty, to become stronger, and to feel around for ways to  revive political police in Russia.</p>

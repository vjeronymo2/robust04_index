			<p>BFN     [Text] In Oslo today, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat said that  he is committed to the Document of Principles [DOP] signed with  Israel, and that he opposes violence and terror. He further  claimed that his remarks were taken out of context, saying that  when speaking about jihad, he meant a religious, nonviolent  struggle and that his remarks were misconstrued in Israel.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz was told that upon  his  arrival in Oslo, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres announced that  he would boycott all the events he was scheduled to attend with  'Arafat until the PLO head personally announced his commitment  to the DOP and declared his opposition to violence and terror,  and declared his support for peace.    It has just been reported that Minister Peres indeed  boycotted a luncheon with former U.S. President Carter and PLO  Chairman 'Arafat. Before holding the joint news conference in  which 'Arafat made the above announcement, Peres consulted Prime  Minister Rabin regarding the steps he should take during his  stopover in Stockholm.

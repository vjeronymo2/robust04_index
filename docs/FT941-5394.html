			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Arts: Tenderness on a dark road - Opera On Friday, for his 65th birthday, Bernard Haitink spent the evening conducting a new production of Katya Kabanova at his artistic home, the Royal Opera. For several reasons it was an inspired choice, not least because Janacek himself was the same age in 1920, when he started work on what was arguably to be his greatest operatic achievement. In this short opera he distilled a life's understanding of men and women - especially women. By and large the female sex has not been a central interest of the major 20th-century opera composers and even Strauss with his colourful gallery of female portraits generally sees women from the male point of view. Janacek is the exception: even as he was composing Katya Kabanova he noted that people accused him of writing nothing but 'female operas'. Of all his heroines, none calls for our sympathy more poignantly than poor, adulterous Katya. A dreamer desperate to escape an unsatisfactory marriage, she finds herself at first trapped, then vilified and finally outcast by a closed, rural community that is not prepared to understand or forgive. No woman is better drawn in modern opera and it is the job of the producer to put her case across. A good pointer to a production's intentions is how it relates Katya to the countryside around her on the banks of the Volga. In Scottish Opera's recent production it became a wintry landscape in front of a cyclorama of drifting clouds; in Vienna in the 1970s it was a flat marshland, featureless, unending. For the Royal Opera's production, designed by Maria Bjornson, Trevor Nunn has tried something different: a long, dark road that swirls down into a bottomless gloom. It is never quite clear whether Nunn intends this to be a naturalistic view of the opera or one that is symbolic. His picture of peasant life in the backwaters of 19th-century Russia features real horses pulling carts and real rain pouring down in the thunderstorm, yet the winding road remains an ominous presence throughout. There are no indoor scenes at all, not even the family home to act as Katya's prison. The visual prospect may sound bleak, but it is warmed by the human qualities of the characters as Nunn sees them. When Katya stands in the centre of his vortex of a set, she looks a helpless young soul, unable to resist the forces dragging her down. Elena Prokina plays her simply and naturally. There is not much sense of the frustration ready to explode from within, but Prokina is very affecting and sings the music extremely well. In this production no caricatures are allowed. Eva Randova barely hints that Kabanicha can be a dragon of a mother-in-law. She underplays the role, doing it the hard way, and shows how devastating a subtle exterior to this tyrant of a woman can be. It is a shame that her scene with Gwynne Howell's shambling Dikoy (a relationship that often smacks of masochism) goes for so little. The lack of an interior is a drawback there, as elsewhere. Kim Begley's put-upon husband seemed stronger than usual, not a whining ninny; Keith Olsen's Boris, cleanly and confidently sung, was conversely a frightened rabbit before the lovers' tryst. For Katya to be caught between two weak men only makes her tragedy the more poignant. Monica Groop's Varvara and Christopher Ventris's burly Kudrjas were an unaffected couple, not coy as can happen. At Glyndebourne a couple of years back the opera worked at a high level of intensity. Haitink's Janacek is not like that. He takes his time, making sure that the orchestra is kept low so that the singers can play in an atmosphere of quiet, conversational intimacy. In the end there is not enough tension, but for its infinite tenderness and human sympathy Haitink's performance could hardly be more moving. In that respect the 65-year-old Janacek has found a meeting of minds. Sponsored by The Friends of Covent Garden and the Royal Opera Trust. Performances continue until March 25.</p>

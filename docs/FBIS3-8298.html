			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 7 (TANJUG) -- Yugoslav Prime  Minister Radoje Kontic said on Monday that the establishing of a  peace in the territory of the former Yugoslavia is his  government's priority and that the urgent lifting of the U.N.  sanctions would considerably speed up this process.    The sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  border on a genocide against a nation and their consequences  have acquired the proportions of war operations, Kontic said  during talks in Belgrade with a delegation of the Greek  committee for humanitarian aid to the people of the former  Yugoslavia.    The Yugoslav Information Ministry announced that Kontic said  that the sanctions are counterproductive and are an expression  of the inability of the international community to resolve  regional conflicts. Underscoring Greece's objective approach to  the resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, Kontic said that the  tragedy in the former Yugoslavia would not have occurred if the  other members of the European Community had taken the same stand.    Kontic expressed gratitude to the Greek delegation, headed  by  the honorary president of the World Council for Peace and the  president of the Greek Anti-War Committee, Evangelos Makheras,  for everything Athens and the Greek people have done for the  resolution of the Yugoslav crisis and in sending the  humanitarian aid which has saved many lives and reduced the  suffering of the people.    "We believe that Greece, as the chairman of the European  Union, will do everything towards reaching a political solution  to the Yugoslav crisis, and this will be the biggest  humanitarian aid," Kontic said.    Makheras pointed out that the lifting of the sanctions is a  priority of the Greek Anti-War Committee and the committee for  aiding the people of the former yugoslavia. "We are opposed to  all forms of sanctions because they are aimed against the  people," he said. Makheras informed Kontic that his  humanitarian organization had three months ago requested from  the U.N. sanctions committee permission to send an additional  550 tonnes of relief aid, but has received no answer so far.  Although humanitarian aid is exempt from the sanctions, it  arrives in Yugoslavia infrequently and in insufficient  quantities due to the inefficiency of the U.N. sanctions  committee.    The almost two-year strict blockade of Yugoslavia has  gravely  affected the health and living standards of the 10.5 million  Yugoslavs and some 600,000 registered refugees from the former  Yugoslav republics.</p>

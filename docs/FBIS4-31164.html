			<p>BFN     [Text] The government held its regular weekly session  today. Some of the session was dedicated to relations between  Slovenia and Croatia, especially in light of President Milan  Kucan's announced visit to Zagreb. He is expected to travel  there on 7 June. As it is customary, a news conference was held  after the session. Our colleague Nadja Pengov was mostly  interested in relations between Slovenia and Croatia:    [Begin Pengov recording] The government conclusions were  explained by Foreign Ministry State Secretary Peter Vencelj, who  said the following: Matija Malesic, Slovene ambassador to  Croatia, yesterday met with Croatian Prime Minister Valentic.  Nikica Valentic told our ambassador that Croatia will continue  with the construction of a border crossing near Secovlje and  that the border crossing will be finished before the beginning  of the tourist season. Work is underway and should be completed  by the end of the week. Nikica Valentic here also said that he  was aware of the controversial nature of the construction,  however, that Croatia can no longer wait for a resolution of  this problem. The information received indicates that Croatia  is not inclined to the Slovene proposal regarding Secovlje and  sailing in Piran Bay -- according to which temporarily, until  this issue is finally resolved, Croatia would assume the manning  of the Secovlje border crossing while Slovenia would supervise  all of Piran Bay. The final verdict on this will be given by  the Croatian Government at the session that started today at  noon.    Bearing in mind that the conclusions of the Croatian  Government are not known at this moment, our government has  decided not to make any decisions concerning President Kucan's  visit to Zagreb for the time being. Whether the government will  propose that President Kucan visit Zagreb or not will be decided  by Prime Minister Drnovsek upon receipt of information on the  Croatian Government stance on the Slovene proposal concerning  the Secovlje border crossing and Piran Bay.

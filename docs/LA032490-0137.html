			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> HONIG TELLS PLAN TO STEER MORE TO COLLEGE  </P> <P> State superintendent of public instruction Bill Honig on Friday detailed an  ambitious partnership plan between community colleges and high schools, aimed  at steering 25% of high school graduates to four-year universities and another  25% to community colleges or technical schools by the year 2000.  </P> <P> Speaking before educators gathered at the Westin South Coast Plaza in Costa  Mesa for a "Plus in Partnership" conference, Honig warned that the plan cannot  work unless educators make "a radical shift in the way we do business."  </P> <P> "We're going to have to reconstruct our entire curriculum," Honig said in his  luncheon address. "We're going to have to redevelop courses. . . . We're going  to have to make structural changes within our classrooms."  </P> <P> The partnership plan -- known in education circles as "articulation," or a  planned process linking together two or more educational systems -- calls for  teachers at both levels to form curricula that will smooth the transition  between high school and college or technical school.  </P> <P> The restructuring will also help direct students bound for four-year colleges  to the appropriate high school courses to pursue career goals.  </P> <P> The goal, Honig said, is to raise the percentage of high school graduates  seeking bachelor's degrees from current levels of about 12% to 25% by the year  2000, and of those seeking associate's degrees or completion of technical  school from the current 19% to 25%.  </P> <P> In a separate plan, Honig said the state hopes to develop partnerships with  business that would steer an additional 40% of graduates directly to the  workplace, leaving a projected dropout rate of about 10%.  </P> <P> "We're going to make it in this country on how effectively we get these kids  into technical jobs," Honig said.  </P> <P> Honig said partnership programs between high schools and community colleges  should be geared toward four areas of academic achievement: basic academic  skills, helping students develop personal goals, training students to work in  groups (or "cooperative learning") and specific technical training.  </P> <P> David Mertes, chancellor of the state's community colleges, preceded Honig at  the podium and said educators will "have to rise to new levels of interaction  with each other" to succeed in bridging the gap between secondary schools and  community colleges.  </P> <P> He also said concerted efforts by college and business recruiters must be "an  ongoing act" if students are to be comfortably eased into institutions of  higher learning or the workplace.  </P> <P> Honig said that while teachers, administrators and businessmen facing a severe  shortage of technical workers are eager to start the program, developing lines  of communications among institutions will be difficult and take time.  </P> <P> "We're talking about institutions that have never worked together," Honig said  after his address. "We're talking about making teachers at two different levels  jointly responsible for 100 students."  </P> <P> Despite the potential obstacles, Honig added, educators throughout the state  are "very excited" about the partnership plan.  </P> <P> "We want to say to you that it is very high on our agenda," Honig told the  audience.

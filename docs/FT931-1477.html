			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wetherspoon advances by 47% to Pounds 1.49m JD WETHERSPOON, the chain of Greater London pubs floated in October, increased pre-tax profits 47 per cent to Pounds 1.49m in the six months to January 31. Sales rose 32 per cent to Pounds 13.2m, but earnings per share fell from 6.9p to 6.1p because of the greater number of shares in issue following the flotation. The first interim dividend is 1.8p. The company had 44 pubs open at the time of the flotation, and has since increased its estate to 58. Mr Tim Martin, chairman, said: 'Since the flotation, the company has obtained five additional licences to convert unlicensed premises into pubs and has also purchased a large existing pub from a brewer.' He said the new establishments had made a promising start and would make a significant contribution to earnings in the second half. The original 44 pubs continued to perform well, with food sales particularly strong. Costs as a percentage of turnover were higher than the corresponding period last year because of the expense of opening new pubs and the higher proportion of leasehold pubs which were free of tie. Some 14.68m shares, representing 51 per cent of the enlarged capital, were floated at 160p.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Salmon farms blamed for parasite problem - An infestation outbreak that is irritating anglers in the west of Ireland A HUMBLE sea-louse with a gourmet's taste for the tender flesh of salmon and sea trout has succeeded in producing a rash of invective, verbal inflammation and much scratching of heads among homo sapiens in the west of Ireland. Lepeoptheirus Salmonis is a parasite of salmonid species such as salmon and sea trout, which was largely unheard of until salmon farming started becoming an important industry in the region in the mid-1980s. In 1989, however, the wild sea trout fisheries in the west of Ireland collapsed. Catches by anglers on rivers between Galway Bay and Clew Bay fell to less than 10 per cent of the levels they had been just a few years before. Many of those that were caught were found to be in poor condition and heavily infested with sea-lice. On some rivers the return of adult spawning fish from the sea fell to less than 20 per cent of previously recorded minimum levels. 'It is disastrous. In Connemara, there used to be 500 rods a day fishing over a 100-day season. It's all gone,' says Mr Vincent O'Reilly, chairman of the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland. The finger of blame was quickly pointed at the salmon and trout farms. There are 34 in Ireland, most of them concentrated in the bays and estuaries along the Galway and Connemara coastline. They produce almost 10,000 tonnes of fish a year, most of which ends up as smoked sides on dinner tables from Nice to New York. Big companies have invested millions of pounds in the industry. The floating cages in which tens of thousands of salmon are kept together for fattening are like five-star hotels to the lowly lepeoptheirus, the concentrated shoals of their favourite food offering ideal grazing and breeding grounds. Lice control has become one of the major management problems on the farms. The adult lice release millions of larvae into water, ready to reinfect other farmed salmon and, it is alleged, the wild sea trout. Efforts to control the lice with chemicals such as dichlorvos have upset shellfish farmers and ecologist groups, who claim that damage is being caused to the marine environment by their use. A study carried out by the Sea Trout Working Group, an ad hoc body set up by the government last year to draw together all the scientific data available on the problem, found that 94 per cent of lice larvae production in the worst-affected western region originated from farmed salmon. The study concluded that 'on a broad geographic scale there was a broad correspondence between total larvae production estimates and the level of infestation of sea trout.' That was sufficient prima facie evidence for the angling and specialist hoteliers' lobby to demand that the farms either be relocated or the sea-lice problem brought under control. But the fish farmers did not agree, and the working group itself pointed out: 'It is still not possible, on the basis of larval production figures, to demonstrate a significant correlation between production of sea-lice larvae from salmon farms and subsequent infestation of sea trout in individual embayments, despite the large numbers of sea lice being produced at salmon cages and the small numbers originating from wild salmonids.' With the scientific evidence inconclusive, the sea-louse war has degenerated into a welter of mutual recriminations and mud slinging with the government uncomfortably trying to straddle the line dividing the salmon farmers on one hand, and the anglers, hoteliers and even its own fisheries officers on the other. Mr Michael Woods, the minister for the marine, in announcing stop-gap measures authorising additional research and monitoring last May told parliament: 'My objective is to ensure the well-being of the wild fishery and the angling tourism industry, which is worth IPounds 74m (Pounds 70m) a year, as well as of the salmon farming industry, both (of which) make a major economic and social contribution to the community in the west of Ireland.' A recent study by the Economic and Social Research Institute in Dublin estimates that some IPounds 80m has been invested in the Irish fish-farming industry over the past 10 years, producing an output worth some IPounds 25m a year. Interestingly, the ESRI study also found that many of the farms were being run at a loss. On the other hand, a lucrative up-market tourism industry is being badly hit. Mr Brian Flynn, the western regional manager of the government's Tourism Board says: 'It is largely a market for high-spending overseas visitors. The sea trout fishing has been very important for this area but we can no longer promote what was a quality product. It no longer exists here. People who have invested for that market have lost it.' One such person is Mr Peter Mantle, the owner of the 'Delphi Lodge' in Connemara. He has invested IPounds 1m in developing a wild fishery and luxury accommodation for anglers over the past seven years. 'Bookings have completely collapsed in the past two years,' he says. Mr Michael O'Brien, the owner of the 'Angler's Paradise' in Killarney, south of where the principal problems have occured says: 'Our sea-trout fisheries around here have gone to the dogs as well.' His bookings are down by 70 per cent this year. Similar tales are told by hoteliers catering for the market throughout the western region. The regional fisheries boards have largely endorsed the anglers' and hoteliers' perception of the problem. Mr Michael Kennedy, regional manager of the Western Region Fisheries Board, says: 'As far as we are concerned the lice from the farms are the cause of the problems. In a bay there might normally be between 2,000 and 5,000 wild salmon. If each has five lice, that's only 25,000 in total. On one farm you may have 1m fish, and if each has five lice that's 5m. There's the problem.' The Irish Salmon Growers Association, the lobby group for the fish-farming industry, which now shares offices with the powerful Irish Farmers' Association, is counter-attacking by alleging that the wild salmon are the cause of louse infections in their otherwise healthy farmed fish and are demanding seats on the regional fisheries boards, which they feel have turned against the farmers. 'That would be like letting the fox look after the hen house,' remarks one hotelier who has lost many angling customers. Mr James Ryan, the owner of a fish farm in the estuary of the Delphi fishery and a key figure in the ISGA says: 'The sea-lice are a red herring. There are always fluctuations and cycles in wild fish stocks. Those that have invested in angling lodges and are losing money are looking for a scapegoat in the fish farming industry'. He admits that 'there may be a problem' in the scale of the current collapse in the western fisheries, but points out that climatic, environmental and disease problems could also be the cause. However, disease and environmental problems have largely been ruled out as the cause by the STWG and Dr Ken Whelan, head of the Salmon Research Agency in Galway and a member of the STWG, says: 'I don't think anyone can deny that lice are the major factor in the collapse of the fisheries.' He and Mr Kennedy point to the experience of Clew Bay where a salmon farm was closed in 1990 because of disease problems. The sea trout numbers recovered in 1991. A new licence was then granted to reopen the farm in 1992 'and the lice problem on the sea trout has recurred in a very serious manner,' he says. The problem with proving their case, however, is that the ways of the juvenile sea-lice remain a mystery to the scientists. Their survival times and distribution patterns in tidal waters are largely unknown. The conclusive link remains elusive. Until further research is completed, it seems that lepeoptheirus will continue to be a major source of irritation not only to the salmon and trout, but to their farmers and anglers as well.</p>

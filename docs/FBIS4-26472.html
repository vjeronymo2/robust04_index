			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 22 (XINHUA) -- The lasting -- even  growing -- influence of the five principles of peaceful  co-existence, first formulated by China, have been underlined  here in the run-up to the 40th anniversary of the "birthday" of  these tenets.    The five principles, which were first proposed by China and  were then initially advocated by China, India and Myanmar (the  former Burma) have had great impact on China's diplomacy and  international relations, said former Chinese Foreign Minister  Huang Hua in a recent interview with XINHUA.    In the interview, the veteran diplomat said that the five  principles of peaceful co-existence, namely mutual respect for  sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression,  non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and  mutual benefit and peaceful co-existence, were the result of a  developing process.    Back on the eve of the founding of New China, Huang  recalled,  late Chairman Mao Zedong had spelled out three principles --  equality, mutual benefit and mutual respect for territory and  sovereignty -- as the basis for China to establish diplomatic  links with foreign countries.    Huang, foreign minister in the late 1970s and early 1980s,  recalled that China proposed the addition of "non-interference  in each other's internal affairs" as a new principle to the  above three principles in a Sino-Soviet pact signed in February,  1950.    At a meeting in Beijing with an Indian Government delegation  in December, 1953, late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai put forward  for the first time the five principles of peaceful co-existence,  which met with warm response from India, Huang said.    On June 28, 1954, China and India issued a joint statement  in  which the two countries affirmed that the five principles of  peaceful co-existence should be the criterion guiding bilateral  relations, Huang noted.    "And that day was regarded as the birthday of the five  principles," he said, adding that on the same month, these  principles were also clearly stated in a Sino-Burmese statement.    The five principles received warm support from  newly-independent countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America,  Huang continued.    The five principles had been accepted by more and more  countries and international organizations after the Bandung  Conference in April, 1954, in Indonesia, at which ten principles  were drawn up on the basis of the five principles, Huang said.    Fu Hao, former deputy foreign minister of China, said that  the five principles played an important role in making New  China's voice heard across the world when China was blocked and  relatively isolated.    Fu, a political counsellor of the Chinese Embassy in India  in  the 1950s, said that Sino-Indian relations improved quickly  after the proclamation of the five principles, and "China fever"  was seen in India as a result.    The Indian people often mentioned the five principles when  meeting with Chinese personnel.    The then Indian ambassador to China, the second ambassador  to  this country, before leaving his post for home, asked Chairman  Mao's signature as a memento. Mao obliged by writing two lines  of ancient Chinese verse on a white paper cover of a fan: "A  bosom friend afar brings the distance closer."    Former Deputy Foreign Minister Han Nianlong said the five  principles had undergone dozens of years of tests in a changing  world.    Time had shown that international relations could not be  handled fairly and reasonably in the forms of big family, group  politics, power sphere or world leader, Han said.    He added that the five principles, emphasizing solving  international conflicts through negotiations and talks on equal  footings, are in keeping with the developing trend of the world.    Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and former  foreign minister, believed that the five principles are  important in the international arena because they go beyond the  limits by social system and ideology, and conform to the  principles of sovereignty and equality specified in the United  Nations charter.    Wu added that the five principles are clearer and easier to  understand than the UN Charter.    On the current significance of the five principles, Liu  Shuqing, president of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign  Affairs and former vice-foreign minister, said the five  principles had always put a rein on the practices of hegemonism  and power politics.    Despite the end of the Cold War, Liu said, the phenomenon of  unfair play is very common in world affairs, and peace and  development are facing serious challenges.    In recent years, a few powers, propagating "sovereignty is  outmoded," and "human rights ahead of sovereignty," have tried  to interfere in other countries' internal affairs, Liu said,  which indicates that though the five principles have been  accepted by the world, not all countries act accordingly.    "At present many countries are very concerned with  establishing a new international political and economic order,"  Liu said.    "What kind of new order does the world need? it is clear  that the new order cannot be just and reasonable and accepted by  most countries unless it is based on the five principles of  peaceful co-existence," he stressed.</p>

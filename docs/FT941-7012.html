			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets: Shares sink as the cash tide flows out - London In like a lion, out like a lamb. We shall see whether March's proverbial reputation applies to the stock market as well as the weather. Certainly the last week of February has been tempestuous with a net fall of 100 points on the FT-SE 100. Whether that makes the stock market a lion is another matter. This week it looked more like a lamb being led to the sacrifice to atone for losses incurred by the speculative US hedge funds. By Thursday it seemed that the dam had well and truly burst - not the Malaysian one which is still shoring up all sorts of possible troubles for the UK government and companies, but the dam which has been supporting the reservoir of liquid funds sloshing about world financial markets in search of yield. The crack which appeared when the Federal Reserve tightened three weeks ago widened this week to let through a flood of selling, particularly in the futures markets, threatening to carry away bond and equity markets alike. It would be dangerous to spend too much energy trying to rationalise what happened. There is little relevance to fundamentals if UK equities are falling because of forced selling by leveraged investors whose original mistake was to mis-judge the yen-dollar rate. True, the worries in the New York bond market and a few choice words from the chancellor's panel of independent forecasters raised doubts about the UK interest rate trend. But none of the panel actually called for rates to increase, and it is hard to see that happening while inflation remains low and April's tax increases are as yet undigested. The yield on equities is almost exactly twice that on gilts which does not suggest they are particularly expensive. Equities' relationship with index-linked gilts is less comfortable. The yield premium against five-year index-linked issues has narrowed to only 1 percentage point from 2.4 points a year ago. That suggests equities have little room to forge ahead unless gilts rally and real yields fall again. There is a chance of this happening once the hedge fund turmoil is over. With muted inflationary expectations, yields of around 7 per cent gilts look appealing. The premium of nearly a full percentage point over German government issues may also attract overseas money but it would be foolish to expect the hedge fund liquidity to reappear in a hurry. Since equities are still trading on a relatively high price/earnings multiple of around 23 times, the focus may shift away from those stocks which benefit from falling interest rates towards those like manufacturing and engineering issues which have genuine recovery potential. Provided these can produce a strong earnings growth, there may be little need for worry. If not, more trouble may lie ahead. So far the company reported season has produced earnings just about in line with expectations, with dividends overall slightly ahead of expectations. The dividend record is distorted, however, by a few companies such as Glaxo which have paid out exceptionally large increases. The picture afforded by this week's results is distinctly mixed. Some dividends were deceptively flattering. On Tuesday Unilever increased its annual payment by 17 per cent to 25.03p per share in spite of a Pounds 490m restructuring charge and evident pressure on its branded goods market. Shell Transport accompanied Thursday's announcement of a mere 3 per cent rise in profits to Pounds 3.23bn with a 9.6 per cent increase in its dividend. Both groups paid only modest increases in guilder dividends, though, so the UK increase largely reflected currency movements. Unilever ended the week off 76p at Pounds 11.30. Shell was down 27p at 702. National Westminster's 6 per cent dividend increase on Thursday disappointed after much higher payments by other banks, but NatWest is also plagued by a relatively low capital base, sluggish loan demand and dependence on trading profits. NatWest's shares finished the week down 42p at 497p. In the real world of manufacturing, ICI's trading statement on Thursday was marginally positive at best. Its 78 per cent increase in annual profits to Pounds 290m was boosted by the effect of restructuring and exchange rate movements and the dividend was held unchanged at 27.5p. The shares fell only 20p to 754p on the week, perhaps because of earlier under-performance. British Aerospace increased its dividend by 19 per cent in spite of reporting a Pounds 237m pre-tax loss on Wednesday after an exceptional charge to cover further possible losses on aircraft leases. The higher dividend reflects a swing in operating profits to a Pounds 229m profit from a loss of Pounds 66m in 1992, which seems to justify BAe's contention that it has finally turned round. The 8.3p dividend, though, is a long way short of the 25p paid as recently as 1991. The shares closed down 21p at 505p Exceptional charges pushed British Gas into a loss of Pounds 285m from a profit of Pounds 681m in 1992. Though it expects a 50 per cent gross return on its Pounds 1.65bn restructuring programme, the cash cost will be considerable when gearing is rising. What with that, its price cap, the threatened loss of market share as competition develops and the low cover of 1.4 times, British Gas looks pushed to deliver real dividend growth. Its payment increased only marginally to 14.5p per share from 14.2p and its shares fell 23p to 318p Finally, the clearing banks decided to cash in their gains and float the venture capital group 3i on the stock market this summer. There will undoubtedly be considerable interest in what could become a new FT-SE100 company. Yet if the banks, who have waited long enough, think now is a good time to sell, it may not be the best moment to buy.</p>

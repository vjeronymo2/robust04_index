There is "a group of unarmed coca producers who, at the  first  attempt to force them to reduce their plantations, will blow  their pututos [native Bolivian musical instrument] to summon the  people."    Felipe Caceres, conflicts secretary of the Coca Growers  Federation, said that if necessary the growers will arm  themselves with sticks, machetes, picks, and big hoes to drive  away those who try to destroy the plantations without giving  anything in exchange." [no opening quotation marks as published]    Caceres said that the coca growers only seek to protect  their  interests and that "under no circumstances do we intend to  protect drug traffickers. We believe trafficking is one of the  scourges to affect the Chapare zone. It brings unrest to the  coca growers. The repression organizations, however, should  take care of this task. We should not interfere in this work."    The peasants declared a general mobilization at the  grassroots level after government organizations this week  destroyed seven hectares of plantations in Senda Bayer and Villa  Pagador, the excuse being that maceration pits used for  producing cocaine paste had been found nearby.    The peasant organizations have organized "union watch  groups"  to control any infiltration of alien individuals who seek to mar  the coca growers' image.    The coca growers have thus managed to halt the government  elimination of what it regards as surplus plantations which,  according to the government, surpasses 35,000 hectares in the  Chapare and Yungas region.</p>

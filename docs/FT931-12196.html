			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / The Property Market: PSA's 'catalogue of disaster' - A select committee inquiry into the shortcomings of the government agency has cast a cloud over the final stage of its privatisation A new chapter opened in the unhappy history of the Property Services Agency this week, as the government launched the last stage of its privatisation. It did not get off to an auspicious start. On Monday, the government announced the tender of Building Management, the largest part of the agency to be privatised. Just two days later, the agency's shortcomings were on display as the all-party Public Accounts Committee scrutinised the 1991-92 accounts of PSA Services. The committee grilled Sir Geoffrey Chipperfield, the permanent secretary of PSA Services, about write-offs of Pounds 12.8m in uncollected debts lost in a paper chase of invoices and inter-departmental disputes. One committee member described it as 'a catalogue of disaster'. The MPs feared that these problems did not augur well for the sale. 'What will be the effect of these uncollected debts on the value of the companies?' asked one member. 'The facts we have been discussing will have some depreciatory effect on the value of the company.' 'History is always with us and a purchaser will look at our short commercial history and the mistakes that have been made,' agreed Sir Geoffrey. In his view, the agency's shortcomings are in the past and would not significantly affect values. Mr John Anderson, an executive director of Bovis Construction, which was called into the PSA 15 months ago to improve its management agreed. 'We have endeavoured to make the organisation more commercial. We have been impressed by the way in which the people in this business have actually tackled this task,' he told the select committee. But improving the PSA's management, which has long been criticised for inefficiency, is a daunting task. 'Few if any government agencies have come under heavier fire,' said the Centre for Policy Studies in a 1988 paper entitled The Property Services Agency - a Case for Demolition. It accused the PSA, which then employed a 24,707-strong staff managing 11m acres with a turnover exceeding Pounds 3bn, of being a 'Byzantine bureaucracy'. It quoted evidence given to select committees of 'over management, a slow decision-making process, and a lack of urgency and energy in management'. Moreover, the PSA had neglected maintenance, had failed to identify opportunities to rationalise the estate and was insensitive to the needs of conservation. With property accounting for 15 per cent of the cost of government administration, there was a clear need to improve the efficiency of its property business. The first step in the overhaul of the agency was breaking it into PSA Services (comprising PSA Projects, its construction arm, and the Building Management business) and Property Holdings, which controls the government's office portfolio and remains part of the Department of the Environment. The monopoly of PSA Services was then removed by opening government contracts up to competition. The final stage of the overhaul is the disposal of PSA Services, which began two months ago with the sale of PSA Projects to Tarmac, the construction and building materials group. The sale proved controversial because of the unexpectedly high costs associated with it. It involved a government payment of Pounds 54.9m to cover unpaid bills and to meet the cost of putting the business on a commercial footing. The government will also pay some Pounds 40m to cover costs of redundancies, since only 800 of the 1,500 staff have agreed to transfer to Tarmac. The disposal of Building Management - which has been broken up for sale as five separate businesses based in Edinburgh, Manchester, Leeds, Bristol and London - once again raises concern that the government will have to foot an excessively high bill for redundancies. The cost of redundancies at Building Management, with five times as many staff as PSA Projects, could be far higher than in the earlier disposal. It is not yet clear how many of Building Management's staff will choose to opt for redundancy or a temporary secondment to the buyer, which in many cases amounts to a deferred redundancy. The CPSA, the union for administrative grades, expects no more than half of its members to transfer permanently. 'No one will be enthusiastic about going from a job in the civil service to a job in the construction industry, which works on a hire and fire basis,' says a representative of the Institute of Managerial and Professional Staffs, another trade union. Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm advising the government, believes the unions are being excessively pessimistic about the proportion of staff that will choose to leave. It believes that the costs of redundancy will be offset by the sums that buyers will be willing to pay for the businesses. 'My belief is that there will be strong interest in the businesses. We will be offered good prices which will offset the redundancy costs,' says Andrew Jordan, a partner. He reports that more than 70 companies have expressed interest in the five Building Management businesses. These include contractors, consultants, utilities and building management companies. The response reflects the attraction of acquiring government contracts lasting up to five years and of gaining a significant share of the market in a single transaction. 'Five years of work is something that many people in the construction industry would give their eye teeth for,' says Mr Jordan. But will the advantages of buying a few years of government work outweigh doubts about the businesses' ability to win future contracts? Many in the industry are sceptical. 'I suspect PSA will not have very much competitive advantage,' says one of its rivals. 'PSA does not enjoy the best relations with government. The brand name is lousy.' But the PSA's poor record is not just a stumbling block for the success of this privatisation - it is also part of its rationale. Whatever the costs and controversy involved in its dismantling, there is a good chance that the management of the government's estate will be better as a result.</p>

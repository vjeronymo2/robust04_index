			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Israel Air Force jets this morning attacked  Hizballah targets in the Jabal Safi area of south Lebanon. An  IDF [Israel Defense Forces] spokesman reported that all our  planes returned safely to base. The pilots reported accurate  hits against their targets.    Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe reports that  the area attacked is under the full control of the Hizballah  organization, and the targets served as training bases and  staging points for terrorist attacks.

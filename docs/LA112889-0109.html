			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CABLE TV FIRMS CONSIDER RATE HIKE  </P> <P> Cable television companies in Orange County expect to raise subscriber rates  from $1.50 to $2.70 a month to offset what they described as "shocking and  unbelievable" increases in their property taxes, company representatives said  Monday.  </P> <P> "We have to do a pass-through," said Joe Casasanta, general manager for the  Tustin-based Continental Cablevision. "To say it mildly, I was shocked."  </P> <P> Casasanta said his cable company is appealing a 400% increase in the property  tax bill received last summer. But in order to make up the additional $170,000,  Continental is anticipating a rate increase for its 10,000 subscribers of about  $2 a month.  </P> <P> Nearly a dozen other cable companies in Orange County are appealing or prepared  to appeal the new assessments and higher property tax bills, according to  industry officials. One cable television spokesman said cable companies would  be paying an average 300% increase on their property tax bills.  </P> <P> The dispute between the cable companies and County Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs  centers on the technique that the assessor's office is using to compute the  taxes of the cable companies. The worth of the companies is being increased by  adding the value of "intangible assets," said Douglas Mo, a San Francisco  attorney representing the cable companies appealing the tax bills before the  Assessment Appeals Board.  </P> <P> Mo said some of the intangibles include the company's customer base, good  relations among customers, ongoing marketing efforts and the right to operate  exclusively within an area.  </P> <P> Jacobs said the matter of the cable company assessments was under appeal and he  could not discuss it.  </P> <P> The largest cable company in the county, Dimension Cable, operated by Times  Mirror Cable Television, has yet to receive its property tax bill from the  county.  </P> <P> "We find ourselves in a strange position of asking for our property tax bill,"  said Dick Waterman, director of corporate affairs for Times Mirror Cable  Television. Waterman said if Dimension's tax bill follows the pattern of  others, it is almost certain there would be a rate increase.  </P> <P> Waterman said the property tax increases for the companies could eventually  impact 450,000 households in Orange County with cable television. Dimension has  more than 100,000 subscribers in South County.  </P> <P> "It is really a consumer issue," Waterman said, adding that the 450,000  households equal about 1.25 million residents.  </P> <P> Under the new assessment method being used, Mo said the assessed values of the  dozen cable companies in Orange County have jumped from $200 million to $650  million. Taxes for those same companies increased from $2 million to $6.5  million.  </P> <P> "It is unbelievable," said Navarra Williams, vice president and general manager  of Paragon Cable, which serves, among other cities, Garden Grove, Westminster  and Huntington Beach. "Apparently, the county is trying to generate tax  revenues the best it can."  </P> <P> Williams said that his company's property tax bill increased from $500,000 to  $1.25 million and that in one 18-month period ending December, 1990, the  company will have paid $2 million more in property taxes than anticipated.  </P> <P> Williams said if the tax increase is divided by the company's 90,000  subscribers, it could come out to a $2.70-a-month increase in cable rates.  </P> <P> Subscribers to Copley/Colony Cable on Monday began receiving notices of a $1  increase in monthly service fees. Officials for Copley/Colony were unavailable  for comment late Monday. GEORGE FRANK  </P></p>

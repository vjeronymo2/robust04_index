The last official activity of the delegation was the  signing of accords and a sister cities act.    Three letters of intent regarding exchanges and cooperation  between Cojedes and Cuba on health, sports, and housing were  signed by Governor Machado and Cuban authorities from the  respective spheres at a ceremony held this morning at the seat  of the National Assembly of the People's Government. After the  signing, Machado pointed out the importance of this event:    "These mutual cooperation accords will allow me, as governor  of Cojedes State, to solve many problems which the science and  resources available there cannot solve. I am pleased with the  support and cooperation from the Cuban Government, all its  mid-level authorities, and deputies for their kindness, support,  and efforts to seal the unity of the people today. The unity of  the people is sealed with deeds, with realities, with good  things."    The five-day trip ends today. The delegation includes  members  of the governor's office and Professor Filipio Duran, vice  director of the Latin American University.    "What I take to my people and country are the good things  you  have here in terms of health, sports, and housing construction."    A document was signed decreeing sister city status between  Cojedes and Boyeros Municipality.</p>

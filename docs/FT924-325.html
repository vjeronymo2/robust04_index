			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Khmer Rouge defiant over peace plan CAMBODIA'S Khmer Rouge guerrillas, shrugging off pressure from Thailand and economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council, yesterday refused to rejoin the UN peace plan for Cambodia. After talks in Bangkok with Mr Khieu Samphan, nominal Khmer Rouge leader, Mr Prasong Soonsiri, the Thai foreign minister, said he saw no change in the group's position. In the face of international criticism of its support for the Khmer Rouge, Thailand has announced plans to implement UN resolutions by stopping oil exports to the guerrillas and preventing the import of logs from Cambodia. Bangkok wants to be seen persuading the Khmer Rouge to abide by the Paris peace accords, which the organisation signed last year but has since repeatedly flouted. After yesterday's meeting, however, Mr Khieu reiterated Khmer Rouge allegations that Vietnamese forces were still active inside Cambodia and repeated demands that the Supreme National Council - which comprises the four main factions, including the Khmer Rouge - should be given more power. He also ruled out UN checkpoints inside Khmer Rouge territory to monitor sanctions against the group. The UN has no evidence to support Khmer Rouge accusations that Vietnamese forces remain in Cambodia in contravention of the peace accords. But to Thailand's embarrassment there have been reports of Thai soldiers - other than those serving with the UN - inside Khmer Rouge-controlled Cambodian territory.</p>

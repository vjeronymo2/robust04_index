			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Emerging Markets: Election clouds Mexican market - The Emerging Investor In a year remarkably short of good news, investors in Mexico's stock market expect a change of luck next Sunday. They are betting heavily that Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the governing party will win the presidential election, and his triumph will be widely recognised as legitimate. Since July 20 the main index has surged by 19.3 per cent, with investors picking up stocks whose values had been depressed by pre-electoral nerves. The market has now recovered all of its peso losses of the year, although it is still down in dollar terms. The gains have been so impressive that some reckon that a Zedillo victory has now been fully discounted and that if it occurs investors will take profits. 'After the build-up to the election, there could be a vacuum after a Zedillo victory,' warns Mr Robert J Pelosky of Morgan Stanley in New York. Before committing more money to the market, investors may wait to see how the post-electoral situation evolves. Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the left-wing Party of Democratic Revolution has promised massive civil protests if there is electoral fraud, and with a devoted following of about 2m supporters, some fear he is a threat to political stability. 'There is a final hurdle - will the election be credible and accepted?' says Mr Jorge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs. 'If that is cleared then there is a basis for very strong capital inflows.' Such inflows, if they materialise, should help reduce domestic interest rates, perhaps to as low as 11 to 12 per cent by the end of the year. Short-term interest rates fell last week to 15.15 per cent from 17.66 per cent on July 20. A further cloud over the market is the possibility of a rise in US interest rates or long-term bond yields. The increase in US interest rates earlier this year contributed to the sharp fall in the local equity market. If international investors turned against emerging markets again, Mexico would likely be the first to suffer. Higher US interest rates could lead to speculation against the peso, depending on the post-electoral situation. In spite of low economic growth, Mexico is expected to run a current account deficit of about 7 per cent of GDP this year. Some economists believe that the government may decide in the post-electoral period to accelerate the maximum rate of devaluation of the peso against the dollar, from the current 5 per cent a year to as much as 10 per cent, in an effort to make the peso more competitive over the long-term. The recent increases in the market have not been all election-based. Second quarter results turned out to be better than many expected. Baring Securities calculates that operating profits of the 42 companies it tracks grew by an average of 16 per cent in the second quarter against 12 per cent in the first quarter. Real sales were up by 8 per cent in the second quarter against 6 per cent in the first quarter. The good second quarter numbers and growth of 3.1 per cent in industrial production in May have been taken as evidence that the long-awaited economic recovery is proving stronger than expected. Mexico's economy grew by just 0.5 per cent in the first quarter. But encouraged by the new figures for industrial production, Mr Pedro Aspe, Mexico's finance minister, reckons the economy will grow between 2 and 3 per cent this year. While the good economic figures have been helpful, the election has been uppermost in investor minds. In the view of many, Mr Zedillo offers the best chance of political stability and a continuation of the pro-market economic policies that have characterised the presidency of Mr Carlos Salinas. Many fear that a victory by the opposition would bring a new and untried team to government, which would find it difficult to govern a country that has been accustomed to one-party rule for 65 years. Mr Roberto Hernandez, the head of Banamex, Mexico's largest bank, caught the prevailing mood when he recently said that Mr Zedillo was the only candidate who could assure stability and bring interest rates down. Lower interest rates are expected to benefit above all Mexico's banks, which have been saddled with many non-performing loans as small and medium-sized companies have been unable to meet growing debt-service payments. The three largest banks are trading at an average of 10.3 times 1995 expected earnings compared to a market multiple of 13.3, according to Baring Securities, with some analysts believing this discount will narrow as rates come down and loan-growth picks up. Infrastructure and construction stocks are tipped by others as likely winners under a Zedillo presidency. These sectors have grown faster than the economy this year, partly because of increased government investment, but should benefit from lower interest rates. Mr Zedillo has promised a 25 per cent increase in infrastructure spending if elected, which should give them an additional boost.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Gillette's bid for Parker Pen referred to MMC THE GOVERNMENT has referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission the proposed Pounds 285m purchase of Parker Pen by Gillette, the US razor, stationery and toiletries manufacturer. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said the deal, announced last month, raised competition concerns in the supply of refillable writing instruments and refills. The MMC has until January 13 to report. Gillette already owns pen makers Paper Mate and Waterman. According to some estimates, acquisition of Parker could give Gillette more than half the UK market for refillable pens and pencils, worth more than Pounds 100m a year. Some retailers are understood to have expressed concern that such a strong position could enable Parker to restrict choice and raise prices in a mature product market where heavy advertising and brand support deter new entrants. No new competitors are believed to have entered the UK market for at least five years. Other leading suppliers of refillable pens and pencils are Sheaffer, Cross, Mont Blanc, Elysee and Pentel. Gillette's proposed acquisition of Parker, which has been based in the UK since a Dollars 100m management buy-out from its US parent in 1985, is subject to regulatory approval in Britain, France and the US. Gillette is already under pressure from competition authorities in Britain, Germany and several other countries to dispose of its interest in Eemland, the parent company of Wilkinson Sword, Gillette's main competitor in wet shaving products.</p>

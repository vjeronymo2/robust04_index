			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- Oleksandr Moroz, people's deputy and  chairman of the political council of the Socialist Party of  Ukraine, made public a statement on 3 May, which notes:  "Recently the milieu of Ukraine's president and Leonid Kravchuk  himself have in their statements and interviews been  importunately pressing on the public their opinion about the  untimeliness and unconstitutionality of elections to local  councils and pre-term elections of a president in June this  year. The intention to appeal to the new composition of the  Supreme Council on the matter of revoking the resolution on  pre-term elections of a president of Ukraine and postponing  elections to local councils to a later date is being justified.  Predictions with regard to possible anarchy, further  confrontation and chaos, and threats to the very existence of  the state are being repeated as arguments in favor of this  decision. A number of parties have taken this same stand; these  are generally of a right-wing orientation and conduct their  politics via the presidential structures in oblasts and rayons."    Oleksandr Moroz stated: "The poorly thought-out statements  by the president about the supposed absence of a constitution in  Ukraine and about the constitutional crisis, about the  incompetence of the newly elected composition of Ukraine's  Supreme Council, and so on, not only discredit him as a leader  of the state, but also actually deepen the political crisis,  which he is endeavoring not to allow, according to him."    According to the leader of the Socialist Party of Ukraine,  the election of the new composition of Ukraine's Supreme Council  by the people is without a doubt the decisive factor in the  political process, the democratic development of which requires  the speedy formation of new structures of state power in the  center and in the localities in order to, first of all, initiate  a set of anti-crisis measures in the economy.</p>

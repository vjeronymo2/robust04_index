			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning more than 2,000 miners from the  Lignite Public Corporation, whose trade unions are affiliated  with the Lignitul Mining Trade Unions Federation, gathered near  the aforementioned company headquarters in their working clothes  ready to go to Bucharest, as was decided last night. Although  Miron Cosma, leader of the Confederation of Mining Trade Unions  of Romania, initially fixed a first meeting with the strikers  for 1200, he arrived there from Petrosani 40 minutes earlier.  Miron Cosma said that two buses loaded with representatives of  the miners from pit coal processing centers will come to Targu  Jiu from the Jiu Valley after 1300 to decide on further joint  actions. At the same time, he warned that no alcoholic  beverages should be consumed, but failed to mention the various  mining tools with which some of the strikers are armed, our  correspondent Titus Stoichitoiu reports.</p>

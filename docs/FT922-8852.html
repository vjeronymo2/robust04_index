			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Companies are criticised TWO THIRDS of the UK's top companies have links with countries that are abusers of human rights, according to a report published today. The Ethical Investment Research Service (Eiris) which screens companies for private investors to see whether they meet certain ethical criteria, says that 36 of the 50 largest UK companies are involved. 'Many UK company groups have subsidiary and associated companies all over the world,' Eiris says. 'By operating in a country, the company group is making a direct investment in that country's economy.' The survey covers all 590 companies in the FTA All-Share Index at the end of last year. It found that 200 had subsidiary or associated companies in one or more of the countries identified, while 31 companies had significant subsidiaries in countries with high levels of human rights abuses.

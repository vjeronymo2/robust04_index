			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Crown in regulatory talks on French sale MR CHRISTOPHER Chataway, chairman of Crown Communications, the USM-quoted commercial radio group, is today expected to have crucial talks with the CSA, the French radio authority, over the sale of its loss-making French radio company. Last week Mr David Haynes, chief executive, announced that the company was close to selling the RFM network subject to CSA approval. Crown has disclosed neither the potential buyer nor the purchase price, but it is believed that NRJ, an independent French commercial network, is bidding less than Pounds 5m for the 114-station network. RFM's main asset is a radio masthead, valued at Pounds 12m in the September 1991 accounts. Price Waterhouse, the auditor, qualified the accounts because it could not say whether the value was fairly stated. There is doubt whether the CSA will approve an early sale to NRJ. A previous sale proposal was rejected. New legislation on French radio ownership is also planned and it is not clear whether the CSA would do anything that could lead to an increased concentration of ownership before the new legislation has been passed, probably next year. To add to the complexity, renewal of RFM's Paris licence, which accounts for 75 per cent of group revenue, is up for ratification in the next seven days. Renewal was agreed in principle several months ago. A sale of RFM and a reduction of Crown's losses is seen as vital for the financial health of the company. For the year to September 1991, RFM accounted for nearly half Crown's pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.79m. Last week Mr Haynes said that LBC, Crown's London commercial radio station, would soon move into a small surplus.</p>

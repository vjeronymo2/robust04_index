			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Freia Marabou The failure of Freia Marabou's share price to match the Jacobs Suchard NKr 450 offer suggests uncertainty about whether the takeover will be a pushover after all. In political terms, Jacobs' position is akin to that of Nestle when it bid for Rowntree. Hershey is still waiting in the wings and has the advantage of already holding an 18 per cent stake. It has a long-standing connection with Marabou. By teaming up with a local company, Orkla, it could more easily overcome Norwegian resistance to foreign ownership of a flagship company, although it has been talking about a lower price. A more likely explanation for the 6 per cent share price discount to the bid is the time value of money. Jacobs needs time to clear administrative hurdles. While the outcome is by no means certain, its ultimate parent, Philip Morris, has the resources to put up a powerful fight. Besides, it is questionable whether Hershey could justify paying a multiple of some 25 times for a business with only limited value as a bridgehead into Europe. Marabou has more strategic value to Suchard. Not only would it gain an advantage over Mars and Nestle in the Scandinavian market: Marabou's Daijm is a high-margin bar product in a segment where Suchard is weak. The Marabou acquisition would thus add to its range in Europe as a whole. If that is Suchard's strategy, Cadbury Schweppes could have cause for unease. Its European prospects would become less exciting still.</p>

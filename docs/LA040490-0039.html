			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS MAY MAKE PARENTS SIGN CONTRACT  </P> <P> Parents of Oxnard Union High School District students may soon be asked to  promise to send their children to school properly washed, dressed and fed in a  move officials hope will enlist parental support for quality education.  </P> <P> The Board of Trustees will consider today whether to take the unusual step of  asking parents to sign a contract pledging to take an active interest in their  children's education.  </P> <P> The contract in part asks that "parents should send their children to school  properly washed, dressed, fed, rested, in good health and with a positive  attitude towards the schools."  </P> <P> While the tasks outlined in the contract may seem routine to some, school  officials say some parents need to be reminded of basic responsibilities toward  their children.  </P> <P> "I think it's absolutely essential," Supt. Bob Carter said. "Far too many times  we have really done nothing more for parents than give them some handy tips. We  feel it's high time to say to the parents of children in our district, 'There  are certain things we expect from you.' "  </P> <P> If approved by the trustees, the two-page contract will be sent home to parents  next fall in their children's registration packets. Parent Teacher Student  Assns. will hand out posters and brochures urging families to make sure that  children attend school regularly, arrive on time and make up missed schoolwork.  </P> <P> Unique in the county, the contract is similar to dress codes adopted by school  districts statewide, said Hueneme High School Principal Terry Taylor, who wrote  the Home-School Partnership, as the contract is called, with Alice Johnson,  principal of Frontier High School in Camarillo.  </P> <P> More than 11,000 students are enrolled in the district.  </P> <P> The proposal was written at the request of groups alarmed by the low number of  parents who turn up for teacher conferences and school events, Taylor said.  </P> <P> "While we don't expect 100% response, it will certainly raise the awareness of  adults in the community that we are an integral part of our children's  education," she said.  </P> <P> Board members expressed hopes that the proposed contract will remind parents to  pay more attention to their children.  </P> <P> "In many cases, we see the parent does not do his or her part to make sure  their kids are dressed and to school on time. I'd say about 50% of parents  don't feel that responsibility to their child," board member Bedford Pinkard  said. "We hope this will remind parents to do the basic things."  </P> <P> The trustees will meet at 7 p.m., in the district office, 309 S. K St., Oxnard.  CAROLYN KUSKY  </P></p>

			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (10): Rapid development takes its toll - Infrastructure under strain THE INHABITANTS of Kuala Lumpur have a habit of shaking their heads sympathetically when they meet a visitor from Thailand. Are not the traffic jams in Bangkok appalling, they ask, and is not Thailand's infrastructure wholly inadequate? Yet Malaysians too are starting to pay a high price for economic success after six years of rapid growth. Utilities are struggling to keep pace with demand. It can be difficult to place a local telephone call. Power cuts have become more frequent because of a shortage of generating capacity (something which has yet to hit Thailand). The streets of the Malaysian capital are increasingly congested and polluted, to the extent that the government has launched a car-pooling scheme with the slogan 'Get our city moving again'. It is true that the roads of Kuala Lumpur are less crowded than those of Bangkok, but then Bangkok's population of some 8m is four times as large as Kuala Lumpur's. Both cities have promoted the cult of the motor car, failed to provide adequate public transport, and are struggling now to build light commuter railways. Both cities need new international airports, and each is about to construct one. As in Thailand, Malaysia's drive to remedy its infrastructural shortcomings presents mouthwatering opportunities to local contractors and foreign companies with the right skills; Malaysian officials cheerfully discuss projects worth billions of dollars as they seek to bring everything from telephone networks to sewage treatment plants up to standards adequate to keep pace with continued economic growth. Some economists are even concerned that the government's eagerness to upgrade Malaysia's infrastructure and maintain high growth rates may itself put further strains on the economy. Building new roads, for example, deprives businesses of much needed workers when unemployment is effectively zero across much of the country. 'People look at growth rates here like they look at inflation rates in Germany,' said an economist in Kuala Lumpur. 'It's a political question, not economic.' One thing that is not - so far - in short supply is capital, foreign or local. Malaysia's foreign debt service ratio has declined to below six per cent of export earnings. Local investors are as enthusiastic as foreign banks to finance viable projects. But Malaysia could face stiff competition for funds from other countries in the region who also face similar infrastructure problems. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, has taken his cue from Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government in Britain in the 1980s and started to privatise transport and utilities with an enthusiasm rarely matched elsewhere. Portions of the electricity and telephone networks have been sold to the public and the companies - Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia respectively  -have been listed on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. Faced with serious power shortages, the government has also strongarmed Tenaga into agreeing to buy electricity from independent power producers known as IPPs, some of which may eventually be listed on the stock exchange. Sixty proposals for power stations have already been made by various joint ventures, but only five have so far been approved and financing constraints will probably mean that not all the approved projects actually proceed. Private sector responsibility for infrastructure projects does not make Malaysia a wholly free market. Many of the companies which have won big contracts for roads and other infrastructure developments, like Renong and Berjaya, have strong connections with government, either through personal friendships or because they are linked to the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the dominant party in the government. Eyebrows were raised, for example, when the Berjaya group, in association with Britain's North West Water, won, without a public tender, a preliminary MDollars 6bn agreement to build and upgrade urban sewage facilities. Berjaya has little experience of such contracting work, but it is an influential company and Mr Vincent Tan, the group's chief, is said to be close to leading figures in government. Some businessmen have criticised the use of funds from organisations such as the Employees' Provident Fund, or the police and army pension funds (the last two have stakes in the sewage venture) to finance infrastructure projects with Umno connections, but others believe there is no problem as long as the project concerned is bankable; such organisations have to invest their money somewhere. Although there is no doubt that some companies benefit from government largesse in such deals, Malaysia does not suffer as badly as Indonesia or Thailand from the corrosive effects of corruption and official indecision. Infrastructure projects, says a banker, 'are not so obviously overpriced'. Existing and proposed projects include: Airports and ports: About MDollars 20bn is to be spent on a new international airport at Sepang, south of Kuala Lumpur, with the first phase costing about MDollars 10bn and an express rail link to the capital a further MDollars 1.2bn. A masterplan study drawn up by an Anglo-Japanese consortium, comprising Balfour Beatty, Trafalgar House Construction, Gammon of Hong Kong, G-MATS and Marubeni, forecast that the number of passengers passing through Kuala Lumpur could rise to between 55m and 60m by the year 2020, compared with 8.8m in 1991. Other airports and sea ports are also being upgraded. Telecommunications: Malaysian officials say about Dollars 10bn of investments will be needed over the next decade. Demand is expected to rise sharply, with international traffic growing by as much as 30 per cent a year. There is scope for expansion; at the end of last year there were 11.6 lines per 100 inhabitants, a third of Singapore's ratio. Railways and roads: The Malayan Railway Administration (KTM) has embarked on a programme to double-track busy lines. Work is underway in the Klang valley between Kuala Lumpur and its seaport at Port Klang, and there are plans eventually to double-track the entire distance between Johor in the south and Butterworth, opposite the island of Penang, in the north. There are also plans for a light rail transit system in Kuala Lumpur. An Anglo-German consortium led by Taylor Woodrow this month raised Pounds 300m to finance the first 12 kilometre link which will take 34 months to build. As for the road network, the north-south highway, a toll road, is expected to be completed next year after the securing of additional funds to meet cost overruns. A second causeway is planned for the crossing to Singapore. Construction and property: United Engineers Malaysia (UEM), a company connected to the Renong group, plans to build a MDollars 450m stadium and village for the 1998 Commonwealth Games outside Kuala Lumpur, in exchange for property with development potential in the capital, including the old national stadium. Other developments include a huge twin-tower office complex in central Kuala Lumpur, and private and state hospitals.</p>

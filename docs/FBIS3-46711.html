It will also accelerate deregulation in many financial  sectors, including abolishing the Foreign Exchange Control Act  in five years' time, Minister of Finance Hong Chae-hyong said  yesterday.    Meeting with reporters, Minister Hong said that inducements  for more foreign direct investments are quintessential for  advancing Korea's technological level and "to this end, the  government is willing to offer various incentives now offered by  other Asian nations to would-be investors."    "Some areas, like providing factory land at cheap prices,  may  be beyond the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry," Hong said.  "But in financial and taxational matters, we will work hard."    He said the efficiency ratings of financial attaches  stationed at major international economic centers, including  Tokyo, London and some European capitals, will be based on their  ability to attract foreign investments.    The dwindling amount of foreign direct investment here,  which  many analysts say is due to steep rises in labor, land and  capital prices compared with other Asian countries, has hindered  Korea's economic recovery, largely dependent on imported capital  and technology.    In a major departure from its stringent control on the  business plans of major state-run banks, the ministry will this  year let banks work out their own business plans and implement  them under their own responsibility, the finance minister said.    The restrictive foreign exchange sector will be drastically  deregulated for the complete abolition of control in five years,  he said.    Various restraints in the banking, securities and insurance  sectors, some of which have been relegated to umbrella  organizations, including the Bank of Korea, will be further  "shaken away," Hong said.    "Even if the ministry is reduced to a mere policy research  organization, we will continue to do away with unnecessary  regulations," the top financial policy-maker said.    Asked whether and when the government plans to permit the  introduction of foreign commercial loans, however, Hong made it  clear that the ministry will not allow them for the time being.    Between the two types of foreign commercial loans, cash  loans  are out of the question, he said, adding that if businesses want  such loans to help finance facility imports, then they should  use the government's foreign currency loans.    Instead, the ministry is considering exempting foreign  currency loans from the combined credit ceiling imposed on large  industrial conglomerates, a measure to help them use more  foreign exchange loans for facility investments, the finance  minister said.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading SOLID buying on the last day of the equity account led to a shortage of stock in futures, sending the March contract on the FT-SE sharply ahead, writes Joel Kibazo. It started trading tentatively at 2,835, a sizeable selling order early in the day sent the contract falling to 2,832, but then firm buying led March higher for most of the session. The buying was encouraged by renewed speculation about a cut in German interest rates, and a firm UK gilts sector. This demand and covering of short positions by traders led to a squeeze in March and it was trading at 2,873 ahead of the opening of Wall Street. Further demand saw it close at the day's high of 2,878, up 47 on its previous close and at a 6-point premium to cash. Turnover was a healthy 13,815 contracts. In traded options, volume improved to 29,949 lots with 11,747 lots dealt in the FT-SE 100 options. Interest in ICI continued to ensure that it was the day's most actively dealt stock option with 2,238 contracts traded. It was followed by British Steel at 1,931.</p>

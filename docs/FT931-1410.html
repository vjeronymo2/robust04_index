			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: China's regulators face an unenviable task - Tony Walker and Deirdre Nickerson look at Beijing's attempts to impose market order CHINA'S unruly and virtually unregulated stock markets must present an alarming picture when viewed from Beijing, where the heavy hand of officialdom is perhaps most visible. Indeed, a member of the leadership was quoted recently in an official publication as describing China's stock markets in the southern economic region of Shenzen and in Shanghai as among the world's most risky. He warned that unless stock market fever was restrained it would 'doubtlessly impose an increasingly negative impact on the country's economic reform and economic development'. Foreign lawyers, bankers and representatives of international institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have been urging the promulgation of a new securities law and regulations governing the operations of the stock markets. Mr Jerome Cohen, an authority on the Chinese legal system, said that while such regulations were indispensable to the creation of a successful capital market, of even more importance was the ability of supervisory bodies to transform 'legislative language into living reality'. This, he observed, would not be an easy task, and would require greatly strengthened legal institutions, including not only the courts, the procuracy and legal profession, but also relevant government supervisory agencies. In contrast, attitudes among Chinese officials, charged with advising the central authorities on a new securities law and other regulations, seem, in some cases, remarkably insouciant about the dangers of a South Sea Bubble crash in China's fledgling markets. Trading volume in A shares, for local Chinese, and B shares denominated in US dollars, for foreigners on the Shanghai and Shenzen exchanges, exceeded Yn100bn (Dollars 17.2bn), last year, compared with just Yn10bn in 1991. This is extraordinary growth by any standards: 50 companies were listed at the end of the year, against 15 at the beginning. Last October,the State Council, or cabinet, announced the establishment of a Securities Policy Committee (SPC), involving representatives of 14 entities, including the People's Bank, China's central bank, and a Securities Regulatory Commission (SRC) to advise on securities-related matters. These bodies were charged with strengthening macro-control of the markets. But doubts persist as to the likely effectiveness of the national SRC, given difficulties of co-ordination among the multitude of bureaucratic institutions involved in the regulatory process and certain resistance from increasingly independent regional authorities. The SPC and SRC have been advising a special securities law drafting committee which recently circulated a 131-article proposed law, covering the gamut of equity securities issues from insider trading to the operations of futures markets and the establishment of securities companies and investment funds. Among criticisms of the draft is that while it includes penal provisions, it is weak on arrangements for enforcement - a responsibility of the SRC. The law is restricted to equities. It is unclear when national regulations dealing with debt securities might emerge. SRC officials say that stock exchange regulations should be published within a few months and the securities law by later this year. However, the pattern has been for all Chinese commercial laws and regulations to encounter repeated delays as various elements of the sprawling bureaucracy chew over the details. One of the SRC's most important tasks will be creating regulations, including rules of disclosure, for initial public offerings. These regulations will apply to Chinese companies seeking a stock market listing outside China. This is an especially vexed issue in the Chinese leadership at present because of the Bermuda-registered Brilliance, a Chinese-foreign joint venture, which was floated on the New York stock exchange last October  -the first such example of a Chinese company listing offshore. Mr Zhu Rongji, China's vice-premier in charge of the economy, has decreed that in future any new listings must receive his approval and be restricted, for the time being, to the Hong Kong exchange. Some Chinese companies, including Shanghai Petrochemical and Qingdao Brewery, are working towards Hong Kong listings. But foreign lawyers and accountants familiar with these cases say they are proving inordinately complex because of difficulties in valuing assets, establishing the full extent of liabilities and any one of a dozen or more requirements for the issuing of prospectuses to comply with international standards. Another of the SRC's responsibilities will be to regulate over-the-counter (OTC) trading under the Securities Automatic Quotation System, a nationally-based computer-linked arrangement, that is some way yet from being up-and-running. In the meantime, OTC trading is a fast-spreading phenomenon throughout China with the coastal city of Tianjin a particular focus. Control of this form of 'off-the-board' equities trading may well provide the SRC with some of its biggest headaches. OTC trading, which was designed as a means of state companies rewarding employees with bonuses in the form of stock, has spiralled to the point where business transacted in Tianjin, some of it in the street where marketmakers scrawl prices on blackboards, is believed to have exceeded trading on the Shenzen and Shanghai exchanges combined. The estimated figure for shares traded on the OTC or secondary market for China was in the order of Yn170bn but this almost certainly understates the volume. Not surprisingly, given the speculative frenzy that prevails in a China starved for so long of real investment opportunities, the clamour from regional capitals for their own stock markets has been almost deafening. China's leaders have rejected these demands, and proposed instead that provinces should select a maximum of three local companies for listing on the Shenzen and Shanghai exchanges. China's securities regulators facing the fairly unenviable task of trying to impose order and encourage responsible self-regulation, are certain to have been reminded of the dictum of supreme Chinese leader, Mr Deng Xiaoping. 'Cross the river by feeling the stones,' he once observed. The problems for the SRC and its associate organisations is that the river is flowing swiftly and the stones on the bottom are by no means secure.</p>

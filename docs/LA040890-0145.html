			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPUTED HOMES AND LAND TESTING UNITY OF GERMANS  </P> <P> The first time the West German stranger appeared on their doorstep, Thomas and  Sabine Siede invited him in for coffee and cookies. It was a pleasant visit.  </P> <P> The visitor told the East German couple that their small stone house had been  his childhood home. His parents built it in 1932. He remembered a Messerschmitt  fighter crashing in the garden during the war. Later, his family fled to West  Berlin.  </P> <P> The second time the visitor appeared, he told the Siedes that their doors  needed refinishing; maybe a wall could be knocked out to enlarge the tiny  living room.  </P> <P> The third time, he brought a can of paint and brushes. He told the Siedes to  fix the place up, that he would probably be moving in this summer.  </P> <P> When Siede protested, the West German turned icy. He said: "I've already waited  40 years. I can wait two or three more."  </P> <P> As the two Germanys move swiftly toward reunification, conflicts like this are  cropping up with alarming frequency. Nervous East Germans, watching West German  cars cruise slowly through their neighborhoods, find themselves waiting for  what has come to be called simply "the visit."  </P> <P> But the question of who owns East Germany goes much deeper, and the visits seem  to reflect both the arrogance and fear that color the fragile relationship  between two countries and two peoples struggling to become one.  </P> <P> The controversy touches on something they have always shared, a deeply embedded  sense of heimat, or home. Yet it also underscores something they have never  agreed on and suggests that the success of reunification cannot be measured in  bank notes or ballots or borders.  </P> <P> Instead, it may come down to things like a stranger on the doorstep with a can  of paint.  </P> <P> The Bonn government estimates that 1 million West Germans could lay claim to  property the Communist regime seized when they left East Germany. Neither  government can say with any certainty what belongs to whom, and the issue looms  as possibly the most complicated and sensitive of all in the process of  negotiating unification.  </P> <P> Some West Germans are drawn across the fading border by bittersweet memories.  They just want to look, to reminisce and reconnect. Heimat.  </P> <P> But others come with tape measures, video cameras, time-yellowed deeds and a  sometimes unsettling determination to take back what they lost so long ago.  </P> <P> "Of course I would like my property back," Heinrich Wiehemeyer, a 56-year-old  West German salesman who remembers with fondness his childhood in Rangsdorf,  said in a recent interview. "My aunt owned the house, and I went to school  there during the war."  </P> <P> After fleeing west in 1945, the aunt spent the next 36 years writing to East  German authorities to inquire about the three-bedroom cottage on a dirt lane in  Rangsdorf. She died nine years ago without ever getting a reply and willed the  house to Wiehemeyer and his sister.  </P> <P> "And now I want my property," Wiehemeyer said.  </P> <P> The East Germans who believe they bought the house from the state for a  pittance 17 years ago can stay and pay him a fair rent, he said, "but it is my  property."  </P> <P> Wiehemeyer, who lives in the West German city of Osnabrueck, compares his  situation to that of Jews routed by the Nazis during World War II.  </P> <P> "The Nazis took away their homes and gave them to other Nazis," Wiehemeyer  said. "Most of the property seized in East Germany went to Communists. And  nobody got restitution."  </P> <P> After the war, first the Soviets and then the East German leaders began  eliminating private property under the slogan "nobility's land to peasant  hands."  </P> <P> In many instances, owners who were not forced to give up their land and homes  had to rent them out at rates too low to cover even routine maintenance.  Frequently,these people would end up abandoning their property. More often than  not, the houses fell into disrepair, for under the socialist system there was  always a shortage of material, capital and skilled labor.  </P> <P> In this quiet, woodsy town where the Siedes live, about five miles from the  West Berlin border, a newly formed citizens' support group estimates that up to  70% of the 1,800 single-family houses once belonged to people who fled to the  West. Already, since the first of the year, Rangsdorf has had more than 100  visits or letters from West German claimants.  </P> <P> People tell of a neighbor who was reassured by a West German owner that he  would not have to move out but would have to give up one of the two bedrooms  every summer for the West German's vacation.  </P> <P> "Reunification means we want to live together," one villager said, "but not  that together."  </P> <P> The citizens' group began contacting neighboring towns, and efforts to organize  nationwide are moving quickly ahead. Members are seeking seats on town councils  in elections scheduled for next month.  </P> <P> When the new Volkskammer, or Parliament, was convened for the first time last  Thursday, protesters gathered outside to demand housing guarantees.  </P> <P> "German unity cannot allow us to be driven from our homes and gardens," a sign  carried by one of the protesters said.  </P> <P> Some people scoff at such concerns.  </P> <P> "It's just Communist propaganda," said Helmuth Sehrig, a West Berlin lawyer who  estimates that his firm represents about 1,000 West Germans with some kind of  property claim in the East. "The old party is trying to stir things up and  create this needless angst for political reasons."  </P> <P> East Germany's socialist laws still provide airtight protection for tenants,  Sehrig said, and no one is going to be forced into homelessness.  </P> <P> "Some idiots," he went on, "are going over there like it's the Wild West,  saying, 'This land's mine, and I want you and your cattle to get off by  sundown.' But obviously, that's ridiculous."  </P> <P> He said he believes that in the end, a united Germany will pay out perhaps  billions of marks in restitution to the old owners, without affecting current  owners or tenants.  </P> <P> Reiner Oschmann, deputy editor of the Communist daily Neues Deutschland, said:  "Nobody really knows. Everything is open, and that just heightens the tension.  It's really a time bomb ticking away."  </P> <P> That's of little comfort to Hartmut Klucke, a 46-year-old physicist who  believes he bought the Wiehemeyer house from the state in 1973 for 12,000  marks, about $4,000 at the prevailing exchange rate. On the basis of  photographs that "a friend in the neighborhood" sent him, Wiehemeyer speculates  that the property is now worth at least 500,000 marks, about $312,000.  </P> <P> "They as much as stole it," Wiehemeyer said.  </P> <P> After getting a series of letters from Wiehemeyer claiming the 2 1/2-bedroom  house and accusing him of knowingly taking "hot property," Klucke said he  suffered a near-heart attack.  </P> <P> "He can't sleep," his wife, Ursula, said. "He has to take tablets to quiet his  nerves."  </P> <P> When Wiehemeyer announced that he would be dropping by to inspect the property,  the Kluckes spent an anxious Saturday peering through the tall hedges ringing  their yard. But Wiehemeyer did not appear.  </P> <P> "This is terrible," Klucke said. "When we moved in, in '73, the house was in  awful shape. We redid the roof, put in new wooden floors, five new windows and  made electrical repairs."  </P> <P> Klucke even built a small sauna in the basement. He said poured his savings and  his free time into the house.  </P> <P> By Western standards, it is hardly a palace. The rooms where Klucke's three  children slept can barely hold a twin bed. There is a Pullman kitchen and a  remodeled bathroom. As in most East German homes, there is no telephone.  </P> <P> But the personal touches assert that, to the Kluckes, it is home. The garden  blooms with pansies and the stairwell is a private gallery of Klucke oil  paintings.  </P> <P> "We had the best years here," Ursula Klucke said, "our kids growing up, grandma  living with us. . . . We even had pet rabbits. Oh, it wouldn't kill me to move,  but I worry about Hartmut. He practically put this place together stone by  stone, with his own hands."  </P> <P> Klucke insisted that he has no hatred for Wiehemeyer.  </P> <P> "Just fear," he said. "I feel so helpless."  </P> <P> When the Kluckes paid off their mortgage last year, they invited friends over  for a party. Not long afterward the letters started coming.  </P> <P> Not all West Germans are eager to reclaim property in the East. Indeed, some  fear that reunification and the undoing of the Communist "land reform" could  saddle them with old mortgages -- and demanding tenants.  </P> <P> Gerhard Fuchss, a retired lawyer who heads an association of West Germans with  property claims in the East, finds that many people now want to waive their  rights as a precaution.  </P> <P> "I had a place in Leipzig, but I don't want it," Fuchss said. "It's old and  rotted. I couldn't do anything with it, it's in such awful shape. In some  cases, it's better to waive all claims in case they decide to give back the  houses with their unpaid mortgages and all these expensive repairs and  renovations."  </P> <P> Only a third of East German households are said to have indoor toilets. Homes  are generally heated with brown coal, which is dirty as well as expensive.  Scarcities can mean waiting four years for a bathtub or months for a sack of  cement.  </P> <P> Thomas Siede is waiting too, waiting for another visit. He and his wife, both  38 and both teachers, have not told their two little girls what the West German  stranger wanted. Their house is cramped, but they pay a typically low East  German rent to the state -- 94 East marks, or less than $20 a month.  </P> <P> They worry that the severe housing shortage in East Germany and the country's  economic struggles as it moves into a free-market system will make it  impossible for them to find a place they can afford if the West German comes  back for good.  </P> <P> "Everybody is so worried," Sabine Siede said. "Mrs. Schmidt down the street  found out from a neighbor that someone with West German license tags drove up  and started photographing her property."  </P> <P> East Germans, the Siedes pointed out, usually move only once or twice in a  lifetime, and then to a place assigned and heavily subsidized by a system that  is now shattered.  </P> <P> "Mobility is foreign to us," said Siede, who like many East Germans refers to  West Germany as "the other side" in a way that makes it sound much farther  away.  </P> <P> "This isn't a political problem or a legal problem, really," he said. "It's a  social one. We've always been the losers, and the other side has always been  the winner. They had the money, and they had the property.  </P> <P> "But we don't want to lose anymore."  </P></p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Downward trend continues on the Continent The downward trend continued on Continental bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw Schering and other chemicals fall after Fisons's London plunge last week, while Thyssen and other steels were depressed by a view of its steel subsidiary's prospects. Construction stocks, particularly Philipp Holzmann, fell on a rumour of a Deutsche Bank downgrade. Schering fell by DM13 to DM720.50, Thyssen by DM6.90 to DM239.50 and Holzmann by DM30 to DM1,085 as the DAX index closed 8.37 lower at 1,773.90, after a 1.97 decline to 708.23 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover fell from DM4.6bn to DM4.4bn. Schering was weak earlier this month, on its own forecasts and on the government's proposals for a two-year freeze on pharmaceuticals prices. On Thyssen, Mr Michael Geiger of County NatWest thought that Thyssen Stahl's weekend forecast of a mere 1991/92 breakeven might reflect the group's plans to merge it with Thyssen Edelstahl, its speciality stainless and light alloy steels counterpart. Holzmann has recently produced excellent results, with cash flow up 50 per cent, and Mr Geiger does not share reservations about its prospects, saying that a reported fall in the growth of orders still leaves it with a huge backlog, of improved quality at that. There was less support for Asko, the highly-geared retailer whose supervisory board chief, Mr Helmut Wagner, departed at the end of May. Since then the shares have come back from DM838 to DM722, accelerating on Friday and yesterday with falls of DM30, and DM31 respectively. PARIS was depressed by a weak domestic bond market which fell on news that the Bundesbank president Mr Helmut Schlesinger saw no room for a cut in German interest rates in the near future. However, a firm start on Wall Street helped the market recover from the day's lows, leading some brokers to believe that the market was stabilising after its recent fall. The CAC 40 index dropped to 1,906.91 before ending at 1,918.14, down 10.15, in very thin turnover of FFr1.5bn. Suez was one of the day's more prominent gainers, adding FFr6 or 2 per cent to FFr310 as two domestic brokers were seen actively buying the stock for institutions. Dealers said the share looked attractive since it was just off its year's low of FFr282 and was down from a year's high of FFr348.90. Oil stocks were weaker, with Total falling FFr5.30 to FFr250.70 and Elf losing FFr5.10 to Fr376. Schneider lost another FFr23 or 3.5 per cent to FFr640 following last week's pessimistic earnings forecast. MILAN was again restricted to open-outcry trading as the screen-based system remained out of operation. Dealers estimated volume at L60-L70bn in trading dominated by position-squaring ahead of the close of the June account today. The Comit index fell 2.09 to 472.85. Stet was one of the most active stocks after last Friday's pricing of its share and warrants issue. The stock gained L36 to L1,946 and reached L1,953 after hours. Fiat was also active, on short-covering, adding L19 to L5,200. Capital increases from Italcementi, Snia and Milano Assicurazione are due to start tomorrow. Italcementi fell L220 to L13,400. AMSTERDAM weakened in low volume. The CBS Tendency index shed 1.1 to 128.4. Nedlloyd lost Fl 1.10 to Fl 55.70 with some analysts noting that a court ruling scheduled for Thursday on the appointment of Mr Torstein Hagen to the supervisory board was affecting sentiment. Fokker lost Fl 1.00 or 3 per cent to Fl 33.10 as the prospect of an announcement on talks with Dasa receded. Royal Dutch lost Fl 1.10 to Fl 157.80 and Heineken was Fl 2.30 down at Fl 161.00. STOCKHOLM's morning rally run out of steam under the influence of weaker foreign markets and concern about the government's stability. The Affarsvarlden General index closed 4.60 higher at 948.10. Hennes &amp; Mauritz, the clothing retailer, reported a 67 per cent rise in half-year profits and the shares rose SKr9 to SKr164 in strong trade. Handelsbanken A rose SKr3 to SKr54 on a belief that they had discounted too much bad news ahead of the bank's four-month results today. HELSINKI reported its lowest inflation rate since 1970, as Outokumpu moved from loss into profit for the first four months of 1992. The Hex index rose 9.7 to 791.3 and the mining group's shares by FM1.20 to FM45. VIENNA failed to be enlivened by the debut of Flughafen Wien. The ATX index eased 0.97 to 992.51. Flughafen Wien was fixed at Sch380, in line with last week's grey market prices, and 13 per cent above its offer price of Sch335. BRUSSELS traded in a narrow range with the Bel-20 index closing 6.10 down at 1,205.18 in low volume of BFr542m. OSLO fell for the 10th session as the all-share index dropped 5.05 or 1.2 per cent to 431.73 in thin trading worth NKr130m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUN 15  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open  10.30am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1162.54  1163.52  1162.50  1161.46  1161.01  1159.52  1159.40  1159.75  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Day's High  1163.95    Day's Low  1159.02  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Jun 12    Jun 11    Jun 10     Jun 9     Jun 8 1167.48   1162.52   1174.58   1174.96   1177.48**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ** Partial.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

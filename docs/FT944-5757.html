			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Nato's advance grinds to halt on Russian front Western and Russian officials often use a catchphrase to describe the relations they would like to see between Moscow and the Atlantic alliance: no vetoes, no surprises. In other words, neither side will claim the right to dictate how the other should behave, but each will avoid giving the other unpleasant shocks. Last night, both Russian and Nato officials were accusing one another of committing precisely that sin. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, came to Brussels for a set-piece event intended to symbolise a new co-operative relationship between Moscow and the western alliance which was founded as a counterweight to the Soviet bloc. The launch of a military co-operation programme was also envisaged by the west as part of a 'charm offensive' supposedly to blunt Moscow's determination to frustrate Nato enlargement. Both Mr Kozyrev's visit and other aspects of the western blandishments to Russia had been carefully prepared. But the expectations of a happy and essentially ceremonial encounter were dashed. The soft-spoken minister arrived from Paris - where he made a bold proposal for closer relations between Moscow and the European Union's defence institutions - in a mood of apparent bonhomie. He recalled jocularly that Brussels was his birthplace and that Mr Willy Claes, Nato's new secretary-general, was an old acquaintance. He then brandished before the television cameras a weighty document, which Russian and Nato officials had been quietly drafting for months, and which was intended to map out future links between Moscow and the alliance. The document details Russia's activities within the Partnership for Peace, a military co-operation programme which Nato has offered to all its former enemies. It also spells out a broader Russia-Nato relationship which Moscow has successfully demanded. Only after ministers went into closed session did word leak out that Mr Kozyrev was holding back from depositing his copy of the document at Nato - and hence refusing to launch the programme. The reason he gave for this piece of high drama was that Russia objected to the document agreed a few hours earlier by Nato foreign ministers, which spells out an accelerated programme for integrating ex-communist countries into the alliance. 'At first reading this document raises more questions than answers,' Mr Kozyrev said of the Nato text, adding that he had discussed it with President Boris Yeltsin. He still hoped the Russia-Nato programme would go ahead, but the alliance would have to provide some clarifications. Nato officials said the western reaction was one of 'shock and disappointment', adding that they had been at pains to keep Russia informed over the past few weeks on their ideas for an accelerated enlargement programme. The Russian gesture confirms what western governments have earnestly wanted not to believe: Moscow still objects strongly to incorporation of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the western defence system, as long as it is excluded. Nato has for the past year been engaged in a bizarre sort of mating dance with its former central European adversaries which desperately yearn for protection from Russia which is unhappy about seeing its former satellites engulfed by the western security system. Hours before Mr Kozyrev's arrival yesterday, western officials were congratulating themselves on having 'squared' Russian concerns. But it is now clear that Russia will spring plenty more surprises as it tries to exercise an effective veto on over-hasty Nato expansion.</p>

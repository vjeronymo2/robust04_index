			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Presidential front-runners eager to convince today: Super Tuesday test for Democrats and Republicans BY all logic, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, a Democrat, and Mr George Bush, a Republican and the president, should be smiling tonight. They ought to win most - in Mr Bush's case all  - the 11 Democratic primaries and caucuses and eight Republican primaries that mark the heaviest day yet in election year, now known universally as Super Tuesday. But elections are not only about simple winners and losers. Especially in the long primary season, expectations count a lot, which means that for both front-runners anything less than a series of convincing victories will be instantly, and perhaps correctly, interpreted as signs of continuing vulnerability. Super Tuesday, therefore, carries risks as well as rewards. Mr Bush's problem, unlikely to disappear today, is with the third of Republican voters who decline to support him in primaries. He has campaigned heavily in the last two weeks, dispensing presidential largesse almost everywhere he has been, and is unlikely to lose a single state. His lead in the delegate count is already overwhelming and he will take almost all the 421 more to be allocated today. But he could still be embarrassed by Mr Pat Buchanan in the south, for example in Louisiana, where another right-winger, former Ku Klux Klan man David Duke, a local son, is also on the ballot; in Mississippi and even in Texas, which the president calls home; and in the depressed New England states of Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Whatever happens, Mr Buchanan has promised to keep on waging his ideological warfare, moving to Illinois and Michigan a week from today and, he says, all the way to the last primary in early June in California, where Mr Bush is not popular. Sooner or later Mr Buchanan will run out of steam and money but his continued ability to goad Mr Bush does the president's image little good. Perhaps for this reason, the president has decided for the moment to remain in the White House. On the Democratic side, the stakes for Mr Clinton are even higher today. His tactically well-planned and well-financed campaign always banked on a big Super Tuesday, with seven of the 11 state polls being held on his natural border and southern turf. He might also be the principal beneficiary of the end yesterday of the campaign of Tom Harkin, the liberal Senator from Iowa. Mr Harkin yesterday studiously avoided expressing a preference for any candidate. Organised labour, Mr Harkin's bulwark, may find the centrist Mr Clinton more amenable than Mr Paul Tsongas, who favours tax breaks and incentives for business, and former California governor Jerry Brown, who attacks the political establishment, of which labour remains a part. But Mr Clinton still has not established himself as a candidate in whom the Democratic electorate has great confidence. In part this is because of questions about his character, raised first in allegations of marital infidelity and draft evasion and now over his financial relationship as governor with an Arkansas real estate developer. It also reflects the fact that the Democratic race has become much nastier. Mr Tsongas reflected over the weekend that he did not really like negative political advertising but that has not stopped him attacking Mr Clinton, and vice versa, and it certainly has not stopped Mr Brown going for both, but especially Mr Clinton, indiscriminately. Four years ago, Super Tuesday produced four separate Democratic winners. This time, most of the 11 races appear to be between Mr Clinton and Mr Tsongas, but the one which is a real litmus test for Mr Clinton's credibility is Florida. He can afford losses in Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Delaware and knows that in several other states Mr Tsongas has barely campaigned, including Texas, which has most delegates at stake. But Florida, an ethnic and economic potpourri of Californian dimensions, now conforms to no stereotype and the Tsongas appeal to the better-educated white and hispanic middle classes could offset the clear Clinton advantage in money and organisation in the state. It is worth recalling that another Greek from Massachusetts, Mr Michael Dukakis, achieved a critical primary victory there in 1988. A loss in Florida, or even a narrow victory, would not knock Mr Clinton off the front-runner's perch, assuming he performs to expectations elsewhere. But it would make him nervous, to put it mildly, about next week's confrontations in the big northern industrialised states of Illinois and Michigan as well as the one in New York on April 7. For, although he already has a handy lead in the delegate count, the Democrats are also electing a considerable number who will go the convention in New York in July committed to no candidate. The prize of an assured first ballot victory at the convention remains some way off.  --------------------------------------------- CONVENTION DELEGATES  ---------------------------------------------                         Number of delegates                         DEM           REP  --------------------------------------------- Primaries  ---------------------------------------------   Florida               148            97   Louisiana              60            38   Massachusetts          94            38   Mississippi            39            33   Oklahoma               45            34   Rhode Island           22            15   Tennessee              68            45   Texas                 196           121  --------------------------------------------- Caucuses  ---------------------------------------------   Delaware               14           -   Hawaii                 20           -   Missouri               77           -   Sub Total             783           421   Total at   convention          4,288         2,209  ---------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------- TEXAS  --------------------------------------------- Population:      17.0m Ethnic composition:                  75 percent white                  12 percent black                   2 percent asian                  26 percent Hispanic* Unemployment rate:                       1988: 7.3 percent                   Jan 1992: 7.6 percent Bankruptcies:                   1988: 41,849                   1991: 47,565 (+14 percent) 1988 Presidential vote:                   Republican: 56 percent                   Democrat:   43 percent  --------------------------------------------- *Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race  --------------------------------------------- Sources: Bureau of the Census; Bureau of Labor Statistics; American Bankruptcy Institure; Congressional Quarterly  ---------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------- Missouri  --------------------------------------------- Population:       5.1m Ethnic composition:                  88 percent white                  11 percent black                   1 percent asian                   1 percent Hispanic* Unemployment rate:                       1988: 5.7 percent                   Dec 1991: 5.9 percent Bankruptcies:                   1988: 11,328                   1991: 18,735 (+65 percent) 1988 Presidential vote:                   Republican: 52 percent                   Democrat:   48 percent  --------------------------------------------- *Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race  --------------------------------------------- Sources: Bureau of the Census; Bureau of Labor Statistics; American Bankruptcy Institure; Congressional Quarterly  ---------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------- Florida  --------------------------------------------- Population:      12.9m Ethnic composition:                  83 percent white                  14 percent black                   1 percent asian                  12 percent Hispanic* Unemployment rate:                       1988: 5.5 percent                   Jan 1992: 8.7 percent Bankruptcies:                   1988: 21,989                   1991: 49,127 (+123 percent) 1988 Presidential vote:                   Republican: 61 percent                   Democrat:   39 percent  --------------------------------------------- *Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race  --------------------------------------------- Sources: Bureau of the Census; Bureau of Labor Statistics; American Bankruptcy Institure; Congressional Quarterly  ---------------------------------------------  --------------------------------------------- Massachusetts  --------------------------------------------- Population:       6.0m Ethnic composition:                  90 percent white                   5 percent black                   2 percent asian                   5 percent Hispanic* Unemployment rate:                       1988: 3.3 percent                   Jan 1992: 7.9 percent Bankruptcies:                   1988:  3,419                   1991: 14,476 (+323 percent) 1988 Presidential vote:                   Republican: 45 percent                   Democrat:   53 percent  --------------------------------------------- *Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race  --------------------------------------------- Sources: Bureau of the Census; Bureau of Labor Statistics; American Bankruptcy Institure; Congressional Quarterly  ---------------------------------------------</p>

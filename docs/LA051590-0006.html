			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYOR BRADLEY'S PROPOSAL FOR MANDATORY WATER RATIONING  </P> <P> How wonderful to read that Mayor Bradley is leading the way in water  conservation "by having his car washed at the City Hall garage" rather than at  his Hancock Park residence (May 4). Are we to believe that the City Hall gets  its water supply from some other source, or that the rest of us may save water  by having our cars washed at the City Hall?  </P> <P> The mayor is setting the kind of example (and peculiar logic) that makes us  realize how we got into this mess in this first place.  </P> <P> EDWARD WESTON  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

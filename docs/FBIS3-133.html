With increasing restlessness among Bophuthatswana civil  servants -- evident in the homeland this week -- there is every  possibility that the public sector could soon be hit by a total  strike, similar to that which crippled the Venda government.  Late this week workers in the education, finance and audit  departments threatened to join the industrial action as postal  workers indicated that their strike would continue at least  until mid-March.    And as the collapse of the Bophuthatswana administration  loomed dangerously close, it emerged that yet another meeting  between ANC [African National Congress] president Nelson Mandela  and homeland leader Lucas Mangope was in the offing. It is  expected that reincorporation of the homeland and free political  activity will be high up on the agenda of the meeting, which is  scheduled for sometime this week.    Although civil servants in Bophuthatswana have demanded the  refund of their pensions, the restlessness seemed to be more a  symptom of growing impatience among homeland residents with  Mangope's resistance to reincorporation and participation in the  Transitional Executive Council. Meanwhile, mediators in the  Venda civil servants dispute over the multi-million pension fund  scam were this week unable to find state officials to negotiate  with as government offices remained deserted. Key government  officials were said to have taken refuge in Johannesburg,  hundreds of miles away from workers who want the millions of  rands, handed out in pensions to senior government staff, to be  repaid.    The collapse of key sections of government administration in  Venda was precipitated by last week's mass march after which  civil servants occupied control centres of sections of the  homeland's security forces. Communication links were disrupted  and police refused to intervene to restore order.    The civil service in both Ciskei and Transkei also seem to  be  gripped by uncertainty. "Everyone is panicking," said one  Ciskei civil servant. In some offices everything from pens to  computers are being stolen by civil servants desperate to make  the most of the last few weeks. Officials seconded by South  Africa to the homelands are worried about their positions --  there are about 360 in Ciskei alone.    In Transkei, seconded officials were told this week that the  South African government did not know what would happen to them.    In Ciskei, new cars are allegedly still being handed out to  bureaucrats who may no longer have top jobs in May. The Ciskei  government recently confirmed the receipt of a fleet of 35  brand-new Ford Meteors and Lasers for government officials. At  R[rand]35,000 apiece, that is a total of R1.2-million.</p>

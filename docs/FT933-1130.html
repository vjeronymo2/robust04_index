			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Littlechild gives out high marks ELECTRICITY companies were patting themselves on the back yesterday after receiving high marks for behaviour from Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator. Prof Littlechild's annual report on customer service showed that companies failed to meet his standards in only one out of every 1,053 cases, compared with one out of 770 the year before. Complaints decreased from 16,679 to 15,521. The regulator said he was pleased companies were reaching standards and providing better service for customers. He added that he had set even higher service standards for 1993-94, and had doubled the penalties for failure. London Electricity claimed the report showed it gave its customers the best electricity service in the UK, with a failure rate of 1.6 per 10,000 services compared with a national average of 9.5. Midlands Electricity said it was providing a better service and the lowest electricity bills in England and Wales. Mr Mike Hughes, chief executive, said his company's overall targets for service were now the highest in the country. Companies with the lowest failure rates included Seeboard, Southern and Eastern. Those with higher rates were Hydro-Electric, South Western and East Midlands.  ----------------------------------------------- ELECTRICITY SUPPLY STANDARDS 1992-93  ----------------------------------------------- Companies                  Failures per                                  10,000                                services  ----------------------------------------------- London                                1 Seeboard                              3 Southern                              3 South Western                        30 Eastern                               3 East Midlands                        20 Midlands                             12 Swalec                               15 Manweb                               15 Yorkshire                             4 Northern                              5 Norweb                                4 Scottish Power                       14 Hydro-Electric                       35  ----------------------------------------------- Source: Offer  -----------------------------------------------</p>

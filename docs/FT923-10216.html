			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Clifford 'deceived' in dealings over BCCI MR Clark Clifford said yesterday there was 'not one scintilla of direct evidence or proof, either oral or in writing' that he had committed any crimes related to his stewardship of the Washington bank holding company alleged to have been secretly acquired by the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI). The defiant 85-year-old former US secretary of defence was responding to indictments brought on Wednesday accusing him of fraud, bribery, conspiracy, larceny and racketeering. He attacked 'a gross unfairness in the manner in which the publicity about a criminal proceeding is brought. Mr Clifford denied that he and his co-defendant, Mr Robert Altman, his law partner, 'were overwhelmed by the nature of the publicity this morning'. He would fight the charges 'as long as I have the strength and health to do it'. Mr Clifford's lawyer reported that his client's doctor had warned: 'He may not live very long.' Mr Clifford said his lawyers had learned 'that neither the district attorney in New York nor the Justice Department in Washington has any direct, credible evidence of our participation in any wrongdoing.' He then detailed his version of his 13-year relationship with the group of 14 Middle East investors ('men of excellent reputations, men of fabulous wealth') who had sought control of Financial General, the bank holding company whose name was later changed to First American Bankshares. Nowadays, though, he said, 'any time anyone mentions anything about BCCI, it's like mentioning Aids.' But, in 1982, when the bank takeover took place and he was persuaded to become its chairman, BCCI was a respectable international financial institution, 'vouched for' by the Bank of England, audited by Price Waterhouse, and with a 30 per cent minority shareholding held by Bank of America, then 'the largest and most respected' US bank. 'I am saying we accepted them then for what they were. We were deceived.' Nor, at the time, did he have any reason to distrust Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, BCCI's ailing founder. In the 3 1/2 years prior to the bank purchase, 'I had gotten to know Abedi well. Commitments he had made at various times he had always kept. We had come to respect him. He seemed to be what he pretended to be.' At no stage before the BCCI denouement, Mr Clifford said, did he know that his bank was controlled by BCCI. He dealt with it mostly for practical convenience because it was easier to correspond with BCCI and Mr Abedi than with the 14 individual investors. Mr Clifford also flatly denied he had improperly profited from the relationship, as charged on Wednesday. For years, he said, he only drew a salary of Dollars 50,000 a year, at a time when the chairman of the biggest local rival bank was earning Dollars 1.5m. Senator John Kerry of Massachussetts yesterday charged that the government of Abu Dhabi has stopped co-operating with the US investigation of BCCI. This was immediately denied by Mr Ahmed al-Sayegh, representative of the BCCI majority shareholders group. Meanwhile, a US federal judge has ordered the Abu Dhabi royal family to forfeit Dollars 104m invested in ICIC Investments Ltd, which she desribed as 'the alter ego' of one or more of the BCCI corporate defendants. Judge Joyce Hens Green drew attention to the conmingling of funds in the complex BCCI network. Approach to creditors, page 6</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Books: Double-edged poetry - Anthony Curtis finds there is more to Victorian verse than meets the eye VICTORIAN POETRY: POETRY, POLITICS AND POETICS by Isobel Armstrong Routledge Pounds 35, 544 pages MUCH OF Victorian poetry was until recently a desolate no-go area. Then Antonia Byatt's Booker-prize-winning novel Possession jolted many of us into an awareness of the fascinating psychological complexities lurking within that poetry. Isobel Armstrong, Professor of English at Birkbeck College, has put together a collection of essays that amount to a re-interpretation of the poetic output of the whole period. Poems like The Lotos Eaters, Mariana, The Lady of Shallott, Maud, Fra Lippo Lippi, Porphyria, Sohrab and Rustum, Dover Beach, Casabianca ('The boy stood on the burning deck . . .') and many others lying moribund in the collective memory return alarmingly to life under Armstrong's masterly dissections. The poems are - in Armstrong's eyes - capable of dual readings. This is particularly true of many poems by Tennyson and Browning that dramatise the plight of an individual. You can either read the poem from within the consciousness of the person at its centre or you can step outside his or her mind and consider the totality of the situation. But let the Professor explain: '. . . the poet often invites the simple reading by presenting a poem as lyric expression as the perceiving subject speaks. Mariana's lament or Fra Lippo Lippi's apologetics are expressions, indeed, composed in an expressive form. But in a feat of recomposition and externalisation the poem turns its expressive utterance around so that it becomes the opposite of itself, not only the subject's utterance but the object of analysis and critique. It is, as it were, reclassified as drama in the act of being literal lyric expression.' From this Armstrong arrives at her key-concept - the double-poem - as the chief poetic construct of the Victorian period. The two readings of the poem are two poles generating tension, stress, ambiguity. This disturbance inherent in the poem encourages us to penetrate beneath the surface meaning. On the surface The Lotos Eaters is a dreamy poem about drug-taking and retreat from activity; but step back and what do we have? 'Its exploration is nearer to Marx's understanding of the estranged labour which converts all energy expended outside work into subhuman or animal experience than to an account of the text as a simple desire for escape and exploitation of resources'. Poetry was used by the Victorians as means of disseminating doctrine both by those on the right and the left. Keble used poetry to inculcate Christian piety. The Chartists used poetry to publicise their protests. The occasional 'hatchet-job' we read today on a new book of poems is a mild affair compared with the way the likes of John Wilson or Croker would pitch into a new volume by poets such as Tennyson. Indeed it is hardly an exaggeration to say that poetry in Victorian times had the same urgency that today we devote to considerations of the economy. Professor Armstrong has reconstructed the main lines of this Victorian debate about poetry as it occurred in reviews and articles. She identifies the groups of theorists and critics from whom the poets drew strength. For Tennyson, it was initially Hallam and the Apostles adumbrating a new kind of post-Romantic conservative-subversive poetry of sensation. For Browning and his discovery of the dramatic monologue she points to a link with Benthamite Utilitarian theory and the notion of the Grotesque as expounded by Ruskin in The Stones of Venice. Some of these connections are dazzling. The most controversial is likely to be her bracketing of Swinburne and Gerard Manley Hopkins as the two sides of the same poetic coin, the sado-masochism of the former a counterpart of the Jesuitical discipline of the latter. Armstrong's expositions are are not always easy to comprehend, as in her long analysis of Christina Rossetti's Goblin Market, the most haunting poem of the period, which she denies is about anything as simple as menstruation or masturbation. Armstrong devotes a substantial chapter to the women poets of the period in which, as well as familiar names like Rossetti, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, the Brontes, she resuscitates interest in such forgotten figures as Letitia Landon, Felicia Hemans, Mathilde Blind, Amy Levy. Armstrong is a formidable apologist who can turn versified dross into poetic gold - as she does with Hardy's The Dynasts, in her view the last great Victorian double-poem. This is one of those works of scholarship and interpretation that, like C S Lewis's The Allegory of Love or William Empson's Seven Types of Ambiguity, from now on students of English literature will need to turn to again and again.</p>

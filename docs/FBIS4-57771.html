			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Liliana Pinheiro] </F>   [Text] Sao Paulo, 22 May (AE) -- The Fifth National CUT  [Sole Workers Central] Congress, which ended in Sao Paulo today,  became a big party in support of PT [Workers Party] presidential  candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Officially, however, CUT  will not support Lula, based on a vote by members from almost  all the regions. Except for the "Workers Cause" faction, which  accounted for less than 1 percent of representatives at the CUT  Congress, the other leftist factions agreed to elect a single  ticket, on which Vicente Paulo da Silva, also known as  "Vicentinho," was elected CUT president.    The slogan at the plenary session was "Lula president, CUT  independent." At the end of the congress the approximately  2,000 delegates signed a statement of support for Lula.    Lula will begin his campaign in the CUT grassroots on 23  May.  Early in the morning, he will seek votes at the Volkswagen and  Scania plants from a loudspeaker-fitted truck of the Union of  Metalworkers of the Sao Paulo industrial belt. The CUT, as an  organization, will not support him, but unions and leaders have  been authorized to decide whether or not to use the CUT  structure. Direct financial help was prohibited. The delegates  did not approve the creation of a Pro-Lula Workers Fund, which  was aimed at raising funds for the campaign, on behalf of the  CUT.    The last day of deliberations was devoted almost entirely to  political affairs and the designation of members of the single  ticket. The executive board, with 25 full members, will have 14  members of the Coordination faction, which is the most moderate  sector, to which Vicentinho belongs. The other posts were  filled by members of more radical leftist groups: four from the  Union Class Movement, two from the CUT grassroots faction, and  two from the Unified Social Workers Party. The Work, Marxist  Trend, and Socialist Force factions won one position each. The  Coordination faction increased its participation with respect to  the previous CUT congress, when 13 of its members were  designated to the executive board. This will make Vicentinho's  job easier because he intends to negotiate agreements for  several sectors, based on the agreement reached in the car  manufacturing sector.    Lula, who attended the closing reception, praised the new  CUT  president's willingness to negotiate. "The change has improved  CUT," he said, adding that "Vicentinho conveys confidence to the  public, and has the flexibility to negotiate and search for a  consensus."</p>

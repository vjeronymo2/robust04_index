			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Two Japanese banks warn of losses TWO of Japan's sickest regional banks, Hyogo and Taiheiyo, yesterday warned of losses for the year to March. Hyogo Bank, which earlier this week announced the resignations of five executives, expects a loss of Y31.7bn (Dollars 285m) for the year, up from an earlier estimated loss of Y9bn, due to write-offs of bad loans and a Y10.8bn appraisal loss on securities holdings. A former director-general of the finance ministry's banking bureau, Mr Masateru Yoshida, has just been appointed president of the bank, one of the most prominent victims of the late-1980s, when it and several affiliates were big lenders to the property market. Hyogo is attempting to support 10 finance affiliates with Y1,600bn in outstanding loans, of which an increasing percentage are bad. The bank will take a special charge of Y29.6bn to assist in the rehabilitation of those affiliates. Taiheiyo Bank, based in Tokyo, is being restructured by four commercial banks which have pumped in about Y60bn in loans. However, the bank is still expecting a loss of Y1.96bn for the year, as the continuing fall in property prices has slowed the recovery of debts. Like Hyogo, Taiheiyo has apparently boosted profits by selling branches, but the success of the restructuring, scheduled to last for 10 years, will depend on a recovery in the property market. The full extent of the non-performing loan burden at the two banks remains unclear, as they have been forced to slash interest rates charged to ailing customers, though these reductions do not show up in the official calculations of non-performing assets. In contrast, Sumitomo Bank, one of the biggest City banks, signalled that it believes the banking industry is heading into better times by announcing that its net profit for 1992-1993 will be Y14bn, up from a previously-forecast Y12bn. Sumitomo reported appraisal losses on securities of Y36.8bn, though the loss would have been larger but for a surge in Tokyo stock prices during March. The bank also announced that Mr Toshio Morikawa, its vice-president, will be promoted to president, succeeding Mr Sotoo Tatsumi, who will become chairman.</p>

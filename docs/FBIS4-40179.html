			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Vladimir Abrosimov and Lyudmila </F> Yermakova]    [Text] Sofia June 14 TASS -- "Our visit to Bulgaria was not  of so much parliamentary, as of state nature, more so, it was  agreed to by the Russian president, government, and, in essence,  precedes Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's scheduled for this  fall visit to Sofia, when important documents for cooperation  between the two countries are planned to be signed," Russian  Federation Council (upper house of parliament) chairman Vladimir  Shumeyko, who headed a Russian parliamentary delegation to  Bulgaria, said at a press conference here today.    Shumeyko paid great attention to the question of further  interaction in different spheres between Russia and Bulgaria.  He expressed the view that "the development of relations  between the two countries should not be allowed to take their  own course." The Russian politician explained this thought,  while answering an ITAR- TASS question regarding the assessment  of the fulfillment of the interstate treaty on friendly  relations and cooperation signed during Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's visit to Sofia in August 1992.    "The treaty is being implemented in an unsatisfactory  manner.  Suffice it say that at that time an accord was reached to  resolve the problem of mutual debts within a short period, but  the problem has not yet been resolved," Shumeyko said.    In this context Shumeyko recalled the important role played  by parliaments of both countries, which should assist "lawfully  ensure" mutual cooperation, thereby removing different kinds of  barriers which exist on the path to movement of capital, in the  sphere of trade and setting up large industrial and finance  groups.    On the whole, Shumeyko values Bulgaria as an important  strategic partner of Russia on the Balkans, with which Russia  intends to interact within the Black Sea economic cooperation  framework.    As far as the Yugoslavian crisis is concerned, according to  Shumeyko, Russia principly adheres to the stand of "achieving a  compromise, reconciliation of the parties, and not punishing  only one of them," the Federation Council chairman said.    According to Shumeyko, the dialogue held with the Bulgarian  leadership has showed that the two sides, in principle, do not  have any differences over the question of participating in  integration processes taking place in Europe. This, in  particular, applies to NATO's "Partnership for Peace" programme,  and joining other European structures, including Council of  Europe. Certain differences of opinion, which cropped up during  the talks, bear rather tactical than strategical nature, he said.    Answering several questions regarding the implementation of  democratic reforms in Russia and the society's present state  asked by Bulgarian journalists, Shumeyko said that he does not  consider it feasible to hold pre-term presidential elections,  since he does not see "any potential basis" for this, as well as  he does for any dramatic social shakeups in the country. The  Federation Council chairman also touched on the recent  pessimistic statements made by nobel laureate Aleksndr  Solzhenitsyn about the prospects of the formation of a  democratic society in Russia. Every man of letters is free to  voice his opinion, but I do not share the great writer's  pessimism, vladimir Shumeyko said.</p>

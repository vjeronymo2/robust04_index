			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Chieftain falls by 42% to Pounds 613,000 Chieftain Group, the USM-quoted supplier of specialist insulation and fireproofing services, blamed recession in the building and construction sectors for a 42 per cent decline in profits for 1992. The fall, from Pounds 1.06m to Pounds 613,000 pre-tax - in line with the company's forecast - came on turnover ahead at Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 14.4m). The position was exacerbated by delays in completion of a number of sizeable contracts. Pressure on margins and reduced demand have led to the closure of the group's loss-making outlets in Watford and Port Talbot. Chieftain ended the year with 'minimal gearing' and a firm order book according to Mr Peter Wardle, chairman. Earnings per share fell to 4.63p (8.27p) but the proposed final dividend is maintained at 3p, lifting the total to 5.1p (4.9p).</p>

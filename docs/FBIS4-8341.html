			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government  of Premier Jozef Moravcik today called on the chairmen of  several district councils to leave their offices.    Several days after Slovak President Michal Kovac's address  in  parliament, considered to be the start of the process which led  to the dismissal of Vladimir Meciar's cabinet, 17 district  council chairmen and two government commissioners signed a  statement accusing the president of "gross insult to  parliamentary democracy." They said Kovac deliberately  destabilized the political scene and discredited Meciar's  government in his speech.    "The district council chairmen who signed the statement  violated the professional honor and committed a serious offense  incompatible with the exercising of high administrative  functions," Slovak Deputy Premier Ivan Simko told journalists  today after the cabinet meeting.    Moravcik's government believed that after taking the office  it provided these district council chairmen enough time to  apologies to President Kovac and to reassess their stand,  Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus said. "This is a moral appeal and  not an appeal for political reasons," he added.    Asked if controls of district councils' activities could be  expected Simko said that the government had ordered internal  controls in all branches including the central state  administration bodies.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Brymon expected to be split in revamp BRITISH AIRWAYS and Maersk Air of Denmark are expected to announce today a restructuring of The Plimsoll Line to rescue the regional airline services it operates. TPL, in which BA and Maersk each hold a 40 per cent stake, owns Brymon European Airways, formed last year from the merger of Plymouth-based Brymon Aviation and Birmingham European Airways. Following losses over the past four years, the two companies have now decided to demerge the operations with BA taking over Brymon and Maersk Air the Birmingham airline. The two companies are expected to inject about Pounds 5m to Pounds 6m each to restructure TPL and rescue the regional airline services together with about 500 jobs. However, there will be about 125 job losses, mainly at Brymon. The TPL airlines lost about Pounds 2m on turnover of Pounds 66m in the 1991-92 year and a further Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m in 1992-93 on similar turnover. BA will also take over Plymouth City Airport, where it absorbed the Brymon operations. The agreement still has to be cleared by the UK regulatory authorities, including the Office of Fair Trading. Brymon operates a fleet of small turbo-prop aircraft including Dash 8, serving the west country, Aberdeen and Newcastle. Birmingham European flies from the Midlands and Humberside and include some jet services. Maersk Air will become the first non-British company to own a British carrier following the liberalisation of the European airline industry at the beginning of this year.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Observer: Back to first base Mention red socks to an east German, and his first thought is not of a baseball team from Boston, but of the Party of Democratic Socialism, the restyled communists to whom this nickname has attached itself. Unsettled by the PDS taking 18 per cent of the vote in polls ahead of the October election, Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats temporarily donned the socks and ran with them - only to make some serious errors. It was all the idea of Peter Hintze, general secretary of the CDU, who last month came up with a poster depicting a solitary red sock hanging from a washing line. It read: 'Together towards the future, but without the Red Socks.' No sooner had Hintze ordered 200,000 posters than the CDU's branches in eastern Germany refused to back the campaign. Some thought it too frivolous, while others tried to explain to their masters in Bonn that sending up the PDS was tantamount to attacking the east Germans themselves, and hence not the brightest way of trying to heal political divisions that continue to split the country east and west. A poll yesterday by Emnid found 51 per cent of Germans believing the campaign has backfired sufficiently actually to be harming the CDU. So, with Commie-bashing removed from its repertoire, will the government's next game plan have to be a touch more sophisticated?</p>

At 8.00 it offers a programme about the police, The Bill, one of the regular episodes in its soap opera based upon a London police station. At 9.00 there is a programme about the police: The Murder Squad, first of a seven-part fly-on-the-wall documentary series about Scotland Yard's murder investigations. Then at 10.40 there is a programme about the police: First Tuesday offers a documentary about a New York policeman who works on the city's subway. Lighthouse-keepers? Farmers? Anaesthetists? Yes, yes, ITV will be coming to them, if not next week perhaps next century. The French National Front and its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, are the subject of BBC2's foreign affairs series, Assignment (7.45), which points out that there is nothing new about extreme right wing politics in France (or among mankind in general, of course). Without Walls continues its series of conversations about the general state of the world of ideas as we approach the year 2000. Tonight Salman Rushdie is among those who discuss the significance of the collapse of communism in eastern Europe (9.00 C4).</p>

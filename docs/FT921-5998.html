			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Cookery: Pancakes that won't batter your ego ONE pancake splattered on the ceiling, one ego shattered on the floor. An ignominious attempt at pancake-tossing has left an ugly mark on the ceiling as a rueful reminder of my clumsiness. I am not so keen on pancakes now. All the fun and excitement goes if you are condemned, as I am, to turning them with tentative fingers and a spatula. So, I shall leave it to others to show-off their pancake prowess on Shrove Tuesday. Instead, I shall turn my hand to other batters - for I am traditional enough to want to indulge in the time-honoured Shrovetide feasting on dairy produce before the Lenten fast. Drop, or dropped, scones sounds ominously like another disaster, but the name means simply that these scones are made from a thick batter that is dropped off the tip of a spoon on to a griddle for cooking. This distinguishes them from the sort of scone that is made from a dough, rolled out, stamped out with a cutter or upturned tea-cup, and baked. My other recipe is for apple fritters, one of those old-fashioned puddings which, while largely forgotten, is much too good to allow to fall from memory completely. Like drop scones, it can be served in savoury ways as well as sweet. You might think it is sour grapes that prompts me to suggest that these dishes will make a less hackneyed feast than pancakes for Shrove Tuesday, but you will surely acknowledge that they win on speed. Pancakes have to be cooked one by one; these can be cooked in batches. And the less time you spend at the stove, the more time there is for celebratory eating. COTTAGE DROP SCONES (makes about 15) Cottage cheese is not an ingredient I use often - the associations with dieters' salads are too grim - but here it is pure pleasure, used in place of flour to make a tender and creamy light batter. Drop scones (also known as Scotch pancakes) make a sizzling 4pm treat. They are just right for tea-time visitors when there is no time to bake a cake - and are ready to eat within minutes of thinking about making them. Add a drop of orange flower water or a pinch of cinnamon to the batter for fragrant variations on the theme. Flavoured like this, they can even be served for dinner, teamed with creme fraiche and something fruity - say, the pulp scooped from passion fruit, or home-made lemon curd, or spoonfuls of Very Very Apricot (Elsenham's recently-launched runny, fruity and rather superior jam-cum-sauce). If you prefer something savoury, season the batter with salt, pepper and perhaps a little spice. Top the hot, freshly-cooked scones with grilled streaky bacon or a saute of chicken livers and mushrooms, or serve simply dripping with butter and sprinkled with chopped fresh herbs or shavings of Parmesan. I plan to try making these drop scones using buckwheat flour when I think they might make an agreeable alternative to blinis for serving with soured cream and caviare (or smoked salmon, if funds will not run to caviare). Ingredients: 2 oz self-raising flour (or 2 oz wholemeal flour plus  1/4 tsp baking powder); 1 tablespoon caster sugar or a good seasoning of salt and coarsely-ground black pepper; 1 oz butter at room temperature;  1/4 lb cottage cheese; 2 large eggs; 2-3 tablespoons milk. Method: Mix the flour (plus baking powder, if using it) and sugar or salt and pepper. Add the butter and cottage cheese and whizz in a food processor for a few seconds. Pour the lightly-beaten eggs through the spout while the machine is running and continue whizzing until blended smoothly, adding the milk as necessary to slacken the batter slightly. Drop tablespoons of the batter on to a hot, lightly-buttered griddle or heavy frying pan (three or four tablespoons spaced a little apart) and cook over moderate heat until set to a golden brown underneath and bubbles foam to the surface. If the heat is too high, they will burn. Flip them over and cook briefly on the second side. Keep the scones warm and tender in a low oven, wrapped between the folds of a napkin, while you cook the rest and serve as soon as possible. APPLE FRITTERS (serves 4-6) These can be served very simply with quartered lemons and a dusting of demerara sugar for crunch. Spice them up, if you will, with cinnamon sugar or a grating of nutmeg. Or pull out all the stops and hand round a bowl of whipped cream laced with calvados or English apple brandy. For those more savoury-minded than sweet-toothed, the fritters can be served in tandem with Wensleydale or Lancashire cheese. Or, instead of sugar and lemon, flavour the batter with salt, pepper and rosemary, thyme or a few bruised fennel seeds and serve the fritters as partners for pork meats: grilled pork chops, gammon steaks or good old-fashioned sausages - a rich and splendid combination. Ingredients: 6 Coxes or other aromatic and not-too-sweet dessert apples; 1 lemon; 1 tablespoon caster sugar; 4 oz plain flour; 2 tablespoons melted butter;  1/4 pt still dry cider or unsweetened apple juice; 2 egg whites. Method: Grate the lemon zest finely and whizz it briefly in a food processor together with the caster sugar and flour. Add the melted butter and cider or apple juice, pouring them through the spout while the machine is running, and continue processing until the batter is blended smoothly. Peel and core the apples. Slice them into rings and rub with a cut lemon. Whisk the egg whites to snowy peaks and fold them into the batter. Coat the apple slices with batter (just a small handful at a time), shake off excess and deep-fry in oil heated to 360`F (185`C) for four-five minutes or until piping hot, golden brown and cooked through. Drain well, keep hot in a single layer in the oven while you cook the rest, and serve as soon as possible.</p>

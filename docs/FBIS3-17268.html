Colonel Nikolay Pivovarchuk, Russia's military attache, was  introduced to Lithuanian Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius. The  ceremony was attended by General Jonas Andriskevicius,  Lithuanian defense forces commander in chief, and some other  Defense Ministry officials.    For three years Colonel Pivovarchuk served as the assistant  head of the Soviet military mission in Europe and later headed a  department of the Russian Armed Forces staff. Before his  present appointment, Pivovarchuk was a military and political  adviser to the Russian Embassy in Vilnius.    The Russian military attache said his primary task in  Lithuania will be "to develop friendship, cooperation and mutual  understanding." In his opinion, work in this direction will not  be affected by the recent arrest of a Lithuanian businessman  whose company builds housing for the Russian military in the  Kaliningrad region. Pivovarchuk said he is certain that more  Russian military attaches will soon come to work in Lithuania  because of its "specific character" -- many Russian citizens and  former servicemen.    The Russian colonel will reside in Vilnius. He is the 16th  foreign military attache accredited in Lithuania.</p>

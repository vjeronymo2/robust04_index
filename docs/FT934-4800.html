			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Tax relief on extortion banned The government has placed a complete ban on companies claiming tax relief on extortion payments. The 1993 Finance Act introduced legislation to prevent tax relief on any payments contrary to the Prevention of Corruption Acts and the Prevention of Terrorism Acts. The additional proposals announced on Tuesday by the chancellor impose a wider ban on extortion payments to terrorists or other criminals which are illegal. The government said the total expected to be saved was less than its 'negligible' definition of Pounds 5m a year.</p>

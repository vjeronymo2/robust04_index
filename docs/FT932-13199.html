			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Building societies see steady upturn . . . but agents disagree FURTHER EVIDENCE of a steady recovery in the housing market emerged yesterday when building societies disclosed that the value of housebuyers' commitments to buy mortgages rose for the second month running in March. However, the reports below from FT writers in the regions show that many estate agents in England and Wales see only a patchy recovery and are cautious about house prices. The rise in commitments emerged in spite of an announcement this week from the rival Abbey National, the mortgage lender, that its commitments rose 60 per cent in the first quarter. Net new commitments rose to Pounds 3.09bn in March from Pounds 2.72bn in February and Pounds 1.55bn in January. However, the March figure was below that of the same month last year, when it was Pounds 3.46bn. Mr Mark Boleat, Building Societies Association director-general, said reports of rises in activity suggested that lending would continue to increase. Mr John Wriglesworth, UBS analyst, said the increase in net new commitments was significant in spite of the fact that the total for the first quarter was only Pounds 7.36m compared with Pounds 8.43m for the same period last year. Mr Boleat said the rise in house activity had also helped societies to increase their inflow of retail funds because individuals selling homes had capital available. Societies' net retail inflow in March was Pounds 249m, following an inflow of Pounds 208m in February and Pounds 363m in January. The total for the quarter at Pounds 820m was well up on the first quarter of last year, when societies achieved an inflow of Pounds 266m. Societies are worried that they face strong competition for retail funds from the government's National Savings products and from equity products. Last year's total retail inflow of a net Pounds 295m was well below inflows in previous years. Housebuilders have also reported significant increases in net reservations - agreed sales on which a deposit has been paid less any cancellations. A survey of 15 of the country's largest builders conducted by the Housebuilders Federation showed that net reservations rose by a third during the first 15 weeks of this year compared with the corresponding period last year. The biggest rise in sales has been to first-time buyers. Recently there have been signs that sales of houses in the medium-price bracket have also started to improve, said Mr Joe Dwyer, chief executive of Wimpey, the housebuilder. He said: 'The improvement is from a very low base and it is still too early to talk of a sustained recovery. Nonetheless things are looking better.' The government has asked Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, to make the National House Building Council amend its structural warranty scheme for new homes so that builders can use comparable alternative ones.</p>

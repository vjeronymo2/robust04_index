			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Telefonica pre-tax profits rise 7% Telefonica, Spain's govern-ment-controlled telecommunications group, raised its parent company's 1993 pre-tax profits by 7 per cent to Pta107.5bn (Dollars 796m) and claimed it had improved the financial structure of its balance sheet in spite of slack demand last year. However, extraordinary provisioning for taxes brought net profits down to Pta84.7bn, a 1 per cent increase on its 1992 net result. Telefonica, which is the most liquid stock on the Madrid exchange and is nearly 30 per cent owned by foreign institutions, earned considerable one-off fiscal concessions in the run up to Barcelona's Olympic games in 1992. The group's results, which will incorporate its profitable Telefonica Internacional division and are due in March, are expected to show a consolidated net profit rise of 8 per cent according to analysts' forecasts. The parent company said revenue from telephone services had grown by 5.7 per cent to Pta1,220bn, the lowest increase for several years. However, the fall in line usage had been compensated by the growth of new products such as mobile telephony and data transmission as well as by raised service charges. In spite of the lowered demand Telefonica strengthened its balance sheet by reducing its borrowing requirements by more than Pta98bn during 1993 to bring its outstanding debt down by 5.3 per cent at the year-end and by adding Pta43bn to capital and reserves, chiefly through the conversion last year of a 1988 Dollars 200m Euromarket bond issue. Costs increased by only 2 per cent, three points lower than inflation last year, due to expenditure control. Cash flow increased 5.2 per cent to Pta490bn. The sound balance sheet will help Telefonica face the deregulation challenge in the years ahead by developing businesses and forging alliances. Telefonica signed an agreement with Unisource (which incorporates the Swedish, Swiss and Dutch national telephone companies) last month and it is examining projects in cable TV and multi-media. Spain has been granted an extension to the deregulation of telecommunications in the EC in 1988. But five data transmission licences were awarded by the government last year and two mobile telephony licences, one of which will be for Telefonica, are due to be granted later this year.</p>

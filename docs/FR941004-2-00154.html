			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because correction processing occurs at the New York and American Stock Exchanges and at the National Association of Securities Dealers before the trade input is transmitted to NSCC, Add-by-Seller tickets, as well as Delete-by-Seller, Delete Add-by-Seller and Delete-by-Buyer instructions, will no longer be accepted under the proposed rule. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  This change is being proposed in order to standardize correction processing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a complete description of the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange and National Association of Securities Dealers corrections processing systems, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 26773 (May 1, 1989), 54 FR 20227 [File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;89&hyph;03] (order approving the New York Stock Exchange's system for the resolution of uncompared transactions); 28069 (May 29, 1990), 55 FR 23324 [File No. SR&hyph;AMEX&hyph;90&hyph;01] (order approving the Intra-Day Comparison System for resolving uncompared transactions); and 28583 (November 1, 1990), 55 FR 46120 [File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;89&hyph;25] (order granting accelerated approval of amendment to proposed rule change relating to the Automated Confirmation Transaction Service). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC will provide comparison services for corporate bond new issue transactions on the same basic terms and conditions as are currently provided for municipal securities transactions with the exception of syndicate takedown processing. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Original trade input for new issue corporate bond transactions will be accepted until the third day prior to the initial settlement date for the issue. Original input may set forth either (1) A final settlement price and a settlement date that is either the initial settlement date or a specified number of days after the initial settlement date or (2) a dollar price. Original trade input that is submitted between three and five days prior to the initial settlement date but does not set forth a final settlement price and settlement date or does not set forth a dollar price will be treated as regular input. Any corporate bond new issue transactions that remain uncompared at the opening of business on the day prior to the initial settlement date will be deleted from NSCC's system. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC defines ``new issue'' transactions in this context to mean transactions which are to settle on the initial settlement date for an issue or a specified number of days after the initial settlement date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This means that some new issue transactions may not be able to be put through the entire range of available trade resolution procedures prior to being dropped. In the extreme case, new issue submissions made on the second day prior to the initial settlement date that do not compare will be dropped without any opportunity for resolution. These unresolved trades will be reported on a separate unresolved trade report, and any trade dropped without the opportunity for resolution may be resubmitted after the initial settlement date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NSCC's fee structure relating to correction fees will be amended to reflect that correction capabilities will be accelerated in conformity with comparison capabilities. These fee changes will conform all bond correction fees to the fees implemented in connection with municipal securities transaction processing in that participants will be charged for supplemental input on or after T+1. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Currently, NSCC charges participants for supplemental input relating to corporate bond and UIT transactions on or after T+2. In addition, the bond system correction fees for ``don't know'' and ``questioned trade'' input will be deleted because NSCC no longer processes such transactions. The proposed rule change also makes certain conforming changes and deletions to NSCC's Procedures in order to reflect greater uniformity in NSCC's bond comparison system and to eliminate certain language which has become obsolete. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For a detailed description of NSCC's correction fees or municipal securities transactions, refer to Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34193 (June 10, 1994), 59 FR 31284 [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;94&hyph;08] (notice of filing and immediate effectiveness of a proposed rule change modifying NSCC's fee schedule for correction fees). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed changes to NSCC's comparison procedures should help achieve higher rates of trade comparison at earlier points in the comparison process and thus increase certainty and reduce risk in the clearance and settlement of corporate bond and UIT transactions. Moreover, the expansion of corporate bond processing to cover baby bond and new issue transactions will promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. Therefore, NSCC believes the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 17A of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

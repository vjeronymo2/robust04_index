			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: EXIT LINES  </P> <P> Actor-comedian Robin Williams, in a two-part interview to be broadcast Thursday  and Friday on ABC's "Good Morning America," says comedy is a great shield.  "It's a great way to keep people out. Comedy is a defense and also a weapon.  You can use it to decimate people and to hold people back, to defuse them . . .  if they laugh, they won't hurt you."

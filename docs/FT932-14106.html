			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): A target too often missed  -Companies are under pressure to improve their product evolution Lloyd Instruments, a manufacturer of materials testing equipment, expects to have its latest product on the market by June, just seven months after starting work. This represents a halving of the time taken to bring its previous testing machine to market, according to Roger Muttitt, chief mechanical design engineer, and 'a major step forward' for a company with sales of Pounds 5m and a workforce of 75. Lloyd Instruments has achieved this rapid reduction in the time taken to bring new products to market by getting departments such as marketing and production to co-operate more closely. It has installed a network of computers at its Fareham factory so that the engineering, design and production departments have instant access to the latest drawings and is farming out more design work to suppliers. The names given to techniques such as these are parallel processing and concurrent or simultaneous engineering though this is a somewhat misleading term since a fully-fledged system involves marketing and purchasing as well as purely engineering issues. The advantages to companies of these techniques are manifold: customer needs can be taken into account in the choice of product; design can use the most cost-effective manufacturing methods; and time-to-market can be reduced, increasing sales and profits. The opportunity for new products to succeed is under increasing pressure, says David Inwood, joint founder of Inwood Ryan*, a product development consultancy. 'Customer requirements, tougher legislation and competitive pressures mean that products developed by traditional design- or engineering-led methods run too much of a risk of missing their target.' Using traditional techniques, the marketing department, if it was effective, would identify a market opportunity; the design department would put together a suitable product; and manufacturing would then produce it. This 'over-the-wall' approach - one department would pass its work on to the next with the minimum of consultation - made for higher costs and delays. The success of, in particular, the Japanese in reducing the time taken to bring new products to market has led to an increased interest in techniques such as concurrent engineering but there is still a long way to go. UK manufacturing companies of all sizes have made relatively little use of concurrent engineering methods while among small and medium-sized companies fewer than one in five have adopted the technique, according to a survey of 700 companies by Engineering magazine. 'The survey contradicts the popular view that smaller firms are inherently more flexible and innovative in their approach to design and new product development,' Engineering noted. The results of this failure to plan new product introductions properly are that projects overrun their development time by 27 per cent on average and their design costs by 19 per cent, the survey showed. These weaknesses force many companies to adopt defensive strategies. 'The added value to the customer from new products introduced in the UK is too low,' comments John Benson, assistant director of industry at the Design Council**. 'Small and medium-sized companies have low profitability and low investment in research and development. Very few are market leaders. They are 'me too' companies which hang on to market share by trimming production costs and shaving margins.' The starting point for new product design should be the sales and marketing department responding to customer needs. Too often companies fail to ask their customers what they want and design new products which do not meet their customers' needs, says Inwood. Tensator, which makes 'pedestrian guidance systems' consisting of posts and retractable tapes commonly used to form queues in post offices and banks, took the decision to move from being an engineering-led company to one with a sales-led strategy. 'We have a deliberate policy of talking to customers and our six largest ones, including the Post Office and Marks &amp; Spencer, have all had products specifically designed for them,' says David Tuppin, sales and marketing manager. This represents a cost-effective way of developing new products, many of which can then be sold to other customers, and the Tensabarrier now accounts for a third of the company's Pounds 7m sales. Tensator, which is based in Milton Keynes, has also developed a more coherent approach to market research, installing a computerised database to log customer information and economic data. 'These are basic marketing tools which weren't available in an engineering-led company,' says Tuppin. But while market research is a frequently overlooked part of new product design, the crucial element in fast product development is team-working, according to the advocates of concurrent engineering. The precise make-up of the team or teams will vary depending on the project and on the company, but David Inwood includes marketing, manufacturing and technology specialists. John Benson says purchasing expertise is also important given the role which suppliers can play in designing components and sub-assemblies. Muttitt says that Lloyd Instruments is too small a company to support cross-functional teams - the same people would be in every team. But it does hold regular product development meetings led by the engineering department and involving the managing director, senior design staff and representatives of sales and production. 'We brief them on the progress of the project and discuss any action which needs to be taken by other departments,' explains Muttitt. 'Production can start work on the tooling while marketing can get the brochures produced.' Unlike Tensator, Lloyd Instruments does not invite its suppliers to take part in these meetings but it does delegate responsibility for sub-assemblies in fields such as bearings, electronics and cables. A third company, Watkiss Automation, which makes paper hand-ling systems used to collate brochures and multi-set invoices, also depends on its suppliers for help in specialist areas but has in other respects chosen a different route to reducing development times. Watkiss, which has turnover of Pounds 4.2m and a workforce of nearly 60, has brought some jobs in-house because it believes it can get work done more quickly. The company produces its own tooling for making plastic mouldings because of the delays involved in using outside companies and it also brought its software and printed circuit design work in-house. Initial market research can also be carried out internally because Watkiss has printing activities so knows from its own experience what it wants from a paper handling system. Just over a year ago the Sandy, Bedfordshire-based company launched a modular paper hand-ling system which allowed customers to assemble a system that met their precise needs. Designing the new equipment took two and a half years and cost more than Pounds 500,000 but it has led to a near-doubling of Watkiss's turnover and taken 40 per cent of its market sector. The length of the development period reflected the large amount of innovation involved, says Jo Watkiss, public relations manager. Despite winning awards for its designs, Watkiss makes less use of the product design vocabulary familiar to companies such as Tensator and Lloyd Instruments. Product design is handled by its eight-strong research and development team composed of designers and engineers. This may reflect the fact that Watkiss is a family-owned company - six family members are at present employed, while Tensator and Lloyd Instruments are subsidiaries of larger, international groups. But whatever technique is used, companies cannot avoid the growing pressure to improve their approach to product design. *Inwood Ryan, The Grange, Market Street, Swavesy, Cambridge, CB4 5QG.

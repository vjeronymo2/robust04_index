Further, FAA is reviewing a proposed noise compatibility program for that airport which will be approved or disapproved on or before July 10, 1994. This notice also announces the availability of this program for public review and comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 103 of title I of the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act of 1979 (hereinafter referred to as ``the Act''), an airport operator may submit to the FAA noise exposure maps which meet applicable regulations and which depict noncompatible land uses as of the date of submission of such maps, a description of projected aircraft operations, and the ways in which such operations will affect such maps. The Act requires such maps to be developed in consultation with interested and affected parties in the local community, government agencies, and persons using the airport. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An airport operator who has submitted noise exposure maps that are found by FAA to be in compliance with the requirements of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 150, promulgated pursuant to title I of the Act, may submit a noise compatibility program for FAA approval which sets forth the measures the operator has taken or proposes for the reduction of existing noncompatible uses and for the prevention of the introduction of additional noncompatible uses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The City of Kissimmee submitted to the FAA on December 2, 1993, noise exposure maps, descriptions and other documentation which were produced during development of the Kissimmee Municipal Airport FAR Part 150 Noise Study between July 1, 1991, and November 29, 1993. It was requested that the FAA review this material as the noise exposure maps, as described in section 103(a)(1) of the Act, and that the noise mitigation measures, to be implemented jointly by the airport and surrounding communities, be approved as a noise compatibility program under section 104(b) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has completed its review of the noise exposure maps and related descriptions submitted by the City of Kissimmee. The specific maps under consideration are ``Existing (1992) Noise Contours on Existing Land Use'' and ``Alternate 5 Recommended Future (1997) Noise Contours on Existing Land Use'' in the submission. The FAA has determined that these maps for Kissimmee Municipal Airport are in compliance with applicable requirements. This determination is effective on January 11, 1994. FAA's determination on an airport operator's noise exposure maps is limited to a funding that the maps were developed in accordance with the procedures contained in appendix A of FAR part 150. Such determination does not constitute approval of the applicant's data, information or plans, or a commitment to approve a noise compatibility program or to fund the implementation of that program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

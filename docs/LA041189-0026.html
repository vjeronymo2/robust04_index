			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. KILLING OF TERRORISTS CAN BE JUSTIFIED, TOP ARMY LAWYER SAYS  </P> <P> The Army's top lawyer has concluded that military strikes against terrorists  can be justified legally without running afoul of a 1976 presidential order  banning assassinations.  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. Hugh Overholt, the Army's judge advocate general, argues in an  eight-page draft memorandum that America's diplomatic and military  bureaucracies have failed for too long to define the term assassination and  that thanks to changes in "the nature of the threat," action against terrorists  can be justified under the legal concept of national self-defense.  </P> <P> "The employment of military force against a terrorist or terrorist organization  to protect U.S. citizens or the national security of the United States is a  legitimate exercise of the international legal right of self-defense and does  not constitute assassination," Overholt concludes.  </P> <P> The existence of the Overholt memorandum was first reported Monday by a trade  publication, Defense Week, and quickly acknowledged by Army officials.  </P> <P> Lt. Col. Dick Bridges, an Army spokesman, explained that the service had been  encouraging legal debate within the Pentagon, State Department, CIA and other  agencies in hopes of producing a common definition of assassination.  </P> <P> Bridges said the Army's basic "Law of Land Warfare" manual, last revised in  1956, has a definition of assassination that dates back to The Hague Convention  of 1907.  </P> <P> That definition states, "It is especially forbidden to kill or wound  treacherously individuals belonging to the hostile nation or army."  </P> <P> The Overholt memo notes that war, in essence, legalizes the "killing of the  enemy," but in peacetime, the standards of conduct must be defined under the  U.N. Charter -- "which recognizes the inherent right of self-defense of  nations" -- and domestic laws and regulations.  </P> <P> In 1976, then-President Gerald R. Ford signed a presidential order banning  attempts to assassinate foreign leaders.  </P> <P> In the intervening 13 years, "the nature of the threat has changed, rather than  the international legal right to respond to the threat," Overholt wrote.  </P> <P> "It is noted that the terrorist individuals or organizations envisaged as  appropriate to necessitate or warrant an armed response by U.S. military forces  are well-financed, highly organized paramilitary structures engaged full-time  in the illegal use of force," the memo concludes.  </P> <P> "A national decision to employ military force in self-defense against a  legitimate terrorist threat would not be unlike that employed in response to an  overt conventional threat."  </P></p>

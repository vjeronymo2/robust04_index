			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons moves to restructure management ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks,food and retailing group, yesterday announced a management restructuring designed to sharpen the focus on its international development. Four regional councils are to be set up to promote overall strategies and operating efficiencies in the group's main markets. Mr John Giffen, 52, will give up his operational posts as chairman and chief executive of the wines and spirits division to which he was appointed last year, to join the group's headquarters team as chairman of the Americas council. Mr Michael Jackaman, chairman, will head the council for western Europe; Mr Tony Hales, chief executive, will oversee the Far East and Africa; and Mr Roy Moss, chairman and chief executive of the brewing division, will head the UK council. 'Each regional chairman will have the clear objective of making sure that we miss no opportunity for growth and synergy in our priority markets,' said Mr Jackaman. The group is also reorganising its business into four operational sectors, including for the first time, a separate retailing arm. Mr David Jarvis, 44, who was last year appointed chairman and chief executive of J Lyons, will become chief executive of the spirits and wines operations which contribute about half of group profits. Mr Hales will be chairman, and Mr Giffen, deputy chairman. Mr Tony Trigg, 51, will become chief executive of the retailing sector which will include Allied's 6,000 pubs, the 1,000 Victoria Wine shops and the Baskin-Robbins and Dunkin' Donuts franchise stores operating in the US and internationally. Mr Moss, who will be chairman of the retailing sector, and Mr Trigg will continue to run the brewing and wholesaling operations. The two men will be Allied's representatives on the board of the proposed Carlsberg-Tetley joint venture. Mr Hales will head the food manufacturing sector, consisting of the J Lyons beverages, bakery and ingredients businesses, with Mr David Beatty, 59, the present corporate development director of Hiram Walker, as deputy chairman. Mr Peter Macfarlane, group finance director, will join the boards of spirits and wines, retailing, and food manufacture.</p>

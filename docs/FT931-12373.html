			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Farepak falls deeper into the red at Pounds 0.97m Farepak, the USM-quoted Christmas food hamper and meat processing group, reported an increased seasonal pre-tax loss of Pounds 965,000 for the six months to October 31 1992 against Pounds 613,000 last time. However, the group is confident of strong growth in the full year and is increasing its interim dividend 13.8 per cent from 1.45p to 1.65p. Turnover expanded to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds 10.46m) and Farepak's agency network - through which it sells its hampers - increased last year by 13 per cent, to 55,000. The average sale per agent was up by 5 per cent and the number of hampers sold last Christmas was 800,000, an increase of 9 per cent over the previous year. Analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 5.4m for the full year, up from Pounds 4.8m last time.</p>

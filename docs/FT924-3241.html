			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Pledge on cost of Ulster terrorism THE TREASURY is to underwrite any extra costs the Northern Ireland Office faces this year in compensating for terrorist damage in the province. But it is still resisting any help for insurers on the UK mainland. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, announced yesterday that he had agreed an 'insurance policy excess'. The Treasury will provide a back-up if the sums paid out in compensation in Northern Ireland exceed the amount allocated in his department's budget. The deal follows the unprecedented freezing of Northern Ireland spending programmes in the last financial year because of unexpected extra costs of the compensation scheme. However, the Treasury said no parallels should be made with the situation on the mainland where no similar scheme operates - in spite of threats by insurance companies to withdraw cover for terrorist attacks on commercial property from next year. Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, is talking with insurance companies about possible solutions. The Treasury said the Northern Ireland agreement was to make clear where the burden of any extra payout would fall. It added: 'It is not a matter of generosity. It is a matter of good control of public expenditure.' In 1991-92, the Northern Ireland Office paid out Pounds 33m in compensation but the amounts vary considerably from year to year according to the extent of terrorist attacks. With the IRA now apparently targeting commercial property, this year's total could be substantially higher. The NIO does not reveal how much is set aside each year for the scheme.</p>

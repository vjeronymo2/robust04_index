			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TALKING PEACE  </P> <P> The guerrillas fighting to overthrow the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador  have made their most dramatic effort so far to end nearly a decade of warfare  in that country. President Jose Napoleon Duarte should reply quickly and  constructively to the rebel proposal while the United States continues to  encourage the nascent peace process.  </P> <P> Meeting in Mexico with leaders from 13 Salvadoran political parties,  representatives of the five guerrilla factions in the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front offered to lay down their arms and "incorporate ourselves into  the nation's political life" if the government responds by changing the  country's powerful military and security apparatus. In making the offer the  rebels abandoned their longstanding demand that the 6,000 regular guerrilla  fighters of the FMLN be integrated into the Salvadoran army as a precondition  to peace. The proposal clearly caught Salvadoran political leaders by surprise  -- and impressed them. Even a spokesman for the ARENA party, which has urged  all-out war on the FMLN in the past, called the rebel offer "a transcendental  step."  </P> <P> This is the second time in as many months that the FMLN has offered a dramatic  concession totry to renew a long-stalled peace dialogue in El Salvador. In  January it offered to take part in presidential and legislative elections  scheduled for later this year if the government agreed to postpone the voting  from March to September and guaranteed to protect candidates sympathetic to the  rebels. The talks in Mexico were a result of that first rebel offer, which was  initially rejected by Duarte as a sham.  </P> <P> Only when the U.S. government, which pours about $1 million worth of military  and economic aid into El Salvador each day, expressed interest in the  guerrillas' first proposal was it taken seriously. The Salvadoran political  leaders traveled to Mexico this week to further explore the rebels' election  plan, but they returned to El Salvador with something even more substantial.  Now it is time for Duarte and his government to respond.  </P> <P> Clearly much remains to be discussed before peace can come to El Salvador. How  will the rebels be disarmed, for example? And will El Salvador's powerful  military caste be willing to accept the profound changes that the rebels have  suggested? Will the generals reduce the army to 12,000 men, the number that it  had when the civil war began in 1979, from the current level of more than  50,000? Will they surrender the control of the Treasury Police, the National  Police and other security agencies that have been the source of so much  corruption and that harbor some of El Salvador's worst violators of human  rights? And what of the rebel demand that several famous human-rights cases,  including the murder of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, be investigated?  </P> <P> The answer to those and many other hard questions regarding El Salvador's  future can be answered only when Salvadoran government representatives sit  across the negotiating table from the FMLN. It is time for that to happen, and  the United States must use all its influence in El Salvador to guarantee that  it does.  </P></p>

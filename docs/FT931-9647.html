			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Arts: Don Giovanni - Opera Two London music schools, the Royal College of Music and the Royal Academy, have been involved in a merger, which was set in place last September. The London Royal Schools' Vocal Faculty is the result: facilities from the vocal and operatic teaching departments of both bodies are now being shared, and jointly funded, under the stewardship of Robert Tear (Artistic Adviser) and James Lockhart (Director of Opera). The most immediately visible product of the union will be the opera shows - Don Giovanni just opened at the RAM theatre, The Turn of the Screw at the RCM next month, others to follow - whose alternating casts and production forces draw on the newly shared resources. For instance, this new Mozart production is conducted by Mr Lockhart (based at the RCM) and produced by Graziella Sciutti, a much-loved Mozart, Rossini and Donizetti soprano now active at the RCM in a teaching capacity. No-one in his or her right mind would seek to disgorge runes and portents from Monday's opening performance. It was, however, full of positive features, which can be taken to indicate the general strengths of the London schools' just now: their ability to attract promising material from across national boundaries, and their luck in having both Mr Lockhart and Miss Sciutti involved in their pedagogical activities. The RAM Opera Orchestra produced impressively solid, vigorous support throughout the evening. The first cast boasts two singers of outstanding gifts - the Ottavio of Ya-Lin Zhang (a physically stiff but free-throated, Italianate tenor) and the Elvira of Susannah Glanville (a fresh-voiced, mettlesome, strongly expressive soprano). Also on show are a Leporello (Paul McNamara) and an Anna (Susan Strangward) not quite 'finished' but rich in promise, and a strikingly young-looking Giovanni (James Lawrence) whose vocal facility and personality need only the natural benefits of greater experience. All the singers seem to have benefited from Miss Sciutti's vibrant engagement with the text and her alertness to character detail. This opera's mesh of emotional complexity and plot intricacy is particularly difficult for young people to convey, yet there was little sense of faltering in weaving its dramatic and musical web. One question-mark hangs over the production, though: the design style, murky, cumbersome and '50s-ish, offers the students no chance to make contact with the more up-to-date modes and manners of opera-staging they will doubtless encounter on leaving college. It is devoutly to be hoped that this forward-looking new concept in operatic education will allow its students to look forward in every possible way. Last performance tomorrow</p>

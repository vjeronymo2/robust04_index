			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: UK gilts The Bank of England has certainly done its best to make its first gilt auction since the devaluation attractive. Not only will the sale create a new 10-year benchmark with liquidity appeal. The partly-paid structure, under which the last instalment of half the principal is not due until next April, also creates an unusually large gearing advantage. Both factors speak for the auction's success. Whether that means worries about funding have been overdone is another matter. Overseas investors, who normally like paper of this maturity, are still hesitant. Sterling is on the sidelines of the latest market turbulence. So it might make sense for international investors to switch into gilts from French government paper, where the exchange risk is growing. But gilts are already trading at a yield premium of only some 125 basis points to German government bonds. D-Mark paper itself - or other markets in dollars, perhaps, or Swiss francs - offer a more attractive haven than gilts. At some stage the Bank will need to find a way of tapping foreign demand if it is to meet next year's requirement. For the time being, its new paper will go largely to domestic buyers. It may help that institutions still want to increase their weighting in gilts, while the market has been undersupplied since the previous auction in August. Still, the real state of demand will best be measured by the extent to which successful bidders are simply switching out of longer-dated paper, depressing yields at that end of the maturity spectrum.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> MURDERER DENIED PAROLE FOR 5TH TIME  </P> <P> Mark J. Baker, serving life in prison for bludgeoning a friend to death on a  Dana Point beach, was denied parole for the fifth time Monday.  </P> <P> In a strongly worded decision, the three-member parole board cited the  "especially atrocious and cruel" nature of the 1978 murder.  </P> <P> They also noted Baker's long criminal record, earlier failures at probation,  disciplinary problems in prison and failure to develop a marketable skill, said  Phyllis Scott, spokeswoman for the California Board of Prison Terms.  </P> <P> The board found that Baker "continues to be unpredictable and a threat to  others," Scott said.  </P> <P> Baker was 21 when he was sentenced to life with the possibility of parole after  pleading guilty to the murder of Karl Marcus Chancellor of Newport Beach. A  year earlier, he had been acquitted of the murder of a Ft. Lauderdale doctor's  wife -- a murder to which he had once offered to plead guilty.  </P> <P> Baker is now 33 and serving his sentence at the California Medical Facility in  Vacaville.  </P> <P> His parole has been vigorously opposed by his victim's parents and by the  Orange County district attorney's office and Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> But one of Baker's former wives maintains that Baker has changed profoundly in  prison and is no longer dangerous.  </P> <P> Baker will be granted another parole hearing in two years, Scott said.

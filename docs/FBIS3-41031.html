A resolution  made today instructs the government to carry out the exchange of  ratification letters to the treaty.    The stipulations related to guarantees of Ukraine's  territorial integrity, inviolability of borders and protection  from aggression by nuclear states as well as compensations for  Ukrainian nuclear warheads withdrawn from the republic.    At present, the stipulations are lifted since the deputies  believe that Kiev's conditions have been met.    The resolution was passed by a majority of 260 votes, with 3  votes against. Five deputies abstained and 21 failed to take  part in the voting.    The parliament also decided to join the Lisbon protocol to  the START-I treaty, including article 5. According to the  article, Ukraine will join the nonproliferation treaty as a  non-nuclear state in the near future. However, the parliament  rejected the proposal to immediately join the treaty.    A total of 193 deputies voted for joining the treaty, 27  against. Eleven deputies abstained and 58 failed to take part in  the voting.    Speaking before the session, Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk said that the republic will necessarily receive the  compensation for the nuclear weapons destroyed. He said  Ukrainian, Russian and American experts will start work on  determining the size of the compensation in February.    "If only one of the sides fails to fulfil its obligations,  Ukraine will suspend the activities on its part," Kravchuk said,  meaning the withdrawal of warheads of strategic nuclear missiles.</p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> No New Cheers: The owner of Boston's landmark Bull &amp; Finch Pub announced  that the bar would not change its name to Cheers, the television comedy it  inspired, because of objections from loyal patrons. Pub owner Thomas Kershaw  said the Bull &amp; Finch had been negotiating with Paramount Pictures,  producer of "Cheers," to make the name change, "but our regulars made a  compelling case to keep the Bull &amp; Finch tradition alive." Created in 1969  as a neighborhood bar, the pub became an international tourist draw 1982, when  "Cheers" producers made it the basis of the NBC television series. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

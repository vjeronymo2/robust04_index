			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: DIVING INTO THE 'LITTLE MERMAID' SEXISM ISSUE  </P> <P> At a USC screening of "The Little Mermaid" the other night, a young woman asked  the co-authors and co-directors, in a tone that could be characterized as  civilly indignant, whether a woman had been consulted in the creation of the  script.  </P> <P> Was what she called the "Some-Day-My-Prince-Will-Come" Syndrome (in which the  answer to any mermaid's prayer is simply to find a good man) their work solely  or a coeducational enterprise?  </P> <P> It was clear the questioner could not believe there had been any feminine  input. She read Disney's new animated feature as reflecting a traditional if  perhaps unconscious sexist view of the woman's role and goal.  </P> <P> Ron Clements and John Musker, Disney animators and writers since 1974 and 1977  respectively, said that women had indeed been part of the creative process.  They admitted, wryly, that the question had come up before.  </P> <P> They argued that the mermaid was a far cry from such enchanting but essentially  passive heroines as Cinderella and the prince-awaiting Snow White.  </P> <P> It is true on the one hand that the mermaid flips out when she catches sight of  her handsome, lovelorn, land-dwelling prince. But what is also true, they  pointed out, is that the mermaid has been established as a resourceful,  independent-minded and even headstrong, insatiably adventurous and active young  woman.  </P> <P> More than that, she is at last prepared to say goodby, painfully, to father and  closest friends and begin a new life in the name of both love and adventure,  not any more regarded as incompatible aims.  </P> <P> The implication seems clear enough from the film that if the prince is  expecting a do-nothing princess he has got another think coming. They met when  she saved him from drowning, after all.  </P> <P> Another questioner observed that in the originating Hans Christian Andersen  fairy tale, the little mermaid dies, and how come the story line was changed?  </P> <P> The idea of generations of moppets and their parents and grandparents rushing  off to see an animated film in which the heroine dies for trying to rise above  her aquatic station, so to speak, fairly well answered itself. It was an undue  and probably inappropriate risk for a multimillion dollar enterprise.  </P> <P> What does come as an occasional jolt to audiences conditioned to fairy tales as  popularized historically not only by Disney itself, but by children's books,  radio and television as well, is that fairy tales were sometimes grim whether  by the Brothers Grimm or not. They were cautionary moral tales (poor gluttonous  Hansel and Gretel!) and no one escaped the iron laws of seemly behavior.  </P> <P> The questions from a university audience were instructive. They reaffirmed that  all films, even animated features, can be interpreted as carrying messages,  whether intentional or not. "The Little Mermaid" is not about feminine  consciousness or about the possibility of living in two different worlds. But  obviously it is, or it can be made to be.  </P> <P> In fact "The Little Mermaid" is a first return in 30 years to the fairy tale  form with which Walt Disney had such remarkable success commencing with "Snow  White." It restores the clarity of story that had been missing from many of the  ambitious animated features from Disney and elsewhere in recent times.  </P> <P> You don't need a score card to know who is good and who is evil in "The Little  Mermaid." The suspense as to who will win is established early and sustained to  the end, decorated with some bright songs (from the composers, Alan Menken and  Howard Ashman, of "Little Shop of Horrors") and some grand slapstick.  </P> <P> Challenged, as Musker and Clements admit, by the immaculate and elaborate  animation of ex-Disneyite Don Bluth in "The Secret of NIMH" and "An American  Tail," a new generation of Disney animators went all out -- leaving no shimmer  unshimmering -- on "The Little Mermaid." It was four years' work by a crew that  reached 400 strong, and it looks it.  </P> <P> But in animation as in live-action, there is no substitute for a strong script.  Musker and Clements noted that "The Little Mermaid" was written line for line  before the first squiggles hit paper. It is the best animated Disney feature  since "The Rescuers" (which still had no ending, well into production.)  </P> <P> When, finally, it is right, animation celebrates and stimulates the limitless  human imagination like no other form of film. Audiences seem to agree, as the  attendance at both "The Little Mermaid" and Don Bluth's new "All Dogs Go to  Heaven" indicates.  </P> <P> Also like live-action, animation has evolved along with the sophistication of  even its youngest viewers. "The Little Mermaid" is calypso-hip and has a  villainess right out of a Klondike saloon. The hip and the innocent can  coexist.  </P></p>

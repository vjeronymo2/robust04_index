			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> HELM DESERTED, COAST GUARD SAYS  </P> <P> The pilot of a sportfishing boat had gone below deck and left no one at the  helm just before a collision with a 564-foot tanker outside Los Angeles Harbor  late Thursday night, Coast Guard officials said Saturday. Coast Guard Cmdr.  Chris Desmond said 2nd Mate Tim Filson of the fishing boat Shogun was primarily  to blame for the crash with the tanker Sealift Antarctic. He said Filson may  have his operating license suspended. The Coast Guard spokesman said Filson,  25, broke one of the "basic rules of navigation" by failing to keep a proper  lookout before the crash, which injured seven people and spilled 2,000 gallons  of jet fuel at the mouth of the harbor. But Desmond, head of the Coast Guard's  Marine Safety Office in Long Beach, said that both vessels were to blame and  that Capt. Arthur Irish of the Antarctic could also have his license suspended  for failing to give way to the smaller vessel. Desmond said the fishing boat  had the right of way at the time of the crash. Desmond said that at the  completion of its investigation in about two months, the Coast Guard will  probably recommend that Filson and Irish have their licenses suspended for an  undetermined period.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> *** GREEN ON RED, "THIS TIME AROUND," CHINA/POLYDOR. ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A  SCALE OF ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> This time around the veteran L.A. subterranean rock band -- now just  founder/singer Dan Stuart and guitarist Chuck Prophet plus various sidemen --  has come up with its leanest, meanest album yet. Dylanstones in the desert on  the hottest day of the year, with some surprising country tenderness to provide  a little shade. STEVE HOCHMAN  </P></p>

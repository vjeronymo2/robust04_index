			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / MPs seek reversal of port sale decision A CROSS-PARTY delegation of MPs is to seek a meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister, in a final attempt to overturn the bitterly resented outcome of the Tees &amp; Hartlepool port privatisation. But transport ministers were yesterday standing their ground, indicating that there would be no about-turn unless significant new information emerged before next week's ratification of the decision. The MPs are urging the prime minister to reverse the decision to sell the trust port to Humberside Holdings, a private consortium, instead of the hotly tipped management-employee buy-out team headed by Mr John Hackney, the port's chief executive. The decision has caused uproar in the ports industry because other trusts fear their own management-employee buy-out bids will also be defeated. Mr Stuart Bell, Labour MP for Middlesbrough, has sent a 13-page submission to Mr Major detailing allegations that the Tees &amp; Hartlepool Port Authority conducted the sale of the port improperly in at least seven respects. Mr Bell's submission says two of the directors of Humberside Holdings had been directors of two dock service companies that went into liquidation during the abolition of the dock labour scheme in 1989, leaving the taxpayer to pay their liabilities of Pounds 6.6m in redundancy payments. He claims the authority did not take this into account when considering whether Humberside Holdings met a key criterion of the sale: the bidders' previous record of meeting their commitments. Another allegation is that Humberside Holdings was given the opportunity to introduce additional investors and increase its bid from Pounds 100m to Pounds 180m during the competition, while the buy-out team was given no such chance to raise its Pounds 150m bid. The last opportunity to overturn the decision will be on Tuesday evening, when MPs are asked to approve a parliamentary order setting out the provisions for clawing back any property profits made by the port's new owners. But the government will use its majority to force the measure through and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the transport secretary, is expected to confirm the sale the next day.</p>

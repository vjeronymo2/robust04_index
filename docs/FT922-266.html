			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Company failure rate sharply up: Number of collapses rises 17% - West Midlands shows the steepest fall in output - Interest-rate switch urged THE number of company failures due to the recession has risen by 17 per cent while the number of creations has fallen by the same percentage, according to two studies. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, says 1,320 businesses have collapsed each week in the second quarter of this year - about 17 per cent up on the same period last year. Meanwhile Jordans, a supplier of company information, said about 2,000 companies were formed each week in April and May, 17 per cent down on the same two months last year. Although the two sets of figures are not strictly comparable, they suggest that the healthy surplus of company creations to failures, a feature of recent years, may soon no longer apply. Even last year - when company failures set a new record - more than twice as many businesses were formed as disappeared. In the boom year of 1988, creations exceeded failures by a factor of six. Dun &amp; Bradstreet said that in the second quarter 15,841 businesses in the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, failed due to bankruptcy or liquidation. In the equivalent period last year, the figure was 17 per cent less at 13,539. Most of the businesses going under appear to be relatively small partnerships or sole traders. During the first six months of this year, failures rose to 30,722, 33 per cent up on the 23,161 recorded in 1991. Over the whole of last year, failures reached 47,777. Bankruptcies during the first six months came to 19,263 (as opposed to 12,725 last time) while liquidations totalled 11,459 (10,436). There were wide regional variations, with 7,015 business failures in the south-east, not including London, in the first six months of this year, a rise of 57.9 per cent on the same period last year. According to Jordans, 16,194 companies were formed in April and May in England and Wales, compared with 19,599 in the same two months last year. If Scotland is included, the number of company formations is increased by about 6 per cent. In the year to the end of March, 105,865 companies were formed, 3 per cent down on the 109,865 total in the previous 12 months.</p>

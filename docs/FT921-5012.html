			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Observer: Expensive ferry Remember what happened to National Home Loans after it took a bunch of analysts on a weekend skiing trip to Austria last year? The share price subsequently under-performed the market by 97 per cent, the chairman and chief executive quit, and the nicest thing one can say about the company currently is that it is 'distressed'. Well, it now seems that Trinity International, publisher of the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, has booked Concorde to ferry another party of 'independent' analysts the 225 miles from London to Liverpool so they get to next month's Grand National on time. An embarrassed PR man warns Observer not to jump to conclusions. Trinity is a picture of financial health and Concorde was flying to Liverpool anyway. Of course.</p>

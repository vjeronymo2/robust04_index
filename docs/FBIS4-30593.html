			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Cho Chae-hyon] </F>   [Text] The Bank of Korea [BOK] said yesterday that domestic  banks should be encouraged to become larger through mergers and  acquisitions (M&amp;A) in order to efficiently compete with  powerful  foreign financial institutions.    Stressing that the level of domestic banks'  internationalization is far lower than that of foreign banks,  the central bank said Korean banks face disadvantages in making  inroads into international financial markets due to their low  credit standing which the BOK said stems from their smaller  sizes and bloated nonperforming assets.    To get recognized as credible banks in international  financial community, banks have to seek credit assessments from  international credit rating companies like Standard &amp; Poor's  or  Moody's, but there are only three Korean banks including Korea  First Bank, Hanil and Sinhan which have received credit ratings  from them.    The BOK said one of the main reasons behind domestic banks'  low credit standing in the international banking community is  their smaller sizes.    For domestic banks to expand into overseas financial markets  and raise funds cheaply abroad, they should expand their  organizations which can be achieved through mergers and  acquisitions.    In order to encourage M&amp;As between banks, the central  bank  said the government should, among other things, guarantee  various financial incentives to those which try to press ahead  with M&amp;As. It also called for the revision of related laws  hampering M&amp;As by financial institutions.    It said that although international banking business is  becoming more and more important in line with the trend to  financial market liberalization and opening worldwide, Korean  banks are lax in strengthening their muscle in the area.    To stimulate domestic banks' internationalization, it said  management at banks should establish bolder longterm strategies  such as expanding investment in hardware and software in  international banking divisions.    "What banks should do first is to secure professionals who  have skills and experience in international banking like foreign  exchange, derivatives and financing for foreign enterprises,"  BOK's senior official Pak Chae-chun said.    He said the absence of international banking strategy at  most  banks is another element hampering their modernization. "To push  for internationalization which is very costly, they need  responsible and autonomous management which can establish  long-term projects and press hard ahead with them.    The central bank called on banks to expand the number of  their overseas branches and to actively develop foreign clients  rather than Korean clients operating there. The Korean  commercial banks' branches and subsidiaries operating overseas  number only 127, far fewer than the 443 of 11 major Japanese  banks. Furthermore, it also urged that overseas branches be  localized in such a way as to hire more foreigners as top  managers.    Korean banks have employed few foreigners in their overseas  networks, which the BOK said blocks them from developing foreign  clients. According to the central bank, the ratio of foreign  managers to Korean managers at Korean banks' overseas branches  is only 33.6 percent. On the other hand, the corresponding  ratio of foreign banks operating here is 87.7 percent.    Korean commercial banks face limits in efficiently enhancing  their international banking operations because they lack  incentive systems in their personnel management. The central  bank suggests that they pay higher wages to professional  officials who deal with international banking than the other  regular employees.    It also recommended the government ease all restrictions  preventing domestic banks from expanding into international  banking. It urged gradual relaxation or elimination of  cumbersome foreign exchange regulations. In particular, in order  to help banks strengthen their ability to finance foreign  enterprises, it said they should be allowed to extend long-term  loans with maturities of more than 10 years to foreign  enterprises.    Domestic banks have faced many restrictions in foreign  exchange transactions and developing derivative products due to  heavy-handed regulations on daily foreign exchange fluctuation  bands, foreign exchange holding and selling amounts.    Korean banks lag far behind foreign banks in terms of  financial futures transactions which have become more important  instruments to hedge against growing risks.    The outstanding amount of financial futures transactions of  all domestic commercial banks is far smaller than at one  American bank. That of Korean commercial banks amounted to only  3.4 billion dollars at the end of last year, compared to 976.4  billion dollars at Citibank of the U.S., it said. And the  outstanding amount of Korean banks' derivative products was 5.9  billion dollars, compared to 977.9 billion dollars for Citibank.</p>

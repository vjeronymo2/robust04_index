			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / US retail inflation up a modest 0.3% US retail inflation remained modest in August, encouraging Wall Street, which had taken fright at last Friday's sharper than expected jump in wholesale prices. The consumer price index rose by 0.3 per cent, the same as in the previous two months. This compares with market forecasts of a 0.4 per cent rise and the month's wholesale price rise of 0.6 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 19.52 higher at 3,879.86, though the bond market reaction was more restrained, with the 30-year long bond up 11/32 to yield 7.68 per cent. The government also reported a widening of the trade and current account deficits in the second quarter of the year. The shortfall on goods and services rose to Dollars 27bn (Pounds 17.3bn) from Dollars 24.3bn in the first three months, while the current account balance, which covers all international transactions, was in the red by Dollars 37bn, against a revised Dollars 32.3bn in the January-March period. The merchandise trade deficit expanded to Dollars 41.8bn from Dollars 37bn, reflecting the relative strength of the US economy against that of its principal trading partners. Exports did increase - to Dollars 122.7bn from Dollars 118bn - but less than imports, which rose to Dollars 164.4bn from Dollars 155bn in the first quarter. This was the largest quarterly deficit in six years. The consumer price index now stands 2.9 per cent higher than in August last year and has risen at an annual rate of the same amount in the first eight months of this year. The so-called 'core' index, which strips out the more volatile food and fuel sectors, has also risen by 2.9 per cent in the two periods. Last year the overall CPI went up by 2.7 per cent. In August, as throughout the summer, the rise in international oil and coffee prices were the main upward forces, with the energy component of the index rising by 1.4 per cent and the cost of a gallon of petrol at the pump going up by 3.7 per cent. The price of coffee, up 22 per cent in the month, pushed the grocery index up by 0.6 per cent. But this was counterbalanced by otherwise modest increases in the food sector and by a 1 per cent drop in clothing prices. Some of the sharp rises in the cost of meat recorded in the wholesale index are expected to work their way through to the retail level, but the prospect of good harvests should mitigate this impact on the index.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Major's chance to show European heart - European Community MR JOHN Major likes to distinguish himself from his predecessor by saying that Britain is at 'the heart of Europe'. Britain's turn as president of the European Community for six months, which starts on July 1, will give him an unrivalled opportunity to show that the heart is beating at a measured but healthy pace. Political difficulties in other EC countries, combined with Mr Major's improved personal stature after the election, seem likely to provide the the prime minister with an ideal European springboard. The Queen's Speech made clear that the government will be giving priority to ensuring a brisk passage for the bill implementing the Maastricht treaty on European union agreed five months ago. UK officials are drawing quiet satisfaction from the recent spate of opposition to the Maastricht treaty in other countries such as Germany and France. Britain's view is that the government's well-known scepticism over a federal Europe has been vindicated by the anti-Maastricht flurry on the continent. At the same time, setbacks for government parties in elections in France, Italy and Germany will make Mr Major a more persuasive partner in dealing with his counterparts from other EC capitals. The resignation of Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the long-serving German foreign minister, seems likely to weaken, at least temporarily, the cohesion of the traditional Franco-German alliance in the EC. This may boost the chances for Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, to promote British views. Britain will be using the presidency to push forward enlargement of the Community, as well as to complete the establishment of the single market, due to come into force on January 1 1993. To stress its commitment to free markets, the government wants to make particular progress in breaking down trade barriers in life insurance, transport and energy, and public procurement. Even before the presidency has started, the aim of EC enlargement is being emphasised by a series of top-level visits to London from representatives of applicant countries. Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, will be in Downing Street today, while Mr Esko Aho, the Finnish prime minister, was in London last week. Both countries, along with Austria, want to join on January 1 1995. The government believes that the Community can continue to be 'deepened' - through the single market, as well as through greater co-operation in economic and foreign affairs - at the same time as it is being enlarged. But, as one official puts it, 'deepening is going to slow down as you go wider.' The UK believes that the timetable for European monetary union will be delayed by Germany's economic difficulties. The UK wants to hold out the hope of maximum access to EC markets, and eventual full membership, for former communist countries Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. But there is little enthusiasm for the wide-ranging institutional reforms suggested by Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, as a way of managing a much more numerous Community. The UK is banking on support from Germany for toning down another Delors initiative - the plan for a large increase in spending on poorer regions, conceived as part of the 'cohesion fund' agreed at Maastricht. Germany's criticisms of Mr Delors' latest suggestions have been as strong as Britain's. British officials are banking on Mr Major's strong personal rapport with Chancellor Helmut Kohl to help revise downwards the Commission's proposals. Whitehall also opposes signs of growing trends in the Commission towards interventionism. These were highlighted by the recent row between Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, the commissioner for industry, over aid for the automotive industry.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One comment noted that &sect;6.2(d) exempts the NPS from its own rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at this part. Two comments asked how the NPS will ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with conditions of &sect;6.4 for NPS-operated solid waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal sites, if the procedural, administrative, financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance and penalty provisions of the proposed regulations do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not apply to NPS operated solid waste disposal sites. The NPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will adhere to the conditions of &sect;6.4 (for a new, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded existing solid waste disposal site) and to the conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of &sect;6.5 (for existing NPS operated solid waste disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sites) as a matter of policy and special directive. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the NPS will comply with the National Environmental Policy Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (42 U.S.C. 4321,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and, at a minimum, prepare an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental assessment for any new, or expansion of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing, solid waste disposal site that the NPS proposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule changes the word ``procedural'' at &sect;6.2(d) to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``permit'' for clarity. The reason why the permit, bond and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty provisions do not apply to the NPS is that there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> means by which the NPS may be both the permitting agency and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permittee, the bond-poster and the bond-holder, the enforcer and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the violator, simultaneously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6.3&blank;Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to one comment, note that the proposed, as well as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final, definition of the term ``agricultural waste'' includes waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting from the ``harvesting of .&blank;.&blank;. trees.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment specifically sought clarification about whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concession operations in parks, whether under contracts or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial use licenses are ``exempt'' from the regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This question is best answered by discussing the definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the term ``National Park Service activities.'' There must be a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary connection between the NPS and the establishment of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid waste disposal site after the passage of the Act. ``National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Park Service activities'' includes activities conducted by NPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees because such persons, under agreement with the NPS, provide eating,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lodging, transportation and other services to park visitors or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> park management itself. Since the NPS may operate a new solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste disposal site within a unit for NPS activities, the NPS may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve new sites for the disposal of solid waste generated by NPS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees. Such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons may also dispose of solid waste in existing NPS operated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While NPS contractors, concessionaires and commercial use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> licensees may dispose of solid waste on lands within a unit, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal by such a person to establish their own new site for solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste disposal, or continue to operate and use their own existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solid waste disposal site, is fully governed by 36 CFR 6.4 or 6.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The disposal of solid waste by such persons, while permissible on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lands within a National Park System unit, must be subject to full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NPS scrutiny. The NPS has a fundamental obligation to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contractors, concessionaires and commercial use licensees dispose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of solid waste on lands within a unit, even the remote lands in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alaska, in an environmentally sensitive manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Residential waste,'' as defined in &sect;6.3, means waste generated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the normal activities of a household. One comment suggested that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the residential waste exception at &sect;6.2(c) not include paper,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plastic and metal. Since the &sect;6.2(c) exception is intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize the solid waste stream by providing an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disposal means for agricultural or residential solid wastes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are compostible, we have partially adopted the suggestion. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule defines ``residential waste'' to exclude plastic and metal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste, since these are not compostible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment appeared to confuse the ``residential waste'' exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this part with the ``household waste exclusion'' that exists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 40 CFR 261.4(b)(1). The definition of ``residential solid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste'' used in this part comes from 40 CFR part 243. That  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition means waste generated by the normal activities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households. This definition applies only to residences, not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial activities, such as lodges, motels or eating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishments. On the other hand, the EPA definition at 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 261.4(b)(1) broadly excludes ``household waste'' from the legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaning of hazardous waste. The 40 CFR part 261 meaning of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``household waste'' includes waste generated by residences AND  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial lodging and eating establishments. It does not follow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that because 36 CFR part 6 largely excludes residential waste from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its control, that the NPS is also somehow excluding waste disposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from commercial lodging or eating establishments. The fact that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes generated by such establishments are specifically excluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the definition of ``hazardous waste'' under RCRA regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not make such wastes ``residential wastes'' for the purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this regulation. These two issues are unrelated and are addressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in separate sections of this regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

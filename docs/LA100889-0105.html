			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Thailand will not repatriate two Burmese students who hijacked a plane with 83  aboard to dramatize their demand for a return to democracy in their homeland, a  Thai official said. Deputy Prime Minister Thienchai Sirisamphan, who persuaded  the hijackers to surrender at the U Taphao air base, said, "We will not hurt  them." Ye Tin, 21, and Ye Thi Ha, 25 -- authorities said their names may be  pseudonyms -- hijacked a Fokker-28 over Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, and  diverted it to Thailand, where nine hours of negotiations ended in their  surrender.  </P></p>

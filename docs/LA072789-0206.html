			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUROR'S ANTI-CALIF. BIAS UPSETS VERDICT  </P> <P> A Seattle jury foreman who told fellow jurors that Californians are so "sue  happy" that they will drag their own mothers into court has given a California  woman a new shot at winning damages from Safeway Stores Inc.  </P> <P> The Washington Supreme Court today agreed unanimously that the juror was biased  against Californians, and that his failure to disclose the bias during jury  selection entitled Marie N. Robinson to a new trial to determine damages.  </P> <P> Robinson sued Safeway in 1983 after she was struck on the back by a metal rack  that fell as she reached into a refrigerated unit.  </P> <P> A King County Superior Court jury in Seattle awarded the woman $9,278, an  amount Robinson considered inadequate. She sought a new trial on grounds that  the jury foreman's bias against Californians had resulted in the inadequate  award.  </P> <P> Upon review, the Superior Court found that the jury foreman, whose name was not  disclosed, failed to reveal a bias toward Californians even when asked during  jury selection.  </P> <P> The lower court found that during jury deliberation the foreman said: "These  Californians sue anyone they can get money from. . . . Californians are sue  happy."  </P> <P> The court found that the foreman further said: It is "the fast pace, I guess. I  mean, you don't see the suits in Washington like California. People down there  sue for anything. Children sue their parents, parents sue their children. I was  sued for $500,000 because of a car accident" in California.  </P></p>

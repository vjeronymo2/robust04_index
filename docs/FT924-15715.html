			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (7): Promise of big benefits - Innovative companies are using integrated software systems to help manage human resources. They are frequently enjoying a big return on their investments / Management briefing; Personnel packages PEOPLE are arguably both a company's biggest expense and its most important resource, yet use of full human resources computer systems to help control the expense and manage the resource is patchy. Payroll systems have been around since the early days of commercial computing, but personnel packages are much more recent and integrated systems - combining all human resources functions - are only just starting to take off. 'Personnel has always been a wild and woolly area,' says Mr John Mills, chairman and chief executive of human resources software specialist Midland Software. 'The traditional view is that no one tells the personnel manager what to do. Indeed, in some areas, where there have been industrial relations problems, the personnel department might have been more or less running the company. This function has been one of the most resistant to computer systems.' Personnel managers interviewed by Software At Work back this view to a point but add that personnel automation has always taken second place to key business systems such as accounting, order processing, manufacturing control and stock management. Yet as this issue of Software At Work shows, companies which have introduced human resources systems are enjoying big returns on their investments. KLM, for example, is saving over Pounds 500,000 a year through better staff rostering, a 33 per cent cut in sick leave and more productive use of human resources staff, all for a one-off cost of Pounds 100,000, (see case study: page 8). The key to the success at KLM and virtually all the other companies interviewed has been the emergence of personnel systems running on personal computers and supplied by software houses specialising in this field. This has enabled personnel departments to overcome the problem of the low priority given to the development of their systems. The PC package has enabled the personnel department to set up and run its own systems from day to day. In some cases the database is held on the company's central mainframe computer but control still resides in the personnel department, which manages and accesses the information through personal computers. This development is reflected in the 1992 Computers in Personnel survey, carried out by the Institute of Manpower Studies. It shows that only 30 per cent of personnel systems have the central computing department as their main source of support, even though 38 per cent are being run on the mainframe. The survey also reflects the emergence of software packages in this area: two-thirds of companies with personnel systems have bought in packages and less than a quarter are using systems developed in-house. Around 75 per cent say their systems are acceptable or good; 80 per cent have similar views on the technical support they get. However, the emergence of personnel systems has raised the issue of integration with other systems, notably payroll and pensions. A way of controlling costs The argument here is that data from these traditionally separate areas is used by all three, so it makes sense to integrate the systems. This then makes it possible to get precise information on individuals, teams and departments from day to day to help control costs, model the impact of pay increases or company cars, look at promotion or redundancy costs and any other information, the extent of which is restricted only by the limits of the user's imagination. Integration can mean taking the approach offered by Midland Software and a few other package suppliers of installing a single system. Or it can mean linking separate packages from a single or different suppliers, perhaps even including a payroll system run by an external computer bureau. John Mills at Midland Software says a survey of big organisations by his company shows that around five per cent set up integrated systems between 1984 and 1990 and another 15 per cent in the last two years. Around 30 per cent will go this way over the next two years and another 30 per cent in the mid-1990s, leaving 20 per cent looking towards the end of the century before they take this step. Mr Colin Richards-Carpenter, associate director of the Institute of Manpower Studies, believes that links between personnel and payroll are needed at very least. 'Our survey shows that only a third of personnel systems are linked directly with payroll, although 44 per cent of managers say they need this facility in future,' he says. 'But this leaves nearly a quarter of personnel systems users saying a link with payroll is not required. Can someone explain the thinking behind this?' Even so, Mr Richards-Carpenter adds: 'It is surprising how advanced some organisations are in connecting their personnel systems to others: for example, 10 per cent have links with pensions, 44 per cent with spreadsheets and 31 per cent with other systems.' The Institute of Manpower Studies survey also shows that a third of organisations have added modules for tasks such as recruitment administration and training management and that most others see such additions as high priorities. Surprisingly, Mr Richards-Carpenter says, the areas in which little is being done are costing, budgeting and manpower planning. John Mills at Midland Software argues that the integration issue highlights the need for top management concern with personnel. 'The current fragmentation is due to the lack of recognition of the importance of personnel work, both by senior management and by personnel itself,' Mr Mills says. 'Personnel has had changing priorities over the last 20 years: we've been through the industrial relations problems of the 1970s and early 1980s and then the emphasis switched to staff communications and more recently to business restructuring. So it has not been clear to personnel what they want in terms of systems.' There has also been the political problem of departmental boundaries, with payroll often coming under the finance department. But an integrated system, with just one set of records, transcends departmental boundaries - 'such issues demand that this whole area needs to be looked at by the most senior management.' Human resources systems are also raising issues for line managers. Personnel managers interviewed by Software At Work say many of the line managers they serve are bemused by the amount of highly detailed information now available to them. Previously, personnel had problems even supplying the number of people in a department; now it can offer lists of people who speak French and have two-litre cars, if required. Personnel managers say their systems have enabled their departments to become active service organisations, examining costs and trends and taking this information out to the line managers. But many line managers do not know what questions they can now ask. One way to help them is to give them direct access to the information through their own personal computers. Some companies are introducing access gradually, for example by letting managers book courses for their staff through the system. As KLM's personnel manager, Mr David McCammon, puts it: 'It's better if line managers run a company, rather than personnel. These systems provide the information to enable them to do that, but it can take time to change people's perceptions.' The satisfaction with personnel systems, largely confirmed by the Institute of Manpower Studies survey, and the rapidly increasing take-up of these systems reflected in other surveys, suggest that this could be a big growth area in the 1990s. As Colin Richards-Carpenter at the Institute of Manpower Studies says: 'The modern personnel system is a very powerful tool and organisations seem to be having few problems justifying the investment.'</p>

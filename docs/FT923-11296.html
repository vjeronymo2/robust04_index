			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Survey of Second Cars (5): Chance to indulge a little fantasy - Individual Choice / Second cars do not have to be sensible little hatchbacks, saloons or estates BUYING your second car can be an opportunity to indulge a fantasy, gratify a whim or project one's personality. For example, driving to a part-time office job or taking the children to school can be much more fun in a four-wheel drive. The high seating position lets you see over hedge-rows and the tops of cars in front. You may never need the 10 forward and two reverse gears. The high ground clearance designed to cope with rutted trails may never be put to a sterner test than mounting a high kerb when sneaking into a parking space. But at the wheel of a Suzuki Vitara or Daihatsu Sportrak you can imagine yourself driving across the Sahara, not down to Sainsbury's. They are the kind of cars that fit a lifestyle in which Barbours, jodhpurs and green wellies figure, whether you shoot or ride or not. They cost no more to buy and insure than normal cars of similar price and power though they are thirstier because of the extra weight and friction of their four-wheel drive transmission. A sporting two-seater or two-plus-two (the latter a two-seater with impractical but conscience-saving back seats) is another option. Such cars, including the Mazda MX-5, Toyota MR-2 or the new Honda CRX are enormously entertaining, though in no way difficult or demanding, to drive. They capture the spirit of the traditional British two-seat sports car exemplified by the MGs of early postwar years but have all the 'mod cons' that the MG conspicuously lacked. With tops folded or stowed away in the boot, they offer the joys of open-air motoring with very few of the inconveniences. If you need more than two seats but still like the idea of driving topless in summer weather, there are plenty of proper four-seat convertibles to choose from. With hoods up, such cars as the Ford Escort, Peugeot 205, Rover 214, Vauxhall Astra and VW Golf cabriolets offer close to saloon car comfort. Hoods down, they provide all the fresh air one could possibly need without blowing your head off. Insurance, it has to be said, is a potential problem for owners of a sporting two-seater or a four-seat convertible. The insurance companies suspect, probably correctly, that a sports car will be driven harder than a saloon and they know that a soft-top convertible is a bigger security risk. A sneak thief with a Stanley knife can ruin a hood in seconds even if he decides not to pinch the stereo after all. Nostalgia and a desire for individuality being what they are, many young second car buyers fancy the idea of driving a collectable classic instead of a modern hatchback. The main thing to bear in mind about old cars is that they are like old houses. They look picturesque, even romantic, but they use more fuel, are less environmentally friendly and much more troublesome to maintain. If you live in a 200-year-old farmhouse, you need to know how to rehang tiles. Equally, if you choose to run a 30-year-old MGB or even a Morris Minor instead of a modern car, you need to know one end of a spanner from the other if you are not to be faced with (a) unreliability and (b) ruinous garage bills. Having said that, collectable cars are now trading at more sensible prices than they were a few years ago. One may appreciate rather than lose value as it grows older, but only if it receives the tender, loving care that modern cars were designed to do without. Never be carried away by a car's good looks and one's own imagination when contemplating buying a collectable as a second car. Tread carefully; to do otherwise can lead to financial disaster.</p>

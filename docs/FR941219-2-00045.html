Montana's PWSS program, administered by the Drinking Water Section of the Department of Health and Environmental Sciences, has adopted regulations for total coliforms, Phase II (7 inorganic and 26 organic chemicals), Phase IIb (1 inorganic and 4 organic chemicals), Phase V (5 inorganic and 18 organic chemicals), and lead and copper that correspond to the National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR) in 49 CFR Part 141 for total coliforms (FR Vol. 54, No. 124, June 29, 1989, Pg. 27544&hyph;27568), Phase II (FR Vol. 56, No. 20, January 30, 1991, Pg. 3526&hyph;3597), Phase IIb (FR Vol. 56, No. 126, July 1, 1991, Pg. 30266&hyph;30281), Phase V (FR Vol. 57, No. 138, July 17, 1992, Pg. 31776&hyph;31849), and for lead and copper (FR Vol. 56, No. 110, June 7, 1991, Pg. 26460&hyph;26564). The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has completed its review of Montana's primacy revisions and has determined that they are no less stringent than the NPDWRs. EPA therefore approves Montana's primacy revisions for Total Coliforms, Phase II, IIb, V, and Lead and Copper Rules.

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Building workers skirmish over pay: Strike organisers tell Diane Summers why they believe the employers are vulnerable MIKE, CHRIS and Frank are sitting in a cafe after a hot day's work on a central London building site. They would prefer to be quenching their thirst in the pub next door, but have been asked to leave for wearing 'work clothes' - the euphemism employed by landlords to protect white-collar drinkers from the sight of the working man. The pub is not the only place Mike, Chris and Frank are unwelcome to the management. They are part of a team which has been organising unofficial strike action and flying pickets on nine London building sites over the past few weeks. So far there have been only skirmishes, but the core group of 40 to 50 activists known as the Joint Sites Committee are threatening full-scale battle with building contractors across the capital before the end of the summer - Frank claims that even the new headquarters site for MI5 at Vauxhall and MI6's site at Millbank have been penetrated. Links are being forged with workers on sites in other parts of the UK, and builders claim unofficial support from London Underground employees and postal workers. Money to support strikers is raised at meetings, union conferences and in canteens on building sites across London. The issue is money - building workers have taken pay cuts of between 30 per cent and 40 per cent over the past two years. Sometimes there is no pay as subcontractors hit by the recession disappear and cheques bounce. Longer working hours and deteriorating health-and-safety standards are also sources of complaint. Mike says there is deep anger among building workers: 'They can't pay the rent - they've got nothing to lose by taking action. When there's a confrontation with the employer, instead of walking away, they're standing their ground. Anyway, they can't walk away, there are no other jobs.' Now is a good time to strike, says Chris: 'The employers are weak. They've cut their own profit margins even before the foundations are laid. They're terrified of penalty clauses for not completing on time.' Two years ago a bricklayer was getting between Pounds 75 and Pounds 80 a day. Now jobs are being advertised at Pounds 48, says Frank. Rates for labourers have dropped from around Pounds 40 to Pounds 60 a day to Pounds 35 a day, Chris says. The worst off might be left with Pounds 23 after tax, he adds, for working from 8am to 6.15pm. The figures are confirmed by research carried out by Ucatt, the main building union, in support of this year's pay claim. Ucatt says building workers have been doubly hit by the housing crisis. Many became first-time buyers of properties they were building in the boom 1980s. Mortgaged up to their necks, they have now seen earnings plummet. For Mike, Chris and Frank, the official pay talks are an irrelevance. Like 700,000 other building workers out of a total 1.3m, they are self-employed and sceptical of the effectiveness of union representatives. Says Frank: 'A lot of the officials are only interested in their flash cars and cushy jobs.' But Mike says some union officials have backed them, though this has to be 'with a nod and a wink' because much of the action is illegal secondary picketing and wildcat strikes without the balloting required by law. Some of the activists are union members - mainly Ucatt, with a few TGWU general union members. Others - like a large proportion of the workers taking action - belong to no union. BUILDING employers yes-terday proposed a freeze on basic pay rates in talks covering 600,000 building and civil engineering workers. The proposal was rejected by the unions and further talks are due to be held on June 9. The Building Employers Confederation and the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors said the industry was 'still stuck at the bottom of the longest recession the economy has suffered since the 1930s'.</p>

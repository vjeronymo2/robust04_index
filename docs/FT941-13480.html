			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Beer price war Hints of a retail price war in Britain's bars and public houses kept brewery stocks subdued. A trade magazine published yesterday highlighted a '79p-a-pint' promotion by one regional brewery group, and recent reports of similar offers from some of the leading drinks groups were enough to mark drinks stocks down sharply as the market opened. 'The threat of a retail price war will be the enduring story of 1994,' said one analyst. Another, Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest Securities, said that the concern was a nagging one rather than anything fundamental, but added: 'The sector can probably shrug off price promotions lasting a month - the worry is if they run and run.' Not all the stocks were hit. Whitbread 'A', one of the most vulnerable to the threat of a price war, rose 7 to 614p but turnover was miserly. Elsewhere, most stocks rallied from the early falls. Bass lost 6 on balance at 590p, Greene King 4 at 565p, Allied- Lyons 4 at 659p, Scottish &amp; Newcastle a penny at 580p and Greenalls 3 at 483p. Guinness, thought to be resilient to the discounting threat, jumped 21 to 539p with 7m traded. The minor drag on the SG Warburg share price in recent weeks triggered by the legal dispute between the largest of the UK merchant banks and Yeoman International, the Irish financial services group, dissolved yesterday when the two groups agreed an out of court settlement. Warburg, which was being sued for Pounds 155m by Yeoman, said the terms of the settlement 'will have an insignificant effect' on its profit and loss account and financial position. Warburg rallied 8 to 982p. The high street banks were featured by yet more bullish comment from leading brokers. Last week's positive note from Morgan Stanley was followed by an upgrade by SG Warburg Securities. Barclays advanced 14 to 635p in heavy turnover of 9.2m. The broker was also said to have promoted TSB, a penny firmer at 289p after a hefty 7.2m changing hands. National Westminster, seen as cheap relative to Barclays and where there was talk of imminent switching activity, also made progress, adding 6 at 611p. US buyers continued to be attracted to aero engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce, sending the stock 8 higher to 185p. Volume rose to 20m, making it one of the day's most actively traded stocks. Reports that the government was about to raise the 29 per cent maximum foreign ownership limit continued to be heard. Turnover in British Steel rose to 34m as US buyers joined European investors moving into the stock. A broker's recommendation last week attracted European buyers to the stock, but it was reports of a return to profitability for US steel companies that attracted US investors to the British stock. The shares put on 4 at 132 1/2 p. UK merchant bank Kleinwort Benson was also said to be positive. British Aerospace climbed 16 to 444p after a weekend press report that Honda Motor is negotiating to raise its stake in BAe subsidiary Rover cars from 20 per cent to 40 per cent. Food retailers suffered amid continued talk of retrenchment and restructuring. J. Sainsbury, the focus of much weekend press speculation over whether or not it would follow the example of close rival Tesco and cut back its expenditure programme, dipped 2 1/2 to 457 1/2 p. Tesco receded 6 to 237 1/2 p with 7.6m traded. In an otherwise flat food manufacturing sector, Unigate added 3 at 430p, with SG Warburg highlighting the stock's strong dividend flow prospects. There was further speculation ahead of results this Thursday from MFI, the furniture store group. Last week the shares had come under pressure as some in the market suggested that the results would be accompanied by a dull trading statement. However, the stock's supporters were evident yesterday, with confident predictions of MFI profits ahead of the forecast range of Pounds 18m to Pounds 25m. The shares responded, advancing 9 to 176p. Turnover reached a hefty 5m. Sparkling results from John Menzies sent the shares surging 30 to 654p. Reports that Rank Organisation planned an expansion of its film interests lifted the stock 15 to 1089p. Ladbroke nudged up a penny to 208p as the comapny announced an Pounds 86m windfall from the relinquishing of a Hong Kong hotel management contract. Electronics group Molynx slumped 10 1/2 to 25p after warning of a significant loss for 1993. The company said last month it was involved in takeover talks with Silvermines. Yesterday Molynx said it had agreed preliminary terms which would indicate a value in the region of 25p a Molynx share. Transport group Goode Durrant held at 165p after a 25 per cent stake, some 13m shares, in the company, formerly held by Winnedale, were placed by Charterhouse Tilney, the stockbroker, at 159p a share. Bett Brothers, the building and property group, forged ahead 23 to 150p after a block of shares moved through the market via an agency cross carried out at that price.</p>

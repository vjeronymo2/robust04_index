			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VOLUNTEERS TRANSFORM COUNTY EYESORE INTO A GREENBELT  </P> <P> A group of neighborhood volunteers combed the bushes for empty beer bottles and  Styrofoam coffee cups, yanked a few weeds and raked away tangles of dead ground  cover.  </P> <P> With the ceremonial placing of a 15-foot eucalyptus tree -- voila! -- the  eyesore began to resemble a greenbelt again Saturday. "Hopefully, this is the  start of something," said Jeff Baker, president of the homeowners' association  that organized the cleanup of the 60-foot-wide strip of land on the east bank  of the Los Angeles River in Long Beach.  </P> <P> Baker and about 40 neighbors of the Wrigley area toiled on a couple acres of  the largely barren lot that they say has been ignored by its owner, Los Angeles  County. Besides improving the looks, they say they want to send a message to  the county that the entire 13-acre riverfront strip from Willow Street to  Wardlow Road should be left as an undeveloped, park-like greenbelt.  </P> <P> Ray Grabinski, a Long Beach City Councilman who represents the district,  watched the clean-up and called it "a classic example" of how residents can  band together to improve their neighborhood.  </P> <P> And it all started with Andy Kowal's broken foot.  </P> <P> Kowal, whose wife publishes the neighborhood newspaper, said he became  interested in the fate of the vacant property as he lay at home recuperating.  </P> <P> "I had to keep my foot elevated," Kowal explained as he hobbled around in a  foot cast. "So instead of watching TV, I started calling the county and the  city to see the status of the land." He said he found out that the county is  offering the land for sale, a move that residents fear would bring new  development on the edge of a tract of small, custom-built homes mostly built in  the 1930s.  </P> <P> Researching further, he said he discovered that new development could force  relocation of the several underground high-pressure gasoline and oil lines  feeding local refineries that lace the vacant property. Also, rainwater runoff  from the neighborhood collects on the property before finding its way into the  river.  </P> <P> The findings, he said, present a convincing case against development. Kowal  said he contacted leaders of the Wrigley Assn. to organize Saturday's cleanup  and went to the county for a permit. The county waived the normal $50 permit  fee, which Kowal said he appreciated, considering the association was cleaning  up county land.  </P> <P> He added that he was told not to plant any trees. So he disregarded the rules  and joined the whole crew in the planting of a single, symbolic tree, the  eucalyptus donated by a Signal Hill nursery.  </P> <P> Gabe and Cheryl Ferramola said they came to pick up trash to show their support  for the neighborhood. "Because I live here, I'm concerned about development in  the area," Gabe said. "We definitely don't want any developments."  </P></p>

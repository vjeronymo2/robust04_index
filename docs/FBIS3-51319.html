			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aquileo Sanchez Viquez] </F>   [Text] Four weeks before Costa Ricans wake up with a  president-elect, the country's electoral situation does not yet  allow a forecast of an undisputed winner for these elections.  Had the elections been held during the previous week, however,  Jose Maria Figueres [presidential candidate for the National  Liberation Party, PLN] would have won with a 3-percent advantage  over Miguel Angel Rodriguez [presidential candidate for the  Social Christian Unity Party, PUSC].    This is what we gather from the sixth weekly poll conducted  by the Multispecialty Development Counselors (CID/Gallup) from 3  to 6 January 1994, as part of the "1994 Electoral Campaign"  series. The participants in this poll were 1,010 Costa Ricans  from around the country, 510 interviewed in their homes and the  rest via telephone.    The poll indicates that Costa Ricans are facing a campaign  that is different from the others, as the personality of the  candidates and their backgrounds are the focal point of the  campaign, whereas ideas and programs have passed to second place  in importance.  <H5>  Distances Become Shorter </H5>   The trend toward a near tie between Miguel Angel Rodriguez  and Jose Maria Figueres, which prevailed in November, is  repeated again in January, still with the opposition candidate  in the lead.    When asking Costa Ricans for whom would they will vote if  the  elections were held today, 39.5 percent of the polled  respondents gave their support to Figueres, while 35.5 percent  supported Rodriguez. In that poll, 10.7 percent said they were  undecided.    Upon asking that last group about their electoral  inclination, should they be forced to choose, 4.6 percent said  they favored the official candidate, and 3.6 percent favored the  opposition candidate.    When these data are added, it turns out that the final vote  inclination for Figueres is 43.1 percent, and for Rodriguez it  is 40.1 percent. Regarding other preferences, Miguel Salguero  of the Democratic Force Party got 4.1 percent; Jorge Gonzalez  Marten of the National Independent Party, 0.6 percent; and other  candidates, .6 percent. In the end, 3.4 percent remained  undecided; 4.6 percent said they did not support any candidate,  and 3.5 percent preferred not to respond.    We must cite that the poll has a margin of error of three  points, more or less, which affects all the results; thus, the  support for Figueres varies between 40.1 percent and 46.1  percent, and the support for Rodriguez is between 37.1 percent  and 43.1 percent.    Regarding the previous poll, which was published on 20  December, Figueres' support dropped by 1.5 percent, whereas  Rodriguez' increased by 1.3 percent.    The decrease in support for the green-and-whites [PUSC] is  also observed when measuring the support for the political  parties, as this week, the PLN has 45.8 percent of the followers  while the PUSC has 37.3 percent.    In the previous survey, the Social Democratic Party  garnered 47.5 percent of the votes, whereas the Social Christian  Party got 38 percent.    The latest poll by Borge and Associates, conducted from 27  to  30 December, was also disclosed last week. The results put Jose  Maria Figueres one point above Miguel Angel Rodriguez (41.6  percent to 40.6 percent), although the PLN maintains a  five-point lead over the ruling PUSC.    In terms of the political parties, the CID/Gallup studies  indicate they have maintained the same level of support since  August, when the first survey was taken following the June  conventions. Figures shows that the gap between the candidates  is narrowing, with Figueres dropping and Rodriguez gaining.  Figueres enjoys the support of the majority of the electorate  in the metropolitan area and voters less than 24 years old who  have a secondary level education. Rodriguez, in turn, has the  support of voters in the rest of the country, those less than 24  years old who have at the most completed a primary level  education and those who describe themselves as undecided.    By way of example, one has to note that other CID/Gallup  polls taken a few weeks before the previous elections show  levels of support similar to the ones the current candidates  have. For instance, in November 1985 Oscar Arias had a backing  of 45 percent, whereas Rafael Calderon had 43 percent. Four  years later Carlos Manuel Castillo had a support of 38 percent,  and Calderon 43 percent. To be sure, the characteristics of  those campaigns were different than the current one, as was  noted earlier. The electorate perceives Miguel Angel Rodriguez  more positively than Jose Maria Figueres. A total of 50.6  percent of Costa Ricans regard the Social Christian Party  favorably and 30.2 percent unfavorably, leaving a positive  balance of 20.4 percent.    Figures, in turn, receives a favorable opinion from 46.1  percent of the people and an unfavorable opinion from 35.1  percent. The difference is 11 points.    Comparing the results with the previous survey, Figures goes  up 3.2 percent, whereas Rodriguez drops 2.9 percent.</p>

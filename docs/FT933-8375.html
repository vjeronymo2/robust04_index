			<p>930816 FT  16 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Medway bid talks are at advanced stage MEDWAY PORTS, which recently announced its intention to seek a stock market flotation next year, confirmed yesterday that 'a number of approaches had been received which may or may not lead to an offer for the company.' Potential bidders are thought to include Forth Ports, Mersey Docks and Powell Duffryn. Medway admitted that discussions with an unamed party - thought to be Forth - had reached an advanced stage. Pre-tax profits are likely to reach Pounds 10m this year, which at current industry valuations would put a potential sale price of Pounds 100m on the the Sheerness-based group. Medway, which was bought by its management and employees for Pounds 37m in March last year, has made no secret of its desire to link up with other port and shipping groups, and has indicated that in the absence of a merger its flotation would enable it to make acquisitions. Mr Peter Vincent, chief executive, said recently: 'If it was a safe pair of hands, we'd have to look at it very seriously. I see Medway as part of bigger group in the long term, whether we build it up ourselves by acquisition or find a partner.' As the flotation was predicted to raise in the region of Pounds 70m, a sale at the potentially higher price would result in a windfall for Medway's 270-strong workforce, which was recently granted share options as part of an incentive scheme. For the 10 months to December, Medway made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.5m on turnover of Pounds 25.2m. In the first six months of this year, pre-tax profits have jumped to Pounds 4.5m.</p>

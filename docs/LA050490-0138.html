			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> LOST SIGHT OF THE PRINCIPLE OF THE THING  </P> <P> The Tustin Unified School District is locked in a long contract dispute with  its teachers that has resulted in some teachers' refusing to give out homework  assignments. Students understandably regard themselves as interested parties in  the labor dispute, and to register their dissatisfaction over not getting  homework, more than 1,000 of them staged a protest at Foothill High School last  week. Unfortunately, the school's administration has overreacted to the  demonstration and further displeased not only the teachers but students and  parents as well.  </P> <P> The latest twist in the dispute centers around the dismissal of Edmund Cronin,  a transfer student who helped organize the protest. The administration says he  argued with Principal James Ryan during the demonstration, the last straw in a  series of transgressions that allegedly included tardiness and unexcused  absences. Cronin's teachers were upset enough with the dismissal to complain  about it to Ryan. Although some teachers may sympathize with Cronin, their  willingness to speak on his behalf also suggests at least something positive  about him as a student. At the minimum, he deserved a fairer hearing.  </P> <P> As if the flap over Cronin weren't enough, the principal decided to place 110  other students on probation and put notices about their participation in the  demonstration in their disciplinary files. The school board has been scrambling  ever since to explain to angry parents that material in disciplinary files does  not go to colleges or employers, and that if there are no further incidents  this school year, the notices will be taken out of the files and students will  be taken off probation.  </P> <P> What's missing in this mess is any sense that school administrators appreciated  the concern the students were expressing about their education when they  protested. They were, after all, asking for homework! Students look to school  authorities for understanding and wisdom. In this case, all they got in  response was overbearing authority.  </P> <P> It would have made more sense if the students had been allowed a peaceful  assembly without consequences. After all, the school system's dispute is with  its teachers. Now, everybody is unhappy, and the environment for reaching a  contract settlement has been made even more difficult.  </P></p>

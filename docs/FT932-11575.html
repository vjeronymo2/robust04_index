			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / World health body spurns Yugoslavia THE annual meeting of the World Health Organisation yesterday voted overwhelmingly to bar the rump Yugoslavia from the work of the 185-nation UN agency, writes Frances Williams in Geneva. The resolution to oust Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, was passed by 125 votes to three, with 26 abstentions. Russia, Zimbabwe and Yugoslavia voted against the resolution. The move was sponsored by neighbours Albania, Croatia and Slovenia, west European countries, and Moslem nations such as Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Iran and Turkey. WHO officials stressed that the decision, which follows a similar vote in the UN General Assembly last year, did not affect the organisation's humanitarian programmes in Serbia, Montenegro and other former Yugoslav republics. It has about 50 staff in the rump Yugoslavia. Yesterday's resolution says the republic cannot automatically assume its WHO seat and must reapply for membership.</p>

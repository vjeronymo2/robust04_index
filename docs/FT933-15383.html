			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / China seeks cash for ploughshares IN BEATING its swords into ploughshares China's People's Liberation Army has turned to the outside world for assistance - making China the only military power seeking to have its 'peace dividend' underwritten by foreign investment. On show in Hong Kong this week is an exhibition - decked with banners proclaiming 'peace, development, co-operation' - of industrial hardware which the PLA's factories across China produce for civilian use. On hand for the exhibition - the first to be held outside China - are senior officials from the Chinese central government's Commission on Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defence (Costind), which oversees the mainland's massive armaments industry and reports directly to the PLA high command. One of the most important is Ms Nie Li, vice-director of Costind, wife of General Ding Henggao, Costind's director, and daughter of the late Marshall Nie Rongzhen, father of China's nuclear weapons industry. At Monday evening's gala opening she rubbed shoulders with some of Hong Kong's leading tycoons, including Mr Li Ka-shing, Mr Stanley Ho, Mr T T Tsui, and Mr Larry Yung, the son of Mr Rong Yiren, China's vice-president and head of Citic Pacific, one of Beijing's biggest companies in the colony. The presence in Hong Kong of the top executives from China's military-industrial complex selling their wares and trying to raise much-needed foreign capital reflects two developments which have occurred since 1978 when the mainland embarked on economic modernisation. The first is the encouragement PLA factories were given to switch their production from military hardware to civilian goods. This followed the cutting of the PLA's strength from about 4m to 2.5m. Nearly 70 per cent of the output of China's defence industries is classified as 'civilian' and the mainland wants to increase the share of civilian output further. The switch to civilian output has already made China's military factories dominant in some consumer industries. The six main defence industries - nuclear, astronautics, aeronautics, ordnance, electronics and shipbuilding - produce more than 60 per cent of China's output of motorcycles, washing machines and electric fans. By the end of the 1980s the civilian production of these six industries accounted for about 20 per cent of China's total machine industry output, by value. The second factor pushing the PLA's factories into the outside world is of more recent origin. In light of Chinese arms failures in the Gulf war, the PLA has had to diversify its sources of foreign revenue to compensate for its declining ability to sell arms abroad. Also, it has stepped up procurement of superior quality foreign-made military hardware, especially from Russia, spending an estimated Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) in the past couple of years. To fund these weapons acquisitions and further modernise the PLA's industrial base, the military needs money and foreign know-how. Although the PLA was one of the few arms of the Chinese government to receive a real, inflation-adjusted, rise in its budget this year (up 13.5 per cent to Dollars 7.3bn), its thirst for investment funds has remained unquenched. Already two of the PLA's directly-controlled companies have set up in Hong Kong. China Poly group, which is owned by the procurement department of the PLA general staff, has acquired a Hong Kong listed company, Continental Mariner. The other, China Xinxing corporation, which is owned by the PLA's general logistics department, established a representative office last October. The purpose of these companies, and many more mainland companies like them, is to raise foreign equity for investment on the mainland. Chinese law defines Hong Kong as 'foreign' for the purpose of direct investment; mainland companies get taxed at about half the national rate if foreigners invest in them. Companies controlled by Xinxing - which owns about 100 factories throughout China making garment, shoes, electronic products and military supplies - have this week signed contracts with foreign investors worth Dollars 1.25bn. The largest, a Yn4bn (Pounds 460m) property development in Beijing, is a joint venture with the Singapore government-controlled DBS Land, which will take 60 per cent of the project. Another of the exhibitors, China North Industries Corporation (Norinco), the largest seller of Chinese made weaponry on the world market, is seeking Dollars 2.2bn of foreign investment for 166 joint-venture projects on the mainland. These ranged from a Dollars 14m heavy-duty truck manufacturing venture in Sichuan, to Dollars 10m for a motorcycle parts factory in Henan, to a hotel development in Shanxi requiring investment of Dollars 7.6m - underlining the scope of the Chinese military's enterprises on the mainland. Separately, the China Association for the Peaceful Use of Military Industrial Technology was offering foreign investors the opportunity to participate in 45 joint ventures - many involving laser technology - which it hopes will raise Dollars 243.3m.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / People: Fitch Fitch, one of the world's largest design consultancies famous for its shop interiors, announced yesterday that its founder, Rodney Fitch, was resigning as chairman and director of the company. Martin Beck, group chief executive, who is based in the US, takes on the additional role of chairman, while Jean-Francois Bentz becomes managing director of the London office. The announcement ends months of speculation in the trade press about Fitch's departure from the company. It has been suggested that Fitch has had an uneasy relationship with the firm's French partners. The company - which has a December year-end, but has yet to announce its preliminary results - was rescued in 1992 by a refinancing. It announced interim pre-tax losses for the first half of the year of Pounds 381,000, down from Pounds 1.8m the previous year. It is believed that the company will soon announce the sale of its headquarters, which were expensively refurbished but have slumped in value.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (2): In the hands of the experts - Outsourcing / Advantages / Budgets are fixed in advance, and the supplier has to worry about any unforeseen expense The concept of outsourcing is not an invention of the computer age. Any company that hires external cleaners, or relies on a local caterer to supply board meetings with sandwiches is in the business of outsourcing. The established practice of contracting out necessary services and the complex world of managing IT systems collided with a vengeance when companies began to evaluate computing costs. By the late 1980s it was all too evident that IT projects were prone to run over budget and suck in extra staff. In the financial world some institutions found that a disturbing proportion of their workforce was employed in the IT function. This triggered political frictions and prompted a movement aimed at putting IT firmly back in its place, as a critical but subordinate function of the core business. Here lies the real attraction of outsourcing. Pick a supplier and hand over the entire responsibility for running IT within an organisation. Budgets are fixed in advance, and the supplier has to worry about any unforeseen expense. Recruiting specialist staff is left to the outside contractor, who may take over the customer's own IT department. The key to any outsourcing deal is the Service Level Contract (SLC). As long as the lawyers have done their job, the SLC should be watertight. A well-drafted SLC embraces the question of handing over the contract to another contractor or returning it to the customer. In practice, the business of outsourcing cannot afford disgruntled users. Any leading outsourcer will co-operate in handing over business to a rival with a smile, however forced. Some law firms have fastened on the world of outsourcing as a lucrative new field. Legal specialists in the outsourcing area are not common, but hiring a lawyer with the right experience is essential in order to get the most out of the contract. The IT sector loves jargon, so a variety of terms have been adopted to describe aspects of outsourcing. Systems Integration is a project-based approach, aimed at getting one defined system up and running. Facilities Management is a common term to cover outsourced computer operations, while Third Party Maintenance (TPM) can involve hiving off parts of the technology mandate to qualified contractors. Whatever the terminology, outsourcing is big business. When Computer Sciences Corporation clinched a comprehensive outsourcing deal with British Aerospace (BAe) last year, the contract was valued at Pounds 1bn over a 10-year period. CSC is taking 1,450 BAe employees under its corporate wing, and will develop and maintain critical computer resources right across BAe's civil and military business units. Computer maker Bull has won Pounds 35m worth of contracts since it set up Athesa, a separate outsourcing division, in January. All of these contracts allow the user to benefit from the supplier's accumulated experience. As the outsourcing supplier wins more business it acquires greater technical wisdom. It should not concern the user that his outsourcing company also works for a commercial rival. The point is that the daunting but vital function of IT is in the hands of the experts. And the computer budget has been tamed at last</p>

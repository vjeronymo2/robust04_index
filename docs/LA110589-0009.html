			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEVE GARVEY  </P> <P> There are several matters that I would have you and your readers know with  reference to the portrayal by Peter Boyer of me in what he styles "The War"  between me and my former husband, Steve Garvey.  </P> <P> First, I would certainly have preferred that no one's version of "The War" be  offered for such conspicuous public consumption.  </P> <P> Second, it is no less saddening than it is unsurprising that Steve would  attempt in the media as he has in the courtroom to shift responsibility for his  daughters' estrangement from him away from his own bizarre and hurtful behavior  and on to me.  </P> <P> Third, as people who know, work with and, yes, even love me would attest, I am  not "obsessed," suicidal or a wild woman. Rather, I live, work and raise  virtually alone two teen-age daughters in this area and look forward to the  time when my children and I will no longer be made objects of scrutiny,  criticism and even derision by mention of us in Steve's media adventures.  </P> <P> CYNTHIA GARVEY, Santa Monica  </P></p>

			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Letter: Merry month of November Sir, Why not choose November 11 as the alternative holiday to May Day? Our European colleagues would find our celebrating the anniversary of the end of hostilities an unlooked-for demonstration of community spirit. As the US also celebrates Veterans Day, there would be minimal disruption to financial markets on both sides of the Atlantic. Steven Spencer, chairman, Richmond Brokers, 27 Station Road, Egham, Surrey TW20 9NN</p>

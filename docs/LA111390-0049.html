			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STREET WISE  </P> <P> I am writing as a very concerned citizen and homeowner of Sherman Oaks in  regard to the appalling conditions on the south side of Ventura Boulevard,  between Woodman and Ventura Canyon avenues.  </P> <P> For the past several weeks, my 11-year-old daughter has been reading "50 Ways a  Child Can Help Save Our Planet."  </P> <P> As a result, she decided to walk to school instead of being driven. We began  this new ritual this morning and were overwhelmed by the atrocious conditions  we experienced on this stretch of the boulevard.  </P> <P> One of the attractions for me in moving to Sherman Oaks over 14 years ago was  the quaintness of the neighborhood. As a longtime resident of this area, I was  very sad to see the small shops that lined that street close. The last thing we  need is another strip center, mini-mall or office complex. But I remained  quiet.  </P> <P> However, after viewing the disgraceful conditions along this street this  morning, I cannot remain silent. The filth, soot, garbage and debris my  daughter and I witnessed is an outrage.  </P> <P> It is bad enough to have to view all of these once delightful shops closed down  and boarded up, but shouldn't the owner be compelled to clean up the trash  while he awaits his building permits?  </P> <P> What an example this is setting for our young people. My child made a personal  commitment to help clean up our air by walking to school the 1.5 miles. She  should not be exposed to this unnecessary and flagrant environmental abuse in  the process.  </P> <P> RHODA BARAZANI, Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

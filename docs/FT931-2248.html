			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: An oasis for serious sportsmen - The greened-over desert is waiting . . . for John Hopkins and his five-iron IT WAS nearly 5.30pm one day last month. As we walked up the 18th fairway the sun slid towards the horizon. The temperature was just over 70`F and a brisk wind was blowing in over the lake, slapping my face like a slightly damp warm flannel. I was thirsty and hungry and looking forward to a pot of tea in the clubhouse. Where was I? Florida? No. Spain or Portugal? No. I was concluding a round at the Emirates golf course in Dubai with Andrew Millar, the Scot who is the club's executive director. 'One big difference between playing golf here and in Spain and Portugal is that we have no housing on our course,' said Millar later as we drank our tea in the spike bar of the clubhouse. 'Down here you get 11 1/2 hours of playing time each day at an average temperature of 70`F-75`F. We get three days of rain each year. In fact, this is probably the sunniest golf club in the world.' He beamed as he said this, knowing it was a sweeping statement. Dubai may seem to be an exotic location for a golfing break but that has not stopped them from building two championship standard courses, or from planning a third, or from generally making a determined bid to be considered a serious venue for a golfing break - all this in four years. Oil is Dubai's main source of income at present but stocks will run out in 20 years and tourism, of which golf is animportant ingredient, is being developed as fast as possible. Dubai is a bustling, busy place. It has a population of just over 600,000, up from 420,000 seven years ago. Wherever you look new hotels are being built and existing ones being enlarged. Emirates Airline, which was founded less than a decade ago, now has nearly 20 flights a week from Britain to Dubai. On one such six-hour flight recently I thought about golf in the Gulf. I had read that the sand course at the Dubai Country Club was one of the oldest in the area and as the aircraft sped eastwards I wondered what it would be like to hit a long iron to an oil-based green, or, as they are called down there, a brown. Little did I know at that stage that much of Dubai was no more than 10 years old - younger than my golf clubs. I went first to the Dubai Creek course, which is about as upmarket a pay-as-you-play course as you could find. It cost Dollars 50m, much of which went on a lavish 50-metre high clubhouse shaped like the sails of a dhow. The Creek course, built on 180 acres of once-barren land, is five minutes' drive from the airport and no further from the centre of town. It was designed by Karl Litten, the well-known American, and opened in February. It is the second grass course in Dubai and thus a cousin of the Emirates course where the Desert Classic has been held these past three years. The Creek is a resort course, aimed at itinerant businessmen who want a game of golf and/or a course of lessons. The head professional is Peter Downie, a Scot, and he and his six-strong team of teaching professionals work most of the day and some of the night as well. Floodlit facilities include a nine-hole par-three course, three practice holes, (a par-three and two par-fours) and a driving range for up to 45 golfers. I played the front nine holes, had my swing videoed from behind, in front and above in Downie's indoor teaching school, and left the club at about 6.30pm. Dusk was gathering but that was no problem. The floodlights were turned on and the bays on the driving range would remain full for another three or four hours. It is hard to imagine better coaching and practice facilities anywhere in the world and it was easy to understand why Downie was anxious to try and attract teams out to the Creek course to practice. 'I want to make this a centre of excellence for teaching and practising,' he said. The next day I played the Emirates course with Millar. Of the two grass courses it is the tougher and, to my way of thinking, the more pleasing to the eye with its imaginative use of grasses and scrub. It has three or four outstanding holes. By the time Millar and I reached the 18th we had barely been out three hours. Golfers know their etiquette in the Gulf. In any case, marshals roam the course to winkle out slowcoaches. Not that Millar needed anyone to hurry him up. A Scot who was once an outstanding water-polo player and international swimmer, he is one of the fastest players I have ever come across. He was out of the cart, had his club in his hand and had hit the ball (no practice swing) and was back in the cart and bowling merrily down the fairway long before his ball had come to a halt - and sometimes before it had touched the ground. Before I left the Emirates club, Millar urged me to go and look at the Dubai Country Club. 'It is part of Dubai's golfing heritage,' he said. 'You must not leave without seeing it.' So the next morning I took a taxi out to the club, 15 minutes from the centre of town. A sign at the entrance said Darjeeling Cricket Club. The taxi paused briefly and then continued up to the low-slung buildings of the country club. The 14th Dubai Ladies Open was being played that day and competitors had come from Germany, Zimbabwe, Oman, India and Pakistan, as well as other countries. I stood by the putting green, shut my eyes and realised I could have been at Royal Mid-Surrey or The Berkshire on a summer's morning. Birds sang overhead. There was a regular clunk and click from the practice tee where competitors were loosening up. English voices were coming from all directions. 'Oh, I say,' exclaimed one. 'I just chipped in. Bet I can't do that in the competition.' Each competitor carried a  1/2 -inch thick, 12in-diameter patch of Astroturf, as if it was a prayer mat. This was to be used on the tees and from the fairways. A ball ending in the rough had to be played as it lay. Each brown, I noticed, consisted of a perfectly raked circular surface. Players were expected to rake the brown after holing out. The browns looked hard and it was difficult to get any backspin. I sought refuge from the heat in the office of Dave Greedy, a slim Welshman who is the manager of the country club. I wanted to talk about golf; he was anxious to know about the Welsh rugby team that had just unexpectedly beaten England. We compromised. He talked rugby and I talked golf until a taxi came to collect me and return me to my hotel. They do things properly down in Dubai. Golf is only the half of it. Safaris in four-wheel drive vehicles into the desert, hot air balloon rides, horse and camel racing, rugby, squash and tennis: all these are available. But golf was what I was most interested in. My four-day visit convinced me that Dubai's courses equal any in the world; all they need is better marketing. John Hopkins flew c/o Emirates Airline and stayed at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.</p>

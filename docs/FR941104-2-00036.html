In addition, we find AT&amp;T's arguments that the $4.85 per call surcharge is in violation of the ISP to be inapposite. AT&amp;T's arguments were based on the original $4.85 per call surcharge, not the amended $1.00 per call surcharge. Further, we note that AT&amp;T's petition stated that a $1.00 surcharge would be consistent with industry practices. Finally, we have not received any additional pleadings from AT&amp;T arguing that the amended operating agreements are in violation of our ISP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. We find that a grant of the above-captioned five applications will serve the public interest subject to the conditions set forth below. These applications are consistent with the Executive Branch's Policy Guidelines. The applicants state that they will initiate service within one year, and expect to initiate service shortly after all requisite regulatory approvals have been obtained. To the extent the applicants propose to use the INTELSAT, Intersputnick, and Columbia satellite facilities and appropriately authorized existing earth station facilities, we find these proposals satisfy the requirement that facilities already be in existence and be limited to equipment and services necessary to deliver a signal to Cuba.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 17. Accordingly, it is ordered that application File No. I&hyph;T&hyph;C&hyph;94&hyph;227 is granted and WilTel is authorized to:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a.

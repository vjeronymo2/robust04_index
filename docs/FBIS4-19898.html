			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 25 (A.A.) - UN special envoy for  Cyprus, Joe Clark arrived in Ankara on Sunday [24 April]  accompanied by his aides Gustave Feissel and John Paul Cavanaugh.    Clark said that the confidence-building measures package has  two points, one being the opening of the uninhabited Maras  [Varosha] section for Greek settlement under UN supervision, and  the other being the opening of the Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport  also under UN direction, and the partial lifting of the embargo  imposed on the Turkish side.    He said that the former will profit the Greek Cypriots while  the latter will be to the advantage of the Turkish Cypriots.    Clark said these are the last days of the process and that  he  has met with Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias in New  York and is due to meet with Turkish officials in Ankara on  Monday and Tuesday.    He added that he will later meet with leaders of both sides  and a draft report should at least be prepared before next  Sunday.    Clark said the package will benefit both sides and the  partial lifting of the embargo will strengthen the Turkish  Republic of Northern Cyprus' economy by 20 percent.    During their stay, Clark, Feissel, and Cavanaugh will meet  with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, Deputy Foreign Minister  Ozdem Sanberk, and Prime Minister Tansu Ciller but it is not  definitive as yet.    The envoys will leave Turkey early on Wednesday morning.</p>

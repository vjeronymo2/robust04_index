			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares close an erratic session sharply higher - Market Report The London market lived up to its recent reputation for volatility yesterday, moving through a range of nearly 70 Footsie points before closing sharply higher on the day as Wall Street belied the pundits by opening the new session with a show of strength. The FT-SE 100 Index gained a net 29.8 at 3,116.2, led above the 3,100 mark again by active buying of stock index futures. Equities made the running in the second half of the session, without waiting for a rally in British government bonds as US Federal securities also recovered ground. Interest rate nervousness was also soothed by the announcement that today's money market repo tender at the Bundesbank would revert to a variable rate, raising hopes that rates will be trimmed again in Germany this morning. Although impressed by the turnround in the stock market yesterday, strategists sounded wary of predicting the near term outlook. Dealers had marked share prices down sharply at the opening after London analysts hastened to line themselves up behind predictions that Wall Street's weakness over Easter spelled danger for European markets. Forecasts of a Footsie down to 2,800, and a Dow Average at 3,200, originally put forward by Mr Nicholas Knight of Nomura Research, suddenly became the order of the day at a number of leading securities houses. But the sellers of equities failed to oblige and by the second half of the session marketmakers were paying dearly for leaving their trading books short of stock over an extended holiday weekend which had left London exposed to developments in markets in the US and the Far East. Yesterday was the final trading day of the UK tax year and there were signs that institutions were buying ahead of expected demand from private client funds. Once again, the pressure came in derivatives markets, and trading volume in equities was slow to develop. However, improving sentiment across the range of equities lifted the FT-SE Mid 250 Index by 10.1 to 3,763. Buyers focused on the manufacturing sectors, leaving many consumer stocks relatively neglected. By the close, Seaq volume had risen to 755.1m shares, a good performance for a session immediately following a bank holiday in the UK. On Thursday, the previous trading day, Seaq volume of 725.6m shares was worth Pounds 1.36bn at retail level. Traders admitted to some bewilderment when share prices began to rise sharply, although both short sterling and near-dated government bonds appeared to be signalling doubts over the near term outlook for domestic interest rates. Some analysts interpreted yesterday's performance by equities as further evidence that investors are now focusing on the improved outlook for British companies as the economy recovers. The past month has seen significant increases in dividend payouts, which has put some stocks on dividend yields of nearly 5 per cent. These yields will enable equities to withstand the tightening of interest rates now expected by many analysts before the end of the year But against these more optimistic comments, there were still many expressing bearish views. These pointed out that Wall Street, too, had been oversold over the Easter break, and that the recovery in the Dow Average would have to be maintained for several sessions if it were to be convincing.</p>

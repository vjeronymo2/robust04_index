This is  what was particularly talked about by Gu Jinchi, secretary of  the provincial party committee, when he conducted investigation  and studies at Shenyang Railway Bureau and Shenyang Economic and  Technological Development Zone on 12 January.    That morning, after listening to briefings given by Liu  Zhijun, director of Shenyang Railway Bureau, and Ma Zengqing,  secretary of the party committee of Shenyang Railway Bureau, Gu  Jinchi extended congratulations and thanks, on behalf of the  provincial party committee and the provincial government, to  Shenyang Railway Bureau for its success in overcoming many  difficulties and overfulfilling various state-assigned  transportation targets last year. He said: The Shenyang Railway  Bureau has done a good job in coordinating with the localities  in carrying out their work, and has been involved in what the  people are concerned with and worried about, cooperated with the  local authorities in economic development, and made prominent  contributions. He said: The development of the socialist market  economy will bring new problems to the railway departments. For  example, enterprises will set their production quota according  to the market, and will make the transportation of cargoes more  irregular. This will disrupt the planned arrangements of the  railway departments, and urge railway departments to understand  and accurately find out the pulses of enterprises and markets on  their own initiative in order to meet the new changes in cargo  transport. He called on the local authorities to cooperate with  railway departments in public security, the improvement of work  style of railway departments, and safe transportation work on  their own initiative, and solve problems at any time.    During a forum with comrades of the Shenyang Development  Zone  in the afternoon, Gu Jinchi fully affirmed the work of the  development zone, and expressed the hope that Shenyang city will  study the kinds of technological transformation projects that  should be introduced by a number of large and medium-sized  enterprises with difficulties in Shenyang at present, the kinds  of achievements that can be made by colleges, universities and  scientific research institutes in the city, and which research  projects are suitable for building in the development zone in  line with its advantages of being a mother city near the  development zone with a strong supporting capacity and numerous  scientific and technical personnel. He suggested: After full  preparations, the development zone may use the three existing  types of foreign-funded enterprises as "match-makers," or ask  the commercial counselors of embassies of some countries to  serve as bridges, specially invite a number of foreign large  commercial corporations and big financial groups to Shenyang to  hold economic and technological talks, and make use of the  favorable opportunity that all countries are trying to develop  markets to bring in some big and high level items. He also  said: At present, Shenyang will no longer be under direct  provincial control in making economic and investment planning.  All departments in the province should actively support the  work of Shenyang city. The development zone should report on  its own initiative its excellent situation of speedy development  and the difficulties it has come across to the relevant  provincial departments and bureaus, and may invite leading  comrades of some departments and bureaus to participate in the  leadership work of the development zone.    Gu Jinchi also inspected the main control room and the main  communications station of Shenyang Railway Bureau, and Lifu  Garment company, Zhongguang electronics company, and Tianxing  computer equipment company, and three other types of  foreign-funded enterprises in the Shenyang Development Zone.    Wang Huaiyuan and Zhang Guoguang, deputy secretaries of the  provincial party committee; and Xu Wencai, member of the  standing committee of the provincial party committee and  secretary general, also accompanied Gu Jinchi during the  investigation and studies.</p>

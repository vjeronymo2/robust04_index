			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe during </F> celebration of the 50th Anniversary of Banco de Oriente in  Puebla on 22 April; from the "24 Hours" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] I would like to take advantage of this occasion to  make a few comments on the current economic situation. As we  have said, the painful and regrettable events that Mexico has  experienced in the first quarter of this year -- in addition to  its tragic human dimension -- have generated effects on the  nation's economy in general and on the financial markets in  particular.    The financial markets reflect these temporary or transitory  events however. It is important to acknowledge that these have  been adjusting in a disorderly [as heard] fashion. This orderly  adjustment, within a legal framework, demonstrates that our  markets are much more stable than in the past, much more mature  than in the past. It also demonstrates we have more solid  financial institutions than in the past, that we maintain an  unchanging economic policy that does not vary with passing  incidents, rather it maintains its course, steered by its  guidelines. We also have a much healthier and more stable  economy.    This transparent adjustment has occurred in an economy that  is completely different from the past. Currently we have an  economy that is much more open to outside markets, more  diversified, which, together with the financial sector, has  allowed us to absorb these events.    I would like to simply point out some of the important  changes that have taken place and that are reflected in the  consensus of the agreement that we recently ratified. The  government, within the agreement, must comply with its  commitments. For example, it must not have a fiscal deficit in  keeping with Congress' mandate and it must maintain a cautious  monetary policy. This can be achieved through the new Banco de  Mexico, which has autonomy at the constitutional level and has  as its main goal safeguarding the currency's purchasing power,  that is, to keep inflation low.    Obviously, when faced with this temporary uncertainty, the  markets, as I said, adjust to the circumstances. The temporary  interest rate increases are the appropriate reply.  Nevertheless, these rate increases are transitory and for the  short term. You may recall some events in the past, and not the  too distant past. You may recall for example, in March 1992 when  interest rates started to fall there was uncertainty, the  interest rates then started to climb, the exchange rate fell  more than planned. At that time, it was said this could turn  back the progress made. Nevertheless the course was maintained,  there was calm, positions and guidelines were maintained. As a  result, the interest rates went down again, the stock market  also started to recover.    Do you recall a more recent event in October 1993, which was  not long ago. Remember that at that time, there were external  events; now there are internal and external events, as I said  before. We had to adjust the markets at that time and you will  recall that in October the interests rates rose; there was an  adjustment in the stock market, however, and the course and the  guidelines were maintained. There was no fiscal deficit; there  was no more printing of currency, no more statements that  inflation does not count. On the contrary, the course was  maintained. In this way, as in all difficult times, such as  those we are now overcoming and those that we will certainly  have to overcome in the future, the guidelines, the course, the  spirit, and renewed motivation must be clearly maintained.    Let us recall some important changes that have taken place  in the past years. From an economy with sky-rocketing  inflation, that averaged over 80 percent and that at times  totalled 200 percent a few years ago, last year, our inflation  rate was down to 8 percent. From March to March [years not  specified] it was 7 percent, and from April to April, from May  to May, we will continue reducing it. From an economy that had  a public sector deficit of 17 percent of what we Mexicans  produced in 1982, and 11 percent in 1988, we now have an economy  that has no deficit or any surplus.    The government now only spends what it has, it does not  overspend to subsequently tax the individuals with inflation.  We do not spend more than we have. This is also a government  -- one must recall because at times we forget -- for which  barely 10 years ago 60 percent of its budget consisted of paying  interest; 20 percent was disbursed in transfers to companies  such as [name indistinct], and Metalmecanica, and so forth. The  other 20 percent that remained was earmarked for education,  health, and social security matters.    In our current budget, 56 percent is earmarked for  education,  health, potable water, sewers, ecology, and housing. We only  earmark 10 percent of the transfers to the payment of interest;  previously it was 60 percent of the budget. The rest is spent  on basic support programs for the countryside, support for  ecology, and so forth.    Let us take a look at these very important changes. From a  government that spent on things and paid interest, we now have a  government that spends on its people, on its community. Its  largest disbursements are for fundamental matters such as  education and health, to give the community better opportunities  for education and thereby better opportunities to access the job  market and for a decent life.    You can note the significant change from a totally protected  economy that was overregulated with trade barriers to an open  economy, with fewer regulations, and with a dynamic exporting  sector. This is an economy in which only a few years ago 90  percent of its exports was made up of petroleum. Last year, 87  percent of our exports were not petroleum, they were  nonpetroleum exports. This year, most certainly, given the  dynamics in nonpetroleum exports, more than 90 percent of the  exports will no longer be petroleum. This is an economy in  which, during the first two months of this year, the dollar  amount of nonpetroleum exports grew 28 percent. Nonpetroleum  exports are growing 28 percent annually. The figures are the  most dynamic in the Western Hemisphere. This is because the  companies have been transformed to participate successfully in  the international markets.    Undoubtedly, there is still a great deal to do, but we  should  not let any passing event make us doubt the strength we Mexicans  have to develop. It certainly is not time to change course. It  is time to advance unitedly, with courage, and with conviction  toward a future that will certainly be more prosperous and more  just. Let us not become discouraged for any reason. In the  past, we have overcome problems, we are currently doing this, we  will overcome them again in the future when they arise.    Mexico has a guideline, it has leadership, and a course.  Mexico has a first-class work force, it has businessmen who  have demonstrated their courage, their valor to risk their  capital. Today, we commemorate this at the Banco de Oriente, in  these times of reforms and changes, so we can have stronger  companies, better jobs, better projects that benefit Puebla,  Tlaxcala, the region, and Mexico. I congratulate all of you  bank shareholders, advisers, and employees. You are truly a  source of pride for the state, for the region, and it must also  be said that men and women such as you, who risk your capital  and who generate jobs, are a source of pride for Mexico. Thank  you very much.</p>

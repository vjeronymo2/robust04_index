			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Technology: Signed, sealed and delivered - British Entrepreneurs / An adventurous couple have capitalised on a simple idea ENCRYPTA Electronics needs to update its stationery again. The Welsh developer of 'electronic seals', devices used to ensure the security of goods in transit, has another award to add to a masthead that already lists several honours garnered over the past six years for innovation and business achievements. The latest accolade for this small family-run business comes from the British government's Department of Trade and Industry. The Welsh Development Agency (WDA) has also sponsored Encrypta, taking a 12.5 per cent equity stake in the company. Encrypta has been promoted by the WDA as a model for how the government agency can help to nurture high-technology start-up companies in economically depressed 'development areas'. In addition to venture funding and grants, the WDA lent credibility to the fledgling enterprise and 'opened doors' says Mark Hayward, who founded Encrypta with his wife Pippa eight years ago. Practical help was also available. Pippa Hayward recalls WDA officials helping her to locate premises for the company - although she ultimately turned down their suggestions of conventional commercial premises in favour of a Victorian mansion in rural Caerleon, near Newport, that now accommodates their business offices and a basement workshop as well as their family home. Despite WDA 'handholding' the Haywards have had to struggle with some serious setbacks over the years. The success of the fledgling enterprise, which now has an annual turnover of about Pounds 750,000 and profit margins of 10-12 per cent, is as much a tribute to their personal determination as to government sponsorship. Indeed, the first time the Haywards approached the WDA for financial support they were turned down. 'I had been involved in a frozen pizza company in the 1970s that went bust,' Mark Hayward explains, noting that American venture capitalists might have viewed his failed attempt at business development more positively. The WDA was more receptive, however, when the Haywards returned with orders for their first product from British retailers Marks &amp; Spencer, Mothercare and Iceland Frozen Foods. Encrypta's story began in 1984, when Mark Hayward, then a buyer for Marks &amp; Spencer, became aware of a problem that the company faced with pilferage of goods in transit. The numbered plastic and metal strips, or 'seals' used to prevent unauthorised access to the backs of lorries, were proving to be inadequate security devices. He turned to his father, a retired electrical and mechanical engineer who had worked on deciphering German codes during the Second World War, to come up with a high-tech alternative. The result was a simple, but seemingly effective, solution; a random number generator that is triggered every time the device is removed from the back of the lorry. After patenting the device, the Haywards initially attempted to license it to established seal manufacturers. When this failed they began to consider setting up their own company. Investing a few hundred pounds they participated in a trade show in London and were overwhelmed with the response they received from retailers. Presented with evidence that there was a market for their prototype product, they set about finding designers and manufacturing contractors. Still, leaving 'a good job with a nice salary and a company car' was a wrench for Mark Hayward. Almost immediately, disaster struck. The first production units of the electronic seal began to fail. While struggling to find the cause of the problem, Mark Hayward assured customers that Encrypta would replace the units. 'That was when we learned about testing,' says Pippa Hayward ruefully. It was at this point that the Haywards turned to the WDA for equity funding. With Pounds 100,000 in the bank they set about redesigning the product and replacing failed units. 'We didn't lose any customers,' Mark Hayward boasts. 'Customer relations are a key issue in our business,' Pippa Hayward interjects. 'We pride ourselves in keeping close to our customers.' Even so, Encrypta's credibility was sorely tested when only a few months later the redesigned products began to fail. 'It was depressing. We were getting failed units arriving here at the rate of 20-30 per week,' they recall. 'And this was after we had done all the testing.' The problem turned out to be battery failure, initially denied by Encrypta's supplier. After threatening to sue, Encrypta won an out-of-court settlement that paid for replacements. After eight years in business, Encrypta now has four products including a version of its Crypta electronic seal that stores data on the last 50 times that a vehicle's cargo hold has been opened. This can be downloaded on to a portable computer, providing fleet management information as well as a data trail that has been used to catch more than one thief. Some 40 per cent of Encrypta's sales are outside the UK, in the US, Europe and the Far East. To date, Encrypta has no competitors, although the Haywards suspect that other companies will enter the field as the potential scope of the market for electronic seals emerges. Although they are coy about details, the couple is currently in the final stages of testing a new product for applications outside the transport field. 'We are going to step on some toes and steal markets,' says Pippa. Uppermost in the Haywards' minds today, however, is the dilemma that faces many small businesses; whether to seek additional financing to expand their business. To do so would necessitate a move to larger premises and the end of their cozy 'work at home' arrangement. They would also be faced with management challenges and the need to take on more staff and are pondering whether to set up their own manufacturing operation, rather than sub-contracting production as they currently do. The Haywards' ambition is to build Encrypta into a Pounds 5m company with annual profits of around Pounds 1.5m over the next two or three years, but they face some resistance from board members, they acknowledge. 'The question is how do we take this forward,' says Mark Hayward. Turning again to the WDA for financial support, the Haywards have brought in business consultants to undertake a review of their operations and prospects. 'We are hoping something radical will come out of it,' says Mark Hayward. Although they are being careful not to 'direct' the consultants, they hope that the analysis will result in a plan for expansion. This may mean selling equity to venture capitalists, and might even involve the appointment of more seasoned management, or in the long term the sale of the company, the Haywards acknowledge. 'We are not in this just to build a nice little business,' says Mark Hayward. 'You cannot stand still.' Despite all of the efforts that the Haywards have put into Encrypta, this entrepreneurial couple claim that they would have few qualms about moving on. 'We are good at kindling fires. It may take somebody else to build it up.' If the Haywards were to start another business venture, would they again locate in Wales? They note that they have been able to find most of the services and sub- contractors needed by Encrypta in Wales and speak highly of the assistance of the WDA. Gazing out of the window of their dining room/ boardroom, watching their horses grazing in the meadow of the four and a half acre property that surrounds their home and offices it is difficult to imagine a more idyllic work setting. But there is one catch, the Haywards acknowledge - isolation. There are few entrepreneurs in the region with whom the Haywards can share their experiences or swap ideas. Regular trips to London help to 'keep your finger on the pulse' says Mark Hayward. 'And stop you going crazy,' Pippa echoes. The series will continue next week.</p>

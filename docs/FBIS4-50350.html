			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, 16 May (XINHUA) -- In addressing the  Congress on 16 May, U.S. Senate Republican leader Dole urged  President Clinton to immediately and unconditionally extend  most-favored nation [MFN] status to China.    Dole said: "We only have a few days before the President has  to decide. If possible, the President absolutely should  immediately announce that he will unconditionally extend MFN  status to China."    He added: The President "should frankly express what most of  us have known for a long time: It is infeasible to link trade  with human rights issues. That policy has already failed. The  President should admit this and continue to move forward."    He reiterated that he does not agree with the measure that  will disrupt [po huai 4275 0975] trade relations between the two  countries. He believes that it will only lead to unemployment  for many Americans and cause U.S. companies to lose the  opportunity to participate in the world's fastest-growing  economy.</p>

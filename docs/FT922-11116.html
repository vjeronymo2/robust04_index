			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Letter: Value of a tenant in US Sir, Concerning your editorial ('Tenants squeezed', April 6), your criticism of the continuing liability of tenants entering into leases following assignment overlooks an essential point. At least in the US, financing for real estate projects is based not on the value of the underlying real estate, however measured, but primarily, and sometimes entirely, on the creditworthiness of the tenant and the perception of the lease as a type of bond. If tenants were to be able to shed their liability by subsequent assignment, the lenders would not be receiving that for which they had bargained, and they would withdraw from high-credit net lease financing. At a minimum, any statutory scheme designed to release an original tenant's continuing contingent liability, notwithstanding the terms of the lease, should only take effect following the retirement of any financing predicted on the original tenant's credit. David B Simpson, Holtmann, Wise &amp; Shepard, 745 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10151, US</p>

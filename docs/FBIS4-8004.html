			<p>BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, today received General Michael Rose, the  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander for  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Haris Silajdzic, the prime minister of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and General Rasim Delic, the  Bosnia-Herzegovina army commander, were present at the talks.    The difficult situation in Gorazde, the town which has been  under a strong offensive by the Serb aggressor for over a week,  was discussed. Gen. Rose was asked to do everything within his  powers to bring an end to the offensive and to have the  aggressor's army return to its pre-31 March positions.    It is expected that Gen. Rose will again hold talks with  President Izetbegovic tomorrow after his talks with  representatives of the aggressor's side.</p>

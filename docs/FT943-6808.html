			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / International Company News: Nynex seeks waiver from 1984 order Nynex, the New York based 'Baby Bell' regional telephone company, has asked the US justice department for an exemption from the provisions of a 1984 court order that barred the regional operators from the long-distance telephone business. In its filing to the justice department, Nynex argued that the widespread competition among local telephone service providers in the New York region meant that the company had already met most of the tough standards federal policy makers are considering before they would allow the Baby Bells into the long distance business. Congress is deliberating bills to allow the Baby Bells into the long-distance business, but the passage of any legislation still appears to be a long way off. Nynex's action adds to the pressure for quick action to deregulate the long-distance market. The company's request for a waiver, however, is unlikely to speed up the process.</p>

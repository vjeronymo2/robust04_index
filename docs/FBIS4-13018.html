			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz with </F> unidentified correspondents at Lebanese Foreign Ministry in  Beirut on 14 April--recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] What measure will the Foreign  Ministry take if it transpires that the two diplomats from the  embassy assassinated Iraqi oppositionist Talib Suhayl?    [Buwayz] First, we should state what happened. On Tuesday  [word indistinct], when Talib Suhayl, holder of a Jordanian  passport but of Iraqi origin, was at home, two people entered  masquerading as clothes merchants, fired from guns fitted with  silencers, and escaped. The Internal Security Forces were  informed and set up checkpoints. Based on a description of the  cars [used by the attackers], the Internal Security Forces  arrested people intending to enter the Iraqi Embassy on  Wednesday morning. They were carrying guns equipped with  silencers, the guns that were used in the shooting. The two men  were identified as Khalid 'Alwan Khalaf, a trade attache in the  Iraqi Embassy, and Muhammad Kamil Kazim, a cultural attache in  the same embassy. It seems that Hadi Hasan, who has no official  status, gained entry to the Iraqi Embassy. These are the facts.    The Lebanese authorities have taken measures to guard these  people and to obtain the information necessary to conduct an  investigation into this criminal case. As for the political and  diplomatic aspects, the Foreign Ministry will soon request that  the Iraqi charge d'affaires in Lebanon lift the diplomatic  immunity of the two attaches and hand over Hadi Hasan to the  Lebanese judicial authorities to investigate him.    Lebanon cannot be exploited, under diplomatic cover or the  cover of diplomatic immunity, as a stage for settling scores and  carrying out crimes. Based on that, the Lebanese Government  insists on conducting investigations and uncovering every  circumstance of this crime.    [Correspondent] If Iraq does not respond, will Lebanon  break off relations with it?    [Buwayz] I believe it is premature to speculate on how  things  will develop. Today we will officially ask the Iraqi Embassy to  inform the Iraqi Government of the Lebanese Government's request  that the diplomatic immunity of the two be lifted and that the  third suspect be handed over.    [Correspondent] Did the Iraqi foreign minister try to  telephone you again today after failing to reach you yesterday?    [Buwayz] No direct contact has been held yet. The Iraqi  Embassy gave us a memorandum asking that the two people be  released on the basis of their immunity and international norms.  We are saying that they are under guard for their own security  first and in line with the requirements of public order second.  We think the interrogations dictate such handling.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] the Lebanese charge  d'affaires in Iraq?    [Buwayz] We recalled the Iraqi charge d'affaires at the  Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad yesterday morning. In the evening  he joined our embassy in Jordan and this morning he was at the  Foreign Ministry for contacts and consultations.    [Correspondent] Is this the first step toward closing the  Lebanese Embassy in Baghdad?    [Buwayz] I think it is useless to make predictions. All this  depends on the extent of the Iraqi Embassy's cooperation with  the Lebanese authorities.    [Correspondent] Was the atmosphere of the meeting with the  Iraqi charge d'affaires positive? [words indistinct]    [Buwayz] The Iraqi charge d'affaires said he had no  knowledge  of what happened. Today he was summoned by the Foreign  Ministry's secretary general, who will inform him of the  Lebanese Government's decision in this regard.    [Correspondent] [Question indistinct]    [Buwayz] No. The victim is an Iraqi national holding  Jordanian and Saudi passports.    [Correspondent] [Words indistinct] in Amman?    [Buwayz] No. We are not aware of this. Thank you.</p>

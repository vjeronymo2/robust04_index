			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Start-up boost for Scottish business Banks in Scotland are to offer small businesses medium-term loans with a rate of interest which will not rise by more than 1 per cent, under a scheme backed by Scottish Enterprise, the official development body. The scheme, launched yesterday by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, is unique in the UK and is said to be the only one of its kind in Europe. The small business loan scheme will make Pounds 100m available in the next two years on a pilot basis. The money will be advanced for up to seven years by any of the four Scottish clearing banks, with the interest rate being guaranteed by Scottish Enterprise. The scheme is one of several initiatives by the enterprise board under a strategy to remedy the low level of business formations in Scotland. Research showed that people were deterred from creating businesses or expanding existing ones by fears of volatile interest rates. Surveys found that many small businesses either did not borrow or financed their companies through overdrafts, which the banks could terminate at short notice. The new scheme, which involves the Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland, TSB Bank Scotland and the Clydesdale Bank, will be available only to new and growing companies employing fewer than 250 people in manufacturing, construction - excluding property development - and business services. The loans should be used for spending on capital equipment, expanding markets and developing new products or services. There will be a limit of Pounds 500,000 per transaction with Pounds 2.5m per business and a minimum level of Pounds 20,000. Scottish Enterprise will arrange insurance of the interest rate charged on the loans and expects the scheme to cost it about Pounds 5m. It had to overcome opposition from the Treasury. Companies will approach banks after being vetted by their local enterprise companies. Scottish Enterprise officials expect there will be demand for a similar scheme in England and Wales. Mr Bruce Pattullo, governor of the Bank of Scotland, who conceived the scheme with Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of Scottish Enterprise, said: 'The problem for the newly formed business is to survive the first economic cycle, when order books drop and interest rates rise.' The banks hope the scheme will lead to longer-term relationships. But the scheme's Pounds 100m is small compared with between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 4bn per year which Scottish banks lend to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

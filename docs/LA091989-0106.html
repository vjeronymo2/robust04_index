			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANUFACTURERS HANOVER DEAL OPENS U.S. BANKING TO DAI-ICHI KANGYO BANK  </P> <P> Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank on Monday disclosed that it would make the largest single  move by a Japanese financial institution into American banking by spending  $1.28 billion for a majority stake in Manufacturers Hanover Corp.'s CIT Group,  a business-lending unit.  </P> <P> In addition, Dai-Ichi Kangyo will spend $120 million for a 4.9% stake in the  New York bank itself.  </P> <P> Separately, Manufacturers Hanover said it will boost by $950 million its  reserves that cushion it against problem loans to developing countries,  primarily in Latin America. As a result, the bank said, it expects to post a  loss of $775 million in the third quarter and $475 million for the year.  </P> <P> For Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the world's largest bank, the purchase of 60% of CIT Group  and the small stake in Manufacturers Hanover represents its first major move  into the U.S. banking market. The Tokyo-based bank, which had $415 billion in  assets as of March 31, has been surprisingly slow to enter the U.S. market  while some of its Japanese competitors have done so aggressively.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bought From RCA  </P> <P> Other Japanese banks with a major presence include Mitsubishi Bank, which owns  Bank of California in San Francisco; Sanwa Bank and Sumitomo Bank, which have  major operations in California; Bank of Tokyo, which owns Union Bank in San  Francisco, and Mitsui Bank, which is forging close ties to Security Pacific  Corp. in Los Angeles. In a separate announcement Monday, Daiwa Bank of Japan  agreed to buy the U.S. commercial banking business of Lloyds Bank of Great  Britain for $200 million.  </P> <P> CIT, which Manufacturers Hanover bought from RCA in 1984 for $1.5 billion,  provides loans mostly to medium-sized businesses. It has assets of more than  $9.7 billion. Last week, Manufacturers Hanover confirmed that it was  negotiating to sell a stake in the operation to Dai-Ichi Kangyo.  </P> <P> The moves by Manufacturers Hanover are part of a broad, four-part plan  announced by the bank to strengthen its capital position and offset its Latin  American loans.  </P> <P> Overall, it plans to raise as much as $620 million through the sale of stock.  It plans to sell up to $500 million in new common stock to the public. In  addition, it is selling 2.7 million shares for $45 each to Dai-Ichi Kangyo. As  part of the stock sale, Dai-Ichi Kangyo agreed not to buy more Manufacturers  Hanover stock for 10 years.  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover Chairman John F. McGillicuddy said in a statement that  recent debt negotiations with Mexico and the U.S. government's plan for cutting  the Third World's $1.3-billion debt, called the Brady Plan after Treasury  Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, contributed to the decision to increase its  reserves. Those moves are expected to make it harder for banks to collect  outstanding loans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lagged in Past  </P> <P> Banks are facing increasing pressure to raise their reserves on their Latin  American debt. British banks recently raised their reserves to 50%. In  addition, some American bankers believe that regulators at the Federal Reserve  and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency may pressure banks to  increase reserves.  </P> <P> James J. McDermott Jr., an analyst in New York who follows Manufacturers  Hanover for Keefe, Bruyette &amp; Woods Inc., said the move by itself is  unlikely to trigger other banks to add to their reserves immediately because  Manufacturers Hanover in the past has lagged behind other major banks doing so.  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover is raising its reserves to $2.4 billion of its  $6.8-billion medium- and long-term loan portfolio to developing nations. That  means Manufacturers Hanover now has reserves totaling 36 cents for each dollar  that it has provided less developed countries, compared to 22 cents for each  dollar before. The vast majority of its foreign loans are to Mexico, Brazil,  Venezuela, Argentina and Chile.  </P> <P> Last week, Citicorp Chairman John S. Reed told securities analysts that he is  comfortable with Citicorp's level of reserves for its loans to developing  countries, although he left open the possibility that it may add to them soon.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Management to Remain  </P> <P> Bank of America, with reserves totaling about 37% on its medium- and long-term  debt of $7.4 billion to developing countries, declined to comment on whether  the move by Manufacturers Hanover would affect its reserves.  </P> <P> Both Manufacturers Hanover and Dai-Ichi Kangyo sought to emphasize that CIT  would continue to operate normally, despite the change in control. The  management will remain, with Albert R. Gamper Jr. as CIT's chief executive.  </P> <P> Despite its size, Dai-Ichi Kangyo could face problems making the CIT investment  work. Some bankers wondered whether it may have an experience similar to Fuji  Bank Ltd.'s 1984 purchase of Walter E. Heller &amp; Co., a Chicago finance firm  troubled with bad loans to small and medium-sized businesses.  </P> <P> COMPANIES AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Manufacturers Hanover  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.67IN:1.78IN:1.78IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="3" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Year ended Dec. 31  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1986  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sales  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (billions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $8.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $7.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $7.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Net income (loss)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (billions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.95  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> ($1.1)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $0.038  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Headquarters: New York  </P> <P> Assets: $71.9 billion  </P> <P> Employees: 22,786  </P> <P> Offices:: 400 worldwide  </P> <P> 52-week range: $26.25-$44.125  </P> <P> Monday close (NYSE): $41.75, up 87.5 cents  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dai-Ichi Kangyo  </P> <P> Assets: $415 billion  </P> <P> Deposits: $315 billion  </P> <P> Offices: 453 worldwide  </P> <P> Employees: 18,000  </P></p>

			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Campaign Diary: BCCI ghost returns to haunt islands The collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International is being blamed for the end of a long tradition of independent politics in the Western Isles. All 30 Independent members of the Western Isles Council are up for re-election on May 5, and, for the first time in living memory, Labour is putting up five candidates. Calum MacDonald, the islands' Labour MP, says the council needs firmer direction following the loss of Pounds 24m in the BCCI crash. But cynical local activists say BCCI is being used to help shore up MacDonald's shaky majority of 1,703 over the SNP. The dissidents say the party decided against fielding a full slate of candidates because of fears that its image would suffer if it had to deal with the aftermath of the BCCI fiasco. The hope is that five councillors will be enough to raise the party's profile between parliamentary elections, without risking too much fall-out from unpopular decisions. Labour-controlled Bristol City Council is being tackled hard by fans of Bristol Rovers, which has to play its Division 2 matches at Bath because of the lack of a stadium in the city. Aggrieved supporters have formed a Bristol party which is fielding 10 candidates, all in Labour-held wards. Its chairman Tony Locke, 53, says the party has picked up widespread support from people who want better leisure and transport. Jim Williams, a former Labour lord mayor of the city, has dropped plans to stand for the party, but Graham Robertson, the Labour council leader, is being challenged in his own ward. Labour, which has a majority of 12, dismisses the Bristol party as 'one of those irritants'.                            *      *      * Bill Cash, the Tory arch-Euro-sceptic, will be the main British participant in a motley gathering of anti-Maastricht campaigners in Paris today, called to campaign for a 'Europe of nation states'. Others at the plush George V hotel rally include businessman Sir James Goldsmith, Lord Rees Mogg, former editor of The Times, Charles de Gaulle, a conservative (small c) Euro MP who is the grandson of the late French president, and Manfred Brunner, head of the German anti-Maastricht party. Somewhat grandiosely, the participants have set themselves the task of 'breaking the monopoly of the Euro-federalists'. Shouldn't be hard to do, since the latter category seems to contain ever fewer people.                            *      *      * Most Conservative Euro candidates have a more pressing problem - how to get out the vote on June 9. One go-ahead candidate, aware that Tory workers are less than keen to support John Major on the doorsteps, has subcontracted his election campaign to cut out the voluntary middleman. Campaign literature is to be stuffed into envelopes by a direct-mail marketing company and delivered by contractors for the local free-sheet newspaper. Canvassing and 'knocking-up' on the big day is to be done from a telephone bank instead of on foot. The candidate has not gone completely high-tech, though. He says he will make at least one personal appearance during the campaign.                            *      *      * Robert Guy, chairman of the London gold fixing and the City's bullion market association, is campaigning for the Conservatives in a more traditional way for the Labour-held London West Euro seat. Guy, 50, a non-executive director of NM Rothschild, has deserted the plush parlours of the City to tour pensioners' clubs in his rambling constit-uency. He says voters are less Euro-sceptical than many imagine. 'Most people understand it would be economic suicide to consider leaving the European Union. But they are very jealous of their British rights and their national sense of identity.'                            *      *      * So bad is the Conservative party's position in the European elections that the possibility of a Canadian-style wipeout is becoming a campaign cliche. Don't expect to hear the Canadian parallel from the lips of politically aware Labour supporters, though. Canada's socialist New Democrats ended up with only eight seats, hardly better than the two won by the Progressive Conservatives. The winners were the Liberals, now in government, and regional parties like the Bloc Quebecois and the (western) Reform party. Step forward Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party . . .                            *      *      * The suggestion that the nation marks the 50th anniversary of D-day by frying Spam fritters may cost the Conservatives thousands of veterans' votes. But it has gone down quite well with George A. Hormel &amp; Co, which makes the chopped pork delicacy in Austin, Minnesota. Hormel's Alan Krejci, says Spam jokes (the most famous is the Monty Python 'Spam with everything' sketch) have helped make the stuff 'a modern food icon'. Hormel sells 110m cans a year in the US - 3.8 cans are eaten every second. 'We have lived with the wartime image for 50 years; it doesn't seem to be doing us any harm,' says Krejci. Maybe the PR whizz-kid who thought up the idea was on to something after all.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters request that the proposed compliance time of 12 months be extended to accomplish the proposed modification of the shock absorbers. One of these commenters requests that the compliance time be extended to 24 months. The other commenter requests that the compliance time be extended to 60 months, in light of the low probability of duplicating the combination of factors that may result in an accident. This commenter notes that, due to the unavailability of manpower and tooling, the proposed modification would result in a minimum of three days of downtime per airplane. Both commenters state that the manufacturer may be unable to provide an adequate number of MLG pistons to accomplish the modification within the proposed 12-month compliance time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs that the compliance time may be extended somewhat. The FAA acknowledges the low probability of duplicating all of the factors that may result in an accident. However, in the unlikely event that all of the factors should be duplicated, airplanes equipped with dual stage shock absorbers would be able to activate, at an earlier stage of the landing roll, all available braking devices, including the deployment of ground spoilers, application of wheel brakes, and deployment of thrust reversers. Proper activation of braking devices would permit the airplane to land within the distances specified in the FAA-approved AFM. In light of the potential for these airplanes to overrun the end of the runway due to delayed onset of braking, the FAA cannot concur with the one commenter's request to extend the compliance time to 60 months; the FAA considers that such an extension (five times the amount of time proposed) would adversely affect safety. However, it was not the FAA's intent to impose an undue economic burden on operators by requiring them to take airplanes out of service for an extended period of time due to the problem posed by a lack of available parts to accomplish the modification required by this AD. Although the airframe manufacturer has indicated that ample modification parts are currently available, the supplier of those parts has indicated that shipping to operators may take an extended period of time. In light of this, the FAA has determined that an extension of the compliance time to 18 months is appropriate; it will allow sufficient time for operators to obtain the parts necessary to accomplish the modification, while minimizing the economic burden on operators. The FAA finds that this extension of the compliance time will not adversely affect the safety of the fleet. Accordingly, paragraph (a) of the final rule has been revised to extend the compliance time to accomplish the modification of the shock absorber to 18 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 35 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 58 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $16,000 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $671,650, or $19,190 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

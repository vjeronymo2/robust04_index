			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Yuriy Kozlov]    [Text] Moscow, 17 Jun -- The nuclear problem on the Korean  Peninsula "contains a potential direct threat to the national  security and state interests of the Russian Federation," Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said at the State Duma today.    First, he noted, what is involved here are steps to violate  the nuclear weapons nonproliferation regime in a direct  proximity to our borders, on the Korean Peninsula, where the  situation is tense at times as it is. Therefore, the  possibility of a nuclear state appearing in a zone of tension  directly affects our security and interests. The second  circumstance, in his words, is the fact that, apart from the  DPRK, there is a "whole number of states that are on the  threshold of adopting similar decisions aimed at acquiring  nuclear weapons in one way or another."    "If one state," the minister continued, "is allowed to  embark  on this road and follow it through from start to finish, in  other words, if one begins by violating the monitoring regime,  then leaves the treaty and acquires nuclear weapons, there is no  way other states could be kept away from this." But the "most  unpleasant" thing, he stressed, is that the potential possessors  of nuclear weapons are in conflict zones, moreover, the  overwhelming majority of them are situated in a direct proximity  to the Russian or CIS borders. Therefore, Kozyrev said, "what  is important for us is not only the Korean issue but the  precedent itself, and we cannot allow it to happen."    The international community has various means at its  disposal  with which to convince the DPRK to refrain from further hasty  steps. First and foremost there are diplomatic contacts, which  are now being exploited to the full, including those between  Moscow and Pyongyang. The minister went on to recall Russia's  proposal to convene an international conference on security and  the nonnuclear status of the Korean Peninsula.    "One of the most extreme methods for exerting influence in  such cases is to impose international sanctions in accordance  with a decision by the Security Council," Andrey Kozyrev said.  "It is quite obvious that if the DPRK goes as far as wrecking  the nonproliferation regime and providing itself with nuclear  weapons, then the international community, we included, will  have no other option than to use the extreme method, that is, to  impose sanctions."    Nevertheless, we believe that their introduction should be  only gradual, the minister continued. "We should begin from the  milder sanctions of a warning nature," Andrey Kozyrev said.  "Considering the present circumstances, the Security Council  should work in two directions: Preparing an international  conference and, at the same time, defining the possible range of  sanctions that may be applied if the DPRK fails to reconsider  its policy."</p>

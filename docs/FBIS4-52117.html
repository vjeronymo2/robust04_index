			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA in  Malay on 6 April, page 7, reported that four Swedish defense  companies (Celsius Tech, Bofors, Ericsson Radar Systems, and  Kockums) are vying for the contract to build six patrol boats  for the Royal Malaysian Navy. Although the Malaysian navy is in  need of 27 patrol boats at an approximate total cost of $1.6  billion, only six are budgeted in the Seventh Malaysia Plan  (1996-2000).    Celsius Tech, trying to improve its chances of winning the  bid for its new 9LV Mk 3 command and surveillance radar systems,  has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Malaysia's  Sapura Holdings for the assembly and maintenance of the systems.  Bofors, known for its missiles, guns, and ammunition, is  offering to manufacture components and ammunition for the 40-mm  and 57-mm anti-aircraft guns with a local partner. Ericsson  Radar Systems has offered its Sea Giraffe 150 surveillance  radars, while Kockums, a leading warship construction company,  has signed an MOU with Malaysia's Hicom Corp. for designing and  building the boats.</p>

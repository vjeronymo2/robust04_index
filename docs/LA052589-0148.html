			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A TOKYO TALE: THE $2-MILLION BAMBOO-THICKET MYSTERY  </P> <P> The $2-million mystery of the bamboo forest, after playing through the Japanese  psyche like a dark subplot to Tokyo's continuing political scandal, finally has  been solved.  </P> <P> But as so often in Japan, the solution seemed only to deepen the mystery.  </P> <P> It began April 11, when a humble seller of yakitori (grilled chicken), rooting  through an urban bamboo thicket for some tasty shoots, stumbled across a wad of  rotting, abandoned yen.  </P> <P> Like any good Japanese, he took the money to the police.  </P> <P> Counting the crumbling bills with some difficulty, they calculated that the  39-year-old restaurateur had picked up the equivalent of $1 million.  </P> <P> The gorudo rashu came next -- a gold-rush fever that brought hundreds of  money-seekers swarming to the grove in Kawasaki, hoping lightning might strike  twice.  </P> <P> And five days later, a humble part-time laborer, 21, who was actually hunting  for wild cress, tripped across another $700,000 in yen.  </P> <P> The frenzy grew, as hundreds more searched for a "third installment." And the  mystery of who would abandon nearly $2 million without even burying it, and  then fail to claim the cash when it was found, seemed to obsess the nation,  even more than the news of the political scandal shaking the government.  </P> <P> Indeed, many observers saw a connection between easy money flowing through the  political world and the mysterious cash of the bamboo forest. It helped  headline writers, although not the embattled prime minister, that the first  character of Noboru Takeshita's name means "bamboo" -- and that he had received  about $2 million from Recruit Co., the conglomerate at the center of the  scandal that has forced him to announce his resignation.  </P> <P> But as Japan's press rushed forward with theory after theory -- each more lurid  than the last -- to explain the unclaimed cache, the dark side of politics was  but one rich lode. Mystery writers were interviewed, past murders rehashed,  fantastic scenarios constructed around drugs and gangsters, blackmail and tax  evasions.  </P> <P> In many ways, the speculation reflected modern Japanese anxieties -- fear that  unaccustomed prosperity is corrupting morals and dividing rich from poor, old  from young.  </P> <P> "The average Japanese cannot play the money game, and when these worlds  collide, as they did in the bamboo thicket, public interest is immense," the  newspaper Yomiuri said in an editorial. "It seems that recently the gap between  the average citizen and the ultrarich has vastly widened . . . that our  society's view toward money has become very distorted, and this causes great  frustration for many Japanese."  </P> <P> Many experts -- and nearly all Japanese depicted themselves as experts on the  subject -- said the money was somehow connected to soaring land or stock prices  that seem to be disrupting Japan's stable, middle-class society.  </P> <P> While the press speculated and philosophized, police methodically investigated.  Paper wrappers around the cash carried dates and the names of several credit  unions in the Kawasaki area, outside Tokyo.  </P> <P> Comparing the wrappers with bank records, police eventually focused on the  president of a mail-order business, Kasuyasu Noguchi, 46, who had made sizable  withdrawals two and three years ago.  </P> <P> Noguchi recently held a press conference and said, yes, the money belonged to  him. Bowing deeply, he apologized to the people of the world for the trouble he  had caused.  </P> <P> But Noguchi's explanation, as provided to reporters and more fully to police,  was "beyond comprehension," Yomiuri said.  </P> <P> Noguchi said he actually had earned the cash in the early 1970s, speculating in  stamps and other things. A thief had been stalking his office, he told police,  so for years he carried the money in the trunk of his car.  </P> <P> When Japan began printing a new type of cash, Noguchi exchanged the money for  new bills -- thus the wrappers indicating withdrawals two and three years ago.  </P> <P> But, he said, his desire for the money lessened as friends were murdered or  committed suicide in business-related matters.  </P> <P> "My view of life changed," Noguchi told police.  </P> <P> He resolved to give the money away, he said, but -- acknowledging that he had  failed to pay taxes on the income -- he feared a tax audit if he donated the  money in his own name. So, he said, in October, 1987, he left $2 million in the  bamboo grove, hoping someone worthy would find it.  </P> <P> He was "relieved" when someone recovered the money, he said. If he gets it  back, he said he will donate it for research into children's diseases.  </P> <P> Police said they found the explanation puzzling but that they saw no basis for  further criminal investigation. Tax authorities said they would investigate,  but income earned so long ago would be beyond their reach.  </P> <P> Seiei Sato, the grilled-chicken seller who found the first chunk of cash, said  he, too, remained mystified by Noguchi's account, but might be willing to  settle for a 20% finder's fee and go back to serving yakitori. "It's  troublesome," he said. "My head is already in a chaotic condition."  </P> <P> The elderly owner of the bamboo grove said he did not care about the money but  he was unhappy that people were taking his bamboo shoots.  </P></p>

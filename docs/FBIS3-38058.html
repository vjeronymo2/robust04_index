Yuriy  Kobaladze, head of the press bureau of the Foreign Intelligence  Service, said in an interview with a CRIME-PRESS correspondent.  After all, if one is to believe the FBI, the country the Ames  started spying for was the old Soviet Union, and the  surveillance over them began 10 months ago.    Moreover, for the first time in the history of relations  between our countries, Aleksandr Lysenko was, as it were, an  official resident of the Russian intelligence in the United  States. He was introduced to the director of the CIA and to the  U.S. Administration in this capacity and was involved in  "cooperation" between the two special services in tackling  issues of global significance which override the rivalry between  the two intelligence services, such as the fight against  international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass  destruction, and other issues.    Now, as a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry has  announced, Russia is forced to take countermeasures and hence  expel a CIA employee.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> The divergence between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the broad U.S.  stock market seems to be narrowing, said Irving Katz, director of research at  Thomas Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> Many stocks have moved up in tandem with the Dow index, which has risen six  consecutive days and is only off 3% from its all-time high, reached Jan. 2 of  this year.  </P> <P> HomeFed gained $1.625 for the week. At its annual meeting last week, chief  executive Robert Adelizzi pointed out that HomeFed finished the most turbulent  decade in the history of the savings-and-loan industry with its most profitable  year ever in 1989 and its best first quarter ever for the period ended March  31.  </P> <P> HomeFed stock is selling at a little over five times earnings, at a 35%  discount to tangible book value, and "remains a buy in my eyes," Katz said.  </P> <P> Warren Buffet's increase in his investment in PS Group to 11% of the shares  outstanding made the stock the largest point mover of the week, gaining $3 to  $37. Most of PS Group's shares are held by value-oriented investment managers  who invest for the long term.  </P> <P> Other solid gains were posted this past week by Rohr Industries, up $2; San  Diego Gas &amp; Electric, up $1.50; BSD Bancorp, up $1.25, and Cubic Corp., up  $2.25.  </P> <P> Great American Bank continued its descent, giving up another $.50 to $2.75 as  the proxy statement and 13-D filings showed that Ed Wedbush, the S&amp;Ls  largest shareholder, sold about 800,000 shares during the last month. The  question remains whether the sale was because of a loss of faith by Wedbush or  a forced liquidation related to margin calls.  </P> <P> Triton Group Ltd. continued to drop and fell $1.125, to a new low of $7.875.  Its proposed merger with Intermark would entitle owners of one Triton share to  1.4 shares of Intermark, which closed Monday at $7.625.  </P> <P> Also on the downside, Magma Power dropped $1.50 and Price Co. dropped $1.25.  Price fell to a new low of $32.50, at which point it is selling at 11 times  next year's consensus earnings forecast of $2.93 a share.  </P> <P> Advanced Marketing Services hit a new low of $4 when it announced that it would  have a loss of 15 cents a share for its fourth fiscal quarter, resulting in  earnings for the fiscal year ending March 31 of 30 cents a share.  </P></p>

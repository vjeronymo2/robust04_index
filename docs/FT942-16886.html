			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Survey of International Hotels (11): Sentiment in Warsaw - The hotel market in eastern Europe is struggling to catch up with demand The quality of Warsaw hotels is uneven at best, but the city presents the sentimental traveller with an unrivalled opportunity to relive most post-war eras, as the Polish capital slipped from Stalinism in the 1950s to the political and cultural thaw of later years, and on to the entrepreneurial free market present day. Few remember, for example, that the fin de siecle Polonia near the main railway station, now catering to the rougher end of the market, was once - in 1945 - home to the entire diplomatic corps in a rubble-strewn city still waiting to be rebuilt. That reconstruction resulted in the stern Stalinist interiors of the Warszawa hotel - ideal for those wanting to indulge in Le Carre spy fantasies - and the down-at-heel Grand, originally built in the 1950s, for bureaucrats coming into Warsaw ministries to arrange for allocations of ever-scarce resources. The Grand remains a handy place to await tardy decisions from the privatisation ministry next door - recognised as such by SG Warburg, a faithful government adviser which appears to have rooms there, as offices, for the duration. Next comes the 19th century Europejski with its faithful clientele and low prices which help to make up for the lack of refurbishing needed to enhance its potential as a provider of old world charm. Across the road stands the Bristol Hotel, once as shabby as its neighbour, but it has been relentlessly restored by Forte. Now it holds pride of place as the classiest and most expensive of the city's hotels. Long gone, though, are the days when the bars in both these hotels were home to the rebellious intelligentsia and the communist party liberals, as well as to the foreign press reporting the 1956 liberalisation, when Poland was the 'merriest barracks in the Soviet camp'. The foreign loan-financed investment boom of the 1970s saw the building of the Forum Hotel at the busiest intersection in Warsaw: an upright shoe box design, devoid of charm. It seems invariably to host package tours of elderly Polish Americans and young Israelis all intent on seeking their roots. The Victoria Inter-Continental, convenient for the finance ministry and within view of Warsaw's chunky opera building, was also built at that time and still attracts a steady stream of bankers and businessmen. Marriott came to the city five years ago. This will be forever linked to the early days of Poland's free market reforms, when it catered to western businessmen eager to take advantage of opportunities then opening up, and the publicly funded advisers - ironically called the Marriott brigades - who then streamed into the country. At the same time, a few hundred yards away, the Holiday Inn, finished in 1988 just a few months before the Marriott, housed (as it still tends to do) the local businessman taking advantage of similar opportunities. Later additions to the hotel scene lack lustre. The Sobieski, sited on the way in from the airport, has a colourful exterior but suffers from a lack of air conditioning in the summer. And the Mercure, a French Accor group project, has yet to acquire a character.</p>

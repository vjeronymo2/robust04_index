			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Regarding the AVS, the Committee joins the House in commending OSM for improvements made to the system. The Committee has consistently supported development and implementation of the AVS because the AVS is essential to effective enforcement of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 [SMCRA]. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Report of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senate Report No. 103&hyph;114, at page 47 (July 28, 1993). Accordingly, OSM has determined to go forward with the final rules published today without regard to the course of litigation between OSM and SOCM or any other person. OSM has reviewed the proposed rules in light of the comments that have been made with a view towards serving the agency's commitment to protecting the environment, to implementing SMCRA, and ultimately, to serving the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These final rules incorporate the AVS into the Federal regulations and mandate the use of the system by State and Federal surface mining regulatory authorities. At the same time that these rules strengthen the enforcement of Section 510(c), they also establish a detailed set of procedural pathways to assure the protection of due process for the regulated community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Participation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated above, OSM published proposed rules on September 6, 1991. The proposed regulations were available for public comment until November 20, 1991. Comments were received from members of the regulated community, representatives of environmental advocacy groups, representatives of State regulatory authorities, and various citizens. While a total of 20 commenters submitted written comments, most comments can be grouped into three major categories which are captioned below. After the discussion of these three major issues, this preamble will then provide a section-by-section discussion of the final rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II.

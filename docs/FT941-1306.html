			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Further expansion in US for Williams Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday announced its second US acquisition in three months with the Dollars 50m (Pounds 34m) purchase of Forney International, a provider of burner management systems for power stations. Williams is paying Dollars 41m in cash for Texas-based Forney, and is taking on debt of Dollars 9m. Forney's net assets after completion are estimated at Dollars 12m. Mr Nigel Rudd, Williams chairman, said the acquisition would reinforce the group's presence in the rapidly-growing third world market. 'It is a real growth business,' Mr Rudd said. The acquisition was expected to be neither earnings dilutive, nor to be significantly enhancing in the current year. Analysts said the purchase was slightly pricey, but made strategic sense. It follows hard on the heels of the acquisition of the Corbin &amp; Russwin locks business in January for Dollars 80m. There was substantial scope to increase margins, analysts said, which would bring substantial returns in 1995. However, 'the problem is that it is doing damage to the balance sheet,' said Mr Richard Rae, conglomerates analyst at Hoare Govett. The broker estimates that after the goodwill write-off, Williams' gearing will rise from 60 per cent to more than 70. The group is forecast to generate cash of Pounds 35m this year, which leaves year-end forecasts for gearing about 12 points higher than previously at 56 per cent.</p>

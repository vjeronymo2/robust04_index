			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] has dismissed a  newspaper report that the organization has come under fire from  Zimbabwe for its violent acts in South Africa. THE HERALD is  the African country's biggest daily newspaper and often reflects  the thinking of President Robert Mugabe's government. An  editorial in the paper warns that other African states may  follow Tanzania's lead. Tanzania this week barred the PAC from  using its Dar es Salaam headquarters as a launching pad for  violent attacks against South Africa. PAC official Gora Ebrahim  says the report is part of a continuing campaign to discredit  the organization.    [Begin Ebrahim recording] This is totally unfounded. The  relationship between the government and the Pan-Africanist  Congress, the government and ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African National  Union -- Patriotic Front] remain as solid as ever. We have  received no written letter or indication whatsoever. In fact,  recently our deputy president led a delegation to the Frontline  States meeting where the position of the PAC on various issues  was clearly put before the chairman of the Frontline States, who  is His Excellency President Robert Mugabe. [end recording]    Ebrahim also says that the PAC is not surprised that the  South African Police [SAP] is refusing to conduct a joint  investigation into the Gugulethu shooting. A 13-year-old boy  was shot dead when police raided a PAC meeting in the Cape  township last week. The PAC had called for a joint inquiry but  the SAP says no legal provision exists for it to conduct a joint  investigation. Ebrahim says police are scared of being exposed.    [Begin Ebrahim recording] On each occasion that the PAC has  been asking for a thorough investigation into these attempts,  none of these have been taken up by the regime. It means that  it is guilty of the crime and it is refusing to be accountable  for it. [end recording]    That's PAC official Gora Ebrahim. Cape Town police,  meanwhile, have suspended the officer who allegedly shot the  teenage boy, pending an investigation. The inquiry is being  headed by Colonel Johan Kleyn.</p>

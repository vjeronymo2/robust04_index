			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Guard has adopted additional security  measures along the confrontation line because of the continuing  state of alert by the Turkish occupation troops and the  pseudostate's forces. The National Guard has also made  representations to the United Nations.    The aim of the Turks is to create a climate of tension  following the deadlock in the proximity talks because of Rauf  Denktas' intransigence. According to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation] information from military sources, the Turks have  taken special measures of readiness in the Nicosia area and at  points that they consider of vital importance, such as arms and  ammunition warehouses and radar installations. The military  personnel at guardposts along the confrontation line have been  doubled. Senior officers of the occupation army carry out  continuous patrols along the entire length of the Attila  [Turkish troops] line.    Within the framework of measures adopted by the National  Guard, strict orders have been given to the national guardsmen  along the confrontation line to be particularly careful.</p>

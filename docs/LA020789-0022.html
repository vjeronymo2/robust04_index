			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TEATRO DE DANZA ESPANOLA AT PASADENA CIVIC  </P> <P> Flamenco is not synonymous with Spanish dance, but it is a key element. It has  also successfully supported imaginative transformations to the dramatic stage  almost since its beginning.  </P> <P> None of this was made very apparent Sunday afternoon at the Pasadena Civic  Auditorium by the Teatro de Danza Espanola, a young-looking -- and -dancing --  troupe making its first U.S. tour. The company boasts a flamenco cadre that  would do many a Seville or Madrid tablao proud, but it did not provide a basis  for any coherent choreography or dramatic extension.  </P> <P> Company director Luisillo's "La Trilla" provided a pseudo-folkloric pageant as  a setting for big solo efforts from Juan Fernandez and Maria Vivo. Despite the  scenery and profusion of agricultural props, this scene of workers in an  Andalusian field -- the women, of course, in heels and their best ruffled  skirts -- was hardly plausible as either a social or dramatic context.  </P> <P> The individual dancing, however, proved eminently credible. Fernandez, despite  a superficial resemblance to John Travolta and despite his adoption of some  disco poses, moved with supple authority and maintained a crisp, cool fury in  his intricately patterned heel work.  </P> <P> Vivo emphasized exaggerated sensuality through sinuous, seemingly boneless arms  and bump-and-grind torso work. Her solo developed increasingly abandoned  variations, with the rhythm of her heel work buried by the accompanying  hand-clapping.  </P> <P> Elaborate palmoteo, indeed, was the central element of the accompaniment, led  by singers Toni Maya and Cancanilla de Marbella, who also contributed clowning  dance parodies. This was raucous, spirited, punk flamenco nuevo, greeted with  cheers from the audience and continued in the exuberant encores.  </P> <P> The first half of the program was devoted to Luisillo's "Carmen," set to the  music of Bizet -- taped, of course -- as reordered and recomposed by Rodion  Shchedrin for his wife, Maya Plisetskaya, in 1968. The poverty of imagination  and lack of self-confidence and identity apparent in choosing a Soviet  arrangement of a French operatic view of Spanish life was reflected in the  cluttered choreography, which made no effort to establish character or  motivation and covered important solo entrances and duets with chorus line  kitsch.  </P> <P> Rocio Acosta brought a measure of paradoxically flamboyant dignity to the title  role, dancing with technical assurance in the tawdry surroundings. Though  billed as a principal ballet dancer, her part called more for modern dance  movement and flamenco poses, plus a loud cry and gasps to initiate her extended  death throes.  </P> <P> Her partner as Don Jose was not the similarly billed Miguel Valeran, but  Florencio Campo. He provided little more than an heroically out-thrust chest  for characterization. In a sad reflection on his ease in the role and the  confused choreography, it was impossible to tell whether he was supposed to  collapse under Carmen at the end, or simply overbalanced attempting to carry  her away.  </P> <P> Vigorous dancing of varying skill in the supporting roles and ensembles did not  redeem the effort.  </P></p>

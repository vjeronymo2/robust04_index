			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Matti Perttila, Ph.D., head of the Marine </F> Research Institute Chemistry Department; Lauri Niemisto, special  investigatgor of the Marine Research Institute Chemistry  Department, and Professor Ake Niemi, head of the Tvarminne  zoological research station: "Saltwater Flow Petered Out  Prematurely; New Discharge of Oxygenated North Sea Saltwater  Would Work Wonders for Baltic"]    [Text] A year ago the Baltic received a sudden flow of  saltwater. The general interest in environmental affairs led to  a great deal of publicity about the event in all of the  countries bordering on the Baltic. In Finland too there was talk  of the "mother of all saltwater discharges" and an abundance of  stormy years was predicted.    There had, as we know, been saltwater discharges before then  too, but only a very few researchers knew about their flow and  its consequences: It was only in January 1993 that the first  discharge of the information generation entered the Baltic.    This whole natural spectacle is incredibly complex. This is  why a saltwater flow does not just like that lead to big  harvests of storms, as was the case after some of the earlier  ones.    Five hundred cubic kilometers of freshwater annually enters  the Baltic catchment area. If salty ocean water from the North  Sea did not occasionally get into the Baltic, the latter's salt  content would gradually diminish.    Saltwater flows enter it through the Danish straits across a  low threshold. Since, because of this, it is North Sea surface  water, it is abundantly supplied with oxygen. But since it  contains more salt than the water of the Baltic, it is heavier  and sinks to the depths of the Baltic.  <H5>  Flows Come at Long Intervals </H5>   However, water only flows from the North Sea into the Baltic  under certain conditions. The prerequisites for this are that  there be an east wind over the straits and that the surface of  the Baltic be lower than that of the North Sea.    Flows into and out of the Baltic usually last only a few  days  and the effect of the flows does not extend over a very long  period.    In some years -- usually in winter -- however, a continuous,  incoming flow is produced that lasts for even weeks on end. Then  the water coming from the North Sea gets so far into the Baltic  that it does not get back into the direction of flow into the  North Sea after turning [at the east end of the Baltic].    Such big water flows occur only a few times in a century,  but  their effects are felt for a long time. The last big discharge  was in the winter of 1975-76. Since then, the salt content of  the Baltic has been constantly diminishing and that is also why  the density of the water has been reduced -- the water has  "gotten lighter." Because of this, a big ocean water discharge  is increasingly more likely.    Oxygen is needed to decompose the plankton. Since the layer  of water adjacent to the bottom is not renewed, its oxygen is  depleted. However, oxygen is not the only substance that  bacteria use to be able to decompose the plankton. The most  important of the others is saltwater sulphate, which is  transformed into hydrogen sulfide during this decomposition  process.    Hydrogen sulfide kills nearly every living thing on the sea  floor. Before the arrival of the saltwater flow, the hydrogen  sulfide layer extended from the floor of the central basin of  the Baltic, that is, from a depth of 250 meters, to a depth of  as little as about 130 meters.  <H5>  Hydrogen Sulfide Uses Up Oxygen </H5>   Last February the water surged into the Baltic for about  three weeks. Danish and Swedish measuring stations estimated  that the volume of the incoming flow was about 310 cubic  kilometers. This was one of the "big" discharges of our century.    They knew that large amounts of hydrogen sulfide and  nutrients had accumulated on the floor of the Baltic. They  feared that this old water would be set in motion and rise to  the surface in the southern part of the Archipelago Sea and the  Gulf of Finland, where it would result in a sharp increase in  algae production. Nevertheless, this did not happen that time.  What happened?    From the standpoint of the heavy incoming mass of water, the  Baltic develops into a series of basins. After the threshold  formed by the Danish straits, the water flows into the Arkona  area, which forms a shallow, flat basin.    The mixing of the water was so turbulent in the Arkona that  it reduced this mother of all discharges to about a third of its  original size.    Some of the water continued on its way into the  100-meter-deep Bornholm Basin, which has a volume of 50 cubic  kilometers.    From the Bornholm the saltwater flow went on to the central  basin of the Baltic, the Gotland Basin. The flow moves slowly:  It took from four to six months to cover this 600-km distance.    So, no more than about 100 cubic km of relatively salty and  oxygen-rich water was reaching the central basin of the Baltic  in the early summer of 1993. In it there was sea water  discharged originally from the North Sea into the Baltic and old  Baltic water from the depths of the Arkona and Bornholm basins.    There were 10-12 g/m[.sup]3[/] of oxygen in the North Sea  surface water, but no more than a third of that oxygen, about 4  g/m[.sup]3[/], in the water that was entering the central  basin. So, 100 cubic kilometers of water brought 400,000 tons of  fresh oxygen into the deep water of the central basin of the  Baltic.    However, a whole basinful, about 250 cubic kilometers, of  old  water containing hydrogen sulfide was waiting for the new water.  There had been time enough for about 5 g/m[.sup]3[/] on  average, or all told over a million tons, of hydrogen sulfide to  form.    It takes roughly 2 tons of oxygen to convert 1 ton of  hydrogen sulfide into a harmless form. So, even though an  abundance of oxygen rolled into the central basin, it could only  handle a small portion of the hydrogen sulfide that was in the  basin.  <H5>  Thresholds Protect Gulf of Bothnia </H5>   This is why they think that, if a new mass of relatively  unmixed water rapidly pushes its way into the central basin, it  may shove the light water in it, which contains a lot of  hydrogen sulfide, toward the Archipelago Sea and the Gulf of  Finland.    The Gulf of Bothnia is protected because the underwater  thresholds formed by the continuations of the Salpausselka and  the shallows on the south side of the Aland Sea keep the water  near the northern [arm of the Baltic] from advancing.    Nevertheless, the pressure of the saltwater that entered the  Baltic in January 1993 was great enough to push the old water  from the central basin to the floor of the Gulf of Finland. This  caused a slight drop in sedimentation and oxygen content on the  bottom.    As a result, there will obviously be a shortage of oxygen in  the deep waters of the Gulf of Finland over the next few years  and bottom-dwelling fauna will suffer because of it. As it rises  to the surface, this water containing phosphates will probably  somewhat increase the growth of plankton, especially offshore of  Hanko and on the eastern side of Suursaari.    The production of algae will not, however, accelerate out of  the ordinary. The future of the Gulf of Finland will continue to  depend on whether we get the abundant nutrient discharges at the  eastern end of the Baltic under control.  <H5>  Flows Come in Successive Years </H5>   The flow that occurred in January 1993 was already so mixed  at the start of its journey that the increase in salinity -- and  hence density -- it caused was not very significant. The water  of the Baltic deeps is still "light" and the situation is still  favorable for a new flow.    Actually, the situation is an exciting one: The way has been  cleared for a new flow and there has not been time for the  hydrogen sulfide to form to any extent. The bulk of a new flow  will no longer be expended on disposing of the hydrogen sulfide,  but it will be enough to renew the bottom-dwelling animal  population.    North Sea flows very often come in series, in successive  years. The disturbance in the rhythm of the water exchange that  has been going on for nearly two decades also illustrates how  delicate the oxygen balance in the Baltic is.    If there is a continuation of the 1993 flow in the near  future, we may hope that, after this disturbance in its rhythm  that has lasted for nearly 20 years now, the water exchange in  the Baltic will return to its normal beat.  <H5>  Last Winter's Saltwater Flow Got as Far as Gotland Basin </H5>   The Baltic needs the saltwater that comes from the North Sea  through the Danish straits. However, this saltwater flow is only  rarely strong enough for it to affect the entire Baltic.    Last winter the incoming flow lasted three weeks. The last  big discharge prior to that was in the winter of 1975-76. The  oxygen of the bottom water layers was exhausted because of the  long interval between flows. When the oxygen was lacking,  bacteria produced hydrogen sulfide, which kills nearly every  form of life, near the sea floor. A year ago there was a layer  of hydrogen sulfide in the central basin of the Baltic that  extended to a depth of about 130 meters from the bottom.    Last January 310 cubic km of oxygen-rich, North Sea surface  water entered the Baltic. Since it was salty, it was heavier  than the water of the Baltic, which is why it advanced along the  bottom.    The water flowed from the Danish straits into the shallow,  flat Arkona Basin. Some of the water drifted back into the  Kattegat area and some of it continued on its way into the  Bornholm Basin, which has a volume of 50 cubic km. Once that  basin was filled, the excess water went on to the Gotland Basin,  which received 100 cubic km of fairly salty, oxygenated water.  This 100 cubic km of water carried with it 400,000 tons of new  oxygen. Lying in wait for it, however, were 250 cubic km of old  water containing a million tons of hydrogen sulfide. There was  not enough oxygen to dispose of all of the hydrogen sulfide.    The pressure of the saltwater pushed the old water of the  Gotland Basin into the Gulf of Finland. The oxygen content on  the bottom of the latter dropped.    Over the next few years there will probably be a shortage of  oxygen in the deep waters of the Gulf of Finland and  bottom-dwelling fauna will suffer because of it. The growth of  plankton will probably increase somewhat.</p>

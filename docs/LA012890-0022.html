			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'WHY IS IT THAT THE POP CRITICAL ESTABLISHMENT HAS TURNED INTO A STRONGHOLD FOR  PRETENSE?'  </P> <P> Rock 'n' roll started out as a protest against pretense and stuffiness -- pure  vitality and good fun, along with moments of emotional uplift and tenderness:  Elvis, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Roy Orbison, the Everly  Brothers. The Beatles, with their good humor, tender ballads and rhythmic  vitality, continued that tradition.  </P> <P> Why is it that the pop critical establishment has turned into a stronghold for  pretense -- both a humorless intellectual pretense (suicidally bleak lyrics are  a requirement) and an insecure machismo pretense?  </P> <P> Music must be loud and unmelodic. And to like rock with melodic structure, or  rock full of vitality and fun or, God forbid, a ballad, is an unforgivable sign  of weakness.  </P> <P> Good rock these days is still a protest against pretense -- but now,  paradoxically, a protest against the self-importance of rock critics; that is  why Billy Joel's superb "Storm Front" was on Pop Eye's Jan. 14 list of the  worst albums of 1989.  </P> <P> FERDINAND GASTELUM  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  The Pop Eye list was the result of a poll taken among 40 writers, critics,  deejays, record executives, managers, musicians and fans. Joel's album was in  ninth place.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Fikret Abdic, the president of the autonomous  province of western Bosnia [APWB], told Velkaton Radio in Velika  Kladusa this morning that the army of the autonomous province of  western Bosnia is objectively not able to prove to the world the  justness of its struggle against the brutal aggression of the  rebel army loyal to Izetbegovic's authorities. Slavisa Sabljic  has a report.    [Sabljic] Abdic said that the idea of autonomy was supported  by Muslims in the diaspora, but not by the diplomatic  authorities in Sarajevo which, via their primitive sympathizers,  have opted for the war and the bloody quenching of our army's  struggle for its own province and autonomy. The ignominious  action and the rebels' offensive that began on 10 June had been  prepared for months, Abdic went on to say and stressed that the  offensive's final aim was to strangulate the province and  liquidate the province's leaders. However, Abdic said, it is  impossible to strangulate the province, there can only arise an  all-people's resistance front, which we will organize.    Stressing the fabrications, media madness, and the lies that  certain media spread to the international public, Abdic said at  the end of his interview on Velkaton Radio that the REUTER  agency blazed the trail in spreading lies about Muslim conflicts  in the province. A REUTER team of journalists will soon arrive  in Kladusa in order to, as Abdic put it, deny their own reports.</p>

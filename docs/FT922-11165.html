			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Spain faces strikes over jobless benefits SPAIN is facing serious labour unrest this summer and autumn, following the announcement at the weekend by the General Workers' Union (UGT) that it is to hold a half-day stoppage next month, and a general strike of possibly 48 hours in October, both in protest at government cuts in unemployment benefits. The UGT and the other large union, the communist-led Workers' Commissions (CCOO) are to meet this week to co-ordinate further mobilisations. The CCOO will probably persuade the UGT to convert its May stoppage into a 24-hour strike. Both unions are promising a series of rolling sectoral strikes if the government does not withdraw its decree to cut unemployment payments. The government, which has made the cuts to trim the growing deficit (equivalent to Dollars 4bn) in the official employment institute, says they are necessary to help the country cut its public sector deficits before it enters the EC's economic and monetary union (Emu). Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance minister, insisted this weekend that the decree would not be withdrawn. The government and the ruling Socialist Party, which was initially unnerved by the scale of the decree, were closing ranks at the weekend and appear to have decided to confront the unions. The party is likely, even so, to force some changes to the decree in parliament this week. Officials say these will be minor and will not change the decree's thrust. Other ministers, including cabinet members well to the left of Mr Solchaga, were rallying to support him at the weekend. The employment institute's deficit has nearly trebled since 1987. Combined with the introduction of temporary contracts, designed to encourage recruitment of labour, its system of benefits payments has become widely abused. Some unemployed people receive more in institute benefit than they did when working.</p>

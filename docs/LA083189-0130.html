			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOSBACHER GUIDELINES ON TURTLES SCORED;  </P> <P> WILDLIFE SERVICE CALLS COMMERCE DEPT. PROTECTION PLAN INADEQUATE  </P> <P> The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in a highly critical letter, has charged  that Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher made a serious error in allowing  shrimpers to trawl without using devices that allow endangered sea turtles to  escape from the nets.  </P> <P> The letter, signed by Acting Deputy Director Richard Smith, called a new set of  interim shrimping guidelines by Mosbacher "inadequate" and said he believed  they would "further threaten the survival of the endangered Kemp's ridley sea  turtle."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Commerce Department, which oversees commercial  fishing in U.S. waters, said shrimpers were flagrantly violating the interim  guidelines.  </P> <P> The new rules call for shrimpers either to use the escape hatch devices or haul  in their nets every 105 minutes to check for stranded sea turtles. But Brian  Gorman, the Commerce spokesman, said the U.S. Coast Guard had sighted 409  shrimpers violating the time limits as of last Friday. Of 64 vessels that were  stopped, only three were using the devices that would free the turtles.  </P> <P> "They are certainly doing themselves a disservice," said Gorman. "We wanted a  system in place that would protect turtles and that the shrimpers would  embrace."  </P> <P> In another arena, environmentalists applauded the Fish and Wildlife Service  letter, saying that it only bolstered their contention that Mosbacher was  making a mistake in what they see as pandering to the shrimping industry.  </P> <P> "We are very pleased by it, principally because it makes all the arguments that  we've made -- that, biologically, tow time fishing is unsound and could lead to  the extinction of the species and, secondly, that the enforcement is  difficult," said Steve Moyer of the National Wildlife Federation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shrimpers Protested  </P> <P> The furor over what are known as turtle excluder devices, or TEDs, erupted a  month ago when shrimpers blockaded ports along the Gulf of Mexico to protest  the use of TEDs, which were about to become mandatory after more than 10 years  of study and negotiations.  </P> <P> Mosbacher, in reply to the blockade and at the urging of Gulf Coast  congressmen, at first said the devices would not have to be used for the next  three months, the height of the shrimping season. But a federal judge in  Washington said Mosbacher had no right to suspend the regulations designed to  protect the turtles. In reply to that, Mosbacher set up the interim guidelines  that will be in effect until Sept. 7, when he will issue permanent rules  regarding sea turtle protection.  </P> <P> The Fish and Wildlife Service letter is only one of about 1,000 letters  received by the Commerce Department during the comment period before the  permanent rules are enacted. Gorman said all but a few favored use of the  turtle escape hatches. Shrimpers have claimed they lose as much as 40% of their  catch because of the TEDS, a figure disputed by both the government and  environmentalists.  </P> <P> In the course of the sea turtle controversy, Mosbacher's own scientists at the  National Marine Fisheries Service urged him not to balk at ordering the use of  turtle excluder devices. When that was leaked to the press, an internal memo  was circulated throughout the fisheries service threatening termination if  employees discuss internal documents with reporters.  </P> <P> "This incident demonstrates a degree of untrustworthiness and unreliability  that, according to departmental regulations, could warrant removal from the  federal service," the memo said.  </P></p>

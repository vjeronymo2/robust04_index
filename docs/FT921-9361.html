			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Signs of housing revival reported THE HOUSING market may be showing faint signs of recovering from the deepest depression in its history, the National Association of Estate Agents said yesterday. A survey of 150 members of the association suggests viewings and offers by potential buyers are increasing. Two thirds of estate agents said offers from prospective buyers in January were up on monthly levels in the final quarter of last year and 84 per cent said viewings had increased. Estate agents in London, the region hardest hit by the property market depression, say inquiries are up for the first time in many months. Agents believe house prices will be flat for at least another year, however, until the middle of next year. Mr David Ware, president of the National Association of Estate Agencies, said: 'I am very pleased with the increased activity but I am acutely aware that we experienced a similar blip this time last year, when the revival proved to be a false dawn.' Regions where the signs of a housing market revival are strongest include the north and north-west of England, the west Midlands, London and East Anglia. In another survey published yesterday, private house builders report an increase in sales in January compared with a year ago. Firms in the south-east told the House Builders' Federation there had been the first 'strong upturn' in the market since August 1988. The federation said the findings suggested a housing market recovery was under way, 'as the first signs of market improvement normally ripple outwards from London and the south-east'. In the survey of builders, 62 per cent said sales had increased last month compared with January last year. Only 21 per cent said sales fell. In Greater London, 62 per cent said sales had improved while 33 per cent said they had remained the same.</p>

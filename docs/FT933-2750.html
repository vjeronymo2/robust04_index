			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Strong growth in Nigeria forecast A BULLISH appraisal of Nigeria's prospects by a leading research firm forecasts steady economic growth, rising oil output and a return to civilian rule next year. A report published today by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) predicts that Nigeria's oil production will rise from about 2m barrels per day now to 2.5m by the end of the decade. Annual real GDP growth will stay above 4.5 per cent over the same period, the London-based research firm forecasts. The study expects the military-backed interim administration, which took office last month following the annulment of the June presidential poll, to fulfil its pledge to hold fresh elections next year and hand over to a civilian government. 'Short-term volatility should not cloud what is a fundamentally optimistic prognosis in the long-term, with the establishment of a stable government committed to an open economy,' says the report. The next administration will have little room for manoeuvre in its economic policy, it argues, and will be obliged to implement lapsed economic reforms and enforce 'disciplined and transparent management of the public finances'. Nigeria 'desperately' needs to reschedule its external debt, which by end-1992 was Dollars 29bn, calculates the EIU study, with service payments 'roughly one third of all foreign currency earnings.' But rescheduling will not take place, the report continues, 'until the government demonstrates its intention to adhere to an adjustment programme' which wins International Monetary Fund approval. One essential condition, says the report, is the removal of the subsidy on domestic fuel which accounted for more than half the federal government's recurrent expenditure in 1992.

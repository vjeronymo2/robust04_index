			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because any PRC firm must affirmatively show that it is entitled to a separate rate before such a rate can be given and any intermediate country reseller must affirmatively show that it is entitled to such status under the intermediate country reseller provision of the regulations (19 CFR 353.47), any new shippers will also be subject to the PRC country-wide deposit rate until they request review and demonstrate an entitlement to an exception. Therefore, there is no need for an ``all others'' cash deposit rate for intermediate country resellers. Furthermore, no ``all others'' rate will be established for the PRC. Because a country-wide rate is applied to all imports of potassium permanganate from the PRC, there is no need for an ``all others'' cash deposit rate for PRC entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These deposit requirements shall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the next administrative review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice serves as a reminder to importers of their responsibility under 19 CFR 353.26 to file a certificate regarding the reimbursement of antidumping duties prior to liquidation of the relevant entries during this review period. Failure to comply with this requirement could result in the Secretary's presumption that reimbursement of antidumping duties occurred and the subsequent assessment of double antidumping duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice also serves as a reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (``APO'') of their responsibility concerning the disposition of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Timely written notification or conversion to judicial protective order is hereby requested. Failure to comply with the regulations and the terms of the APO is a sanctionable violation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1) of the Tarriff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and 19 CFR 353.22. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Susan G.

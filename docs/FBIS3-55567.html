			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Excerpts] You are listening to Slavyanka, the radio  station of Russia's Ministry of Defense, and now -- and what  could be more natural -- here is Russia's Defense Minister, Army  General Pavel Grachev. The recording was made at the very end  of the outgoing year when he was rounding up its results, and  these results, I must say, were extensive and varied, and out of  all that variety, we have selected the things that concern  everyone directly: housing, conditions of service -- but each of  you can add to the list yourself. Listen on. [passage omitted]    [Begin Grachev recording] [passage omitted] Regarding  military discipline: the results of 1993 show that,  unfortunately, due to serious failings in the work of staff  commanders and educational organs at all levels, and also  through lack of personal discipline, people continue to die,  weapons, ammunition, and military property are misappropriated,  and cases of absence without leave continue to occur.    The Ministry of Defense is making every effort to solve  these  problems. To illustrate this, we managed this year to slightly  reduce the gravity of problems linked to losses and  misappropriations of weapons and ammunition. In comparison with  the identical period last year, the quantity of misappropriated  weapons fell by a factor of more than 17. In comparison with  1992, the number of dead was almost halved.    An order of the Ministry of Defense on measures for  maintaining law and order and military discipline in the Russian  Armed Forces has been worked out and dispatched to the troops  with the aim of improving discipline in the forces.    We believe that its execution will enable the state of  affairs in this area to be improved significantly in 1994. [end  recording]</p>

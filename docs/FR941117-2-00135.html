			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In summary, the Commission believes that the CBOE proposal is a reasonable approach to ensure that solicited, prenegotiated orders are not ``hidden'' from interaction with the auction market. Such orders should be exposed to the trading crowd to ensure that the best price available is obtained. At the same time, the proposal will still provide market participants with flexibility to search for interest for unusual or complex orders. By setting forth a set of priority principles, subject to the priorities granted to the customer limit order book, to encourage disclosure of solicited orders, and by prohibiting market participants from trading ahead of others based on undisclosed knowledge of solicited orders, the proposal should benefit market participants and ensure investor protection consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Amendment No. 1 effects three minor revisions to the CBOE's proposal. First, paragraph one of Proposed Rule 6.9 is amended to make it clear that the rule includes solicitations by floor brokers who do not represent such an original order but who become aware of the original order when it is announced in the trading crowd or otherwise. Second, Proposed Interpretation and Policy .04 is revised to reflect that only paragraph (a) of Rule 6.9 overrides the Exchange's crossing rule, CBOE Rule 6.74. Third, Proposed Interpretation and Policy .05 is revised by deleting the introductory clause and adding an example to make it clear that the priority of an original order is in all cases governed by the priority principals of Rule 6.45. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that Amendment No. 1 strengthens the Exchange's proposal by refining some of the language used in its proposed rule. Moreover, these changes do not affect the substance of the Exchange's proposal. Accordingly, the Commission believes the Amendment raises no new or unique regulatory issues. Therefore, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 19(b)(2) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on an accelerated basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V.

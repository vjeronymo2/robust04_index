			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Book Review: Aspects of life where money doesn't talk VALUE IN ETHICS AND ECONOMICS By Elizabeth Anderson Harvard University Press.  Pounds 27.95/Dollars 41.95. 245 pages. Capitalism has proved more efficient at generating wealth than Marxism or any other economic system. But debate over its ethical foundations is not dead. The latest contribution comes in this stimulating book from Elizabeth Anderson, a philosopher at the University of Michigan. Though not totally hostile to market economics, Anderson is anxious to combat what she sees as a tendency for commercial values to invade areas of human life where they do not belong. She opposes, for example, making money out of surrogate motherhood, cost-benefit analysis of the environment and privatisation of public services. Commercialisation can degrade human beings by undermining their autonomy, according to Anderson. This happens when people sell things such as their freedom of action, perhaps via certain types of employment contracts, and their ability to reproduce. Putting a price on too many aspects of life can also restrict people's capacity to enjoy a meaningful existence by reducing all considerations of value to mere utility. At the heart of Anderson's book is an attack on the theory that people care only about what is useful or pleasurable to themselves. This idea, known to generations of economics students as the axiom of 'utility maximisation', is the foundation upon which much classical economic theory is built. Anderson rejects this proposition as too narrow an explanation of human behaviour. Instead she offers a more complex theory, which acknowledges that people value things not simply because they are useful or pleasurable but for other reasons such as respect, love, admiration or awe. She argues that this pluralism in the way we value things is central to the richness of life. When an object's utility is the only consideration, then the market is an appropriate institution for valuing it - but not when other considerations such as respect or love come into play. In fleshing out this thesis, Anderson distinguishes between things that can be properly traded and those which, she believes, should only be given. Examples of the latter category include children, trust, friendship and sexual gratification. To buy and sell these, she argues, is to devalue them. Equally, to treat the environment merely as an economic resource is to ignore the fact that nature is valuable even when it has no practical use to mankind. Although Anderson's book is hard to read because of its philosophical jargon, it has many strengths. Her pluralistic theory of value provides a broader perspective on the limitations of the market than the traditional leftwing complaint that capitalism leads to an unfair distribution of the fruits of economic activity. Her argument that commercialisation can rob human existence of much of its significance surely has merit. The book's weaknesses appear when Anderson turns her attention from philosophy to public policy. Her preference is for the state to draw the boundary between what should be traded and what should not. She is also opposed to the campaign begun in many countries in the 1980s to roll back the frontiers of the state through privatisation. Instead of privatisation, Anderson wants to see greater involvement for community bodies, such as local government and school boards, which she believes would allow people's needs to be determined through democratic debate. She thinks it is more important for citizens to exercise their voices collectively rather than as individuals picking and choosing suppliers of services. She therefore objects to ideas such as education vouchers on the grounds that they would undermine a community approach to schooling. But such practical conclusions do not obviously follow from Anderson's philosophical analysis. Just because the market is not perfect does not mean that the state can remedy its defects. For example, although people may be unwise to engage in practices such as prostitution, Anderson does not give convincing reasons why it should be prohibited by the state. Advocates of individual liberty have accepted that freedom includes the freedom to make mistakes. Similarly, Anderson is too quick to recommend that the state should ban commercial surrogate motherhood on the grounds that it leads to manipulation and exploitation of the genetic mother. If consistently applied, a policy of banning every act that involves manipulation would lead, not only to the criminalisation of most economic activity, but virtually of all politics. This book would have benefited from exploring a wider range of options for combating manipulation: it might, for example, be better for the state to educate its citizens so they are better able to stand up for themselves than to impose heavy-handed regulations. A further reason for resisting the knee-jerk reaction of calling in the state to sort out the limitations of the market is that the state has its defects, too. Anderson recognises this, criticising the tendency for power to become concentrated in remote centralised organisations. She believes the answer to such defects is to decentralise power and make the state more democratic. But, although democratic community organisations may be preferable to a centralised state, it does not follow that they are in general superior to the market. Nevertheless, the book's weaknesses when it comes to public policy should not detract from its philosophical strengths. It is possible to reach different practical conclusions while accepting Anderson's overall theory of value, which provides a useful contribution to debate about the proper scope of the market.</p>

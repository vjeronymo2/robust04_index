			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Italian union chief accepts pleas to return to the fray MR Bruno Trentin, leader of the CGIL, Italy's largest trade union confederation, has proved a well-worn maxim of Italian political life - resignations must never be taken at face value. Scarcely was the ink dry on the historic agreement signed on July 31 between the government, employers and the unions ending indexed wages when Mr Trentin handed in his resignation. It was a puzzling gesture from the country's most prestigious and intellectually gifted union figure, especially when his charisma was needed most by the CGIL as well as the government and employers. Ever since then he has been under pressure to reconsider. This he did at a special three-day meeting of the CGIL's 250 senior officials last week. The meeting turned into a virtual re-election of him in his four-year post as secretary general, to which he was elected last October. Despite objections from a hardline minority, the CGIL leadership also endorsed the July agreement ending the 47-year-old scala mobile system of indexed wages. It will be replaced with a limited system of compensating wages for inflation through to 1994. As of January 1993, workers will receive an extra L20,000 (Pounds 9.30) per month for 13 months. This is well below the inflation rate of 3.5 per cent projected for 1993 and does not compensate for this year's wages falling behind consumer prices. The government has agreed to freeze public sector tariffs and is offering the possibility of tax breaks to offset unexpected rises in inflation - issues tackled yesterday in the first government-union talks since the summer recess. Mr Trentin's acceptance of the deal was bitterly criticised by many in the rank and file who claimed that hard-won union gains had been traded for token concessions. However, last week he told his critics that his acceptance had been determined by reasons of state: this was not the moment to sign inflationary wage deals. He also threw light on the reasons behind his resignation. He knew the agreement was controversial and considered his resignation the best way to focus discussion. Behind such noble sentiments, he let slip another consideration: he was fed up presiding over a federation torn by political rivalries. The two elements of the former Italian Communist party - the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) and Reconstructed Communism - have shamelessly used the CGIL as an arena to pursue vendettas arising from the collapse of communism. Beyond these manoeuvrings lies the unresolved issue of the role of a hitherto powerful trade union movement in what is now a rich and increasingly market-orientated country.</p>

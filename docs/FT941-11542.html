			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador banana exports ride out storm Following months of protests by Latin American banana producers and an official condemnation by the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade of the European Union's import restrictions on Latin American bananas, Ecuador has announced near record export sales for 1993. In spite of what Mr Henrique Betancourt, president of the Association of Banana Producing Countries, has called the 'the worst crisis in the history of banana production' Ecuador's total sales last year reached 2.618m tonnes, 73,000 tonnes more than in 1992 and the second highest level ever. That performance came as a surprise as Ecuador, the world's largest banana exporter, had faced not only a sales crisis because of the EC restrictions but also a continued battle against disease. Ecuador's success was not shared by other Latin American banana producers and it was helped by being able to pick up the export slack left by Central American production losses caused by last year's hurricanes and floods. Mr Mariano Gonzalez, the agricultural minister, attributed the record exports to the successful trade policies of President Duran Ballen's administration, which wasted no time in gaining access to alternative markets. Despite its relative success, Ecuador still stands alongside other Latin American banana producers in the battle to persuade the EU to think again about its import restrictions.</p>

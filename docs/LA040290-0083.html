			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE WEEK OF MARCH 26:  </P> <P> Parents Blame Son's Murder on Bank: Wells Fargo Bank was sued in Los Angeles  Superior Court Wednesday by an Oregon couple, Frank and Susan Chase, who  contend that their son, Mathew Marshall Chase, was kidnaped and fatally shot  because of poor security and negligence.  </P> <P> In June, 1988, 22-year-old Chase disappeared after he went to a Wells Fargo  branch in Los Angeles to make a deposit at an automated teller machine. His  body was found in March, 1989. The suit says Chase was abducted after the  machine mistakenly indicated that he had insufficient funds to withdraw cash,  presumably angering his assailants.

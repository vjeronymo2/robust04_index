			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Olga Senatova and Aleksandr Kasimov, Institute </F> for Humanitarian-Political Studies: "This Nasty Word  'Constitution'"]    [Text] As we know, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who was  elected President of Kalmykia on 11 April 1993, promised during  his electoral campaign to introduce presidential rule in the  republic, to disband the Supreme Soviet and to get rid of the  opposition. These promises have been fulfilled, unlike the  promises to create a free economic zone, to promote industry,  and to make Kalmykia a center of world trade and tourism.    On 26 April 1993, the republic's Council of Ministers and  the  heads of rayon administrations laid down their powers. The  president undertook the formulation of the government and the  appointment of presidential representatives to the rayons. Only  two of the 13 former heads of administration became such  representatives.    The disbanding of the Supreme Soviet took place rather  quietly and in an apparently painless manner for the republic.  At its last session, the Supreme Soviet simply adopted the  decision to disband itself--only two deputies voted against it.  Work had been performed with each deputy. The president had met  with practically all of them, and, pressuring some and promising  something to others, he achieved the necessary outcome of the  voting. A professional parliament comprised of 25 members was  created on the basis of the Supreme Soviet. The list was  presented by the president and consisted primarily of his  supporters. During the 11 months of its existence, the  parliament never once spoke out against the president, even on  the most minor matters. In 1994 the republic press began calling  this a puppet parliament. The parliament members did not take  offense at this, which was not surprising. After all, there have  beem known cases of repeal of certain parliament decisions which  the president did not like for some reason.    The rayon level was left without even any formal  representative institutions. The president's representatives  became the masters there. The structure of power in the republic  turned into a pyramid, subordinated to the president, whose  slightest whims were not only carried out by the structures of  executive power, but also legitimized by the quasi-parliament.    After the elections, the opposition in the republic found  itself shattered and demoralized. The parties of democratic  orientation--the RPRF [Republican Party of the Russian  Federation] and the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia], initially  spoke out in support of the president, agreeing even to  voluntary self-dissolution (this was one of the principles of  candidate Ilyumzhinov's pre-electoral program). The Cossacks and  the religious associations followed suit. Finding themselves in  the real opposition to the president were the "Slavs of  Kalmykia" movement, the Kalmyk organization of the CPRF  [Communist Party of the Russian Federation] and the Free Party  of Kalmykia--the party of the Association of Farmers of  Kalmykia, the only one of the listed organizations which had a  material base and some influence.    Already by the Fall of 1993, it was becoming clear that the  large-scale projects for flourishing of the republic's economy  according to Ilyumzhinov were experiencing a collapse.  Ilyumzhinov was not able to add to his authority also among the  regional leaders. He continued to be perceived as an outsider,  primarily because his goals and intentions remained unclear.    During the Moscow events of 21 September - 4 October 1993,  Kirsan Ilyumzhinov tried to play solo. It seems the Kalmyk  president increased his rating, making people speak much about  him. However, this was only at first glance, and only in the  "western" understanding of political ratings. In the political  space of Russia such actions led to Ilyumzhinov's total  political defeat.    Ilyumzhinov lost even more after 4 October, when he in fact  expressed full loyalty to the President of Russia. Here we  should remember that open opposition to Yeltsin during those  days was demonstrated only by two republic leaders--Khakasia  Supreme Soviet representative Shtygashev and Ilyumzhinov.  However, Shtygashev, whose position in his republic was must  less stable than that of Ilyumzhinov, did not repent in  anything, and the Center did not dare touch him. Yet, even if it  had wanted to, Moscow could not have touched Ilyumzhinov.    By the Spring of 1994 it became ultimately clear that the  republic was in such a difficult position as never before.  Moreover, it became known that the credit in the amount of 14  billion rubles (R) obtained from the RF Central Bank in November  1992 by the commercial bank "Step," which was controlled by  Ilyumzhinov, judging by the reporting note of Minister of  Internal Affairs of Russia V. Yerin, had gone for conversion to  currency funds for a group of persons headed by Ilyumzhinov. The  compromise was set in motion after the events of 3-4 October in  Moscow, but then the matter was frozen, not without some  grounds, as many observers believe, in exchange for  Ilyumzhinov's initiative.    As a result, the republic found itself without money, and  people did not get their wages for several months. And here a  political crisis ensued, triggered by the president's  announcement about abolishing the republic's constitution.    On 8 February 1994 the session of parliament adopted an  amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of Kalmykia-Khalmg  Tangch, according to which the words "sovereign" and  "sovereignty" were deleted from the constitution. The  justification for this was the adoption of the new Constitution  of Russia, which stated that Russia is a federative state. The  decision was discussed and adopted, naturally, at the proposal  of the president. This event did not evoke any particular  emotion in the republic. However, already on 11 March at the  expanded session of the parliament, the president announced that  he would repeal the republic's constitution and would declare  the direct effect of the federal constitution on the territory  of Kalmykia.    This announcement by Ilyumzhinov could not remain without  consequences. Heated discussions flared at the closed meeting of  parliament which was held immediately after the expanded one.  Six deputies spoke out against the president's announcements.  Among these six was the editor-in-chief of the official  government newspaper IZVESTIYA KALMYKIYI, Mankya Koneyev.    Ilyumzhinov suggested to Koneyev that he submit his  voluntary  resignation. The president's press secretary was appointed as  the new editor-in-chief of the newspaper.    On 18 March, a session of the republic's parliament was held  in Elista, devoted to the new Basic Law. A decree by which the  Steppe Code must be approved by the Constitutional Assembly  comprised of 300 members was adopted by a majority vote.    On 22 March, the draft of the Steppe Code (Basic) Law) of  the  Republic of Kalmykia was published in the newspapers. The code  was developed, apparently, in record time (no more than a week).  According to the draft, the supreme power in the republic  becomes the president. The Legislative Assembly--the People's  Hural--may be disbanded by the president, for example, as  follows: "The President of the Republic of Kalmykia may disband  the People's Hural prior to expiration of its term if the  People's Hural does not ensure stability in society." No  mechanism for dismissing the president was provided in the code.    The Constitutional Assembly was held on 5 April. The  opposition did not participate in it. The representatives of the  opposition parties and movements refused to propose candidates  to the Constitutional Assembly, while 8 parliament deputies who  had voted against the Steppe Code on 18 March did not attend.  The assembly was held in one day and was concluded at 2:30 with  the adoption of the Steppe Code. One person voted against  it--the first secretary of the Kalmyk Republic Committee of the  CPRF, and one other person abstained. Of all those who spoke,  only one proposed amendments to the text of the code. The others  criticized the opposition and said that the adoption of the code  was a progressive step of world significance and that soon other  republics would follow the example of Kalmykia. Hero of  Socialist Labor and poet David Kugultinov presented a speech in  which he announced that the very word "constitution" is deeply  loathesome to him, since the constitution did not protect the  Kalmyks during the time of Stalinism. Nevertheless, the most  odious parts of the code were slightly re-worked.    On 7 April, the decree of the Constitutional Assembly was  published in the newspapers. Thus, the Republic of  Kalmykia-Khalmg Tanch now bears the name of the Republic of  Kalmykia, and it must live according to the Steppe Code (Basic  Law) of the Republic of Kalmykia.    That which is going on in Kalmykia is in line with the  general tendencies of behavior of executive power in the regions  of Russia, and reflects as if in a warped mirror all that is  going on in the Russian center itself, at the top of the  executive vertical. The tendency of President Ilyumzhinov toward  theatrical effects and a certain political "Khlestakov  mannerism" merely attract attention to the republic, and give  the all-Russian processes a clearly apparent character.    We will recall that Ilyumzhinov disbanded the Supreme Soviet  of his republic five months before the Moscow events, and after  21 September and until the beginning of October 1993 sharply  criticized Yeltsin specifically because he did not follow his  lead--he did not fully take into consideration the Kalmyk  experience. At that time these words were perceived as a  curiosity. However, it is possible that it was specifically  Ilyumzhinov's experience which was taken into consideration by  presidential analysts in developing Edict No 1400. But even if  this is not so, both cases of disbanding of the soviets were  links in the same chain. After his election as president,  Ilyumzhinov frankly exposed the motives for his future  actions--"the opposition will get in the way"--and did not heed  its admonitions about the necessity of the latter for democracy.  It is characteristic that, in the words of Ilyumzhinov, the  opposition may hinder the progress of economic reforms in the  republic. All year President Ilyumzhinov spent at the top of the  pyramid of power without any indications of hindrance from the  opposition--and what about the reforms?    Not one of the president's pre-electoral promises has been  fulfilled. Moreover, the real economic situation in the republic  has deteriorated. The republic needs subsidies for almost 100  percent of its budget--income from the sale of wool and other  farm products is absent due to low purchase prices. The  much-advertised projects for participation of foreign companies  in the construction of an international airport and the  provision of video and telephone services to every shepherd's  station, as well as the idea of turning the republic into the  capital of world Buddhism, were also from the realm of  discussions on the topic of "it would be nice to build a  bridge." However, a system of organs of power has been  formulated which legitimizes a regime of uncontrolled personal  power of the president.    The exotic manner of the Kalmyk president's actions hinders  Moscow observers from seeing an analogy. Certainly, the stories  about Ilyumzhinov's mediation during the talks between Yeltsin  and Nazarbayev, or the next idea about holding a meeting of the  Dalai llama, the Pope of Rome and the Patriarch of Moscow and  All Russia give reason to smile. But, in fact, we do not really  want to smile.    The executive power, which is dedicated to itself, is  incapable of effectively resolving the real problems. Even if we  discount the cases of outright corruption and expenditure of  budget or attracted funds for personal needs (and such cases  have been, are and will be)--even the most honest and best heads  of administration are powerless under current conditions to make  any global changes in the life of their region. They simply do  not have the means for this. Under conditions of the absence of  control on the part of the representative power, efforts to find  these means at any cost may inflict tangible loss both upon the  region and upon the state as a whole.    As for Kalmykia's prospects, they are bleak. A new round of  political confrontations in the republic is inevitable. The  national problems, which have been long forgotten for the last  two years, will also become more acute. But the main thing is  that now the citizens of the republic will not be lured to any  elections by any promises.</p>

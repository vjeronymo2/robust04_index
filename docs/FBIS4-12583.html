			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Rabin told the cabinet that the  closure of the territories, ordered after last week's wave of  terror attacks, will continue until further notice. The cabinet  decided to bring in about 18,000 foreign workers to replace  Palestinian laborers in Israel and to subsidize 4,000 Israeli  workers in agriculture. Jack Katzenell gave us this report:    [Begin recording] [Katzenell] All the cabinet ministers  agree that the territories will be closed off at least until  after Independence Day, and it takes place on Thursday [14  April]. It is on what happens after then that they disagree.  Minister of Culture and Communications Shulamit Aloni said the  acts of a few terrorists do not entitle the government to punish  nearly 2 million Palestinians. [passage omitted]    However, Prime Minister Rabin told the cabinet his long-term  aim is to reduce Israel's dependence on Palestinian workers not  only until the agreement with the PLO is implemented but until  it has proven itself -- in other words, until the number of  Palestinian terrorist attacks against Israelis has dropped in  the wake of the establishment of Palestinian autonomy. Economic  Planning Minister Shim'on Shetrit later told reporters this  could mean weeks or even years. Minister of Agriculture Ya'aqov  Tzur said: I believe the closure is for a long time; Housing  Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer said: I believe there is an  intention to leave it as it is, even after the implementation of  the agreement.    A number of ministers hinted that the closure would be used  as a means of pressure against Yasir 'Arafat to get him to speed  up the negotiations. This view was expressed both by hawks like  Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer and doves like Labor and Welfare Minister  Ora Namir.    [Namir] I do believe that it will bring the PLO to come as  soon as possible to Gaza and to Jericho and to take command of  the security of the people that are living there. In Israel,  the key to the process of peace is security.    [Katzenell] And Prime Minister Rabin told the cabinet that  the closure will be accompanied by a diplomatic drive to  complete the negotiations as soon as possible. [end recording]</p>

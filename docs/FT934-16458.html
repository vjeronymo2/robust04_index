			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Doeflex dips to Pounds 725,000 Doeflex, the Surrey-based PVC and thermoplastic sheet manufacturer, reported profits before tax of Pounds 725,000 for the half year to June 30, a decline of 17 per cent on the comparable outcome of Pounds 876,000. Turnover improved to Pounds 15.9m (Pounds 12.9m). Mr Richard Bickerton, chairman, said trading conditions remained competitive in the UK and deepening recession in Europe affected volume and margins for the group and its competitors.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from "News 7" program; </F> recorded passages in English]    [Text] With respect to the question of nuclear development  by the DPRK, or North Korea, International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] Director General Hans Blix said the IAEA will submit a  report on this case to the UN Security Council [UNSC] unless  North Korea accepts nuclear inspections before the end of this  month. He made the remark in an interview given to NHK in  Hiroshima today.    [Begin recording] [Blix] We have sent a letter to the DPRK  asking to let us be able to complete [nuclear inspections] as  soon as possible. If this is not accepted by the DPRK, then, of  course I have to report that to the Security Council.    [Unidentified NHK reporter] We would like to hear the  deadline. When is the deadline for the procedure?    [Blix] That should be before the end of ... around the end  of April. [end recording]    Following a failure to complete an inspection in North Korea  last month, the IAEA brought this case to the UNSC on 22 March.  But the UNSC just issued a presidential statement calling for  North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections due to China's  opposition to hardline policies against North Korea. Director  General Blix's remarks indicate his view that, depending on  North Korea's attitude, the issue should be brought again to the  UNSC later this month. In that case, the UNSC will have to  consider more compulsive measures, such as economic sanctions.</p>

			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Metals and coffee in retreat London commodity markets languished yesterday as New York traders took a second day off to digest their Thanksgiving turkeys. And none was more languid than aluminium. After pushing to a fresh four-year high of Dollars 2,015 a tonne for the three months delivery position on Tuesday the London Metal Exchange aluminium contract succumbed to the downward 'correction' that most market analysts thought inevitable following the 15 per cent run-up of the past month. The price quickly back-tracked below the Dollars 2,000 mark and continued downwards as relatively modest selling met little buying resistance. The fall accelerated yesterday morning as speculative liquidation breached successive chart support points and by the close three months metal was trading at Dollars 1,887.50 a tonne, Dollars 12.50 off the low but Dollars 61 down on the day. Traders noted that the nearby supply tightness that had narrowed the cash discount against three months delivery to just Dollars 1 a tonne at Monday's close had eased somewhat. Yesterday the discount ended at Dollars 15. Supply tightness was still very evident in the copper market, where the cash price remained at a substantial premium to the three months position. And with stocks of copper in LME warehouses continuing to fall prices bounced quite strongly after a mid-week shake-out. The three months quotation, which dipped to Dollars 2,753 a tonne at one stage on Wednesday, closed yesterday at Dollars 2,827.50 a tonne, unchanged on the week. Nickel was the only market to resist yesterday's early weakness, with commission house buying enabling it to ignore news of a sizeable rise in LME stocks. An advance to Dollars 7,810 a tonne for three months delivery proved unsupportable, however, and the price ended at Dollars 7,745.50, Dollars 3 on the day and Dollars 23 on the week. At the London Commodity Exchange the robusta coffee market added substantially to last week's heavy fall. Continued liquidation of long positions and an absence of roaster buying combined to push the January futures position down by over Dollars 200 a tonne on Monday. Tuesday saw a tentative rally but this was snuffed out the following day after Brazil revealed that is coffee stocks stood at about 15m bags (60kg each), substantially higher than traders had thought. The ensuing fall took the price to Dollars 2,870 a tonne, Dollars 1,260 below the 8 1/2  year peak reached on September 21, when a prolonged drought in Brazilian growing areas was adding to crop worries caused by damaging frosts in June and July. The price bounced to Dollars 2,987 a tonne but that was still Dollars 296 down on the week. 'There is a significant battle between producers and consumers over which way prices go,' commented Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst at GNI, the London trade house. 'The market is awash with coffee now, but it will be tight again next year.' In the meantime technical analysts are concentrating on the market's downside potential. 'It does have a bit of a yawning chasm below it now,' said Susan Rigg, of Chart Analysts, after Wednesday's plunge. And Elli Gifford, of Investment Research of Cambridge, warned that, given the pace of the decline in recent days, it seemed 'unlikely' that the coffee market would rally to reverse the downtrend. Chart patterns suggest that unless the January futures price can clamber back above Dollars 3,300 pretty quickly a fall to Dollars 2,600 could be on the cards.  -------------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------------- Aluminium       -16,400 to 1,872,150 Aluminium alloy     -20 to    26,700 Copper           -1,650 to   320,075 Lead               -975 to   358,900 Nickel             +792 to   151,254 Zinc             -3,725 to 1,206,775 Tin                -145 to    28,900  --------------------------------------------</p>

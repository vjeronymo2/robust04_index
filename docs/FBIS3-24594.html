Kabanov, Tayfun Scientific Production </F> Association; UDC 551.576.11:551.510.42/522.629.782]    [Abstract] Changes over time to the horizontal size of a  water vapor and hydrochloric acid launch cloud ater the launch  of a solid fuel rocket are calculated. Its lifetime at the  surface is calculated for various meteorological conditions.  Calculations were done for clouds which formed after space  shuttle launches. The time for the cloud to be destroyed by  precipitation is estimated. The following assumptions are made:  the troposphere is not saturated with moisture; there is no  cloud cover; the temperature and concentration of water vapor  does not change over the cloud's lifetime; wind speed in  constant. Cloud altitutde is assumed to be limited by an  inversion layer. The vertical and horizontal components of  turbulent diffusion are described. Figure 1; references 10: 4  Russian, 6 Western.</p>

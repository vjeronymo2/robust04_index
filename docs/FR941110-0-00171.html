			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters said that the denial of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment for certain diagnostic categories set forth at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.217(b) of the proposed rule would be ineffective, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lead to discrimination against individuals whose care may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more costly. This, they said, would be in violation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rehabilitation Act of 1974 and of the Americans with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Disabilities Act of 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We believe that these arguments are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convincing, and to prevent facilities from using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision as a means to discriminate, we have deleted it in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters said that this remedy as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written is too broad and subject to too much interpretation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particularly with respect to the meaning of the terms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``adequate care,'' ``diagnostic categories,'' ``certain specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnoses,'' ``substandard quality of care,'' and ``new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admission.'' Some said that residents who go to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital, then directly back to the facility, should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be ``new admissions.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ``Substandard quality of care'' has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in &sect;488.301. ``New admission'' has been defined at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.401 and the definition already contained the statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that residents admitted before the effective date of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial of payment and taking temporary leave are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered new admissions, nor subject to the denial of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment. Since we have deleted the proposed &sect;488.417(b),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no definitions for those terms need be provided. Finally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the term ``adequate care'' does not appear in the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> text at &sect;488.417. When it appears elsewhere in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, it has the ordinary dictionary meaning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One facility offered criteria for imposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial of payment for all new admissions based on a scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and severity scale of its own design, and suggested we say,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at &sect;488.417, that denial of payment for all new admissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be in effect only until the date the facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified to be in substantial compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We received several suggestions for revising  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> our scope and severity scales, and the enforcement scheme  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that we have established at &sect;488.408 (``Selection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies.'') reflects some of these suggestions. Neither a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial of payment nor any other remedy will be imposed at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility in substantial compliance, as defined at &sect;488.401.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once a denial of payment is imposed, it will be lifted when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility achieves substantial compliance (and is capable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of maintaining it, if necessary). This policy is set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, as well as at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.454 Duration of remedies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter, in setting forth regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> text for proposed &sect;488.217, said that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Denial of payment should be imposed, not only for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any deficiency which remains uncorrected within 90 calendar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days after the last day of survey identifying the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency, but for any deficiency which remains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially uncorrected within that time period as well;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If the facility can supply documentation that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial compliance was attained on a date preceding that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the revisit of the survey team, the denial of payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only remains in effect until the date that substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance was actually reached;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Denial of payment for all new admissions should last  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only until the facility has ``substantially corrected'' the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Denial of payment should not take effect until either  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA or the State has provided notice to the facility and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public of the impending action. Public notice shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by publication in a newspaper of general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circulation in the county where the facility is located;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Another commenter agreed that denial of payment should not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take effect until notice has been provided, and also said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that HCFA should set forth regulations requiring States to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> give notice to facilities before denying payment for all new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions.); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;When payments resume, this too should be announced to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the public in the same way as the denial notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree that denial of payment for all new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions should last only until the facility is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial compliance. Because the final rule reflects the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adoption of a substantial compliance standard, a denial of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment for new admissions, like other sanctions, will only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be applied should a facility fail to meet that standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, under sections 1819(h)(2)(d) or 1919(h)(2)(C) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, that facility must face a denial of payments for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions. Similarly, if, within 3 months of the survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that first identified deficiencies, the facility is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> successful in achieving substantial compliance, the denial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of payments will be lifted as required by sections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1819(h)(3) and 1919(h)(4) of the Act. If the facility does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not come into substantial compliance by 3 months after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last day of the survey, denial of payment will be imposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until substantial compliance is achieved or until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility is terminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also agree that, except in the case of the mandatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial of payment for substandard quality of care identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in three consecutive standard surveys, if the facility can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supply documentation acceptable to HCFA or the State survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency that it was in substantial compliance, and was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capable of remaining in substantial compliance, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary, on a date preceding that of the revisit, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies terminate on the date that HCFA or the State can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verify as the date that substantial compliance was achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (This is further discussed in connection with a comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.454.) In the case of repeated substandard quality of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care, the Act requires that the denial of payment (and State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitor) remain in place until the facility is in compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and can demonstrate that it will remain in compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree that facilities should receive notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies before they are imposed. Notification requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are found at &sect;488.402(f), and need not appear again at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.417. The commenter cited section 1919(h)(2)(A)(i) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act as rationale for HCFA promulgating regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> setting forth procedures for States to use in informing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general public about remedies. We do not agree that the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires HCFA to promulgate regulations regarding how States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must go about notifying the general public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters said that the remedy denial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of payment for specific categories of residents to be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the surveyor finds that the facility is not currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to provide adequate care for these individuals, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that caring for such individuals would adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect care provided to other residents, was not one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies provided in OBRA '87.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are deleting the provisions for denial of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment for specific categories of residents from this final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule because, as we stated at the beginning of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we believe that this remedy could lead to inequities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters expressed concern over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether survey agency revisits would be timely enough to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure the prompt resumption of payments as soon as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility corrects its deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

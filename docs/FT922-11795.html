			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Letter: Ignored and late reports (2) Sir, While I have not seen a copy of the paper produced by the Bristol Business School at the recent BAA annual conference, I was surprised to read Andrew Jack's report, 'City analysts 'largely ignore' annual reports (April 16) . Through its examinations, the SIA is widely recognised as having led the way in raising analytical standards in the investment community and the interpretation of reports and accounts is certainly a focal point in its examination syllabus. It may also be noted that a recent Mori survey of City opinion confirmed once again that analysts rely more on company reports and accounts than any other material and this includes personal interviews and presentations etc. What individual analysts may admittedly not be so well qualified to do is to scrutinise accounts for so-called 'bad' accounting practice; however, this is one of the reasons why, on their behalf, the society is making its contribution to the work of those bodies committed to seeing an improvement. C C Davis, chairman, Society of Investment Analysts 211-213 High Street, Bromley, Kent BR1 1NY</p>

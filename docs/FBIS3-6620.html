			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Japan Trade Union Confederation [Rengo], at its  senior executives meeting on 15 March, decided to soon establish  the "Rengo political forum" (tentative name), the policy  consultative organ composed of Diet members from various parties  including conservatives. Among those parties are the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the Democratic Socialist Party  [DSP], Sakigake [Harbinger], and the Japan New Party.    Within Rengo, moves toward the political realignment have  been observed. For example, the All-Japan Prefectural and  Municipal Workers Union, the Japan Teachers Union, the Japan  Electric Communications Union [as published], and the Japan  Postal Workers Union have agreed to provide financial assistance  and electoral cooperation so as to unite the SDPJ, the DSP, and  liberal forces. The purpose of this organ is to create grounds  for unifying a new force by engaging in policy coordination  between various parties.    At Rengo's Central Committee session scheduled for 17 March,  Chairman Akira Yamagishi will officially propose the  establishment of the organ. Then, members of both the SDPJ and  the DSP and some intellectuals will form a preparatory team in  early April to work on establishing the new organ.</p>

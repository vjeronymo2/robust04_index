			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 22 Feb (XINHUA) -- China has made progress  in reforming statistical work, and statistical organs at all  levels throughout the country have attained new achievements in  promoting statistical work into a social, industrial,  commercial, and international practice. Statistical work is  moving in the direction suitable to a socialist market economy.    As a key link to changing statistical work in compliance  with  a market economy, the experiment on establishing and improving a  new national economic accounting system has evolved into the  phase of practice, and the basic framework of accounting systems  for the state and provinces has been preliminarily established.  The "China National Economic Accounting System (Experimental  Program)," which was developed and formulated in 1992, not only  tallies with China's actual situation in developing a socialist  market economy but also conforms to the international norms  commonly practiced in the world. Compared to China's original  accounting system, the new system has made new breakthroughs in  the scope, contents, and methods of accounting. China will  comprehensively transfer to the new accounting system in 1995.  Statistical organs in all localities and departments have  treated this reform as their central work, whereas the State  Statistical Bureau and the overwhelming majority of provincial,  regional, and municipal statistical bureaus have fully used all  kinds of statistical data, including those held by departments  in charge of various businesses at all levels, to complete the  compilation of gross national product [GNP] and the form for it,  the input-output table, the flow of funds accounts, the balance  of international payments, and other basic accounting forms,  thus laying a foundation for a complete transfer to the new  system.    To meet the requirement of strengthening macroeconomic  management, China has also studied and established relevant  special statistical systems in carrying out statistical work.  Together with the departments concerned, the State Statistical  Bureau has formulated a program for improving the application of  indexes to appraise and assess the industrial economy and a  program for the trial computation of the quarterly GNP, in  addition to having established the systems of industrial value  added, sales, output value, a system for assessing and computing  the economic efficiency of industrial enterprises, and a  quarterly GNP accounting system. Meanwhile, to reflect in a  timely manner the basic conditions in China's  factors-of-production markets, the construction of development  zones, and the development of trial state enterprise groups, the  State Statistical Bureau also formulated the "system of  synthetic statistical forms for factors-of-production markets  and development zones" and the "system of statistical forms for  trial state enterprise groups." The implementation of the new  program using indexes to appraise and assess the economy has  played a positive role in improving China's macroeconomic  management and in correcting the tendency of pursuing an  increase in output value alone and blindly competing with one  another in terms of growth rates.</p>

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> MICHAEL JACKSON, ELTON JOHN WIN FIRST RYAN WHITE AIDS AWARD  </P> <P> Entertainers Michael Jackson and Elton John were selected as the first  recipients of the Ryan White Memorial Award, which was named in the memory of  the young AIDS victim.  </P> <P> The announcement was made Tuesday night at a gathering of Athletes and  Entertainers for Kids at the newly opened Tiffany &amp; Co. store on Rodeo  Drive.  </P> <P> The award was created to remember the young AIDS victim, who spent the final  years of his life telling adults and youngsters about the disease and fighting  for his rights and the rights of others who contract the virus.  </P> <P> Among those attending the event were Ryan's mother, Jeanne, former Lakers star  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Olympic gold-medal swimmer Greg Louganis.  </P> <P> Louganis, who had developed a close relationship with Ryan, said the youngster  served as an inspiration to him.  </P> <P> "He really was so brave," Louganis said. "That really helped me. When I hit my  head on the springboard in Seoul, Korea (during a dive at the Olympics), it was  like if this was Ryan White, he wouldn't give up. I know he wouldn't. He was my  strength for a time there."  </P> <P> The awards will be presented during a television show later this year.  </P></p>

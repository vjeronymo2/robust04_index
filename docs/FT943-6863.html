			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Clinton wins vital Senate support for Dollars 30bn crime bill President Bill Clinton won a crucial victory yesterday when Democrats and moderate Republicans in the Senate united to pass a procedural motion paving the way for a vote on the controversial Dollars 30bn (Pounds 19.3bn) crime bill. If the bill is approved in a final vote, the president will get a much-needed boost as he struggles to revive his flagging political standing ahead of mid-term Congressional elections in November. Senators were poised last night to vote in further stages of the legislative process. The crime bill, which was passed by the House of Representatives on Sunday, has seemed in danger of being lost through procedural wrangling in the Senate. But the president's supporters mustered 61 votes - just one more than necessary under the rules - to get the bill over a critical initial hurdle. Six Republicans joined 55 Democrats to push the bill ahead, while 38 Republicans and one Democrat were opposed. After a final vote is taken on the crime bill, the Senate will adjourn for two weeks, but behind-the-scenes efforts will try to make progress on healthcare - Mr Clinton's other big legislative goal. The crime bill would provide funding over six years for new prisons, extra police and social programmes aimed at preventing people from turning to crime. The crime bill has been caught up in blocking manoeuvres by the Republicans with an eye to the looming elections. Last year a similar bill passed the Senate by a wide margin of 95-4, with only two Republicans in opposition. That bill went to a House-Senate conference committee, where differences between the House and Senate versions were ironed out. But when the bill returned for a final vote, it nearly failed in the House and has run into strong Republican blocking tactics in the Senate. Republican Senators have tried to eliminate the social programmes from the bill. But Democrats have accused them of acting on behalf of the powerful gun lobby, which wants the bill killed because it contains a ban on assault weapons. The crime bill was intended as a showcase for Mr Clinton's brand of moderate government activism. It contains items to appeal to various constituencies: new death penalties, tougher sentencing laws, incentives for the hiring of 100,000 new policemen, and prison funding - all intended to appeal to the political right; crime prevention programmes for the political left; and the assault weapons ban to demonstrate that Washington is not in the grip of 'special interests'. On the Senate floor yesterday, the Democratic leader, Senator George Mitchell, begged his colleagues to 'resist the temptation to take a political action' by opposing the bill. The lengthy wrangling over the crime bill has held up Senate action on healthcare reforms and some Democrats claim that is the real purpose of the Republican tactics.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Asian economic growth forecast at 7.3% in 1995 Asia will continue to outpace global economic growth next year, even though its projected expansion in gross domestic product of 7.3 per cent will be slightly lower than this year's 7.8 per cent, according to latest estimates by economists at the Asian Development Bank. China is forecast to record a 9 per cent growth rate, down from 11.5 per cent this year. That figure is topped only by Vietnam's 9.6 per cent expected growth. Collectively, the region's newly industrialising economies (Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan) are expected to turn in a slower growth of 6.9 per cent, from this year's 7.1 per cent. The developing economies of South-East Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) are forecast to advance by a higher average rate of 7.7 per cent, from this year's 7.3 per cent, according to the ADB. Mr Malcolm Dowling, assistant chief economist at the Manila-based ADB, attributes the continued expansion mainly to 'the modest recovery' in global production that will push up overall demand. Mr Dowling presented these forecasts at the opening yesterday of a three-day ADB workshop on Asia's economic outlook. Representatives from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund also presented studies pointing to a 'broadening' and 'acceleration' of the nascent recovery in industrial economies. Economists from the three institutions said the current turbulence in world financial markets will not jeopardise the continuing growth in Asian economies. Mr Dowling cited particularly the Asian economies' strong savings and investment rates that have been instrumental in achieving steady growth records. The ADB study also noted the 'phenomenal' rate of net resource flows (including grant aid) to the developing countries of the region.</p>

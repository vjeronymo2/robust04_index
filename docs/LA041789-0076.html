			<p><P> April 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: ROSE TAKING HEAT, SHOWING NO SIGNS OF WILTING  </P> <P> Pete Rose, public enemy No. 14, is in town today, up to his shaggy bangs in  investigation and innuendo. How happy he would be if the toughest question he  had to answer all week had to do with sending up a pinch-hitter, or pulling a  pitcher, instead of those third-degree interrogations that begin: "Where were  you on the night of . . . ?"  </P> <P> Ask me baseball questions, Pete Rose pleads, a condemned man's last request.  </P> <P> On the other hand, after weeks and weeks of wild rumor and nasty humor, Pete  Rose remains persecuted, not prosecuted. This may change, and soon. A decision  is due any month now. So far, however, Pete Rose has been accused of everything  but the Lindbergh-baby kidnapping and the ZZZZ Best carpet-cleaner scam.  </P> <P> "Let me tell you something," his old friend and foe, Dodger Manager Tom  Lasorda, said Sunday. "If this guy is innocent, can you imagine the injustice  that's been done to him?"  </P> <P> Yes, I can. If Pete Rose is innocent, I think he should take the bat he used to  break Ty Cobb's record -- if he still has it -- and come out swinging at every  single person who has soiled his good name.  </P> <P> Somehow, the man manages to keep managing, manages to keep his Cincinnati Reds  near the top of the National League standings, while dealing with all the  Rose-bashing and Red-baiting that has followed him from town to town. Charlie  Hustler, they call him now. Or gag songs they write, like "Gamblin' Rose," a  parody of an oldie by Nat King Cole. Ours can be a cold, cruel world, can't it?  </P> <P> At the same time, Pete Rose's various transgressions could turn out to be  extremely serious, in which case, he could end up being inducted in the Hall of  Infamy. He could end up the very way he stood his ground in the batter's box --  with the short end of the stick.  </P> <P> All we can say is, we hope not.  </P> <P> "It's a simple game," Pete Rose is fond of saying. "The ball is round, and you  try to hit it square."  </P> <P> That's all the guy wants, a square deal. If these investigators really have  something on him, he must pay the price. If they don't, then somebody owes this  guy an apology-and-a-half.  </P> <P> Through it all, Charlie Hustle has endured. He has handled himself about as  well as anybody could be expected to handle the notion of people prying into  his personal life, quoting his children, quoting his former spouse, quoting his  friends, quoting his casual acquaintances, quoting unknown and unnamed  assailants, dissecting his personal life as though he should be this week's  special guest star on "America's Most Wanted."  </P> <P> Maybe things will turn out poorly for Pete Rose. Maybe he will be thrown out at  home, caught stealing, trapped in a rundown, sent to the showers. As we say, we  sure do hope not. Pete Rose has been good for baseball, as well as vice versa.  He is one of those guys we hoped would stick around as long as Casey Stengel  and Yogi Berra, grow old wearing short pants, be there to manage the Reds on  the first Monday in April of the year 2000, be there to toss out the ceremonial  first ball at the World Series of 2025.  </P> <P> At this season's opener, before his friends and apostles of Riverfront Stadium,  the Reds had a date with the world champion Dodgers, and Lasorda had hoped to  pull him aside, speak to him confidentially. Trouble was, whenever Pete Rose  poked his head from the dugout, wherever he stepped on the diamond, he bumped  into somebody who wanted to know if he placed bets on this, or sold this to  that, or gave secret hand signals to so-and-so.  </P> <P> "I finally managed to whisper in his ear," Lasorda recalled. "There were all  these people around, it was hard to get near him. All I told Pete was, we're  all pulling for him to come out of this thing fine. We're all hoping he'll come  out with his reputation not tarnished.  </P> <P> "All these things they say and write about Pete, they'd better be sure of their  facts. I'll tell you one thing: He has to be a very, very strong person to keep  doing his job the way he's been doing, because I certainly understand how  demanding it is taking care of your players, your coaches, your trainers, your  fans, your press, you name it. I know Pete's got a lot on his mind.  </P> <P> "If the guy messed up, he's gotta pay for it. Everybody knows that. But they'd  better be damn sure he messed up before they accuse him of it."  </P> <P> And to think it was only last summer when the biggest worry Pete Rose had, or  certainly appeared to have, was overtaking the Dodgers for first place. The  blues got the last laugh on the Reds, hanging tough all the way through  October, after the Cincinnati manager had prophesied that Los Angeles would  topple somewhere along the way.  </P> <P> All Pete Rose wanted to think about during the off-season was ways to jump from  second place to first. The biggest problem he seemed to have was staying in  owner Marge Schott's good graces, and making sure he never ran over her dog  with his Porsche.  </P> <P> Now, as Pete Rose returns to Chavez Ravine, he is fighting for more than first  place. He is fighting for his baseball life. And, I will tell you something  about Pete Rose. He will not go out without a fight.  </P> <P> You can bet on it.  </P></p>

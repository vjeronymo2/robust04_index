			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Asset-backed offerings in Canadian dollars and lire Two asset-backed offerings were launched in the eurobond market yesterday in an otherwise quiet session which saw a number of small-sized issues mainly targeted at European retail investors. European Sovereign Investments, a bond-arbitrage company based in Luxembourg which issues bonds backed by a pool of European government bonds, launched its debut offering in the Canadian dollar sector, with a CDollars 125m issue of bonds due January 1998. The issue was priced to yield 32 basis points over Canadian government three-year paper and found demand from institutional investors in the UK and Belgium and from retail investors, primarily in Switzerland and the Benelux region, lead manager Wood Gundy said. The spread widened slightly to 34 basis points after the syndicate broke. In the lira sector, US Guaranteed Finance Corporation, a special-purpose vehicle which issues bonds backed by the US Export and Import Bank, launched a L350bn offering of 12-year floating-rate notes. This is the first such non-US dollar offering and the longest-dated eurolira bond ever issued, according to joint lead manager Citibank. Also in the lira sector, Peugeot Finance International tapped the shorter end of the sector with a L150bn offering of three-year bonds with a coupon of 12 per cent. Demand for the paper came from Italian institutional and retail investors and investors in France, Switzerland and the Benelux countries, lead manager Credito Italiano said. JP Morgan is arranging a debut eurobond for San Miguel, the Philippines brewing and food company and the country's largest manufacturing enterprise. The USDollars 100m, fixed-rate offering will have a maturity of 5 1/2 years and a semi-annual coupon. It is expected to come to market in the week beginning September 26, after JP Morgan has completed a series of representations to key investors. JP Morgan said the bonds would be priced to give a lower yield than Philippine government five-year eurobonds, which trade at about 200 basis points over US Treasuries. The unusual maturity is due to Philippine central bank regulations, JP Morgan said.</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH CHEERED AS HE CRITICIZES CONGRESS  </P> <P> Oliver L. North, speaking before a cheering crowd of hard-core supporters  Saturday, attacked Congress for intervening in foreign affairs but avoided any  mention of his conviction on three of 12 counts in the Iran-Contra scandal.  </P> <P> North's only reference to his legal situation was indirect, coming when he  criticized Congress and the independent counsel's office for spending $40  million on investigating the Iran-Contra affair. He said the money would better  have been spent supporting the Contras.  </P> <P> It was the retired Marine lieutenant colonel's first scheduled public  appearance since he was convicted Thursday of supplying Congress with a false  chronology of the Iran-Contra events, shredding documents to cover up the  deceit and accepting a $13,800 home security system from Richard V. Secord, who  still faces trial for his part in shipping weapons to Iran.  </P> <P> The event was sponsored by conservatives among Miami's Nicaraguan and Cuban  immigrants, who are helping pay North's legal bill.  </P></p>

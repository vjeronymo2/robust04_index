For security and  stability to be achieved in the region, the peace process must  be comprehensive. Otherwise, it remains merely talk that will  not produce concrete results; on the contrary, using hollow  expressions about peace without real results will lead to  terrorism and violence, as happened in the massacre at the holy  al-Ibrahimi Mosque. [end recording]    The statement was given during al-Shar's current three-day  visit to Bonn. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Minding Your Own Business: You cannot beat the system - Computing I WENT to a talk given by an eminent authority on small businesses. He was planning a study on the administrative burden that VAT inflicted on small businesses. The other members in the audience agreed - accounting for VAT was a big problem. There are even consultants who specialise in teaching businessmen how to handle VAT. But if small businessmen are having trouble with their VAT return it is not because VAT is difficult. It is because they are disorganised; they are not working to any system. Because they have no system they know the VAT return is going to be a difficult job, so they put it off until the last minute. Late at night on the last day before the deadline, they work out the inputs and outputs on the back of an envelope and fill in the return. Three months later when the next return has to be filled in they look at this envelope and cannot remember how they arrived at the figures. So it is yet more work to unravel what they did last quarter before they can get started on the new one. All this is unnecessary. With even the most elementary manual system the VAT figures virtually jump out of the daybooks straight into the VAT return. To take a different example on a larger scale: one of your company's main suppliers rings up and says you are behind on paying your bills and you owe Pounds 10,512.56. Now. Otherwise he stops deliveries. In a disorganised company, this may be the first inkling anyone has that there is a serious problem. Managers must drop everything to handle this emergency. First, you have to find out if you do really owe Pounds 10,512.56. Which invoices make up the total; are they all overdue? If not, perhaps we can offer to pay some now, the balance later? So having worked out which invoices are involved, you have to work out whether you have the cash in the bank to cover a hefty cheque. And remember to leave enough to cover next week's wages. If there is not enough cash you will have to chase some customers to pay their bills. Whose invoices are overdue? Find out, and then get on the phone to them. In a company which is organised, you know there is a problem before the supplier rings. A system is in operation which automatically gives you the details of which invoices you owe, how much money you have in the bank, and so on. Therefore, before it blows up into a crisis, you can sit down, look at the figures and work out what to do. You can ring your supplier, tell him that things are a bit tight because several big bills are coming due at the same time but you propose to do A, B and C - is this OK? Usually it is. You have taken the initiative by ringing him first. It shows you are on top of the situation and he feels he can trust you. Note also the enormous savings in management time. You could have wasted a couple of hours in panic on that call. But being forewarned by a good system, you could see the problem arising and sort it out before it blew up into a crisis. With a good system, you might not have had to do anything at all. Your bookkeeper saw the problem coming up, planned what to do, got your agreement and then went ahead and did it. The distinction is between effort and effectiveness. The organised business is quiet and relaxed. In a disorganised business the managers waste hours chasing their own tails. So what exactly is a system? The designer of a system takes a complex task and breaks it down into its parts and then puts the parts back together in as logical and simple a procedure as possible, effectively reducing it to a standard set of steps, a routine. Someone trained to follow these logical steps can handle a complex task quite easily. Designing systems is not a natural skill. In industry there are Organisation and Methods specialists and systems analysts who specialise in this work. But because keeping financial records is basically the same for any company, you will find that systems to help you keep accurate financial records are available off the shelf. There is one key question about any system - who is going to run it? Unless the company is very small, record-keeping needs to be the task of someone other than the management. Managers are constantly being interrupted by customers, employees, problems. Managers are concerned not with important matters, but with urgent ones. Financial records are not urgent, so if the manager has to keep them they will always be out of date. The person who keeps the books should not be in the firing line. Record-keeping is the task of second-line management, not first-line. This is why big companies are so much better at running computers than small ones. Big companies have intelligent second-line staff who can handle problems without help from the bosses. Small companies often have no competent second-line staff at all. To be effective, systems have to be run systematically. The operator must be intelligent, methodical, disciplined. Such people cost money. You have to decide the priorities for your company here. Do you forego that big company car and the pension scheme in order to spend the money on good quality admin staff? It is an old adage that first-rate managers employ first-rate people; second-rate managers employ third-rate people. What sort of manager are you?

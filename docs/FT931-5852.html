			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Political Notebook: A dangerous by-election By-elections do not count. All governments are vulnerable to protest votes. The shock waves last no more than a day or so. Seats lost in mid-term are almost invariably won back at the following general election. Already in the bars of Westminster senior Conservatives are arming themselves against the possibility that the Tory stronghold of Newbury will be the scene of Mr John Major's first electoral defeat of the present parliament. The untimely death last month of Mrs Judith Chaplin robbed the prime minister both of a good friend and of one of his most able back-bench MPs. No-one doubts that she would have been among the first of last year's new intake to be given a job in government. The resulting by-election is threatening to prove as politically wounding to the prime minister as her death was personally painful. His party remains in turmoil. The recession and the civil war over Maastricht have drained morale. Loyalist MPs and ministers are increasingly frustrated by the government's inability or unwillingness to take on the Euro-sceptics. But veiled threats of expulsion from the party whips appear only to solidify the rebels' detachment. Among the 40 or so implacable Tory opponents of Maastricht there are perhaps a dozen who would see the prime minister fall rather than back the treaty. There are mutterings still that if the rebels fail to derail the bill by voting for the social chapter they might yet support an anti-Maastricht candidate in Newbury. Friends as well as enemies judge the authority of Mr Major's government to be as weak as any since Mr James Callaghan's ill-fated Labour administration in the late 1970s. The prime minister has been heard to comment ruefully that the now Lord Callaghan has confided that it is easier to govern with a majority of one than with 21. Newbury is by any standards a prosperous constituency, one of the principal beneficiaries of the 1980s boom along the M4 corridor. It is no accident perhaps that the constituency's biggest employer is a supplier of mobile phones. But now it offers a microcosm of the ravages of Britain's first middle-class recession. As one minister explained this week, to visit Newbury is to understand why the government is so unpopular with its own natural supporters. If an unemployment rate of 7.5 per cent remains well below the national average, the number of people out of work has trebled since 1990. The crime rate has almost doubled. The house price slump has left thousands of once-confident aspirants to the Tory good life trapped by negative equity. It is not certain that the Tories will lose. It would take a hefty swing of just over 9 per cent to the Liberal Democrats - the only serious challengers in the constituency - to overturn Mrs Chaplin's 12,357 majority. Even in times of crisis loyalty to the Conservatives runs deep in Berkshire. Strategists at Conservative central office are drawing comfort from the fact that during each of the last three parliaments the party has survived its first by-election challenge. Labour's expected but unimaginative refusal yesterday to withdraw from the contest (it won only 6 per cent of the vote in 1992) raised hopes that a split opposition once again would give the Conservatives victory. But Mr Major is in no hurry to test favourable precedents. Fresher in his mind are the 25 per cent and 12.5 per cent swings to the Liberal Democrats in Ribble Valley and in Kincardine and Deeside during his first year in Downing Street. In Newbury the Liberal Democrats are firmly entrenched in the council and will field a strong local candidate. So most Conservatives assume that the poll will be postponed until May 6 to coincide with the local authority elections. The assumption is that is better to get the bad news from both out of the way on the same day. Some, though, are suggesting that Mr Major should wait until the last possible moment in late June before facing the electors. By then his party may have escaped from the debilitating limbo of Maastricht. By then the economy may have escaped from the worst of the recession. By then his government may have escaped from its present paralysis. Mr Major must hope so. It may be that through the prism of history, by-election defeats appear frequently as insignificant dots on the political landscape. But it never feels like that at the time. This prime minister cannot afford to lose.</p>

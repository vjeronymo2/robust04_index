			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Abbey National chief's bonus Abbey National may have had a good year in 1993, but Mr Peter Birch, the bank's chief executive, did even better, with a Pounds 62,400 performance-related bonus to add to his salary. Back in March, Abbey surprised analysts with an increased dividend pay-out policy that reflected the optimism that came with a 25 per cent increase in pre-tax profits. However, Mr Birch just managed to top this. The latest annual report reveals a 28 per cent increase in his pay package taking it up from Pounds 257,566 to Pounds 329,179.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A man convicted of shooting a "Good Samaritan" who stopped to offer him a ride  was sentenced Friday to life plus 11 years in state prison.  </P> <P> Michael Manuel Brito, 25, was given the term for his conviction March 3 of  premeditated attempted murder, which carries a life sentence.  </P> <P> Eugene Smith, 27, a San Diego Park and Recreation Department employee,  testified that he offered Brito a ride Aug. 12 when he saw him walking on  Interstate 94 at Euclid Avenue with a gas can.  </P> <P> Smith said Brito fired a shot that struck Smith in the back, then stole his  1981 Cadillac.  </P> <P> San Diego Superior Court Judge Ross Tharp also imposed a consecutive 11-year  term because Brito stole the car. Brito was convicted of burglary in 1983, and  later of grand theft.  </P> <P> Tharp described Brito as "a serious danger to society."  </P> <P> Brito's attorney, William Saunders, said afterward that Brito probably won't  become eligible for parole until after he serves 15 to 20 years.  </P> <P> The judge also ordered Brito to pay back $3,500 to Smith from his prison  earnings for stealing the car, which was recovered after it had been stripped.  </P> <P> Smith testified that Brito, whom he had never seen before, demanded all his  money when pointing the gun at him. He said Brito shot without warning.  </P> <P> Smith ran to a nearby gas station and was hospitalized 10 days. He did not  suffer permanent injury.  </P></p>

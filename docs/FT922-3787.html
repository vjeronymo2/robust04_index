			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Protean advance 55% to Pounds 2.03m PROTEAN, the water purification and laboratory equipment maker formerly Elga Group, yesterday displayed the fruits of recent acquisitions with steep rises in profits and turnover for the year to March 31. Pre-tax profits increased 55 per cent from Pounds 1.31m to Pounds 2.03m. A final dividend of 2.15p is proposed for a total of 2.75p (2.5p). Mr Peter Ryan, chairman, said last year was one of great achievement. Although profits were boosted by a first full-year contribution from Chromacol, acquired in February 1991, all companies traded profitably despite pressure on margins caused by the recession. Two other acquisitions had less impact, coming towards the end of the reporting period. Aquadem, the Paris-based water purification components supplier was acquired in December. The purchase of Carbolite, a maker of laboratory furnaces, was not completed until March. Turnover rose to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 16.5m), in line with the interim figures, when sales were 37 per cent ahead at Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 7m) and pre-tax profits increased 52 per cent to Pounds 462,000. Earnings were affected by a higher tax charge and rose to 8.29p (8.05p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Igor Shishkov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 7 May -- An Il-76TD transport aircraft  carrying 117 Russian citizens -- staff members of foreign  establishments in the Republic of Yemen and members of their  families -- took off from Djibouti today for home. An ITAR-TASS  correspondent was told this today when he spoke to a senior  staff member of the Russian Foreign Ministry's press and  information department. This first group of evacuees from among  850 Russian citizens in Yemen had first been brought from Aden  (in southern Yemen) to Djibouti by sea.    The foreign ministry spokesman said the evacuation from the  northern part of the country will start tomorrow. A second  group of Russians will be taken from Sanaa to Al-Hudaydah (a Red  Sea port), where two Russian transport ships are already  standing in the roadsteads, and then they will be brought home  by sea. Expressing hopes that the evacuation of our  fellow-countrymen will be completed successfully, the foreign  ministry spokesman added that it is planned to send a further  aircraft to Yemen -- this time a passenger aircraft -- for a  final evacuation of people.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. : PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> Perhaps it was inevitable, but tensions on the increasingly congested local  roadways seem to be spilling over into a new arena: parking lots.  </P> <P> Score cards ready? Boxer Mike Tyson is accused of cuffing an attendant who  tried to prevent Tyson's party from docking in a reserved spot at a Hollywood  night club . . . two limousine drivers vying for the same spot at a Lucky  supermarket in Redondo Beach draw guns on each other . . . two Palos Verdes  Estates women are hauled off to jail after allegedly erasing the meter-maid's  chalk marks on their tires.  </P> <P> And now. . . .  </P> <P> Actor Clint Eastwood has been sued for $101,000 by a woman who says the actor  ruined her day by allegedly ramming her parked car with his used pickup truck  on the Burbank Studios lot. The plaintiff, Stacy McLaughlin, an executive with  an animation company, made the mistake of leaving her car in Eastwood's spot  while making a delivery. She also claims that the celluloid cowboy threatened  to break the car's windows with a hammer if it wasn't moved.  </P> <P> Eastwood, who is already a defendant in a palimony suit filed by actress Sondra  Locke, "is not available for comment," a spokesman said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The renaming of the Skyline Equestrian Trail in the San Gabriel Valley for  County Supervisor Pete Schabarum is a reminder of Schabarum's interest in  transit. He did, after all, unsuccessfully seek the secretary of transportation  post in President Bush's cabinet.  </P> <P> And the christening also follows the recent trend of naming geographical spots  for politicians while they're still alive -- and even still in office.  </P> <P> Such was not always the case. The fountain bearing the likeness of  early-century U.S. Sen. Frank Flint on the south lawn of City Hall was a  posthumous tribute. (The fountain has since been turned off after the body of a  transient was found floating there.) Fletcher Bowron Square, named in honor of  the Los Angeles' mayor from 1938 to 1953, was installed in the Los Angeles City  Mall years after Bowron's death.  </P> <P> But nowadays, more and more politicians are living to see their tributes. Mayor  Tom Bradley's name graces a terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. A  Century City businessman will soon have his name on a skyscraper: the Ronald  Reagan State Office Building. And the Century Freeway has been renamed for Rep.  Glenn M. Anderson (D-Harbor City), a nice honor if the freeway is ever  completed.  </P> <P> Who started the trend locally? It may have been San Pedro Assemblyman Vincent  Thomas, who consented to having a site -- the bridge connecting San Pedro and  Terminal Island -- named in his honor while he was still in office in the early  1960s. Ironically, Thomas was later defeated for reelection. And, now 25 years  after it was built, visitors sometimes confuse the span with a religious order  and call it the "St. Vincent Thomas Bridge."  </P> <P> If the streets around Sunset and Gower are more jammed up than usual on the  evening of May 17, the news figures to get out over the air waves quickly. KNX  radio is hosting a Traffic Tipsters Party at the station.  </P> <P> Why kick it off at 6 p.m., right in the middle of what KNX traffic reporter  Bill Keene calls the "rush-hour rodeo?" Make it more of a challenge for the  invitees?  </P> <P> "We thought of having it on a weekend," said Keene, "but the tipsters told us  they preferred a weekday evening because they didn't know if they'd be in town  on a weekend."  </P> <P> Invitations have been sent out to actors Chevy Chase and Angie Dickinson and  about 400 other car-phone commandos who have called in traffic bulletins  regularly for at least a year.  </P> <P> Keene isn't sure whether to invite another sometime KNX correspondent, Roman  Catholic Archbishop Roger Mahony. Mahony was invited last year but "sent us  back a very nice letter saying he was booked up solid," Keene said. "I'm not  sure this is the sort of thing he'd attend."  </P></p>

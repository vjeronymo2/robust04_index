			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Reynolds casts for Ulster peace catch: The tactics of Irish ministers may be a reminder of the nation's favourite sporting pastimes, but they have caused confusion among those who think the joint declaration is being undermined Viewed from London or Belfast, the Dublin government's recent efforts to bring Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, to the Northern Ireland negotiating table have on occasion appeared contradictory, confusing and - to unionist eyes at least - full of menace and duplicity. At one moment Irish ministers stood shoulder-to-shoulder with their British counterparts, insisting that there would be no concessions to Sinn Fein without a permanent IRA ceasefire. At the next they appeared to change tack. Having signed the Downing Street declaration in December, the Irish republic lifted its broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein in January and then made various direct and indirect communications to Sinn Fein to spell out its interpretation of the joint declaration. Dublin has insisted that no deadlines will be put on Sinn Fein's acceptance or rejection of the declaration. Last weekend, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said a temporary ceasefire by the IRA would be 'welcome'. So is Dublin undermining the joint declaration? Or is it that the Irish government's recent manoeuvrings are simply a translation into politics of two of the country's favourite pastimes - horse-racing and fly-fishing? Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, is a keen racegoer and has a reputation as a man prepared to take a gamble in politics. With the joint declaration he has in effect studied the form, checked the going, and placed his bet that Sinn Fein and the IRA will eventually renounce violence and enter the negotiating process. Meanwhile, with the skills and patience of a fly-fisherman, he has repeatedly cast his vision of Ireland's future past the suspicious eyes of the North's republicans. He changes the 'fly' to suit the latest shifts in wind or weather, but always with the same intention - to catch the biggest fish in the history of the Irish state, an end to the IRA's military campaign and the prize of peace in Northern Ireland. One prominent Northern Ireland politician said recently: 'Sinn Fein is like a salmon on a hook. It darts this way and that and puts up a tremendous struggle to escape. But if you play it in gently, you will eventually land it.' Dublin has made no secret of its view that any efforts to renew political talks in Northern Ireland are likely to founder without an end to the IRA military campaign. It has therefore spared no effort to explain to Sinn Fein's leaders both Dublin's and London's understanding of the joint declaration, and of the steps that will follow an end to violence. According to government officials, those contacts continue through intermediaries. One said: 'The Taoiseach (prime minister) speaks to someone who then speaks to someone.' Senior Irish government officials say in private that Mr Reynolds believes the British government could take similar steps to bring about an IRA ceasefire without entering into negotiations or making concessions. Dublin's latest cast is to emphasise that Sinn Fein does not have to accept the Downing Street declaration as such, but that a permanent end to the IRA military campaign would be sufficient to admit Sinn Fein to what is seen as the next phase of the peace process - the establishment of a Forum of Peace and Reconciliation in the republic. The forum was referred to in the joint declaration as a specifically Dublin initiative, bringing together the nationalist parties of north and south to work out a common platform from which to negotiate with the unionists and the British government. Other parties would subsequently be invited to attend. It is unrealistic in Dublin's view to impose a precondition on Sinn Fein to accept the declaration (other than the essential condition that the IRA abandon its military campaign) when it has already been declared moribund by the Ulster Unionist party and rejected out of hand by the Democratic Unionist party. In Northern Ireland it has been welcomed only by the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party and the moderate Alliance party. In a recent interview with a Belfast newspaper Mr Reynolds said: 'Let (the declaration) be a vehicle for a cessation of violence. If some people in the republican movement have problems with some of the words in it that's fine. That should not be a reason for staying away.' Mr Reynolds and Mr Spring have since insisted that a temporary ceasefire will not be sufficient to admit Sinn Fein to the talks process, especially as the IRA does not seem to be considering one. That particular 'fly' has been put away for the moment, it seems, but it should not come as a surprise if Dublin casts a few new ones across Northern Ireland's troubled waters in the weeks ahead, as it waits patiently for Sinn Fein to bite.</p>

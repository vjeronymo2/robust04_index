			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOP 10 NET $100+ MILLION OVER HOLIDAY;  </P> <P> BOX OFFICE: NO. 1 'HOME ALONE' TAKES IN $30 MILLION. 'LITTLE LADY' DEBUTS IN  SECOND PLACE AND 'ROCKY V' TAKES A TUMBLE.  </P> <P> Hollywood had much to be thankful for over the Thanksgiving holiday period. Led  by the startling second-week performance of 20th Century-Fox's family comedy,  "Home Alone" -- which had five-day receipts of an estimated $30 million -- the  top 10 films delivered $100-million plus to the coffers.  </P> <P> But if the news was good overall, the figures -- which represented ticket sales  for Wednesday through Sunday -- also reflected disappointing returns for  certain titles.  </P> <P> Most notably, MGM-UA's "Rocky V" -- which opened last weekend to $14 million  and second place -- tumbled 44% in its second weekend. With five-day receipts  of approximately $11.8 million, it ranked fifth for the holiday period.  </P> <P> And although Touchstone Pictures' "Three Men and a Little Lady" debuted with  earnings of about $19.2 million -- for second place -- some industry observers  wondered if a portion of its family-oriented audience hadn't been kidnapped by  "Home Alone."  </P> <P> Another just-out sequel, Fox's "Predator II" -- which this time finds the alien  killer on the prowl in Los Angeles -- came in third, with approximately $14.8  million.  </P> <P> Orion Pictures' western epic, "Dancing With Wolves" -- previously in limited  release -- widened to 1,048 screens for receipts of $12.6 million and fourth  place. That's an impressive figure, considering the film's three-hour running  time, which limits the number of daily screenings.  </P> <P> But the most impressive numbers went to "Home Alone," which jumped  approximately 27% in ticket sales in its second weekend. Its per-screen average  also shot up from $14,211 in its opening weekend to approximately $17,000.  After just two weeks, the $15-million comedy about an 8-year-old (played by  Macaulay Culkin) who is inadvertently left on his own during the Christmas  holidays, has earned more than $45 million. Its surprise performance had Fox  executives crowing, and executives at competing studios acknowledging a lively  marketing campaign led by a show-stopping trailer. Also applauded was Fox's  decision to open the film ahead of much of the holiday pack -- especially  "Three Men and a Little Lady," which vies for some of the same audience.  </P> <P> As for those films which rounded out the top 10, they are, in estimated  figures: "The Rescuers Down Under" (Disney), $5.2 million, sixth place; "Ghost"  (Paramount Pictures), $4.5 million, seventh; "Child's Play II" (Universal  Pictures), $4.3 million, eighth; "Jacob's Ladder" (Tri-Star Pictures), $2.8  million, ninth; "White Palace" (Universal), $1.7 million, 10th.  </P></p>

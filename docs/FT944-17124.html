			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / International Company News: Banco Napoli rating reviewed IBCA, the European credit-rating agency, has put Banco di Napoli's rating 'under observation' pending further examination of the Italian bank's disappointing half-year figures. Last week, Banco di Napoli's shares fell 11 per cent after the bank - one of Italy's largest and oldest financial institutions - announced a heavy first-half deficit, caused by losses on its investment portfolio and provisions against bad loans. But Mr Luigi Coccioli, the bank chairman since May, has hit back at the negative comments on the bank's results, arguing that investors, and rating agencies, should be looking at the group's prospects rather than its recent difficulties. 'We've already seen good signs of recovery, in terms of loans, in terms of revenue for the bank, which will certainly lead, in my opinion, to a far better situation by the end of the year,' he said on Friday, after IBCA announced its decision. In the next few days, Mr Coccioli is expected to meet Mr Gustavo Minervini, chairman of the foundation which controls Banco di Napoli, for an informal discussion of the first-half results, which were published on September 30. Banco di Napoli lost L168.8bn (Dollars 108.48m) before tax in the first six months of 1994, compared with a pre-tax profit of L162.2bn in the same period last year. The bank made provisions of L235bn against bad loans, mostly to small and medium-sized enterprises in southern Italy, where some 600 of its 800 branches are located. News of the loss was published after the close of trading on September 30, but prompted a 14 per cent decline in the bank's share price in the first four days of last week. By Friday, Mr Coccioli's efforts to reassure investors appeared to be paying off and the shares recovered by L50 to L1,496, in spite of a heavily depressed market and the IBCA announcement. Mr Maurizio Morolli, one of IBCA's Italian analysts, said: 'This loss came as a surprise. We think it may well be due to cleaning up of a bad loans, but we are waiting to examine the results.' Mr Coccioli said Banco di Napoli's experience with bad loans and the unfavourable environment for securities trading was no different from that of other Italian banks. Indeed, the bank has pointed out that its ratio of doubtful loans to overall loan commitments is lower than the national Italian average. Italian banks are suffering from the hangover of a deep recession, even as other Italian companies are showing signs of recovery. Earlier last month, Banca Popolare di Milano announced poor first-half results, which it blamed on past over-exposure to heavily indebted Italian industrial groups, such as Ferruzzi. Banco di Napoli's IBCA credit rating is A1 for short-term loans and A+ for long-term loans. That compares with Italy's highest-rated financial institutions, IMI and Cariplo, which have an AA rating for long-term loans and a rating of A1+ for short-term loans.</p>

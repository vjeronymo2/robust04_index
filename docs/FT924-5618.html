			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / US growth may alter Clinton's strategy US PRESIDENT-elect Bill Clinton may change his plans for an immediate growth package as a result of yesterday's revised growth figures, which show that the US economy expanded by 3.9 per cent in the third quarter. The revision upwards from 2.7 per cent, announced by the Commerce Department, makes it the strongest quarter of Mr Bush's presidency. The economy last reached this growth rate in the final three months of Mr Ronald Reagan's administration. Mr Clinton said the data would not alter his long-term plans for the economy, but 'could have some impact on short-term judgment'. 'It could be that we are finally seeing the impact of lower interest rates,' he said. Mr Bush has spent much of the past year insisting that the economy really had emerged from recession. His fellow Republicans, and several economists, believe that his successor will inherit a strong recovery of Mr Bush's making. But Mr Clinton may now be trapped by the expectation that he will announce a package totalling Dollars 20bn-Dollars 50bn (Pounds 13bn-Pounds 33bn) as soon as he takes office on January 20. If the economy is already growing strongly under its own steam, stimulus may no longer be needed and could prove counterproductive by worrying financial markets about the prospect of bigger deficits and higher inflation. When the Commerce Department initially estimated GDP growth at 2.7 per cent just a week before the presidential election, some suggested the number had been inflated to benefit Mr Bush. Mrs Barbara Hackman Franklin, the commerce secretary, said yesterday's upward revision 'should serve as a vindication of the integrity of both the process and the professionals involved'. Commerce Department economists said estimates of exports, business inventories and personal consumption were all revised upwards. The GDP data have been reinforced by other economic statistics showing a recovery, including higher orders for durable goods, more home sales and stronger consumer confidence. Home sales, reported yesterday, rose by 9.1 per cent in October, their highest level for four years. Earlier this week the Conference Board, a New York-based business group, said its consumer confidence index rose 11 points in November. Mr Lyle Gramley, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington, cautioned that the recovery was still at risk because of the fragile economies of many of the US's most important export markets, and the lack of improvement in employment, which is critical to public confidence.

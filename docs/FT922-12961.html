			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Sudan continuing to use torture, says Amnesty THE Sudanese government is torturing and detaining opponents without trial despite a 1991 claim that it was releasing all political prisoners, the human rights organisation Amnesty International said yesterday, Reuter reports from London. 'Torture, brutal beatings and short-term detention in secret detention centres. . . are the Sudan government's standard reaction to dissent,' Amnesty said in a news release. The government of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir came to power in a military coup in June 1989 and announced a general amnesty for all political prisoners in April 1991. Nearly 300 prisoners were released, but Amnesty said more than 60 remained in detention without trial. Others were rearrested shortly afterwards. More dissidents had since been imprisoned without fair trials, Amnesty said. The Sudanese government has branded critics of its human rights record as 'colonialists'.</p>

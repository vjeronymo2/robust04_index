The proposed rule would: Delete the definition of ``Controlled area'' to make it clear that any area to which access is restricted for the purpose of radiological protection is a restricted area as defined in the regulation, revise the definition of ``Occupational dose'' to delete reference to the ``Restricted area,'' revise the definition of unrestricted area to be consistent with the deletion of controlled area, revise the provision entitled ``Instruction to Workers,'' so that radiation protection training will be provided to all persons with the potential to be occupationally exposed and restore a provision to provide that whenever licensees are required to report exposures of individual members of the public to the NRC, then those individuals are to receive copies of the report.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comment period expires April 4, 1994.

Compliance became mandatory for all licensees on January 1, 1994. Extensive discussion regarding interpretation and implementation of the new rules has ensued both within the NRC and Agreement State staffs and with licensees and other interested parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised standards include a definition for the term ``Controlled area.'' The term is defined to be an area outside of a restricted area, but inside the site boundary access to which can be limited for any reason (10 CFR 20.1003). The term ``Restricted area'' was retained in the revised standards from the original regulation, 10 CFR part 20, and is defined as an area, ``access to which is limited by the licensees for the purpose of protecting individuals against undue risks from exposure to radiation or radioactive materials *&blank;*&blank;* (10 CFR 20.1003).'' Neither the revised standards themselves, nor the supplemental information provide a basis for deciding whether to designate a given area as a ``Restricted area'' or a ``Controlled area.'' In discussions with licensees and Agreement States, the absence of such a clear delineation appears to be the cause of considerable uncertainty among a number of licensees regarding how to implement the revised standards in this regard. The NRC believes that this situation can be alleviated by eliminating the term ``Controlled area'' from the regulations. This change has the effect of returning the regulation to the former situation in which areas are either restricted or unrestricted for purposes of radiation protection. As has always been the case, licensees continue to have the option of controlling access to areas for reasons other than radiation protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of ``Unrestricted area'' in the revised standard acknowledges the existence of controlled areas and currently is defined as an area ``access to which is neither limited nor controlled by the licensee'' (10 CFR 20.1003). Deletion of the term ``Controlled area'' permits return to the former situation in which areas are either restricted or unrestricted for radiation protection purposes, and the Commission now proposes to revise the definition of ``Unrestricted area'' to make this clear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposal, licensees would continue to have the option to control access for reasons other than radiation protection. As before, the definitions of ``restricted area'' and of ``unrestricted area'' do not preclude the existence of areas in which access is limited for purposes other than protecting individuals against undue risks from exposure to radiation and/or radioactive materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

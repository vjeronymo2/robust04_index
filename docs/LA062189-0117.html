			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL TRADING VOLATILE, PRICES END MIXED  </P> <P> Oil prices ended mixed in volatile trading Tuesday on the New York Mercantile  Exchange as traders squared their positions on the last day of trading in July  contracts.  </P> <P> West Texas Intermediate -- the benchmark U.S. crude -- sank $1.33 to $19.53 a  barrel for July delivery, compared to Monday's close of $20.86 a barrel.  Gasoline rose, but home-heating oil declined.  </P> <P> On the U.S. Gulf Coast spot market, where oil is sold to the highest bidder,  West Texas Intermediate rose 55 cents to $20.65 a barrel.  </P> <P> Analysts said WTI prices skidded on the Merc as market participants scrambled  to honor delivery commitments for expiring July contracts and to switch their  interests into later contract months.  </P> <P> "We saw some active liquidation of the July contract," said Steve Platt, senior  energy analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.  </P> <P> Analysts said trading volume was light to moderate and WTI fluctuated in price  by more than $2.25 a barrel during the session.  </P> <P> Platt said crude prices for later months also slipped because traders decided  that despite the potential for a supply squeeze that buoyed WTI crude prices  last week, other crudes would be available to take up the slack.  </P></p>

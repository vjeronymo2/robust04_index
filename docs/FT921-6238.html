			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / FT Law Report: Tax avoidance scheme is effective FITZWILLIAM (COUNTESS) AND OTHERS v INLAND REVENUE COMMISSIONERS Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Nourse, Lord Justice Staughton and Sir Christopher Slade): February 19 1992 STEPS TAKEN in a scheme to avoid capital transfer tax are not preordained and do not constitute a single composite transaction so as to defeat their object if there is a real possibility that the scheme may not go through in that, before entering on one of the steps, a participant seeks separate legal advice which may result in her putting forward fresh proposals. The Court of Appeal so held when dismissing an appeal by the Inland Revenue from Mr Justice Vinelott's judgment quashing their decision that, by application of the Ramsay principle, capital transfer tax (CTT) was payable by virtue of a series of transactions affecting the estate of the 10th and last Earl Fitzwilliam, who died in 1979. LORD JUSTICE NOURSE said that by his will the trustees of the Earl's residuary estate had power for 23 months after his death to appoint capital or income in favour of beneficiaries including his widow, Lady Fitzwilliam, and her daughter, Lady Hastings. At the end of 23 months the trustees were directed to pay the income to Lady Fitzwilliam during her life, with power to pay capital at their discretion, with an ultimate trust in favour of Lady Hastings. The 10th Earl died on September 23 1979 aged 75. Lady Fitzwilliam was 81. The net value of the estate was just over Pounds 12.4m. If Lady Fitzwilliam died within 23 months the whole of the residuary estate would attract 75 per cent CTT on the Earl's death. If she took an interest in possession, duty would be payable on her death and would not be significantly less than 75 per cent. The trustees instructed their solicitors, Currey &amp; Co, to explore all possible ways of avoiding the prospective liability. Five successive steps were ultimately taken: Step 1 - On December 20 1979 the trustees appointed that Pounds 4m be held in trust for Lady Fitzwilliam absolutely. Step 2 - On January 7 1980 Lady Fitzwilliam drew a cheque for Pounds 2m, post-dated January 9, in favour of Lady Hastings. The Pounds 2m was raised by loan appropriated to Lady Fitzwilliam's Pounds 4m appointment. The cheque, and a letter signed by Lady Fitzwilliam stating that the Pounds 2m was a gift free of CTT, were handed to Lady Hastings by Currey on January 9. Step 3 - On January 14 the trustees appointed that Pounds 3.8m be held upon trust to pay the income to Lady Fitzwilliam until the earlier of February 15 1980 or her death; subject to one moiety in trust for Lady Hastings absolutely and the other in trust for Lady Hastings contingently on her being alive at date of determination of the income interest. Step 4 - On January 31 Lady Fitzwilliam, in consideration of Pounds 2m, assigned Lady Hastings her interest in the income of the contingent moiety. Step 5 - On February 5 Lady Hastings settled Pounds 1,000 on trust to pay the income thereof to Lady Fitzwilliam until her death or March 15 1980, and subject thereto, on trust as to both capital and income for Lady Hastings absolutely. On February 7 Lady Hastings assigned her reversionary interest in the vested moiety to the trustees to be held by them as an addition to her settlement. If Mr Justice Vinelott's decision stood, CTT at a very high rate on assets worth Pounds 7.8m would have been avoided. The Ramsay principle was drawn from the House of Lords decisions in Ramsay (1982) AC 300, Burmah Oil (1982) STC 30, Furniss v Dawson (1984) AC 474 and Craven v White (1989) AC 398. In Furniss v Dawson (1984) AC, Lord Brightman said: 'There must be a preordained series of transactions; or . . . one single composite transaction.' The taxpayers' primary argument was that the steps were not preordained and did not make up a single composite transaction. In Craven v White Lord Keith said that in ascertaining the legal effect of the series of transactions, it was relevant to take into account that 'all the steps in it were contractually agreed in advance or had been determined on in advance by a guiding will'. Lord Oliver said the concept of a 'single indivisible composite whole' might be summed up by asking whether at the material time the whole was already 'cut and dried'. He said one essential was that when the inserted step was entered into there should be 'no practical likelihood' that the pre-planned events would not take place. Lord Jauncey suggested 'no real likelihood' as the appropriate test. For many years prior to the Earl's death the partner in Currey who had looked after his family affairs was Mr D G Bosanquet, assisted since 1970 by his partner, Mr N R D Powell. By the time of the Earl's death Mr Powell had taken over responsibility for his affairs generally. He was solely responsible for all tax planning aspects. Mr Bosanquet continued to look after Lady Fitzwilliam. From October 18 1979 Mr Powell instructed junior counsel, Mr Robert Walker. On about January 14 1980 another partner, Mr N W Smith, agreed to advise Lady Hastings. On January 18 Mr Smith instructed Mr Mark Herbert of counsel to advise Lady Hastings. The Commissioners concluded that the five steps taken to implement the CTT avoidance scheme satisfied the Ramsay conditions. That could only be supported if participation of both Lady Fitzwilliam and Lady Hastings was at the material time 'cut and dried'; or if they were, in Mr Justice Vinelott's words, 'mere actors in a play reading a prepared script'. The Commissioners found that Lady Fitzwilliam gave Currey carte blanche to make all necessary tax arrangements. They said that Lady Hastings, unlike her mother, had no difficulty understanding the advice given. On one matter she took an active part in a discussion with Mr Smith on January 22 and expressed some views of her own. The Commissioners' findings demonstrated that Lady Hastings had both an understanding and a will of her own. The inference that her participation was on January 14 cut and dried, or that it was insupportable that she was a mere actor in a play reading a prepared script. It was enough for the taxpayers' purposes that the inference should be rejected in the case of Lady Hastings alone. The Crown argued that there was a preordained scheme as from January 3 when Mr Walker dictated the necessary steps and a timetable for them over the telephone to Mr Powell. In the very breath in which he had dictated the steps and the timetable, counsel had suggested that serious consideration be given to Lady Hastings being advised by another partner and possibly by separate counsel. That suggestion was followed within the fortnight. Different proposals might have been put forward on her side. None of the tests for preordainment expressed in Craven v White was satisfied. There was no 'guiding will'. Lady Hastings's participation was not 'cut and dried'. It could not have been said that there was no 'practical' or 'real' likelihood that the scheme would not be completed. The Commissioners found that Mr Powell's intention to implement the scheme at each step must be attributed to Lady Hastings. Mr Powell's 'intention' to implement the scheme was qualified by the suggestion, apparently acted on by January 14, that Lady Hastings should receive separate advice, and by a consequential recognition of a real possibility that the scheme proposed would not go through. Such a qualification was fatal to application of the Ramsay principle. Accordingly, on January 14, when step 3 was taken, it was not preordained that Lady Hastings would participate in steps 4 and 5. Even as a single composite transaction none of the steps would have produced the fiscal results for which the Crown contended. The CTT legislation did not apply to any of the composite transactions contended for by the Crown. The appeal was dismissed. Their Lordships gave concurring judgments. For the taxpayers: Robert Walker QC and Mark Herbert (Currey &amp; Co). For the Crown: Robert Reid QC and Christopher McCall QC (Inland Revenue solicitor).</p>

He said  mainland-funded companies were partly to blame for speculation  in the property market. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office's think-tank would soon look into the problem and study  ways of maintaining the territory's economic dynamism, said Mr  Lu.    Speaking to a group of Hong Kong deputies to the Chinese  People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at a  closed-door session, Mr Lu said main land-funded firms would be  stopped from participating in property speculation. He was  quoted as saying "quite a number" of mainland-funded firms in  the territory had been speculating and insisted that was not  good for Hong Kong. Mr Lu said it was unfair to other investors  because mainland-funded companies were using state funds to make  profits. "They can push up the prices of property without  having to bear any responsibility," he said.    In a separate meeting with a group of Hong Kong deputies to  the National People's Congress, Mr Lu said the level of property  prices had gone beyond what ordinary residents could bear.  "Many people cannot afford to buy their own flats. This is a  big problem. It hinges upon people's livelihood. It hinges on  whether Hong Kong will be able to maintain its status as an  international financial centre."    He said what had made Hong Kong tick over the past decades  was its low production costs, luring foreign investors. It was  reported yesterday the international firm, Unisys, is to shift  its regional centre from Hong Kong to Singapore because of high  costs in the territory. "This is a big problem," he said.    Mr Lu conceded there were various factors behind the surge  in  property prices. But he said the Government had the  responsibility to solve the problem. "If the problem remains  unresolved, it will affect the post-1997 government and create a  major burden on it."    Mr Lu said the PWC's economic sub-group would soon form a  team to study the property market. "We will give suggestions to  the British side. It's a matter for them as to whether to  accept it. We will also listen to people from all walks of life  on effective ways to deal with the problem. We will do as much  as we can."    A Hong Kong deputy to the CPPCC, Ho Sai-chu accused some  property developers of hoarding land in order to seek more  profits. Mr Ho, a construction company boss, said although  36,000 flats had been completed last year, only about 28,000 had  been put on the market.</p>

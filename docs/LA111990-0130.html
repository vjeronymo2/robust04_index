			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TALK-LINE GIRDS FOR 10TH YEAR OF TALKING TURKEY  </P> <P> It's time to talk turkey again.  </P> <P> The Butterball Turkey Talk-Line is back in business for its 10th year of  answering sometimes wacky questions with serious advice.  </P> <P> In 10 years, the experts who answer 1-(800)-323-4848 have heard just about  every question and disaster that can befall the preparation of that  Thanksgiving turkey.  </P> <P> Some questions are simple: "How do I turn my oven on?" a caller from Lawrence,  Kan., asked.  </P> <P> Some are odd: "Do you baste under the turkey's armpit?" a fledgling cook from  Mankato, Minn., wanted to know.  </P> <P> Judging by some questions, some cooks might have been better off if they had  not figured out how to turn that oven on.  </P> <P> A Baltimore woman said no one told her to remove the plastic wrap before  cooking the bird. A newlywed from Quincy, Mass., prepared the bird for the oven  by washing it -- with soap. A Philadelphia woman called to ask about the rubber  glove she left inside the turkey.  </P> <P> "I called my mother and asked her how to fix a turkey," an Indiana cook said,  "and she told me to call the Butterball Turkey Talk-Line."  </P> <P> Talk-Line staffers still chuckle about the Egg Harbor City, N.J., secretary who  apparently didn't think much of her boss's culinary ability and left a message  for him to return a call to the Talk-Line.  </P> <P> Last year, the most-asked question was how to roast the bird. Answer: Use the  conventional open pan method, with the uncovered turkey oiled and sitting on a  rack in a 325-degree oven.  </P> <P> Other inquiries included how best to thaw a frozen turkey, how to stuff it and  what to do with leftovers.  </P></p>

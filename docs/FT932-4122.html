			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Initial rally on futures-related buying is lost Wall Street AFTER posting early gains on futures-related computer program buying, US share prices slipped back yesterday afternoon to end little changed, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 1.39 at 3,511.93, almost 20 points below its high for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.07 ahead at 445.78, while the Nasdaq composite gained 1.50 at 689.24. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 249m shares. Traders said stocks opened firmer partly because the declines incurred at the start of the week had left prices low enough to attract sporadic buying interest from investors. Some program buying related to movements on the futures market also lifted stocks, as did reports that President Bill Clinton is willing to try alternatives to his proposed, but much criticised, energy tax. The early gains, however, did not take hold, and prices retreated steadily in the afternoon amid selling of selected blue chip stocks. Throughout, investors remained nervous ahead of forthcoming inflation data. The May producer prices index will be released tomorrow, followed by the consumer prices data early next week. The figures should provide a clear picture of inflation, and determine whether the Federal Reserve will have to lift interest rates to slow the pace of future price rises. Leading technology stocks were in mixed form. Compaq fell Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 53 3/4 after two broking houses, Prudential Securities and Cowen &amp; Co, lowered their ratings on the stock in the wake of its recent strong performance. The shares were also undermined by newspaper reports that Compaq senior executives have been heavy sellers of their company's stock in recent months. Although the downgrade seemed to hit some other computer stocks - Motorola lost Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 82 and Unisys eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 11 5/8 - the rest of the sector was in surprisingly good form, with IBM adding Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 53, Hewlett-Packard rising Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 86 1/4 and Digital Equipment gaining Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 43 1/8 . A disappointing earnings projection from Apple Computer, traded on the Nasdaq market, also buffeted the sector. Apple, which said it expected earnings for the second half of the year to be below comparable results for 1992, dropped Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 44 1/4 in volume of 10.5m shares. Poor second-quarter earnings and continued weakness in plywood prices undermined Georgia-Pacific, which declined Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 59 3/8 in busy trading. Canada TORONTO stocks pared earlier losses to leave the market only marginally lower on balance, with a recovery in bank shares offsetting weak precious metals issues. The TSE 300 index lost a net 3.0 at a closing 3,859.7, while declines outnumbered advances by 436 to 295 after volume of 57.1m shares valued at CDollars 509.1m. Eight of the 14 sub-group indices ended lower, led by the golds group, off 1.6 per cent. The price of gold in New York fell USDollars 2.65 to USDollars 371.35 an ounce. Financial services showed a gain of 1.0 per cent.</p>

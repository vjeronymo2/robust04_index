			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / International Company News: Capital Cities/ABC falls 34.5% A SIGNIFICANT drop in operating earnings from the ABC Television Network contributed to a 34.5 per cent decline in fourth-quarter 1991 net profits at Capital Cities/ABC, the US television and newspapers group. Profits were Dollars 103.2m, or Dollars 6.17 a share, on revenues 1 per cent higher at Dollars 1.56bn. Operating income in the quarter fell to Dollars 260.2m from Dollars 297.4m in the same period of 1990. Mr Daniel Burke, chief executive, said the company's advertiser-supported businesses continue to be affected by the recession. Net revenues for ABC and other television operations declined in the quarter, while ABC's drop in operating income was described as 'substantial.' The fourth-quarter net would have been Dollars 31.2m but for charges related to the redemption of subordinated debentures. The net, however, would have still been 14.7 per cent lower. For the whole of 1991, net income fell by 28.1 per cent to Dollars 343.5m, or Dollars 20.47 a share, and group revenues were down marginally at Dollars 5.38bn. Operating income for 1991 was Dollars 761.2m, down from Dollars 923.2m in 1990. McGraw-Hill, the US publishing and information services group that owns Business Week magazine, yesterday reported a 14.2 per cent decline in 1991 full-year net income to Dollars 148m, or Dollars 3.03 a share, on unchanged revenues of Dollars 1.9bn. For the last quarter, net profit fell by 11.8 per cent to Dollars 45.4m, or 93 cents, on revenues 1.8 per cent up at Dollars 568.1m.</p>

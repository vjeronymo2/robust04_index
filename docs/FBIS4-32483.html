			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Declaration of the Union of Democratic Forces National </F> Assembly Faction: "This Form of Boycott Helps the Bulgarian  Socialist Party"; adopted at 22 June meeting of the Assembly  faction]    [Text] On 22 June 1994 the parliamentary faction of the  Union of Democratic Forces [SDS] discussed the parliamentary  boycott and decided:    1. Article 3 of the Decisions of the Sixth SDS National  Conference points out specific extraparliamentary actions,  including a parliamentary boycott, which, against the background  of the governmental crisis that existed then, were expected to  lead to toppling the cabinet and the holding of early  parliamentary elections.    2. This decision was not fully implemented. Only the  decision on the SDS parliamentary faction walking out of the  National Assembly sessions was adopted and implemented.    3. In this manner, the parliamentary boycott, which was not  supported by the extraparliamentary actions, did not prompt the  fall of the government and the holding of early parliamentary  elections.    4. This form of boycott did not block, but rather  facilitated the work of the parliamentary majority of the  Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], which aims at recommunization,  and contradicts the interests of the country.    5. The specific form of the boycott that was adopted --  selectively participating in or walking out of the National  Assembly sessions -- jeopardizes the authority of the SDS as a  serious political force in and outside the country. The  parliamentary faction's work has been disorganized and  deactivated. Thus, the manner in which this specific political  action is being effected rather serves than hurts the interests  of the BSP.    Therefore, for the aforementioned reasons, the SDS  parliamentary faction decides as follows:    It insists that the SDS National Coordinating Council  analyze  the implementation of Article 3 of the Decisions of the Sixth  SDS National Conference and the results of the currently  implemented form of parliamentary boycott, and express its  opinion whether the recommendation of the aforementioned  decisions has been implemented, and whether the boycott produced  results that prompt early parliamentary elections.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Observer: Big divisions So where does The Weir Group, Scotland's most successful engineering company, stand in the battle for survival at Britain's naval dockyards? After all, the campaign to secure the navy's Trident submarine work at Rosyth has become a national crusade in Scotland. However, Glasgow's Weir Group has its feet firmly in the Sassenach camp. It owns 30 per cent of Devonport Management (DML). 'This certainly looks like an anomalous position for a Scottish company,' says the third Viscount Weir, chairman, 'but then Babcock, which owns 75 per cent of Rosyth, is English. So it's all square. The issue is the future of the Royal Navy which is neither Scottish nor English but British. So it's a British problem.' Despite such courageous talk Lord Weir was outnumbered 17 to one by pro-Rosyth peers when the House of Lords debated the issue this month. But the main point is that, contrary to popular belief, the Scottish establishment is almost always divided on big issues. It was split over Guinness's takeover of Distillers, and over Elders IXL's unsuccessful bid for Scottish &amp; Newcastle. And there were Scottish troops on both sides at the battle of Culloden in 1745.</p>

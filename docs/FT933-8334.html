			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Italy joins in evacuation of wounded from Sarajevo Italy yesterday became the latest country to join the highly publicised international scramble to evacuate the wounded victims of Sarajevo when it offered to provide 454 hospital beds for seriously injured patients - the largest offer to date, writes Gillian Tett. But as the diplomatic wrangling continued over the airlifts, which some UN officials have criticised as a publicity stunt, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees indicated that it now had more offers of beds than it had patients awaiting evacuation. More than 700 beds have now been offered by a dozen governments in recent days.</p>

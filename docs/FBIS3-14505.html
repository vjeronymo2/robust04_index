			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A statement by the Islamic Society Movement, Hamas,  said that a delegation of the movement, headed by Mr. Mahfoud  Nahnah, was received yesterday by Mr. Lamine Zeroual, head of  state.    The statement of Hamas considered the meeting as a  preparation for future practical meetings. It also said that  the meeting was characterized with frankness.    The statement added that the delegation reached an agreement  that the aim of the transitional period was to return to the  election stage, and that the dialogue would continue and would  include the leadership of the dissolved FIS [Islamic Salvation  Front] within the framework of respecting the constitution and  renouncing violence.    This was the statement of Hamas.    However, sources close to the presidency pointed out that  the  text of the statement in the part related to the participation  of the dissolved FIS in the current national dialogue was  nothing more than an interpretation -- used for political aims  -- of the message conveyed by Lamine Zeroual to the various  personalities he received until now.    As far as the dialogue was concerned, the source close to  the  presidency recalled, it would take place within the framework of  the statement issued on 18 March.</p>

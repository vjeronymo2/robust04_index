			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Time ticks away for Air France reprieve - The French carrier must bite the reform bullet by 1996 A rescue, or a temporary reprieve? That is the question confronting Air France after Wednesday's approval of a controversial FFr20bn (Dollars 3.6bn) capital injection for the ailing airline from its state shareholder. The conditions attached to approval of state aid were numerous, but were largely anticipated and scarcely aggressive, prompting strong condemnation from several of the French carrier's rivals. For Air France it is unclear whether the additional finance will underpin recovery or whether it will represent just the latest, and by far the biggest, sacrifice of funds in the airline's history of decline. The answer will depend on whether the French national carrier finally bites the bullet of reform and addresses the strategic and management weaknesses behind losses that reached FFr8.48bn last year. This is half the deficit of the world's leading airlines. 'They have to restructure, and quickly,' says Mr Guy Kekwick, analyst at Lehman Brothers in London. 'They are in a serious financial situation, and without the kind of reforms that other airlines have undertaken, they will struggle to survive the next downturn in the market.' The first FFr10bn tranche of state aid will ease the airline's immediate financial pressures. The cost of financing its debts of more than FFr35bn resulted in financial charges of FFr3.51bn last year, while negative cashflow has forced the company to borrow to fund such basic requirements as fuel. However, under the terms of the Commission's approval for the capital increase, the next two tranches of funds, due in 1995 and 1996, will only be permitted if Air France delivers on a three-year cost-cutting and restructuring plan, drawn up by Mr Christian Blanc, the chairman. In addition it must maintain its pledge to reduce its fleet and dispose of assets, such as the Meridien hotels chain. Previous restructuring at Air France has failed miserably, often due to the resistance of the airline's 14 trade unions. Last October, strikes forced a humiliating climbdown by the French government and the scrapping of a recovery plan drawn up by Mr Bernard Attali, who resigned as chairman in protest. So far, Mr Blanc has made progress in implementing his reforms. An audacious referendum of the airline's staff in April won him approval for a framework restructuring package, allowing him to introduce a wage freeze and to start cutting the workforce through voluntary redundancies. Air France says the target of 2,100 job cuts this year, from a total workforce of 39,600 at the beginning of January, should be achieved. There is a long way to go to Mr Blanc's objective of a 30 per cent productivity increase over the next two years. Moreover, most industry analysts believe the plan, scarcely more ambitious than that drawn up by Mr Attali, is at best the minimum required for Air France's survival. Mr Blanc is negotiating with unions concerning the reorganisation of working practices. Changes in working hours, rotas and management structures are vital if the productivity improvements demanded by Brussels are to be obtained by the end of 1996. But some unions, including the pilots' union, are opposed to the proposed productivity measures. On the revenue side, Air France is benefiting from a rebound in passenger traffic and an increased load factor, which averaged 72.5 per cent in the first five months, against about 64 per cent in the same period last year. However, the airline's wings are being clipped by the Commission's demand that it restrict traffic growth to 2.7 per cent per year. 'This will be a constraint,' says one airline analyst. 'But the priority for the airline is to increase the revenues per passenger rather than the number of passengers.' Air France has outlined plans to reduce its fleet from 166 aircraft to 149 within five years and to cut some non-profitable routes. A thorny problem could be a transformation of Air France's relations with Air Inter, its domestic subsidiary. The European Commission has demanded the capital increase should go only to Air France. As a result, the French government is proposing the separation of the two airlines and the creation of an umbrella holding company. The legal separation of the domestic airline may bring complications - in particular, through an assertion of independence by the domestic airline, which feeds many of Air France's international routes through Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports in Paris and which is seeking greater access to European routes. The sensitivity of Air Inter's unions, anxious for a more equal relationship with Air France, was demonstrated yesterday. Some union leaders refused to attend a meeting with Mr Blanc to discuss the group's new structure, expressing concerns that Air Inter would be left to the mercy of increased liberalisation of the internal French airline market while Air France receives all of the state aid. The establishment of a new relationship with Air Inter is a complex task which will be difficult to resolve quickly. Unfortunately for Air France, time is firmly against it. After the controversy of the latest capital injection, and with Brussels adamant, this must be the last recourse to state funds, Air France must now, or never, learn to fly on its own.</p>

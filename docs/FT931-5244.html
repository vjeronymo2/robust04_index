			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Gardening: New light on England's lost Arcadia - Robin Lane Fox is intrigued by a painted clue to the gardening styles of yesteryear I HOPE that garden history never becomes more popular than gardening, but in the cold of the recent winds, I can understand why it might. If so, it will still confront questions of scope and accuracy, one of which confronted me at a recent exhibition of garden history, called An English Arcadia: 1600-1900. This well-chosen exhibition took its final call in Bristol in the west of England last week after five successful months in London and the US. Its main aim was to raise funds and interest for the continuing restoration of the garden buildings at Stowe in Buckinghamshire. The National Trust is leading a campaign and nobody could quarrel with this undertaking, because Stowe was at the centre of English landscape gardening during the 18th century. Stowe, therefore, was in the forefront of my mind at the Bristol Art Gallery, but a related problem soon dislodged it. It is all very well to look at designs for grand fountains, grandiose arches and enormous avenues, but what about the history of smaller gardens, owned by people who led the commercial 'flower culture,' a characteristic of England since the early modern period? What was happening in lesser gardens with flowers while Vanbrugh and Brown were designing schemes which were far too grand for flowerbeds or ordinary mortals? So often, histories of gardening become histories of parks and grand architecture with a separate list of contemporary flowers. Where are the pictures of gardening as we now know it, apart from the handbooks and nurserymen's lists which prove that it existed? The answer seemed to be that the sources are very few. Nearly 20 years ago, they were vastly increased by a fascinating group of views of small mid-Georgian gardens in an old portfolio, found and identified by chance. The pictures were designed by an able draughtsman, Thomas Robins, and they showed the Georgian 'nouveaux' and 'nouvelles' sitting in gardens with frilly white furniture, spotty planting and that eternal status-symbol, a conifer. What happened next or elsewhere, I often wonder, outside the background to Jane Austen's novels? Few gardeners could afford the Grand Tour or were able to obliterate entire villages and rivers: what about the family in a bijou town house or the man with a modest garden? On to the main show of Grand Arcadia: the Bristol Gallery had added some local extras, one group of which made me stop in my tracks. Six small watercolours show exact details of a town garden at 14, St James Square, Bristol. Nowadays, the square has since vanished, but around 1810 there were flowerpots, irregular flowerbeds, a summer house of Georgian elegance, a long gravel walk and a staff of at least two in breeches. The picture above also illustrates the compost heap, sensibly placed against a house with a chimney for sterilising the soil. The Bristol Gallery acquired these paintings in 1976. As they are watercolours, they are not exhibited regularly and still look as if they come straight from their artist's possession. They are an invitation to wonder who lived at number 14 and drew this precise selection of snapshots, showing a keen gardener's work in less than an acre. Instinctively, I thought of a correspondent of Gilbert White, the naturalist of Selborne. The Gallery's date of 'circa 1805' would be slightly too late, but the man combined efficiency, observation and an air of experiment which suggested a practical eye. It is hard to be sure, but some of the flowers in his many flowerpots looked decidedly trendy, half-hardy exotics from temperate climates: agaves were in evidence and the man kept a hothouse. In 1979, the pictures were noted in Connoisseur by the art historian Kate Eustace. Intriguingly, she referred them to a date around 1805 and to a family called Pole, because they had been kept with a signed silhouette by one T. Pole. She doubted if the T. Pole was himself the artist, although local returns show that he resided in St James Square, in Bristol, from 1802 onwards, albeit not certainly at number 14. In one of the six paintings, a lady is shown at a desk, inside a Georgian window whose view runs the length of the garden's walled walk: was this lady, perhaps, the artist of the sketches? It all sounds intriguing, but I think that we can be more precise. Thomas Pole is an important figure. His father had emigrated from the Exmoor village of Wiveliscombe to New Jersey and his son was a man of science who specialised in medical anatomy, especially of the female, and became a member of the American Philosophical Society. He returned to England, qualified as an MD and was known for his handbooks on anatomy, illustrated by his own sketches. Furthermore, he was an active Quaker. In 1908, a brief biography for Pole was prepared: the author tells that on returning to England, Pole rode more than 6,600 miles on horseback to visit fellow Quakers and their Friends' Meetings. This religious zealot and accurate observer of anatomy was living in Bristol's Handson Square by 1802. He remained an active citizen, bubbling with goods works: one of the best was a school for poor adults who lacked education. His own speciality remained the female anatomy, which had evidently shown him some remarkable things. In 1792, he published his Anatomy of A Double Uterus and Vagina; ten years later, we should picture him in Bristol, sitting (I infer) in number 14 and looking at a single garden walk. My first instincts seem to be true. If this Pole owned the garden, he was indeed a scientific man, forerunner of the surgeons, doctors and dentists who are so keen on precise gardening and pruning nowadays. His career and talents connect with the garden's qualities, its meticulous neatness, its technology, its elegance and the collecting instinct which shows in the masses of flower pots from the hothouse. In 1908, his brief biographer remarked: 'Despite the strictness then prevalent in the Quaker Society of Friends, a love of art remained with him to the last and found expression in many watercolours, drawings of landscape and architecture and silhouettes.' The garden and pictures at Bristol, I suggest, are the work of this Quaker philanthropist. It was planted between his long rides on horseback, made for the sake of Quaker contacts. To record its appearance, Thomas Pole painted it exactly, plant by plant, view by view. The few figures in the watercolours are oddly proportioned and either elongated or reduced. Would an anatomist have made this mistake? Art historians have drawn the wrong conclusion: if you can draw parts and details you cannot therefore draw figures as a perfect whole. This failing does not tell against an attribution to Pole himself of our finest snapshots of a garden in the late Georgian period. In France, it would soon be the age of grand jardins anglais, of English parks and lakes in the manner of Capability Brown. In smaller townhouses, we now see, there were jardins anglais of a different quality, flower gardens where men with curious minds grew plants by the hundred for display and knowledge, where science and taste went hand in hand. Without these watercolours we would underestimate them: I propose this identification in the hope of future knowledge which some of you may have, and also as a postscript from a sort of Arcadia where I, too, can picture myself. Patricia Morison writes: Further to my article last week on city trees, changes in the legislation have made the penalties for infringing a Tree Preservation Order considerably more draconian, increasing the fine from Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 20,000. A Service of Thanksgiving for Arthur Hellyer MBE, former gardening correspondent of the Financial Times, who died on January 28 at the age of 90, will be held at the church of St Stephen with St John, Rochester Row, London SW1 on Monday March 22 at 2.30pm</p>

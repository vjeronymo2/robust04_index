			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / ICI may leave Millbank: Company plans to cut nearly half its headquarters staff IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, one of the UK's largest companies, plans to cut nearly half of its headquarters staff and may abandon its historic headquarters at Millbank near the Houses of Parliament. ICI employs about 450 people at Millbank and neighbouring Ergon House. Mr David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, which will become ICI's independent bioscience subsidiary, said his group would move out of Millbank, probably over the next 12 months and certainly within two years. His headquarters staff would number no more than 100 and possibly as few as 80. Zeneca's new headquarters would ideally be located within a mile of Millbank, he added. Speaking the day after ICI announced it would split in two, Mr Ronnie Hampel, deputy chairman and future chief executive of the new ICI, said the number of staff at his new headquarters would be between 100 and 200. During a staff meeting yesterday Mr Hampel raised the issue of selling the historic building, although he said it would not raise as much as it should because of the state of the property market. Other options raised by Mr Hampel include moving staff now based elsewhere into Millbank or renting out some floors to outside companies. ICI shares rose 55p to Pounds 12.08. BhS, part of the Storehouse retail group, is cutting 800 full-time and 2,300 Saturday jobs, but creating 2,000 part-time jobs in a further move towards flexible working in the retail sector. The store chain said the changes were aimed at ensuring well-trained staff were always available to provide higher levels of service at peak times, especially on Saturdays, and to remove anomalies in the existing staff structure. Management staff at BhS have already been reduced by 900. The full-time job cuts now being made at store level account for more than a quarter of the present total of 3,000 full-time jobs, while Saturday losses account for nearly 40 per cent of weekend-only working. They will be replaced by 2,000 jobs working between 12 and 20 hours a week. The total number of employees will fall from about 13,000 to 12,000. All remaining staff working more than 12 hours a week will be entered on National Vocational Qualification training schemes to raise standards of customer service. Basic pay will be increased. BhS said it hoped some people losing their jobs would accept part-time jobs, provided they met NVQ competence standards. But some compulsory redundancies were likely.</p>

			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: AIB shows IPounds 171.6m thanks to US side Correction (published 4th March 1993) appended to this article. A STRONG performance by First Maryland Bancorp, its US subsidiary, largely helped Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's largest clearing bank, achieve better than expected pre-tax profits of IPounds 171.6m (Pounds 177m) for the nine months ended December 31 1992. The result was produced despite deteriorating trading conditions in Ireland. Mr Gerry Scanlan, group chief executive, said: 'Excellent results in the US and significant improvement in Britain compensated for the lack of growth in Ireland, which reflected the uncertain market conditions for our customers'. The group has changed its year-end reporting date from March 31 to December 31 this year consolidating the different reporting dates of the group's various subsidiaries, making comparison difficult with the 1992 results to March 31 1992, when pre-tax profits of IPounds 185.8m were reported. However, due to improved tax management, the post-tax profits of IPounds 107.6m for the nine months compare favourably with IPounds 104.7m for the previous 12-month period. Profits growth of 23 per cent was reported at First Maryland which contributed 43 per cent of total group profits for the nine months period. Losses in the UK division were down to IPounds 25.6m for the nine months, compared with IPounds 47m for the previous full year, while the Ireland division, which includes results from its TSB subsidiary in Northern Ireland, reported IPounds 129.5m in pre-tax profits for the nine month period compared with IPounds 172.6m for 1992. Profits in the Republic, however, were significantly down (by some 20 per cent on an annualised basis) to IPounds 72.7m from IPounds 121.4m between the two reporting periods. Loan loss provisions were IPounds 143.3m for the nine months (IPounds 178.3m) and the the group's Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio has again improved, from 6.6 per cent to 7.2 per cent. A final dividend of 4.2p is recommended, giving a total of 8p for the period. On an annualised basis this equals 8.7p, an increase of 5.5 per cent over 1991-92. Market analysts anticipate pre-tax profits in the region of IPounds 220m and earnings per share of 21p for 1993. COMMENT AIB executives remain upbeat about performance in the group's core Irish market for the year ahead. But the sharp downturn in the last quarter of 1992, triggered by the sterling crisis, high interest rates and a loss of business confidence, will only be partially offset by the punt's devaluation at the beginning of this year. Continuing high interest rates, weak sterling, and ERM instability give little cause for corporate optimism. Growing loan loss provisions and tighter profit margins would seem a more likely scenario for 1993. Thus the group's 'engine for growth' appears to have chugged off to the other side of the Atlantic, where First Maryland has built up a good head of steam ready to take advantage of the Clinton economic recovery. CORRECTION Allied Irish Banks' profits in the Republic of Ireland, reported in Wednesday's FT, should have read IPounds 76.7m (Pounds 78.2m) and not IPounds 72.7m. On an annualised basis this gives a 15.7 per cent downturn compared to 1991-92, not 20 per cent.</p>

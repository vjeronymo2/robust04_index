			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CALCULATED RISKS;  </P> <P> DESPITE SLUMP, ELECTRO RENT IS BUCKING TRENDS IN THE INSTRUMENT-LEASING FIELD  </P> <P> Early this year, Electro Rent Corp. Chief Executive Daniel Greenberg moved his  company into a newly built, post-modern headquarters with a sculpture in the  lobby and landscaped grounds, at a cost of nearly $15 million. It's the kind of  move companies usually make when the business climate is sunny. But the climate  isn't sunny for Electro Rent, a Van Nuys company that rents out high-tech  testing and measuring devices.  </P> <P> In fact, Greenberg admitted, "There are a whole host of reasons for pessimism."  </P> <P> But the move into new quarters is typical of Greenberg's confidence that his  company is doing the right thing. Some companies search for new directions when  hard times strike, but not Electro Rent.  </P> <P> Despite a nearly five-year slump in electronics, defense and aerospace -- the  industries on which Electro Rent depends for rentals -- the company is sticking  to its basic game plan -- to have plenty of distribution centers scattered  throughout the country to be close to its customers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Price-Cutting  </P> <P> That's hardly true elsewhere in the business, which has been hammered by  price-cutting in the last few years. The rental market for high-tech testing  gear is anywhere from $350 million to $450 million a year, depending on who is  doing the counting. Electro Rent, with about $115 million in revenues (not all  of it in instrument rentals), is the biggest player. But Electro Rent's closest  rivals have cut back their number of distribution centers to save money.  </P> <P> Those rivals include United States Instrument Rental (USIR) in Dallas, which is  owned by Ford, and Leasametric in Foster City, Calif., which is owned by the  billionaire Pritzker family of Chicago.  </P> <P> Since 1984, those companies and others have begun centralizing their equipment  centers' operations. Leasametric reduced its system of satellite offices, and  USIR cut back from three regional distribution centers to one. But although  Electro Rent reduced its payroll from 523 to 486 last year through attrition  and layoffs, it has essentially stuck to a local-office strategy. Electro Rent  still has 10 equipment depots across the country. Greenberg acknowledges that  the approach is far more costly but insists that it is the only way for Electro  Rent to maintain its lead.  </P> <P> USIR's senior vice president, Jack Cunningham, said of his company's  consolidation, "We've done it because we think we're right."  </P> <P> "Our competitors have made a serious mistake," Greenberg said. "They will  suffer because of it."  </P> <P> Maybe so, but refusing to scale back its operations is still a gamble for  Greenberg, because Electro Rent does not have the deepest pockets in the  business. USIR and Leasametric, with their wealthy parents, obviously can get  cheap financing in a business that depends heavily on borrowing to buy  equipment.  </P> <P> Greenberg is sticking with his old strategy of staying close to his customers  because it has paid off before. For five years, beginning in 1980, when Electro  Rent was spun off as an independent public company from its parent company,  Telecor, its sales grew at an average rate of 29%, reaching $89.9 million in  1985. Profits rose steadily, hitting $10.8 million in 1985.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defense Buildup  </P> <P> The growth of the instrument rental business was closely tied to the Reagan-era  defense buildup. "I'd like to tell you it all had to do with my personal  genius," Greenberg said. But "we were all being pulled by the runaway train of  the Reagan revolution."  </P> <P> But beginning in 1985, that runaway train got switched onto a sidetrack. The  yearly growth rate of Electro Rent's revenues tailed off, and in the latest  fiscal year, which ended in May, its sales shrank less than 1% to $114.5  million. Meanwhile, its profits fell three out of the past four years and stood  at $7.9 million in fiscal year 1989.  </P> <P> That's when trouble struck Electro Rent's business. The company's main line is  renting out sophisticated electronic testing equipment, from devices such as a  $500 digital voltage meter to high-tech gadgets such as a $60,000 microwave  spectrum analyzer, which monitors the frequency of microwave transmissions.  Electronics and aerospace firms rent the devices for short projects when buying  isn't practical, or when they want to avoid sinking money into hardware that  may become obsolete. Electro Rent's best customers are defense contractors,  such as Lockheed, Boeing and TRW, who find renting especially convenient to  help assign equipment costs to specific government contracts.  </P> <P> Keeping its equipment in the field is essential for Electro Rent to make money.  When Electro Rent buys, say, the $60,000 microwave spectrum analyzer, the  company turns around and rents it for 6% to 11% of the purchase price per month  (or about $3,600 to $6,600), hoping to keep it in use 60% of the time. After  about three years, Electro Rent sells the analyzer for $30,000 to $45,000. The  resale is crucial and helps Electro Rent turn a profit on the equipment.  </P> <P> Turning a profit is tougher than it used to be because of a wave of  price-cutting in instrument rentals. Some of the most visible price-cutting was  done by Telogy, a new Redwood City, Calif., company, as it competed for big  contracts. But USIR's Cunningham said, "I think we all shot ourselves in our  own foot." Whoever initiated it, the price cuts had a clear effect. Electro  Rent's profit margin per dollar of sales fell from 12% in 1985 to 7% in 1989.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slow Growth  </P> <P> Reeling from slow growth and evaporating profit margins, most of Electro Rent's  competitors rethought the business and decided to cut their distribution costs  by closing some offices. Electro Rent, of course, believes that keeping a  number of regional offices across the country helps its marketing, delivery and  customer service.  </P> <P> In the recent tougher times, Electro Rent has also embarked on a $44-million  stock repurchase program to consolidate Greenberg's and his family's grip on  the company and to help boost the stock to near its five-year high recently.  Greenberg, with his family, holds about 36% of Electro Rent's stock, worth  about $27 million at recent trading prices.  </P> <P> Will Greenberg's defiant strategy work? Industry analyst Gerald Fleming of  Fahnestock &amp; Co. pointed out that Electro Rent's profit margin remains  solid at about 7%. And he notes that Greenberg seems to have known what he was  doing in the past. "You can't fight with success," Fleming said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> EASTERN EUROPE CHURCH AID SET  </P> <P> U.S. Roman Catholic bishops launched a major program today to help churches of  Eastern Europe recover from their prolonged suppression under communism.  </P> <P> Presenting the plan, Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis said churches there  have suffered a "man-made disaster" resulting from years of persecution.  </P> <P> With the collapse of communism, he said, they are "like a man just emerging  from the darkness of a cave, standing there, blinking in the bright light of  freedom."  </P> <P> At the annual meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, a  succession of about a dozen bishops took the floor to back a national church  collection to pay for the aid project.  </P></p>

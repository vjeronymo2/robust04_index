			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPUS NERDS AIM FOR LAST LAUGH  </P> <P> It's the laugh. That obnoxious giggle that ends in a full-fledged snort. That's  the mark of a true nerd.  </P> <P> Jeremy Kahn has it. Naturally. He is the founder, president and ideological  spokesman for the newly formed Society of Nerds and Geeks -- or SONG -- at  Harvard University.  </P> <P> If Veritas (truth) is the motto of Harvard and Vanitas is the motto of the  Harvard Lampoon, then the slogan of SONG is "Veritas is more important than  Vanitas," explained Kahn, 20, a junior majoring in math.  </P> <P> "The kind of people we're looking for are very interested in what they're  studying. Not as worried about -- like -- what other people think about them,"  said Kahn, who punctuates a lot of his sentences with "like."  </P> <P> "Truth is more important than to look good," he added.  </P> <P> Everyone knows or has known a nerd or a geek. A nerd was that brainy math major  in college, the one with the thick glasses, the perpetual pocket calculator and  plaid shirt. A geek was a guy -- or gal -- who wore mismatched socks or strange  color combinations and walked to the beat of a drummer no one else heard.  </P> <P> Nerds, however, go on to invent amazing new machines and make millions on the  patents. Geeks go on to found new companies and become the CEO featured on  Fortune's cover for their maverick style. Nerds and geeks always have the last  laugh.  </P> <P> Will nerds inherit the earth? No, but they might just save it, according to  Kahn.  </P> <P> The first step, he says, is to help take the stigma off students who live to  study, not party. SONG, organized in mid-October by Kahn, aims to do that with  meetings, speakers and other activities. "Basically it's putting academics  ahead of social life."  </P> <P> With about 35 members, SONG meets weekly and fosters discussions on how to  study better and improve academic standings.  </P> <P> "We talk about -- like -- why grades are important to us or how we see  relationships, which may seem strange for nerds and geeks to talk about," said  Kahn. And he laughed that nerdy laugh.  </P> <P> Future plans for SONG include lectures, off-beat dances for those slightly out  of step and a special "procrastination hot line." This would involve a "kind,  caring and generous counselor" to talk with students who simply can't get down  to work.  </P> <P> "I think students procrastinate more than anyone else. It's amazing how much  time I spend procrastinating," Kahn said. A hot line could get students "on the  road to recovery. In 10 minutes they'd be sitting down and getting to work."  </P> <P> Kahn had been thinking about organizing some kind of club since he entered  Harvard. "Freshman year I found myself very isolated. For the first time in my  life I could not concentrate on studies. No organization that would, like, help  me concentrate on studies."  </P> <P> So he thought up the name Society of Nerds and Geeks, registered it with the  proper Harvard authorities and began having meetings. Most members are math  majors, but other disciplines are represented as well, such as Sanskrit.  </P> <P> The club's graduate student adviser, Leonid Fridman, has written a "Nerd  Manifesto" about the dangers of anti-intellectualism. Yet the alumni adviser is  the assistant coach of the Harvard wrestling team, proving that nerds and jocks  aren't necessarily mutually exclusive.  </P> <P> "The role of women in SONG isn't any different from that of men. We are  equal-opportunity nerds," said freshman Kate Tulenko, an 18-year-old  biochemistry major.  </P> <P> There's a funny saying going around Harvard, "Blessed are the nerds and geeks  for they will become trend-setters," Kahn said. And then he laughed -- like a  nerd.  </P></p>

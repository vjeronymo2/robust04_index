			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF;  </P> <P> COURSES DESIGNED BY NICKLAUS HAVE INSIDE TRACK TO PRESTIGE RANKING  </P> <P> The modern-day shortcut to getting a golf course named one of the "100 best in  America" would seem to be having Jack Nicklaus as its architect.  </P> <P> Nicklaus, who has been at his second career only 15 years, designed seven  courses among the top 100 in the latest rating by Golf Digest's panel of  experts. Only four legendary designers -- Robert Trent Jones, Donald Ross, Pete  Dye and A.W. Tillinghast -- have as many or more.  </P> <P> Nicklaus' first signature course, Muirfield Village, which he created with  Desmond Muirhead in Dublin, Ohio, heads the list, which also includes Shoal  Creek, Ala.; Castle Pines, Colo.; Desert Highlands, Ariz.; Annandale, Miss.;  Loxahatchee, Fla., and Grand Cypress, Fla.  </P> <P> It may be only a matter of time before two of his jewels in Southern California  break into the top 100.  </P> <P> Sherwood Country Club, which opened with great fanfare in the hills south of  Thousand Oaks a year ago, and Dove Canyon Country Club, the newest addition to  Orange County's golf explosion, are excellent future-book candidates.  </P> <P> All they need is time, and with Nicklaus courses that sometimes doesn't take  long. Loxahatchee, a watery layout in Jupiter, Fla., made the list only four  years after it opened.  </P> <P> Difficulty -- at least from the championship, or tournament, tees -- is always  a consideration, and both Sherwood and Dove Canyon can be stretched out to  torture tests. Sherwood, from the gold tees, was recently assigned a 75.7  rating with a slope of 146, the fourth-highest in the Southern California Golf  Assn. Dove Canyon has been tentatively set at 74.3 with a 136 slope, but it is  expected to be 75 or higher when the official rating is assigned by the SCGA  later this year.  </P> <P> Both are centerpieces of exclusive master-planned, gate-guarded communities.  Surrounding the Sherwood course is David Murdock's 1,900-acre development in  the Sherwood Valley. Dove Canyon is an 874-acre development east of Mission  Viejo, where Garth Chambers has carved out 1,312 homesites and a golf course  between Rancho Santa Margarita and Coto de Caza, another golf course-oriented  community where a Robert Trent Jones, Jr.-designed layout is the centerpiece.  Dove Canyon is unique in that no smoking is allowed -- on the golf course --  because of its proximity to the Cleveland National Forest and its use of a  straw-like fescue grass in the rough, which has given it a high fire-risk  classification.  </P> <P> Sherwood was opened last November when Greg Norman played host to the Ronald  McDonald Children's Charities tournament won by Curtis Strange. This year's  event will be Nov. 13-18.  </P> <P> The Dove Canyon course opened on Aug. 8, but the formal opening with Nicklaus  on hand to hit the first ball will not be held until early next year, after the  47,000-square foot clubhouse is completed.  </P> <P> Pete Pino, who was instrumental in forming the Los Coyotes and Friendly Hills  country clubs and was later at the Los Angeles Country Club and Industry Hills,  recently joined Dove Canyon as general manager. Kevin Paluch, formerly with  Fairbanks Ranch Country Club in Rancho Santa Fe, is director of golf.  </P> <P> "Nicklaus' attention to detail is amazing," Pino said. "When he came out for  what was sort of a final inspection, he didn't like the way one fairway looked  to him, so he had us move it 15 feet. The sprinkling system was already in, and  we had to move the whole thing."  </P> <P> The incident is similar to Nicklaus' work at Sherwood, where he didn't like the  positioning of a 100-year-old oak tree on a hole; he simply had it dug up and  moved to where he wanted it.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel and Betsy King will continue their duel for player-of-the-year  honors on the LPGA Tour into the $325,000 MBS tournament next month at Los  Coyotes Country Club.  </P> <P> Daniel, the earnings leader with $557,532 to date, and King, the U.S. Women's  Open champion and winner of $421,431, have both filed entries for the 54-hole  tournament Sept. 21-23, along with Nancy Lopez, the defending champion.  </P> <P> Patty Sheehan, the second-leading money winner with $537,791, is also expected  to enter.  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Arnold Palmer and Lee Trevino have committed to play in the inaugural Security  Pacific Senior tournament Oct. 29-Nov. 4 at Rancho Park. Palmer won three Los  Angeles Opens at Rancho in 1963, '66 and '67, but he is probably remembered  more for the seven-over-par 12 he took on the ninth hole in 1961, when he hit  four consecutive shots out of bounds -- two to the right and two to the left.  The 54-hole $500,000 tournament will benefit the Centinela Hospital's  Children's Charity Fund. . . . The 16th annual Billy Casper Invitational will  be held Sept. 11 at Anaheim Hills.  </P> <P> The West Coast Golf Show, second largest golf trade show in the world, will  wrap up today and Monday at the Long Beach Convention Center and Arena with 905  exhibit booths showcasing the newest in equipment, accessories and fashions. .  . . Former touring pro Bill Thornton has joined head professional Robert La  Point as teaching pro at the Ridgeline CC, a nine-hole executive course in  Orange. . . . Rancho Park juniors, headed by Andy Huang, won the L.A. City  junior club championship on their home course. Griffith Park was second,  followed by Hansen Dam and Sepulveda. . . . Dennis Kaprielian of San Marino won  the SoCal Left-handed Golfers Assn. championship with a 74-68 -- 142 at El  Prado. Low net was Ron Turner of Los Angeles with 133.  </P> <P> Jerry Barber, in his sixth decade as a professional golfer, is the oldest  regular on the Senior PGA Tour at 74. The longtime Griffith Park pro from La  Canada comments on the problems of keeping up with the 60-year-olds in the  Vantage Super Seniors division: "The toughest thing I find is the way I've lost  distance on my driving. The golf courses are getting a little too long for me,  and they're calling for finer shots than I can make now. We could make those  shots in days gone by, but not now. A lot of guys are coming in there with a  seven- or an eight-iron, and I'm back there with a wood or long iron. It  doesn't make for any kind of scoring."  </P> <P> Dates for the 20th annual L.A. City Senior Women's Championship have been  changed to Sept. 5-6 at the Rancho Park course. . . . Bill Campbell, 1964 U.S.  Amateur champion and former president of the U.S. Golf Assn., has been named to  receive the Old Tom Morris award from the Golf Course Superintendents Assn. of  America. Campbell is only the third American, joining Francis Ouimet and Joe  Dey, named captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, Scotland.  </P></p>

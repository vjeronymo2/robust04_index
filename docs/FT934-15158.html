			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: M&amp;S set to open franchise in Turkey MARKS AND Spencer aims to break new ground by opening a franchise operation in Turkey. The country's economy grew faster than any in Europe last year. The company, which has previously concentrated its franchises in North America and continental Europe said it was looking for a Turkish partner with the financial muscle for a retail operation with annual turnover of at least Pounds 50m. 'We believe there are opportunities for our particular formula in Turkey,' the company said yesterday. The operation, in line with recent successful franchises in Hungary and Austria, would start by retailing ladies' lingerie and toiletries. The project is a pilot scheme. Initially, the stores would be about 2,000 sq ft, compared with about 30,000 for a UK branch. Risk capital would be provided by the Turkish franchisee, while Marks and Spencer would supply merchandise. Turkey's consumer market is driven by rising personal incomes, fast urbanisation and rapid changes in consumer taste, with importance attached to brand names and packaging. Retails chains currently account for 7 per cent of the market nationally and about 12 per cent in the big cities, Istanbul, Izmir and Ankara.</p>

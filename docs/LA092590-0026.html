			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CITIES MISUSE CENSUS  </P> <P> It is interesting to see that the release of preliminary census figures brings  protests from communities that profit by having higher numbers. It is much like  a political rally in which police estimate crowd size at 20,000 while the  candidate claims 50,000.  </P> <P> In a population in excess of 240 million, it does not seem possible to count  every individual. As a temporary census employee, I can attest that great  effort was expended to get an accurate count.  </P> <P> However, a certain percentage of forms were not returned. Another segment  showed a lack of understanding of the questions, while a third group felt that  even the short form was too intrusive and returned the forms with "none of your  business" scrawled across them. Workers made follow-up efforts, but not every  effort was successful.  </P> <P> Probably the count of homeless was inaccurate, but which community should be  credited with the ones who were identified? With police and community leaders  driving them from Costa Mesa, Santa Ana and other areas, do those communities  now claim the numbers for fiscal reasons? Costa Mesa most notably has tried to  prevent this group from seeking employment or even receiving help from private  agencies.  </P> <P> Why, then, do these same communities ask for a count of those people in order  to receive more funding? Perhaps their purpose is to use the funding for more  police to harass these underclasses of society.  </P> <P> RAY BRACY  </P> <P> Tustin  </P></p>

			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Mixed feelings in Bonn on result ON Maastricht, the German body politic seems to want to eat its cake and have it. One side - Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his government and the main parties  - says full steam ahead: lingering doubts about the meaning of Maastricht, and the implications for the D-Mark, must be subsumed in a rapid ratification process. 'Maastricht is not going to fail because of Germany,' says Mrs Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, EC spokesman for the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), normally die-hard opponents of the chancellor. The other side - many of the same people, plus business and industry, the financial establishment, and politicians outside the Bonn hot-house  - simultaneously wants a breathing space, time for some fine-tuning, even for a little reconsideration about the revolution implied by economic and monetary union (Emu). 'The direction of Maastricht is the right one, but the speed will depend on how quickly we can solve the problems,' Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister and close associate of Mr Kohl, said yesterday. One cannot create a European currency 'artificially', he said. Outside the establishment there are those who want nothing to do with Maastricht at all. In spite of growing public sympathy, they have made no impact on Bonn. Their campaign for a referendum does not look likely to succeed - partly because of the shambles of the French referendum and, more important, because of bitter memories of the misuse of referendums in the Weimar republic, when they undermined the elected parties and contributed to the rise of Hitler. Even those fighting for ratification admit that the process - due to begin with a first reading in the Bundestag on October 7 - is no longer the end of the issue. For the demand by both houses of parliament to have another debate before moving to the final stage of Emu, in 1997 or 1999, is now recognised as a chance to halt any automatic move to a single currency. 'No German government will go ahead (to Emu) if the Bundestag refuses to accept that the economic convergence criteria have been fulfilled,' a senior government official said yesterday. 'And Emu without Germany would not happen.' The view that is gathering momentum, however, is that the EC is condemned to become a multiple-speed community. As a result of the divided establishment view, there is something of a love-hate relationship towards those seen as complicating the process: first Denmark, then France, and now Britain. The Danish No vote was welcomed by many pro-Europeans for forcing the German public to focus on the Maastricht Treaty for the first time. It was welcomed by opponents for liberating the debate and allowing Germans to dare to say No in the opinion polls. The French referendum was watched in trepidation throughout the establishment for fear it would undermine Germany's most important partner in all Community affairs. With the result out, no one is quite sure the tiny majority for the Yes vote will not have the same effect: sapping the French government's will-power as one half of the 'motor' of European integration. Attention is turning to the British reservations, just as the British are indulging in a dose of Germany-bashing. One voice of the establishment says: 'Press on regardless. They will never be true Europeans.' Another voice says: 'How can we help them stay on board? For we sink or swim together.' 'Great Britain must decide,' says Mr Karl Lamers, foreign affairs spokesman of Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats. 'There is a growing temptation for people to pull back into their national snails' shells. It is an illusion. It is an expression of fears, a flight from reality. The reality is called Europe.' What Germany can do for British Prime Minister John Major is return to the issue on which the two stand relatively united: the need to reinforce so-called subsidiarity - maximum devolution of decision-making - and the protection of national identities in the Maastricht Treaty. That was the key new element in Mr Kohl's statements on Sunday night and yesterday, in the wake of the referendum result. Otherwise he was merely insisting that Maastricht must be ratified by all member states, and that European political union must move hand-in-hand with economic union. 'We must all ensure that the Europe of Maastricht is a democratic and citizen-friendly Europe, which respects and promotes the national identity, history and culture of all member states and their regions, a Europe which is built on the basis of 'unity in diversity',' he said. However, the simultaneous German concern is that UK fury at the fall of the pound, and its accusations of German complicity, may fatally undermine British willingness to find ways of pushing the Maastricht process forward. That would be serious if Britain were just one of 12 members round the table. It could be disastrous with Britain currently occupying the presidential chair and so responsible for promoting compromise. In particular, Mr Major's suggestion that the emergency summit in October might consider ways of reforming the European Monetary System and its exchange rate mechanism is regarded as wild and dangerous in Bonn. 'If you want to torpedo the EMS, you just do what the British prime minister seems to suggest,' one German official said yesterday. 'I don't see how you can negotiate at a European summit, in front of 5,000 journalists, about the future of the monetary system. The markets would go wild. 'We need a summit meeting well prepared to do some stock-taking and to agree on how to get the ratification process through. We need to answer the problems of both Denmark and the UK. We still have not given up hope with the UK.'</p>

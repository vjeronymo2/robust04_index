			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Paul Jacob] </F>   [Text] Jakarta -- Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was admitted  to a Jakarta hospital's intensive cardiac care unit on Wednesday  for what officials would only say was "fatigue".    Dr. Budi Trisulo, Mr. Alatas' personal physician, confirmed  yesterday that the 61-year old foreign minister had been  hospitalized but declined to say more.    ANTARA National News Agency quoted Foreign Ministry  spokesman  Irawan Abidin as saying that doctors have ordered Mr. Alatas, a  heavy smoker, to take a complete rest for at least two weeks.    That would mean that Mr. Alatas, who was appointed foreign  minister in 1988, would be unable to attend a meeting of the  Indonesia-Malaysia joint ministerial commission in Kuala Lumpur.  He had also been scheduled to fly from Malaysia to Egypt to  attend a meeting of the Nonaligned Movement's foreign ministers.    A key point on the Cairo agenda is the question of who  succeeds Indonesia next year as chairman of the 110-strong  movement.</p>

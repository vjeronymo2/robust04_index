			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Philip Morris falls 25% as cigarette price war takes toll THE CIGARETTE price war raging in the US took its toll on Philip Morris, the world's biggest cigarette manufacturer, in the third quarter, wiping 25 per cent off the company's profits. Net earnings were Dollars 971m compared with Dollars 1.291m in the same quarter last year. The figures were worse than the market had feared and the share price fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 3/8 . Philip Morris triggered the price war in April by cutting 20 per cent off the price of its premium brands - notably Marlboro, its top-selling product, but also Benson &amp; Hedges, Merit, Parliament and Virginia Slims. The company was responding to the in-roads made by low-price cigarettes into its market share, as consumers switched away from famous brands to cheaper products. The price cuts produced a fall of 16 per cent in Philip Morris's domestic tobacco revenues in the third quarter, causing a 53 per cent slump in the division's operating profits to Dollars 615m. But the company took consolation from a 1.7 percentage point increase in its share of the US cigarette market to 25.7 per cent. Most of the rest of the group performed well. The international tobacco business showed a 15 per cent rise in operating profits to Dollars 678m, North American food increased profits by 10 per cent to Dollars 586m, and the Miller Brewing Company raised its contribution by 71 per cent to Dollars 94m. International foods, however, saw a 12 per cent fall in operating profits to Dollars 243m because of adverse currency movements and exceptional gains from asset sales the previous year. Group turnover for the quarter rose 1.4 per cent to Dollars 15.2bn, while net earnings per share fell 23 per cent to Dollars 1.11. Mr Michael Miles, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Our overall results indicate that our business strategies are proving effective in very difficult economic and competitive circumstances.' The pressure on US cigarette prices seems likely to last and analysts are gloomy about the prospects of a recovery from this part of the group's operations. But Ms Leigh Ferst, analyst at Prudential Securities, said: 'If they can stop the decline in US cigarette profits, there is growth in the rest of the business.'</p>

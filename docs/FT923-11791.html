			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Koreans agree steel curbs South Korean steel makers have agreed to voluntary restraints on exports of nine steel items to the US for one year from April 1, 1992, the Korea Steel Manufacturers Association said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Seoul. - The items include coated sheets, pipe and tubes, nails and stainless products. The move follows complaints by US steel makers against Korean steel exporters for selling below 'fair' prices in the US, and is seen as an attempt to stave off dumping charges. Six other Korean steel products are under dumping investigation in the US.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Ukraine to ratify treaty on N-arms Ukraine's parliament yesterday ratified the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and closed a chapter in the country's hesitant steps to give up the nuclear weapons inherited from the Soviet Union. The long-awaited vote, passed by wide margin, looks set to improve the often strained relations with the west and Russia. It also marks a considerable political victory for President Leonid Kuchma a week before his summit with President Bill Clinton. Ukraine will formally accede to the 1968 treaty as a non-nuclear state once security assurances from the US, the UK, France and Russia are, as expected, given at next month's CSCE summit in Budapest. The assurances concern Ukraine's territorial integrity. Ukraine's ratification also is crucial because Moscow and Washington have been delaying implementation of the first and second strategic arms reduction treaties until Kiev ratified the NPT. Ukraine, which is the world's third largest nuclear power, last January gave up its nuclear arsenal under an agreement signed with Russia and the US in exchange for about Dollars 1bn (Pounds 641m) in nuclear fuel supplies and disarmament assistance. Parliament ratified the Start-2 treaty in February; NPT was the last step. The conservative parliament had for three years hedged on ratifying NPT, viewed by many nationalists and communists as Ukraine's last bargaining chip, but yesterday's debate was brisk. 'Ratification will make us hostage to politics in other countries - such as Russia,' said Mr Oleh Vitkovich, a right-wing deputy. But, after only a dozen deputies, Mr Kuchma significantly spoke last. He told the chamber that, as a former director of a nuclear missiles factory, he found the argument for keeping a nuclear deterrent an 'illusion' held by 'false patriots'. 'By signing this treaty, Ukraine shows we don't blackmail the world community,' he said, warning of diplomatic isolation. Although Ukraine inherited 176 inter-continental missiles and 41 strategic bombers - the warheads are now being transferred to Russia - Moscow controlled the launch codes and Kiev lacked both the technology and financing to store the weapons properly or gain control. Mr Kuchma warned deputies that developing Ukraine's nuclear capability would require up to Dollars 200bn and help from Russia. The president instead asked for further western aid to dismantle the nuclear weapons. On Tuesday, 14 western states and the European Union promised Dollars 234.38m in disarmament aid on top of Dollars 500m already pledged. The funds are earmarked for military conversion, resettling and retraining military personnel, environmental clean-up, missile dismantlement, non-proliferation safeguards and nuclear reactor safety. 'As Ukraine takes the final steps to move beyond the nuclear issue,' a joint statement read, 'its relations with western partners will rise to a new qualitative level with a focus on political and economic questions and on Ukraine's closer integration into the west.' Russia put further pressure on Ukraine this week by cutting off nuclear fuel supplies - needed to power Ukraine's five nuclear power plants - until Ukraine ratified the NPT. Western diplomats called the vote a break-through. 'Ukraine can now be a full player on the international scene,' one said The US wanted Ukraine on board to build momentum ahead of next spring's on NPT renewal, opposed by states such as Nigeria and India.</p>

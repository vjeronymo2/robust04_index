			<p>BFN     [Text] Our country's permanent representative to the United  Nations described as deceitful the remarks made by U.S. State  Department officials about Iran's performance in the fight  against narcotics.    He stressed: While Iran has come under strong Western  criticism for taking strict antinarcotics measures, the United  States accuses Tehran of procrastination in the matter.    Referring to data and statistics and a report by the  International Narcotics Control Board, our country's permanent  UN representative said: The Islamic Republic of Iran has taken  extensive measures to control narcotics, not only in the region  but also globally. Tehran's investment in the matter is of the  highest level.    The U.S. assistant secretary of state claimed last Monday  that the Islamic Republic of Iran is taking no measures to fight  narcotics smuggling.</p>

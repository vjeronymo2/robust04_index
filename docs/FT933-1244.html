			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Outlook for economy depresses the cyclicals Wall Street IN SPITE of rising bond prices and a cooling off in the Russian political crisis, bad economic news depressed cyclical stocks yesterday, although secondary issues fared much better, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.27 at 3,539.75, but the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.54 at 457.74, while the American SE composite finished 2.42 ahead at 452.71 and the Nasdaq composite up 6.70 at a record high of 752.24. New York SE volume was 275m shares. The pattern broken on Wednesday by the Dow's near 10-point gain reasserted itself yesterday: cyclical stocks suffered, while much of the rest of the market held steady or prospered. Cyclical shares have been in the doldrums because investors are increasingly worried about the outlook for the still struggling US economy. Those concerns were fuelled yesterday by bad news from the labour markets. The number of people claiming state unemployment insurance rose 11,000 during the week ended September 18, a much bigger increase than analysts had been expecting. The fact that the bad jobs data sparked a big rally in bond prices - the benchmark 30-year bond rose half a point, and the yield dropped close to 6 per cent - did not help the equity markets, however. Paramount Communications, which has risen sharply since Viacom, and then QVC, unveiled multi-billion dollar takeover bids for the company, receded Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 76 7/8 in busy trading on reports that Viacom is unwilling to increase the value of its offer to match QVC's counter-bid. Viacom, listed on the American Stock Exchange, rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 60 1/4 on the reports, while the Nasdaq-listed QVC rallied from an early loss to finish Dollars 1 3/4 up on balance at Dollars 61 3/4 . Sears Roebuck shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 57 1/4 in volume of 1.8m shares after the big retailing group warned that its fourth-quarter results may not be as buoyant as in the same quarter a year ago. Among cyclicals hit again by economic worries were Caterpillar, down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 77 1/8 , International Paper, off Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 59 3/8 , Aluminum Company of America, Dollars  7/8 lower at Dollars 67 3/8 , and Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, Dollars  5/8 easier at Dollars 103 3/4 . Wednesday's news that Travelers will merge with Primerica continued to support the former, up another Dollars 1 at Dollars 37 5/8 , while Primerica moved Dollars  7/8 higher to Dollars 48 3/8 . Storage Technology dropped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 25 1/2 after warning that it will make a big loss in the third quarter. Selected drug issues were in demand the day after President Clinton unveiled his health care reform plan. Schering-Plough rose Dollars 2 to Dollars 65 1/4 and Pfizer put on Dollars 2 at Dollars 62 1/2 . Canada TORONTO rose in moderately active trading. The TSE 300 index ended 15.9 up at 3,970.9 and advances led declines by 378 to 350 after volume of 57.2m shares valued at CDollars 563.8m. Golds put on 1.33 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuwait has shown keen interests in employing more  Thai workers to help in reconstruction of the country. Vice  President of the Kuwaiti Parliament [Salei Yusuf Al Fathala] met  Minister of Labor and Social Welfare Phaithun Kaeothong on  Friday for talks on Thai labor in Kuwait. There are currently  about 3,000 Thai workers in Kuwait. The country wishes to  increase the number of Thai workers to 7,000, the same number  employed in Kuwait before the Gulf war. The vice president of  the Kuwaiti parliament asked Thailand to help urge Iraq to  release Kuwaiti prisoners of war. Kuwait intends to cooperate  more in Thailand in diplomatic, trade, and labor areas. Trade  between the two countries last year amounted to 2,000 million  baht. Kuwait has invested over 1,000 million baht in the  petroleum business in Thailand. Kuwait has also invited  Minister Phaithun to visit that country.</p>

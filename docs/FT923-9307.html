			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Letter: BT should stage a strategic retreat Sir, BT's chairman, Mr Iain Vallance, is a man of great stature. However, his stature will not be ennobled by confronting Oftel over its market interventions ('BT chairman attacks watchdogs', July 31) while BT's market share remains at 95 per cent or thereabouts. In common with BT, most investors in telecommunication service provision wish to evolve to a market structure in which price and quality, in its broadest sense, create a sufficiently competitive market for consumers' interests to be served without heavy regulatory intervention. Conceptually, Oftel should regulate itself out of existence, leaving it to the Office of Fair Trading, the Monopolies Commission, common law and consumer legislation to protect the interests of consumers and competitors. This must be a shared common goal. Meanwhile, the reality is that BT has a 95 per cent market share and it seems to me that Iain Vallance can forge the relationship with Oftel he (and the rest of us) seeks when he has implemented a programme of strategic market share retreat. This means relinquishing to competitors, in a controlled way, segments of the market which do not jeopardise future strategic positioning and which contribute least to BT's return on capital. Michael Storey, chairman, Cable Television Association, Fifth Floor, Artillery House, Artillery Row, London SW1P 1RT</p>

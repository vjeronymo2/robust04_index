			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Summary of interview with ROK Deputy Prime Minister Yi </F> Hong-ku by unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN reporter on 9 June; place  not given; first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] The following is a summary of remarks by Yi Hong-ku,  ROK deputy prime minister and National Unification Board  director, in an ASAHI SHIMBUN interview on 9 June.    1. It appears there were two possible reasons for North  Korea proceeding with the replacement of fuel rods in its  nuclear facilities on the eve of the third round of high-level  negotiations with the United States.    One was the fact that some quarters in the United States and  in the international community said they could tolerate North  Korea's past nuclear-related attempts if it fully returns to the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and guarantees it will  not extract plutonium from the replaced fuel rods. North Korea  probably thought it was worth finding out if they really meant  it.    Another reason was, judging from the mood in the United  States and the international community, North Korea thought it  unlikely they would react strongly to fuel rod replacement.  That was probably a gamble, but it ended up as a miscalculation.    2. Concerning possible sanctions against North Korea, the  ROK Government has a three-point principle -- sanctions should  be implemented 1) effectively, 2) swiftly, and 3) on a  step-by-step basis. Our stance is that, while measures should  be strengthened gradually, there would always be room for  negotiation.    3. Generally speaking, sanctions can be classified in three  steps -- "limited sanctions," "further sanctions," and "heavy  sanctions (like sea blockade)." The latter may bring about  excessive tension in the region. Since bans on oil, food  exports, and remittances are unlikely to trigger military  conflicts, these should be incorporated in the first or second  stages.    4. We are seeking a UN Security Council [UNSC] resolution on  the sanctions as early as next week. Even in the worst case,  the resolution should be adopted within three to four weeks.  The United States is in accord with us on this point.    5. While we have an option of three-party sanctions by  Japan, the ROK, and the United States, if China opposes UNSC  sanctions we must focus on discussions in the UNSC for the time  being. The objective of the trilateral talks is to clearly show  the grave concern of the three nations and not let North Korea  get any wrong idea that the UNSC is the only obstacle to  overcome.    6. China has great influence on North Korea since it  supplies 75 percent of North Korea's oil needs. China does not  want any nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula, and, to  achieve this objective, we hope China will take considerable  positive action on the issue.    7. It is my understanding that Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's proposal for an eight-party conference (of the United  Nations and nations concerned) is not a prerequisite for  Russia's approval of UN sanctions. We take the stance that the  eight-party conference cannot replace the sanctions bill already  under debate in the international community.    8. Even if North Korea formally proposes bilateral talks  with the ROK, we would not agree. Since the issue is currently  under debate at the UNSC, such an offer confuses the focal point  of the problem.    9. At the end of 1991, the North and South signed a joint  non-nuclear declaration, and this is an absolute promise between  the two Korean nations. The ROK declared its policy not to  develop technology for reprocessing of nuclear fuel to encourage  North Korea to remain in the bilateral framework instead of  embracing nuclear weapons development. However, the non-nuclear  declaration would lose its effect if North Korea obtains  plutonium through reprocessing.    10. In explanation of the ROK policy to stick to the  non-nuclear declaration, we have been telling the public that  reprocessing of nuclear fuel can be regarded as an attempt to  develop nuclear weapons. If North Korea breaks the declaration,  we would no longer have justification for staying away from  reprocessing technology. In that case, we would have to take  some action. If we fail in removing concern over nuclear  warfare from the Korean Peninsula, that would endanger the  entire Northeast Asia in the 21st Century.    11. Some quarters in the ROK insist the non-nuclear  declaration should be abolished to promote the ROK's own nuclear  energy policies. Those people are questioning why we have to  drop nuclear reprocessing while Japan is doing it for peaceful  purposes. To my surprise, most National Assembly members of  both the ruling and opposition parties believe this, so there is  the possibility of future adoption of active nuclear energy  policies in the ROK.    12. At present, North Korea is taking no major military  actions to provoke us. However, the Korean situation is often  affected by political and psychological factors. The ROK  citizens are working hard to strengthen the nation's competitive  power in the international market by pursuing democratic  politics and a modernized economy. For such people, war is the  very last choice. North Korea is taking our antiwar sentiment  hostage.</p>

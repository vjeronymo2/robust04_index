			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS PALMDALE;  </P> <P> VOTE THREATENS SPLIT ON COUNCIL  </P> <P> The apparent election defeat of two Palmdale City Council members by  challengers favoring tighter controls on development appears to divide the once  solidly pro-growth council in the rapidly expanding Antelope Valley city.  </P> <P> Semiofficial results from Tuesday's election showed businessman James Ledford  and high school teacher James Root, who ran a joint campaign calling for more  controls on growth, defeating first-term incumbents Tom Smith and Daniel  Becker, both considered pro-growth advocates.  </P> <P> Of the three incumbents on the ballot, only Mayor William (Pete) Knight clearly  won reelection, outdistancing two opponents. But voters rejected a city-backed  ballot measure to lengthen the mayor's term in office from two years to four,  beginning in 1992.  </P> <P> The outcome of the council race remained uncertain because Root led Smith by  only 26 votes in the semiofficial tally, with an estimated 152 ballots  uncounted. However, Smith said Wednesday he did not expect to overtake Root in  the final tally, which is due by Friday.  </P> <P> The result would leave Palmdale, one of the fastest-growing cities in  California, with a sharply divided City Council. All five incumbents had been  considered pro-growth. But Ledford and Root, while not advocating "slow  growth," have urged closer scrutiny of development projects.  </P> <P> "It sounds to me like the people have spoken for a change in the direction our  city's going to take. I think they're looking for a little more controlled  growth," said Ledford, a city Planning Commission member and owner of a  Palmdale bar and restaurant.  </P> <P> During the campaign, Ledford and Root promised to increase the city's park  space, reduce traffic congestion and force builders to better mitigate the  impacts of their developments. Both had the backing of city homeowner groups.  </P> <P> In contrast, Smith and Becker stressed the advantages of the city's growth,  including a new regional shopping mall set to open this fall. They too had  homeowner support, but their campaigns also were strongly backed by developers  and development-related political consultants.  </P> <P> Smith blamed his apparent defeat on the changing makeup of Palmdale. He said  the city has become increasingly populated with Los Angeles-area residents who  moved to escape urban ills, but now want to "pull up the drawbridge."  </P> <P> Becker blamed his loss on two mailers attacking his rivals sent out by a  pro-development group -- the Southern California Caucus -- linked to his  campaign. Becker insisted he did not authorize the mailers and said they  produced a voter backlash. One disclosed Ledford had a 1983 drunk-driving  conviction.  </P> <P> But Ledford went on to get 20.7% of the vote, more than anyone else in the  field of 10 candidates for the two council seats. He was trailed by Root with  19.3%, Smith with 19% and Becker with 15.4%. None of the other candidates got  more than 10%.  </P> <P> Knight got 60.7% to win a second two-year term as mayor, beating Kamal Chalabi  with 22.9% and Brian Spencer with 16.4%. Measure A, which would have given the  mayor the same four-year term as council members, was rejected 64.8% to 35.2%.  </P> <P> The voter turnout in the election was just under 19%.  </P></p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Brake Bros to Pounds 19m Acquisitions and an insurance claim fuelled a sharp jump in pre-tax profits at Brake Bros, the frozen food distributor which yesterday announced a 19 per cent increase to Pounds 19.1m in 1993. Mr Frank Brake, managing director, was cautious in spite of the profits increase. 'We do not foresee any dramatic change in the marketplace and are expecting it to remain flat this year - although we are hoping for better.' The main growth would come from acquisitions, including Country Choice Foods purchased in May for a shares consideration of Pounds 10m. Sales were 26 per cent higher at Pounds 354m, helped by the inclusion for seven months of CCF. Continuing businesses were 10 per cent higher at Pounds 311m. At the operating level, profits of continuing businesses improved by 3 per cent to Pounds 18m. Acquisitions contributed a further Pounds 2.28m to operating profits. The operating advance was held back by higher than expected losses of Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 1m) in the chilled foods business, and a nil contribution from France. Operating profits also included a Pounds 1.8m insurance payment arising from the fire at a cold store in 1991. The core frozen foods division had increased market share, Mr Brake said, with a 9 per cent increase in like-for-like sales. However, margins had slipped back from 6.7 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Mr Brake said the group expected margins to stabilise in the current year. The managing director said the chilled foods business would continue to make losses this year, although at a substantially lower rate. France was not expected to make a substantial contribution in 1994. The final dividend was increased by 11 per cent to 4.82p for a total of 6.82p (6.2p). Earnings per share were 9 per cent higher at 27p. COMMENT Brake Bros has done well to increase sales in a tough market, but the margins are showing the effects for the third successive year. While growth in the core frozen foods division appears to have slowed marginally in the second half, further progress is expected from Country Choice. Longer-term, France and chilled foods offer potential, assuming nothing goes wrong. Few expect Brake to race ahead in 1994 with the real growth pegged for 1995-96. Forecasts are for Pounds 21m this year. This puts the shares, which closed yesterday at 476p, on a multiple of about 17 times. While this may look high, the premium is lower than it has been for some time.</p>

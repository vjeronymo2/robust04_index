			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (7): Migrants readily find jobs - Epirus: Albanians continue to flood across the frontier THE LEAN, weatherbeaten men tramping the roads of Epirus, their possessions kept in a cloth bag slung over one shoulder, are immigrants from Albania. They can be seen at any hour of day or night, travelling in twos and threes to look for work. The trickle of Albanians crossing the border in north-western Greece has turned into a flood over the past year. There are thought to be over 200,000 Albanians - about 6 per cent of the country's population - in Greece. Among them are former diplomats and university professors. But an overwhelming majority are young men who enter Epirus illegally across the mountainous border. As part of its commitment to improve relations with Albania's democratic government, Greece has adopted an attitude of laissez faire tolerance towards the immigrants, who do not ask to be treated as refugees. In fact, it would require draconian measures to keep them out. Greek commandos patrol the border, but villagers on the Albanian side make a living out of guiding immigrants to out-of-the-way footpaths leading into Greece. A senior police officer in Ioannina, the provincial capital, says: 'Most days, we pick up about 500 Albanians in Epirus who don't have valid visas in their passports, and bus them back to the border. But there are probably more than that number coming across.' Greece issues visas to Albanians of Greek descent, most of them Greek-speakers from the North Epirus region of southern Albania, adjoining north-western Greece. Over 40,000 North Epirots and their families are now legitimate residents. In addition, Greece has agreed with the democratic government in Tirana to accept another 30,000 Albanians as short-term migrant workers. It says something about the size of the black economy in Greece that Albanian immigrants have little trouble in finding jobs, however temporary. Albanians are in much demand as casual workers in agriculture and construction, as they will accept a daily wage of Dr3,000 (Pounds 9). While this is less than half the basic rate for Greeks, it is equivalent to almost a month's salary in Albania. The flow of arrivals looking for seasonal work increased dramatically after Albania's democratic government launched a tough economic reform programme in July, in return for a stand-by loan from the World Bank, freeing food prices and cutting unemployment benefits. It is clear that the plight of the impoverished North Epirots, cut off from Greece during Albania's 40 years of Stalinist self-isolation, touches Greek sensibilities. Although there are few organised reception facilities for them, North Epirots use a network of extended family contacts in Greece to find better-paid jobs in the service sector. They are given preference over other unskilled workers applying for work, and employers are more willing to help ease them into the legal economy by meeting their social security obligations. Inevitably, the impact of the Albanian migration is felt most strongly in Ioannina. Thousands of Albanians have settled in the city, which is only a two-hour bus ride from Argyrokastro, the nearest big Albanian town - where most transactions are now carried out Greek drachmas rather than Albanian lek. Ioannina is where returning migrants buy up household appliances, food supplies and (increasingly) second-hand cars, to take home. Several thousand refrigerators, television sets and washing machines are taken across the border every week, according to Greek customs officials. 'The shops do well, but there are social problems. The Albanians have a tradition of violence, and we have much-increased rates of crime and prostitution,' says a provincial official. With the aim of slowing the immigration rate, the Greek government is preparing a medium-term aid and development programme, to be focused on southern Albania. It is awaiting approval, by the Group of 24 western industrialised countries, of a Dollars 75m plan for setting up agro-industries in Albania, from chicken-farming and pig-raising to canneries and the launch of a fishing fleet. 'Informal and disorganised as it may be, the Albanian immigrants are getting valuable exposure to a free-market system. That experience will be important in making their own economic transition,' says a Greek official. The government has also extended its incentive scheme for promoting investment in remote regions of Greece to southern Albania, offering grant aid and tax concessions even for small-scale projects. However, the complex bureaucracy inherited from the communist past, together with the slow pace of decision-making in Tirana, seem daunting to Greek businessmen. 'The public administration is still in very weak shape, and there are doubts about the legality of property transfers. You can sign a protocol, but there is no guarantee it will lead anywhere,' says Mr Costas Aslanides, a Greek contractor who wants to modernise a hotel in southern Albania. In the meantime, a government-sponsored organisation, the Foundation for Returning Greeks, is shipping European Community food aid to Albania. Truck convoys leave the Epirus port of Preveza several times a week, carrying flour to state bakeries in Albanian towns. Greece itself will provide Dollars 35m in aid to Albania this year, largely to meet specific requests from the Albanians for a variety of essentials, from potatoes and pasta to light bulbs and soap.</p>

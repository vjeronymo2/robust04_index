			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft loss widens Metallgesellschaft, the German trading and industrial group which nearly collapsed as a result of controversial deals in US oil futures, yesterday announced an increased net loss of DM2.7bn (Dollars 1.8bn) for the 1993-94 financial year and said it now looked with confidence to the future. The preliminary figure compared with a loss of DM1.97bn for the previous year to September 30. Turnover was down to DM20.1bn from DM26.1bn as a result of asset sales and withdrawal from unprofitable businesses. MG Corporation, the US subsidiary responsible for the oil futures debacle, incurred a pre-tax loss of DM2.9bn. The company, which only survived after a DM3.4bn rescue package led by creditor banks, repeated its expectation of a positive operating result for the current year. This should total well over DM100m. Its trade, plant construction, chemical and financial services activities would all contribute to this result. Bank indebtedness fell to DM3.1bn, which was matched by liquid assets, from DM7.4bn at end-December 1993. Metallgesellschaft again said the annual meeting next March would decide on capital restructuring measures, but gave no details. A reduction in share capital followed by a rights issue is one possibility. The company said with the closing of the 1993-94 financial year, all visible risks from its US subsidiary had been dealt with in the balance sheet. The company has sold subsidiaries, shareholdings and property to strengthen its finances. In recent months, the way the oil futures contracts were unwound has been the subject of a furious debate. Metallgesellschaft and Deutsche Bank, a leading creditor and shareholder, have defended themselves against claims by US economists that the method of unwinding actually increased the losses.</p>

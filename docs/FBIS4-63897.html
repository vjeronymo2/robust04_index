			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Kozlovskiy </F> by Nikolay Mirgorodskiy; date and place of interview not stated:  "Of Sovereignty and a Kalashnikov Cartridge"]    [Text] Colonel General Pavel Pavlovich Kozlovskiy, the  republic's defense minister, is extremely busy and, I thought,  it would be problematic for him to find even a little time to  talk with a journalist. But the Defense Ministry immediately  gave a date and time for the meeting. And the talk began with a  very topical theme: preparation for the celebration of Belarus'  liberation from the German fascist invaders.    [Kozlovskiy] Actually the Defense Ministry is already taking  part in these events. The army is quite unable to stand aloof  from the nationwide holiday. A state commission which includes  representatives of the Defense Ministry has been created for  holding the celebrations. A special badge has been approved  which will be presented to the veterans of the republic's  liberation. However banal it may sound now, the military units  are assuming patronage of the veterans, helping them, and  tending the monuments and graves. A special plan has been  compiled.    [Mirgorodskiy] Comrade minister, do you believe a Belarusian  army has been established and what traditions -- before and  after the October period or relating to recent years -- have  been most acceptable to it?    [Kozlovskiy] We are in favor of the good army traditions of  all periods and generations being preserved. But the traditions  of recent generations of the USSR Armed Forces are more  important. Fraternity, mutual assistance, friendship, honor --  these are sacred concepts for any soldier and officer. There is  no doubt that we do not have the right to forget the many years  of history of the Belorussian Military District. Outstanding  military leaders served here and sophisticated equipment was  tested. If we are able to retain the links and traditions of  the generations, that will have a beneficial effect on the  army's combat capability. And it is now in the process of  reform which according to the plan ends in late 1994. The  establishment of the armed forces is proceeding on the basis of  the republic's legislation. But to ensure that they acquire  their own national identity we still have a great deal of work  to do.    [Mirgorodskiy] You mentioned that the Belorussian Military  District used to test sophisticated models of weapons and  equipment. So they are not being tested now? And in general  where do you get weapons, equipment, fuel, uniforms, spare  parts, and food supplies?    [Kozlovskiy] A fine question. You should have put it to  some deputies who accuse the army of every sin. Yes, previously  there was a single supply system for the armed forces. The  Belorussian Military District was considered the best in the  Union. Moscow gave it everything. Today the situation has  changed. The tough system of centralized material supplies has  been destroyed. We have been obliged to embark on bilateral  agreements with Russia, Ukraine, Poland, and other countries in  order to maintain our combat readiness.    Once again difficulties with finances have arisen. If only  the power gave us as much as we need for arms. But alas! We  are obliged to engage in commercial activity, for which we are  mercilessly and perhaps sometimes rightly criticized. But the  main function of any army, you will agree, is in no way trade  and commerce.    [Mirgorodskiy] The unit's banner. It is sacred to any  serviceman. Its loss is shameful. How do matters stand with  regard to our units' old combat banners? Will they be kept in  the ranks or replaced with the white, red, and white flag?    [Kozlovskiy] We delivered an appeal to the Supreme Soviet  Presidium on the retention of the units' combat banners, orders,  and names. They are our history, our memory. In the republic's  top instances there is a proposal to approve the national banner  of the Republic of Belarus Armed Forces with all attributes. We  believe that both banners -- the old and the new -- should be in  the ranks together.    [Mirgorodskiy] Let us suppose that some adversary has  decided to attack the republic. Will the Belarusian army be  able to defend us?    [Kozlovskiy] The troops are in a state of combat readiness.  That is unequivocal. The question lies elsewhere. Is the army  prepared alone, and I stress that, alone, to deliver a fitting  rebuff to a potential foe? It all depends on the level of the  conflict. Of course, the army will fight, but it is nonetheless  better to defend ourselves in alliance with other friendly  states. At least it is far more reliable.    [Mirgorodskiy] How much money has been earmarked for the  Defense Ministry this year?    [Kozlovskiy] About 4 percent of the republican budget. This  money should be enough only for the army to survive.  Incidentally, for your information in Russia 20 percent of  budget funds are earmarked for this purpose.    [Mirgorodskiy] You say we are short of equipment. But to  judge by the recent rapturous newspaper articles we are  destroying it quite successfully: destroying tanks, aircraft,  and missiles. That is illogical....    [Kozlovskiy] It is all logical. If logical is part of our  reality at all. We are fulfilling international treaties.  Although it is permitted to use some of the equipment in the  national economy and as exhibits. A painful subject. But even  the vehicles we are reequipping for use for civilian purposes  are not, alas, finding customers. Moreover we have the right to  sell only those tanks, for instance, which were allowed to have  according to the quota. The others must be scrapped.    [Mirgorodskiy] And where does the metal go?    [Kozlovskiy] To Khlobin to be melted down.....    [Mirgorodskiy] Let us turn from strictly army questions.  And let us talk a little about politics. The presidential  election campaign is about to begin. How will the army take  part in it?    [Kozlovskiy] The army by law is outside politics. But no  one has deprived the soldiers and officers of the right to vote.  Campaigning work will not be carried out in the military  collectives. As you know, there are no political parties in the  army. So that each person will make his choice independently.    [Mirgorodskiy] We have touched on the subject of the  shortage of fuels and lubricants, spare parts, and ammunition.  But how are exercises proceeding? According to a curtailed  program?    [Kozlovskiy] Combat training is being carried out in full.  Various simulators are being used, including those developed at  our own firms. We are merely trying to restrict the troops'  movement.    [Mirgorodskiy] It is known that the officer cadres are not  trained in all specialities in Belarus. How is the Defense  Ministry recruiting the specialists it needs?    [Kozlovskiy] We are now short of about 1,500 junior  officers. We are developing our own academy and schools are  being reoriented. Cadres are also being trained abroad. One  month of training for a cadet costs $300-350 [figure as  published]. Is that expensive? Undoubtedly. Now those cadets  who arrived to study during the existence of the USSR are  completing their study in our schools. But few are expressing  the desire to serve in Belarus. Because a Russian officer's  salary is considerably higher than a Belarusian's.  Incidentally, our draftee soldier receives half the minimum  wage.    [Mirgorodskiy] Let us complete the subject of money with the  following question: What is the actual cost of one artillery  round (as a comparison a pair of shoes used to be cited) and one  cartridge for a Kalashnikov assault rifle?    [Kozlovskiy] One artillery round, depending on the shell,  costs $100-600. A Kalashnikov cartridge costs 25 cents. You  can do the sum and make the comparison.</p>

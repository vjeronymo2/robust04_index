			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Purple Accord Not Yet in Sight"] </F>   [Text] There does not appear to be any chance of the  negotiators' plans for a "purple" coalition comprising the PvdA  [Labor Party], the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy], and D66 [Democrats 66] resulting in an agreement on  the main lines of policy within the next few days. After a  weekend of internal consultation, it is clear that the PvdA and  D66 now want to press ahead quickly with the formation of a  government. But the VVD in particular still has objections on  some major points. "Bolkestein cannot go to the party with these  proposals," VVD members say.    Serious complications have also arisen because the CPB  [Central Planning Bureau] has proposed, independently of the  negotiators, intervention in the politically sensitive area of  the WAO [Law on Labor Disability]. The CPB proposal is that  people must have worked for at least five years before  qualifying for any entitlement to disability benefit. Such a  proposal is not included in the plans of Kok (PvdA), Bolkestein  (VVD), and Van Mierlo (D66).    Last week, the three party leaders sent an adapted draft  accord to the CPB experts, with the request to test the  soundness of the social, economic, and financial plans. The  austerity measures totaling some 20 billion guilders [G] were to  produce at least 100,000 extra jobs while sharply reducing the  tax burden, achieving a modest reduction in the public debt,  and, at least for those on low wages, bringing no more than a  limited reduction in spending power.    On Friday [17 June] came the reply from the CPB. It seems  that the CPB rejected a major item of expenditure cuts put  forward by the three political leaders. The new WAO law  includes a compulsory reexamination of all those registered as  disabled. This reexamination is supposed to result in many  people, the Social Affairs Ministry expects as many as 130,000,  no longer being declared disabled or being classed in a lower  category of disablement. This would then save G750 million.    The CPB believes that Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo are  banking on something that is far from guaranteed. The savings  expected by the Social Affairs Ministry are based on no more  than 4,000 reexaminations. The CPB considers it irresponsible  to count on savings on such a scale on this basis.    On its own authority the CPB has issued a proposal which  does  indeed provide for considerable savings. Under this proposal,  anyone who wants to be considered for disability benefit must  first have worked for at least five years. Essentially, this  means that young people will be unable to qualify for disability  benefit. Such a rule has been applied in Germany for almost 10  years now. The measure was also included in the VVD's election  program.    The CPB's suggestion was rejected out of hand in PvdA  circles  yesterday. The PvdA has already suffered some traumatic  experiences through trying to meddle with the WAO. In the  election campaign it always stressed the need to first wait and  see how beneficial the new regulation proves to be.    Criticism of the CPB is growing within the PvdA and D66 in  particular. "Anybody who thinks that Zalm's computer (Zalm is  the head of the CPB) can accurately predict the future is simply  insane," one D66 member said.    The VVD remains very critical of a large part of the planned  cuts. It considers G6 billion of these cuts to be very  questionable. The VVD finds proposed spending cuts on defense,  transport, and communications of G1 million unacceptable.    The CPB predicts that it will be 1998 before the public debt  is brought down to 3 percent. If the timetable of the  Lubbers-Kok government had been maintained, this percentage  could have been achieved in 1994. The VVD also objects to this.    All three parties consider that reducing the tax burden by  G9  billion is going to provide too few extra jobs. The CPB  predicts that it will produce no more than 72,000.    An additional difficulty is that the CPB computer only comes  up with the figure of 72,000 extra jobs if employers are  exempted from a premium that they must now pay for employees.  The loss of this premium would have major consequences for  spending power.</p>

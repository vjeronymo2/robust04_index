			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Roll over, Beethoven: Truth of the Matter - The use and misuse of great music Of the many things which the world does not need, a new recording of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony ranks right up there, along with Prozac, pet rocks and party conferences. I know Herbert von Karajan advised young conductors to throw away their first 100 versions of the work (pity the poor audiences) but there comes a point when enough is enough, when the obsessive pursuit of perfection becomes a futile exercise in megalomania. I was forced to pause, however, when Franz Welser-Most's new interpretation of this classic work with the London Philharmonic popped through the post this week. It was not the gaudy fireworks-by-moonlight scene adorning the sleeve, nor the performance itself, which is more than competent. It was the obtrusive white sticker on the front of the compact disc cover: 'Includes music from Hovis and Pedigree Chum TV ads'. I know that in the age of the sound-bite and the sample, in a world where you can walk into a record shop and buy an album called Bach to Basics, this should not come as a shock; but it did. This is Beethoven's Fifth, for goodness sake, probably the most famous piece of music in the western world, and someone is honestly trying to use it to sell brown bread and dog food? And worse still, someone is trying to sell the compact disc by advertising that it is used to advertise brown bread and dog food? My mind reeled as I tried to recall the offending items but my memory, and my imagination, drew a blank. Hovis: a wholesome family sits at the kitchen table glowing with health and well-regulated fibre intake - da-da-da-da. It just didn't pan out. Pedigree Chum: a cuddly spaniel bounds towards its bowl of nourishing goodies - da-da-da-da. No way. These are the opening bars which Beethoven reputedly described as 'fate knocking at the door'; could he really have been referring to a kennel? My curiosity was getting the better of me; I had to make a few calls. The man from Hovis was brisk and confident. 'No, we've never used Beethoven's Fifth, nor any Beethoven for that matter. We use Dvorak, the second movement of the New World Symphony.' He was so assertive, it sounded like the most logical pairing in the world. 'And there are no plans to use Beethoven?' 'None.' There was no doubt in this man's mind, Hovis and Dvorak was a marriage baked in heaven, and any interlopers were not welcome. The woman from Pedigree Chum was less strident, and had to check: 'No, there is no record of us having used Beethoven at all.' She sounded relieved. 'I mean it just doesn't seem like music for one of our ads. It's a bit heavy, isn't it?' I nervously agreed that, yes indeed, it was a bit heavy, but in truth I had lost all confidence in my ability to match world-famous pieces of music with pet food products. If she had said that Pedigree Chum had been using Siegfried's Funeral March for the last 20 years, I would not have batted an eyelid. But she did not say that; instead she added that the music they were 'famous for' (where have I been all these years?) was Dvorak's New World Symphony. The mystery was solved. It was a cock-up, the right sticker on the wrong compact disc cover. My instincts were proved correct; no-one can use the music of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony to push products. My ideals remained intact, the great man could once again bask in the purity of his genius. A final call, to EMI, and the end to my nightmare: the sticker was an innocent mistake, and should not be appearing in the shops. Simple as that. But the issue will not go away. Does listening to snatches of classical (or, as some would have it, 'serious') music as an inducement to buy essentially trivial products really do any harm? The reason we, as a culture, continue to churn out Beethoven Fifths is in ritualistic affirmation of our sophistication and love of high art. This, we continually tell ourselves, is what we are capable of; this is the peak of human achievement. It may have taken place some 200 years ago, but we are still recording it, still travelling to see it performed, still discussing it. Are these sentiments not infected when such works of sublime intent are wrung through the warped minds of some crazed creative department? Or is it just a 'harmless bit of fun', that clarion-call of our times? Beethoven, a most complex man, lived in a much simpler world. I find it difficult to conceive of how fate knocking at the door would sound in 1994, but I have the horrible feeling that after the first two notes, there would be a commercial break.</p>

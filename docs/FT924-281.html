			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Range of measures Prof Tweedie's stated aim is to encourage the market to look at a range of measures of company performance. He is surely right to insist that earnings per share, however calculated, is only part of the story. The new cash flow statement invites the market to place more emphasis on cash flow per share. As with earnings, though, investors will have to grapple with a plethora of alternatives. Basic measures of cash flow - taking pre-tax profits plus depreciation - ignore some strong demands on corporate liquidity. Tax, interest charges and preference dividends are hardly paid at the discretion of the company. Equally, some capital expenditure can be deferred from year to year, but routine maintenance costs are a drain on resources. That suggests no single measure of cash flow per share will be sufficient. Companies with high capital expenditure will be flattered on one measure, but suffer if the cash earnings line is drawn lower in the cash flow statement. Whether most investors will have time for such detailed analysis remains an open question. The new shape of the balance sheet, proposed in the recent exposure draft on accounting for capital instruments, will reveal more about how companies are funded. But again, the market will have to decide whether the new balance sheet category of non-equity shares - which covers instruments such as preference shares - should be counted as debt or equity for the purpose of gearing.</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Survey of International Legal Services (5): Shift to client power puts curb on costs - Diana Bentley investigates attitudes to alternative billing and value for money Times change. In the ebullient 1980s large legal fees often merged imperceptibly into total transaction costs and were accepted with the optimism and confidence which characterised most of the decade. But the grim realities of the recession have fostered new attitudes to lawyers' remuneration, and established practices unlikely to be discarded even in improved economic conditions. 'There has definitely been a shift in power to the client,' says John de Forte of de Forte Associates, consultants to the profession. 'The pressure on costs which started in other fields like auditing really predated the recession - the growth in the 1980s intensified competition and caused the breakdown of loyalty to advisers but the recession has accelerated the changes,' he says. Methods of costing which were considered common by late 1993 show a marked difference from the 1980s. They reflect the flexibility and control now considered to be important elements in managing legal services. It is incumbent on in-house lawyers especially to monitor and reduce legal costs. Most recent trends indicate that lawyers and clients have increased the efficiency and reduced the cost of the delivery of legal services, but Mr de Forte believes that new practices, are not cyclical, but structural, and here to stay. While most commercial and litigation work has traditionally been costed on an hourly fee basis, 'Generally there is now a disenchantment with hourly rates,' says Derham O'Neill of Clifford Chance, London. Hourly rates for large City firms can average Pounds 260 for a partner, Pounds 140 for an assistant; or Pounds 170 and Pounds 100 respectively in the provinces. 'Regional firms have done well recently, often because of their lower hourly rates,' notes Mr de Forte. Rates now are often agreed before work is begun, and are subject to negotiation. Despite the fact that rates for partners or senior lawyers may vary within a firm to reflect seniority or the complexity of work, many clients, (including government bodies) prefer to strike one rate for all partners for simplicity, and similarly for different levels of support staff. The practice of calling for competitive quotes from candidates for work has had a greater impact. This has become commonplace, although many firms remain uncomfortable with the practice. 'Tendering has always been used - especially by government bodies, but its use has been extended recently,' explains Mr O'Neill. The stimulus has been, largely, dissatisfaction with high fees and the uncertainty which purely hourly costing causes. Though tendering may be dispensed with where highly specialised skills are required, it is established as a sensible means of selecting legal services where a range of firms provide equal expertise and experience. But price is not, and should not always be, the deciding factor in selection. Other key questions, says John de Forte, are how the firm will prevent 'over-lawyering', and guarantee the proper relationship between the matter and the expertise it requires. 'Clients are increasingly keen to get value for money,' says Derham O'Neill. 'That can mean the selection of fewer firms, but ones which can deliver appropriate quality - whether for specialised or routine work.' Diana Miller, Legal &amp; General group legal services manager, agrees. 'The quality of the advice is always paramount and in-house counsel are well placed to judge it, but we also consider closely the services we want, and generally need service that is cost effective,' she says. Another marked trend is the move to fixed fees, or fees agreed for the whole job, but they also present problems for firms: 'Clients like fixed fees - lawyers find them difficult,' says Derham O'Neill. While lawyers' experience of the average relevant transaction can suggest the appropriate fee, external factors can invalidate estimates causing problems for clients and lawyers. 'Lawyers need to get better at developing fuller specifications on what is and what is not covered by the fee,' Mr O'Neill adds. For a proper assessment of value for money, clients often need more information on what the fee covers. Usually, distribution and use of resources is critical. The awkward question remains: who bears the additional cost where the fixed fee is understated, but capping (the practice by which the firm agrees to take the risk on the override) is not yet common in the UK. On top of hourly rates, premium billing - or the addition of a lump sum to reflect the complexity of the case and degree of responsibility - was common in the 1980s, but Diana Miller says that premiums are now used less; the market for legal services is more competitive, and it is more usual for clients to expect a discount if for some reason the matter does not proceed, or is unsuccessful. For companies rationalising their legal services and able to provide regular work of a predictable type, volume discounts can secure efficient services - their growth is a sign of more flexible billing practices. Even given these charges, the profession can look for no comfort from its most senior members. As recently as October 1993, in an address to the Bar's annual conference, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice, attacked the fees charged in particular to large corporate clients by solicitors and barristers in contentious matters which, he said, were often out of all proportion to a reasonable rate for the job. Elsewhere, particularly in the US, where excessive billing has fostered the growth of legal cost audit services, the way in which lawyers charge is similarly being scrutinised. But in the US, too, options for charging are greater. Contingency fees for litigation have long been permitted in the US. Banned in England as contrary to public policy, they are not permitted, either, in civil law jurisdictions such as Germany, France and Belgium. Despite arguments that they improve access to legal remedies, recent utterances from Lord Taylor and others who fear they may boost speculative litigation, suggest that contingency fees are unlikely to be approved in England. But some formal changes are occurring. By this spring, a conditional fee system approved by the Lord Chancellor's department will be permitted, under which a lawyer may charge an 'uplift' or percentage of the normal fee where the action is successful, but such fees will be restricted to personal injury and insolvency cases. The trend towards more efficient delivery of legal services, with manning as an important aspect of this, should continue. Mr O'Neill expects that there will be increased pressure to appoint smaller teams on matters involving more multi-skilled lawyers. For law firms, this will require broader training and an emphasis on highly organised integrated delivery of services to reduce client costs. 'What clients want is transparency and a clear idea about how work will be handled and by whom,' he says. Ms Miller of Legal &amp; General agrees. 'Legal fees are the same as any cost in a business - suppliers of services can't bill indiscriminately, but need to provide full information of how they charge and demonstrate they are cost effective.' Monitoring of costs is another area where improvements could be made to ensure cost effectiveness, John de Forte says. Law firms need to provide information in advance, details of current billing to date, work in progress and anticipated overall fees compared to budget. 'Regular billing is an increasing trend and a good one which requires discipline,' Derham O'Neill remarks. Overall, Mr de Forte says, controlling costs should be just be one aspect of how you manage the whole relationship.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EXAMPLE OF PROCESS OF TAILORING THE FIRM'S APPROACH TO THE CLIENT'S NEEDS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Issue                    Desired service       Benefit to client  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Client alienated by      Monthly statements    Better able to control existing advisers' fee   tracking time spent   and monitor costs rates and uncertainty    against forecast over costs  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Different fee bands   More cost-effective                          used to reflect       use of law firm                          complexity of the                          work  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Need for fast response   Back-up for each      Deadlines always met and access to legal      partner/fee-earner expertise at all times  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Need for guidance on     Partner/fee-earners   Pro-active advice on how other companies      with industry         best practice within deal with regulatory     experience            the industry issues within the        industry (eg environmental)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Need to reduce           Commercial approach   Commercial objectives litigation costs         to litigation         achieved (eg illustrated through case studies)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- In-house lawyers have    Offer to provide      Costs reduced by to deal with fluctuating lower-level support   keeping staffing levels workload on routine      to in-house team      in-house to a minimum matters  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Proposals, Pitches and Beauty Parades, by J. de Forte, published by FT/Pitman  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed P.S.: "Mr. Leotard Says He Is in Favor of </F> Creating European Intervention Forces"]    [Text] Defense Minister Francois Leotard said on Thursday,  3 March that the Western European Union (WEU), which is expected  to become the armed wing of the European defense structure, "is  still having trouble finding its place between the Atlantic  alliance and the Community." Speaking before the members of the  European Movement, who were meeting for a working day devoted to  Europe's foreign and security policy, he said that "it is  difficult to develop a common European vision in defense  matters" because "the endorsement of the highest political level  is missing," he said.    The minister feels that the boost can only come from the  heads of state and government. Consequently, he came down in  favor of holding a WEU summit which "would symbolically and  concretely manifest the political vitality of this security  instrument of the European Union and the European pillar of the  alliance." It would also provide an occasion to give the WEU "a  strong sense of legitimacy."    Mr. Leotard also proposed pushing further the logic which  led  to the creation of the Franco-German Eurocorps (joined by the  Belgians). He would like to see the establishment of European  intervention forces to be placed under the command of a European  multinational and joint services general staff. He also  expressed his desire to give concrete form to the European  desire to take defense in hand through a "White Paper on  Defense in Europe," along the lines of the white paper on  defense, which has just been submitted in France.    Jennone R. Walker, Bill Clinton's adviser on the National  Security Council, also attended the meeting. Listening  attentively to the minister's speech, she no doubt appreciated  that it was accompanied by a warning against any desire to  create a European defense structure that runs counter to U.S.  interests. "There is a European dimension and a Euro-American  dimension to NATO. Nobody would dream of building up a Europe  that was against the United States," he said.</p>

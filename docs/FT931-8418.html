			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council house sales campaign planned THE FIRST publicity drive for more than six years to encourage council tenants to take advantage of their right to buy their homes is being planned by ministers. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, wants to launch the drive in the spring, perhaps as early as next month. Television advertising and leafletting all council tenants to ensure they are aware of the schemes on offer are among the moves being discussed. No new incentives are intended, but ministers believe that the fall in mortgage rates and the rises in council rents have tilted the balance of advantage for council tenants more towards buying instead of renting than it has been for some time. The move will be greeted with incredulity by the opposition, given that the current number of housing repossessions is at a near record level, and is also likely to re-ignite the controversy over government and political advertising. The timing of the initiative is broadly related to the new government rules giving local councils a greater incentive to sell their property. Mr Norman Lamont announced in the Autumn Statement that there would be a relaxation of the rules, enabling councils to keep all the proceeds of any sales - instead of just one quarter - for a limited period until the end of this year. While the environment department insists the Cabinet Office rules on advertising will be obeyed, the fact that the campaign may well get under way not long before the sensitive six weeks before the local elections in May, will intensify opposition attacks on it. About 1.2m council homes have been sold in England since 1979. Out of 4m or so council tenants, about 1.25m are not on housing benefit, and are thought most likely to be interested in purchases. The publicity will focus on the discounts, of up to 70 per cent off the market value, available to council tenants, and the 'shared ownership' route through which a tenant can buy part of his home. The cash incentive scheme, by which a council tenant can receive a one-off grant of up to Pounds 35,000 to move out of council accommodation into buying a property in the private sector, will also be highlighted. Mr Jack Straw, the shadow environment secretary, told a local government conference yesterday: 'Whatever the rhetoric, the truth is that Tory housing policy is motivated by dogma not democracy.' He said that over 1.5m people lived in homes worth less than they paid for them because they were encouraged to buy during the 1980s. The market alone could not meet housing need, he added, and councils must continue to ensure the direct provision of low-cost quality housing.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Dissident Tories attacked over PO Mr David Martin, Conservative MP for Portsmouth South, hit out in the Commons yesterday at Tory backbenchers who forced the abandonment of plans to privatise Royal Mail. During the resumed debate on the Queen's Speech he underlined his concern about the effect their success 'could well have' on the direction of government policy. Mr Martin resigned as parliamentary private secretary to Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, so that he could speak on the issue. To nods of approval from some of his backbench colleagues Mr Martin complained that the right policy and the right future for Royal Mail had been 'scuppered' by the dissidents. He said it should be left to Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs to argue that free enterprise and the free market could not provide services in the public interest. Mr Martin said that Royal Mail required a great deal more money and freedom to compete with domestic and foreign rivals. The crucial argument was whether this could be done with ministers and civil servants deciding how much money was required, or with private money raised through commercial channels. Mr Martin highlighted the success achieved by British Telecommunications since it took control of the telecommunications network from the Post Office. While criticising the 'ridiculous salaries' paid to top executives in water and electricity undertakings, he said that the overall success of privatisation would help the Conservatives to achieve a further general election victory. During the debate Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced new restrictions on the home leave privileges available to prisoners nearing the end of their sentences, or on compassionate grounds. Insisting the safety of the public had to be paramount, he said that, with immediate effect, a much more rigorous risk assessment would be made before any temporary release was permitted. The new system was likely to lead to a cut of about 40 per cent in the number of prisoners released temporarily. Meanwhile the government hopes to secure an early change in the law authorising confiscation of money and property acquired through criminal activities in the six years before a conviction. A bill to achieve this objective is in preparation and Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, told the Commons yesterday that it would have government support if introduced as a private member's measure by a backbench MP. The bill would also ensure that the confiscation order could not be avoided by serving a term of imprisonment in default. The ballot for the right to introduce private members' bills will be held on Thursday.</p>

Mr. Selami pointed out the losses of the Albanian economy  caused by the sanctions imposed on former Yugoslavia, which  amount to [words indistinct] electric power, bitumen, etc. Also  the only railway line which links Albania with Europe has been  closed, creating great difficulties in the transport of  commodities. In these conditions, Mr. Selami demanded that the  international community and the European Community must help  Albania to compensate the losses caused by the embargo. Mr.  Selami suggested that compensation should cover material  assistance for the population mostly affected by the embargo and  creation of facilitations for the customs and transport.    Although Albania is experiencing the economic consequences  of  the embargo, Mr. Selami said, it is seriously committed to  observe it. We are against the lifting of the embargo against  Serbia and Montenegro unless a peaceful solution is found in  former Yugoslavia. The lifting of the embargo, Mr. Selami said,  would be a favour for the aggressor and another chance for  greater difficulties in the efforts to resolve the conflict in  Bosnia and prevent its expansion in Kosova and broader. If the  international community is willing to prevent the further  expansion of the conflict and to learn from the mistakes in  Bosnia, it should condition the lifting of the embargo with the  correct resolving of the conflict.</p>

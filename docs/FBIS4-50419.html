			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Xu Furui (6079 4395 3843) and Wu Ping (0702 </F> 1627)]    [Text] Copenhagen, 16 May (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  [CCPPCC] National Committee, called on Danish Prime Minister  Poul Nyrup Rasmussen here this morning. Lauding Sino-Danish  friendship, the two leaders noted great potential and broad  prospects for bilateral cooperation.    Li Ruihuan spoke first, saying he was delighted to meet  Prime  Minister Rasmussen and thanking the Danish Government for warm  hospitality. He told Rasmussen that China is very happy to see  the two countries expanding cooperation in various fields and  enjoying a deepened understanding in recent years as a result of  expanded exchanges at senior levels, adding that rapid growth in  bilateral trade and economic cooperation has brought about a big  increase in trade volume.    The Danish prime minister said that he was deeply impressed  by China's economic development and described Danish-Chinese  relations as very good, expressing his optimism about future  cooperation.    At Rasmussen's request, Li Ruihuan gave an outline of  China's  efforts to promote socialist democratic politics and the role of  the CPPCC. He said: The CPPCC is an important organizational  form of the system of multiparty cooperation and political  consultation led by the CPC. Different from Western  parliaments, the CPPCC's main function is to conduct political  consultation and democratic supervision and to take part in the  administration and discussion of state affairs. It conducts  consultations on the state's general political principles,  important matters in the political life, and major issues  related to economic and social development. Moreover, the CPPCC  and its members exercise effective democratic supervision over  the enforcement of the Constitution and other laws and  regulations, the implementation of key policies, and the  execution of duties by state organs and functionaries. All  CPPCC members are empowered with the democratic right to make  criticism and air dissent. By practicing democracy in such a  way, the CPPCC enables the people to have full consultation on  major issues while exercising their democratic rights through  election and voting. It also enables the people to exercise  extensive democratic supervision, as well as legal supervision.  Such a way of practicing democracy can help the CPC bring into  play its leadership role and the democratic parties take part in  the administration of state affairs. It is conducive to  ensuring respect for the majority's common aspiration while  taking into account the minority's reasonable demand, thereby  seeking maximum common understanding of the whole people and  preserving the stability and harmony of the entire society.    Li Ruihuan added: Over a long period of time, the CPPCC has  made important contributions to consolidating and developing  political stability and unity; to facilitating reform, opening  up, and modernization construction; and to promoting the  motherland's reunification and development, as well as  friendship and cooperation with the peoples of various  countries. In the future, it will further carry out its  functions, actively develop exchange and cooperation with the  peoples of various countries, and make unremitting efforts to  promote world peace and development.</p>

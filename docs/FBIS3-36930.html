The troops were engaged in  fighting with armed gangs some 400 times on the Tajik-Afghan  border and killed 700 of them. On that border section alone  they confiscated five tonnes of narcotics, as well as other  contraband to the sum of four billion roubles. Those figures  were cited by Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev,  commander-in-chief of the Russian frontier guard troops,  published today in the new weekly GRANITSA ROSSII (Russia's  Border). Its first issue was brought out today.    The issue opens with an appeal by Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin, who believes the newspaper should become an  effective instrument of the implementation of Russia's border  policy, of the military-patriotic education of frontier guard  troops and the population in the interests of ensuring reliable  protection of Russia's borders and its territorial integrity.    The weekly gives wide coverage to the Army service of  Russian  frontier guard troops at the borders of Russia and the new  commonwealth and carries reports from the Pacific coast, the  south Kurile islands and other regions, as well as from the  Tajik-Afghan border where the situation has not changed much of  late. The troops are continuing their routine studies and  training sessions.</p>

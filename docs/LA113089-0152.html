			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARLY START PERPLEXES COACHES;  </P> <P> BASKETBALL: POSTSEASON TOURNAMENT, EXAMS PROMPT OPENING OF PAC-10 CONFERENCE  SEASON IN NOVEMBER.  </P> <P> It's not just the holiday season that seems to start earlier every year. So  does the Pacific 10 Conference basketball season.  </P> <P> It's still November and UCLA will play Washington tonight in Hec Edmundson  Pavilion while USC opens at Washington State in Pullman.  </P> <P> Why so early?  </P> <P> When the Pac-10 voted to add a postseason tournament, it lost a week for  conference games. For the last three seasons, leftover games were played in the  week before Christmas. But those dates, in some cases, conflicted with final  exams.  </P> <P> So, in the spring of 1987, conference athletic directors voted to play the  games, starting this year, in the first weekend in December.  </P> <P> Two other conference games are scheduled for tonight.  </P> <P> Only California and Stanford, which were scheduled to meet Saturday but decided  to move the game to the last week of the season, will not open conference play  this week.  </P> <P> "It's really a difficult time to start the conference season, particularly for  a new coach with a new team," said Washington Coach Lynn Nance, who was hired  by the Huskies last April after leading St. Mary's to a 25-5 season and the  championship of the West Coast Athletic Conference.  </P> <P> Nance is one of three first-year Pac-10 coaches to make conference debuts  almost before they have had time to meet their players.  </P> <P> Two other newcomers -- Bill Frieder of Arizona State and Jim Anderson of Oregon  State -- will oppose each other tonight at Corvallis, Ore.  </P> <P> For ASU, the conference opener is also its season opener.  </P> <P> "I don't think any of us coaches like to play league games this early," UCLA  Coach Jim Harrick said. "But you do what you have to do."  </P> <P> Next season, Pac-10 games are scheduled for Nov. 29.  </P> <P> One obvious solution to the problem, of course, would be to discontinue the  postseason tournament. That possibility, supported by the coaches, will be  discussed at league meetings Dec. 7-10 in San Francisco.  </P> <P> This season's conference tournament will be played March 8-11 at Tempe, Ariz.,  but the Pac-10 has not yet committed to a tournament site for 1991, conference  spokesman Mike Matthews said.  </P></p>

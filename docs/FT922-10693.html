			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Markets resist the confusion IF there is any sense of crisis about this week's events in Bonn and elsewhere, it has not communicated itself to the country's financial markets, at least not so far. The confusion surrounding the choice of the new foreign minister has left markets fairly cold. Dealers said the stock market regarded it as just an 'interesting and embarrassing aside', since it did not call the stability or durability of the coalition government into question. The gathering strike threat is a different matter. So far, the public sector workers' action has not really bitten hard, though the union looks as if it is prepared for a long strike. In the engineering sector, warning strikes have begun but industry has not really been hit. Thus the DAX index on the Frankfurt stock exchange closed a mere 0.03 points lower at 1,734 yesterday in moderate trading and the D-Mark closed little changed in quiet dealings at around DM1.66 to the dollar. But while markets have discounted the present industrial action, things could be different if it lasts for some time. 'The stock market has been prepared to accept these strikes, but much will depend on what happens in the next week or so in the engineering industry,' says Mr Nigel Longley, a Commerzbank broker. Companies, especially in the car sector, could be shut down quickly if the big IG Metall union hits key suppliers. So while foreign and domestic investors have reacted with sang-froid to the first wave of strikes, their attitude could be very different if German unions confirm the impression of fast-rising labour costs by a determination to press for wage rises much higher than inflation. That could then give share prices a nasty shock.</p>

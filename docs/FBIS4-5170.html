			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Let Us Pave the Way to Peace and Reunification With Great </F> Unity of Whole Nation"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Papers here today  dedicate editorials to the first anniversary of the publication  of the work of the great leader President Kim Il-song "10-Point  Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the  Reunification of the Country" (April 6, 1993.)    The ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole  nation put forward by the great leader is a patriotic one which  embodies the noble desire of the 70 million fellow countrymen to  achieve the reunification and prosperity of the Korean nation  with a 5,000 year-long history through the firm unity of the  whole nation, transcending the differences in ideology, idea and  social system; it is a great banner of national reunification  which indicates a short-cut to tide over the difficulties in  the way of reunification by the strength of the internal force  of the nation and achieve the independent, peaceful  reunification of the country, NODONG SINMUN says, and goes on:    An unprecedented danger of war is being created in the  Korean  peninsula by the adventurous anti-DPRK, anti-socialist moves of  the United States and the South Korean puppets, its followers.    The United States reversed the agreed conclusion reached at  the contact with the DPRK in New York, led the third-round of  the DPRK-USA talks to a rupture, and brought the "nuclear issue"  to the UN Security Council to produce a "presidential statement"  and is now resorting to the military adventure to stifle the  DPRK, more undisguised in a row of international pressure on the  DPRK.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, dancing to the tune of war  against the North turned by the United States, its master, is  fanning up war fever, clamouring for "tough countermove" and  "strong retaliatory punishment" against the DPRK.    The prevailing situation is making it more incumbent upon  the  Korean nation to unite in one mind to defend peace and security  of the country at the risk of their lives, irrespective of  residence, ideology and idea.    All the fellow countrymen in the North, the South and  overseas should turn out as one in the patriotic struggle to  achieve peace and reunification of the country with the great  unity of the whole nation transcending the differences in  ideology, idea and social system, bearing deep in mind the high  aim and noble patriotic idea of the great leader President Kim  Il-song reflected in the ten-point programme of the great unity  of the whole nation.    The principle of national independence should be maintained  in order to implement the programme and achieve peace and  reunification of the country.    The South Korean people should never pardon the Kim Yong-sam  group which is hindering the great unity of the nation, trying  to outlive in reward for selling off the dignity and interests  of the nation to the outside forces, without independence.    The editorial calls upon the whole nation to hold in high  esteem the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il as the centre of unity and  leadership and achieve the great unity and thus open a new  epochal phase in removing the danger of a nuclear war,  preserving peace and hastening reunification in the 90s.</p>

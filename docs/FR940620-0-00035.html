			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To promote consistency in disclosure standards, the Circular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 230 disclosure rules are patterned after the section 6694 rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, therefore, a signing preparer must actually disclose (rather  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than merely advise disclosure of) nonfrivolous return positions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that do not satisfy the realistic possibility standard. Because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury believes the realistic possibility standard is distinct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the not frivolous standard, these amendments to Circular 230  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also distinguish between these two standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the OBRA '93)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made certain changes to the accuracy-related penalty in section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6662 of the Code. The OBRA '93 raised the disclosure standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of the penalties for disregarding rules or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations or a substantial understatement of income tax from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``not frivolous'' to ``reasonable basis''. Also, the OBRA '93  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminated the disclosure exception for the negligence penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The IRS published temporary regulations &sect;1.6662&hyph;7T in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to implement these changes. See 59 FR 12547 (March 17,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994) and 59 FR 14749 (March 30, 1994). These changes narrow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunities to avoid an accuracy-related penalty by disclosing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a return position. In view of these changes, these final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations require non-signing practitioners to advise their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clients of any opportunity to avoid such a penalty by disclosing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a position (rather than to disclose the position).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;10.34(a)(2) of the proposed regulations, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practitioner who advises a client on a position to be taken on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return, or who signs or prepares a return, must inform the client  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the penalties reasonably likely to apply to the client with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the position. One commentator contended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that a practitioner apprise its client of penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably likely to apply intrudes on the practitioner-client  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship and should be deleted. Another commentator stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the requirement was too lenient and should be strengthened  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by requiring practitioners to give their clients written notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of penalties reasonably likely to apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury believes that informing clients of penalties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably likely to apply with respect to return positions is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important component of a practitioner's duty to his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> client. Accordingly, these final regulations retain this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement. The final regulations, however, do not require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practitioners to give the penalty advice in writing. Treasury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that preserving flexibility as to the form in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practitioners advise their clients promotes client understanding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the advice and discourages the use of possibly confusing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boilerplate language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed regulations, a position satisfies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realistic possibility standard if a reasonable and well-informed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis by a person knowledgeable in the tax law would lead such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a person to conclude that the position has approximately a one in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three, or greater, likelihood of being sustained on its merits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commentators stated that the one-in-three formulation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the realistic possibility standard should not be used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of Circular 230. A common criticism was that the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is inherently difficult to administer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The one-in-three test has been adopted for preparers under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 6694. Adopting a different formulation of the realistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility standard in Circular 230 would lead to unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confusion. In addition, quantification of the realistic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possibility standard helps to prevent its erosion. For these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons, the suggestion of some commentators to eliminate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one-in-three test was not adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of determining whether the realistic possibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard is satisfied, the proposed regulations provide that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities that may be taken into account under 26 CFR 1.6662&hyph;4(d)(3)(iii) for purposes of the substantial understatement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty also may be taken into account for purposes of Circular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 230. Some commentators suggested expanding the permissible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities to include well-reasoned treatises, articles in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognized professional tax publications, and other reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tools commonly used by practitioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Treasury believes that the determination of whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> realistic possibility standard is satisfied for purposes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Circular 230 (as well as section 6694) should be grounded in laws  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enacted by politically authorized decisionmakers, not in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpretations of those laws in secondary source materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the suggestion was not adopted. Even though secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources are not authorities for Circular 230 purposes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practitioners may rely in preparing returns on applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities underlying the conclusions in those sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

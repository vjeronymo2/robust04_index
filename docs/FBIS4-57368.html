			<p>BFN     [Text] More than 60 lawmakers have signed an abridged  constitutional reform project that Congress President Gonzalo  Aguirre yesterday handed over to the Electoral Court for  ratification by voters in the national elections scheduled for  27 November.    Yesterday afternoon Aguirre summoned journalists to report  on  the project, during a ceremony that was attended--among  others--by dissidents of the Party for the Government by the  People, Hector Lescano, and the Herreraists who support Alberto  Volonte's candidacy.    The project was submitted under the terms of a paragraph of  Article 331 of the Constitution.    Aguirre said: "This is the crowning point in a long  constitutional reform process in which many political sectors  have engaged. We want to implement this reform, which will begin  a process through which the country will reach true electoral  freedom."    Aguirre added that the idea is that the process should not  be  finalized with this partial-scope referendum, but "next year,  without electoral constraints, we should work in Congress to  complete this process and achieve fuller electoral freedom."    He emphasized "the perseverance of sectors that advocate the  reform" and the "ethical attitude" toward the subject.    "This ceremony marks the beginning of a period that extends  up to the elections, during which we will promote this project,  showing to citizens that they will be the beneficiaries of the  reform because of the freedom they will enjoy," Aguirre said.    The following are some of the main innovations of the  project:    -- Departmental Boards may modify budget bills only to  increase revenues or reduce spending, and may not create jobs on  their own initiative or approve any project that will generate a  deficit.    -- Alternate members may not automatically join Departmental  Boards.    -- Departmental Board members (councilmen) will earn a  monthly salary that will be established by the board before they  are elected. This also applies to the mayor. The salary may not  be modified during the five-year tenure. Members may not receive  other benefits (like gasoline vouchers, etc.).    -- Departmental Boards will have a new structure, with 31  members in Montevideo, 25 in Canelones, and 21 in the other  departments.    -- The amendment of Article 77 of the Constitution allows  citizens to make a so-called "crossed vote," that is, voting for  one party ticket at the national level (president and vice  president of the Republic, Senate, and Chamber of Deputies) and  for another ticket at a department level (mayor and departmental  board members). This means that citizens may vote--for  example--for a National Party candidate for president and for a  Colorado Party candidate for mayor.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIES TO TAPE  </P> <P> The Fabulous Baker Boys (Cinemax Sunday at 9 p.m., Monday at 3 a.m., Tuesday at  10 p.m., Friday at 11 p.m.), Steve Kloves' clear-eyed look at the unpromising  end of show biz, is as salty and sexy and unhousebroken a movie as you could  hope to find -- and one of the most enjoyable American pictures in recent  years. Jeff and Beau Bridges have the title roles as a stale piano-lounge act  resuscitated by sultry new singer Michelle Pfeiffer.  </P> <P> Gorillas in the Mist (TMC Tuesday at 4:30 a.m.) This 1988 film has everything  you could ask for in an adventure picture -- exotic locales, romance, danger  and, finally, tragedy. The film illuminates an extraordinary and unprecedented  communication between a human being and the world's largest primates. At its  center is an absolutely stunning performance by Sigourney Weaver as the heroic  and controversial primatologist Dian Fossey.  </P> <P> Public Enemy (Channel 5 Friday at 2 a.m.) William Wellman's 1931 gangster  classic made James Cagney a star. It contains one of the most famous screen  moments of all -- when Cagney shoves a grapefruit into Mae Clarke's face.  </P> <P> Mildred Pierce (Channel 28 Saturday at 9 p.m.) Joan Crawford won a well-earned  Oscar as a self-made businesswoman caught in a deadly competition with her  daughter, Ann Blyth, over Zachary Scott.  </P></p>

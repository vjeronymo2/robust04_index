			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Fimbra critics ready to attack FIMBRA, the self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers, is expected to be criticised at its annual meeting today over the presentation of its financial position in its accounts, Andrew Jack writes. Mr Michael Bryant, marketing director of Rathbone Brothers, the banking and asset management group, said he would question the board on the accounts recently lodged with Companies House. 'These are accounts that Fimbra would not allow from its own members,' he said. He was disturbed by the fact that the accounts were for the year to March 31 and yet were being discussed only in December, after they were 'horrendously out of date'. He echoed the concern of several members that the accounts omitted adequate details of the commitments by the body to the Investors' Compensation Scheme, the industry-wide arrangement that covers financial advisers, life company salesmen and Stock Exchange firms. The scheme's accounts are published separately, but the Fimbra accounts show the scheme as a creditor for Pounds 486,767. They do not provide a balancing debtor figure to show the amount of levies paid out to the scheme. Other critics of Fimbra's accounts have expressed concern over the decision to change its accounting policy last year to treat deferred subscriptions and registration fees in its balance sheet with capital and reserves, rather than treating them as creditors. Without that balancing item - which amounted to Pounds 2.9m this year - Fimbra would have been technically insolvent.</p>

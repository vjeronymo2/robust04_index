			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The French Vote: A right to hunt ring doves - William Dawkins dreams up an offbeat European treaty designed to suit all tastes and circumstances FRANCE'S hyper-efficient public administration has a plan for every contingency. The boffins from the Ecole Nationale d'Administration have devised a secret counter-treaty. Its sole purpose is to satisfy every possible objection floated by all sides of the French public and as such is only a basis for negotiation. An executive summary has mysteriously come into our hands. Article 1: Subsidiarity. As stated in the original treaty, the European Community shall cease to have any powers in matters where national decision-making is most appropriate. But it shall mind its own business with especial care in the following specific areas. This list can be unilaterally expanded - but not shortened - by any member state: Foods. Cheap lamb, beef and pate de foie from eastern Europe can be kept out according to individual governments' wills. Free pan-Community market access guaranteed for all EC-made unpasteurised cheeses known to the Prince of Wales, wines and perfumes. Sports. The right to hunt ring doves and other small birds across internal frontiers is guaranteed. Article 2. Monetary Union. Single currency programme to take place as envisaged, but the new currency will be called the Francfort and will circulate in parallel with all existing EC currencies. Central European Bank. It will be fully independent from market forces. This is to be a largely ceremonial institution, based in Lyons, at the heart of Europe. The bank's duty will be to promulgate monetary and economic policies decided by European Community finance ministers, on a unanimous vote only. Article 3: Security co-operation. Member states shall make their own arrangements over immigration. Visas will be issued by individual member states and apply to the country of issue only. Customs posts will be strengthened. Article 4: The treaty shall be expanded to include these trade matters. The Common Agriculture Policy and EC steel quota regime are to be reinstated. All Japanese car imports to be cleared through Peugeot headquarters in Paris. Vehicles applying for entry to be left in convenient little underground car park at the back, quite near the metro station. Parking fees from FFr500 (Pounds 56) per vehicle per day. Import licences granted by unanimous vote in the EC council of ministers. Article 5: Ratification. This treaty can only come into effect on achieving a simple majority by simultaneous referendum in all 12 member states. After ratification, any member state can opt out of all or part of the treaty for a temporary period or for ever if its parliament wishes.</p>

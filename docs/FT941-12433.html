			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / A Major diversion off the A1: Dominic Lawson says the Tory party should foot Gillian Taylforth's libel bill We are told, with a certainty and roundness of figure that should immediately arouse suspicion, that Gillian Taylforth and her lover, Geoff Knights, will have to pay bills of Pounds 500,000 as a result of losing their libel action in the High Court against The Sun newspaper. For those of you who have spent the past few weeks on another, less prurient planet, Taylforth, an actress, claimed that The Sun libelled her by publishing that she had fellated Knights across the front seat of a Range Rover parked on the 'hard shoulder' of a slip road leading on to the A1 motorway. It is at least questionable whether such an accusation was defamatory of Taylforth. Most men with whom I have discussed the matter seem to think that the actress should be proud and not ashamed of the (highly co-ordinated) accomplishment of which The Sun wrote. And, more surprisingly perhaps, most of the women with whom I have discussed the matter have said that Taylforth was using a lay-by for its traditional purpose. But, as the judge in the case rightly surmised, the point the jury had to decide was not whether the alleged actions were such as would lead a reasonable member of the public to think less of Taylforth. No, the judge said, it is simply a matter of who was lying to the court: the policeman who said Taylforth did 'it', or the woman herself, who said that she did not. One of these two people must have been lying, said the judge, and the jury, by a majority of 10 to 2, concluded that it was the actress who was telling a whopper. If the jury was right, and who could suggest otherwise, then Miss Taylforth had been committing perjury on a grand scale. However, as everyone seems to be saying, she must now suffer the anguish of footing a Pounds 500,000 bill, included in which are The Sun's costs of finding a private video showing Taylforth doing to a German sausage what the court decided she had subsequently done to Geoff Knights. From that figure of Pounds 500,000, if we believe it, we must deduct the considerable sum Taylforth has received for selling her story to the Daily Mirror. How should she raise the rest? I think the government or, more properly, the Conservative Party, should pay the rest of Taylforth's bill of costs. Were it not for the fact that the public had been so completely gripped by the account given to the High Court of her adventures, then there would have been no other distraction from the awful pounding that Major and colleagues have been receiving over the matter of increased taxation. Taylforth has performed a service of incalculable political value by pushing this enormously embarrassing matter - far more embarrassing than anything which takes place on the nation's slip roads - off the top of the front pages. It is, of course, a mystery why anyone should be surprised at the size of the tax demands which are now landing on doorsteps throughout the land. That these demands would be sent, was spelt out in the clearest possible terms by Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in his Budget speech in November. That speech was cheered to the echo by Conservative MPs, and universally praised by the press. It baffles me why both these two groups should now be complaining, when Clarke has done no more than keep his word. For the Labour Party, however, the matter is strictly analagous to the Gillian Taylforth libel action. Somebody is lying, and they claim that Major was telling porky pies during the last election campaign when he pledged that the Conservatives, if re-elected, would reduce, not increase, taxes. Major, in the spirit of Taylforth, says that he was telling the truth, but that his actions have been misinterpreted. Taylforth says she was merely loosening Knights' trousers to soothe an attack of pancreatitis. Major says he merely had no idea just how badly the economy was doing. What he has not yet admitted is that the economy was in such a terrible state because the government had been giving the D-Mark the same attentions that Taylforth once lavished on a German sausage. In public, too. Dominic Lawson is editor of the Spectator.</p>

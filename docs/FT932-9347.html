			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Fraud denied by car company ALLEGATIONS that Nissan Motor Corporation, the Japanese carmaker, was behind a multi-million-pound tax fraud were denied yesterday at the Old Bailey by a senior executive from the company. The claim was made by Mr Michael Sherrard QC, counsel for Mr Michael Hunt, a director with Nissan UK, the former British car importer, who denies conspiring to defraud the Inland Revenue of Pounds 97m in corporation tax. Mr Sherrard suggested that the fraud may have arisen by Nissan Motor Corporation Carriers (NMCC), the transport subsidiary of the Japanese carmaker, keeping its freight charges artificially low. Meanwhile, agents employed to ship the cars charged Nissan UK significantly higher prices. The 'lion's share' of the difference was then creamed off into other accounts, including one opened in Switzerland by Mr Friedrich Pannosch, an Austrian transport consultant, into which huge sums were passed. This was carried out with the full knowledge of its Japanese parent company (NMC), he said. The accusations were denied by Mr Eisuke Kukita, an NMCC manager who ran the company's European operations in the late 1980s. 'I cannot believe that,' he replied. He denied his company's freight charges were significantly lower than normal market prices, or that they had been artificially reduced. Mr Kukita agreed that in March 1990, in Oslo, he met Mr Tore Thorsen, a Norwegian shipping agent, who is also accused by the Inland Revenue of taking part in the conspiracy. Mr Kukita denied, however, that at that meeting he was shown a financial breakdown of the alleged fraud, including details of payments to Mr Pannosch. Mr Kukita agreed that after an introduction from Mr Thorsen, he and two other senior Nissan executives met Mr Pannosch in Vienna in April 1990. He denied the purpose of the meeting was to 'check out' Mr Pannosch because NMC was soon to end its long-standing franchise deal with Nissan UK. Mr Pannosch had taken them on a simple weekend sightseeing trip around the city, Mr Kukita told the court. They had, however, discussed business, he agreed: 'It happens to be part of the Japanese make-up, but we find it difficult to talk about anything other than business,' he said. The trial continues today.</p>

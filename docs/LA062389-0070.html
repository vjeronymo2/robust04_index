			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEVELOPER GETS OK TO SCRAPE RIDGE TOP  </P> <P> The Glendale City Council will allow a developer to scrape off the top of a  prominent ridge in order to fill in a hole and complete a controversial  subdivision in the Verdugo Mountains.  </P> <P> The council's decision this week gives Gregg-Gangi Development Co. permission  to cut up to 70 feet from a ridge to obtain a quarter-million cubic yards of  earth needed to complete the Oakmont View subdivision.  </P> <P> Otherwise, the developers would have had to truck in the dirt needed to fill  the six-acre hole, which would have disrupted the quiet hillside neighborhood  of expensive homes for at least 1 1/2 years, city officials said.  </P> <P> "I don't think that I have ever agonized over a decision as much as I have  agonized over this one," said Councilman Larry Zarian.  </P> <P> City officials said developers miscalculated how much dirt they needed to  complete the 197-lot subdivision of exclusive view homes above the Oakmont  Country Club. The project, approved in 1976, lacks about 25,000 truckloads of  dirt needed to fill in an area for the final 25 lots, worth at least $5  million.  </P></p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Letter: Detailed accounts needed of political donations Sir, The Conservative party is playing the game of political donations too close to its chest ('Tory party to return Nadir funds if they were stolen', June 16). Regardless, it would appear that Asil Nadir is not the only foreign national to donate money to the Conservative party during the past decade and this raises the question of accountability. The number and amount of these donations calls into question the system of political funding in the UK and whether or not donations are a means of purchasing influence and other favours. It is time that all political parties were obliged, by law, to publish detailed accounts, including names of donors, to allow the public to assess whether there are any implications.

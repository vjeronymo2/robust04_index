			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Deals for UK mission in India The UK's biggest-ever trade mission - a week-long tour to four cities in India - notched up further successes yesterday when two small UK companies signed distribution and technical agreements with Indian concerns. The mission, led by Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister (pictured left), aims to win deals in the fast growing Indian infrastructure market and help smaller UK companies secure business. Speaking in Bombay, Mr Needham pointed to the success of Checkpoint Security Services, a small Reading-based company, which has signed an agreement with Bradman of India enabling distribution throughout India of its cheque security products. Mr Needham said this showed it was not only big companies which could success in overseas markets. 'I would encourage the small- and medium-sized companies to explore the Indian market,' he said. Another company, Uxbridge-based High Value Horticulture, secured three tie-ups with Indian companies to supply technical knowhow, expert advice and specialist planting material for food processing and horticulture.</p>

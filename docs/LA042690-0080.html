			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STRING OF SUCCESSES MARK MARTINEZ'S CAREER ;  </P> <P> IN PIERCE'S BRAZEN FRESHMAN, MOST FOES DISCOVER THAT THEY HAVE MET THEIR MATCH  </P> <P> Al Martinez is in a rather peculiar dilemma, one that could jeopardize his  chances for a men's junior college division singles title in this week's 91st  Ojai Valley Tennis tournament.  </P> <P> He has played too well this season.  </P> <P> Martinez, a Pierce College freshman, seldom is challenged by his junior college  competition. Consequently, his on-court concentration has atrophied. He often  appears bored during matches, chats with friends in the stands and watches  passers-by.  </P> <P> "He hasn't really been pressed," Pierce Coach Paul Xanthos said. "Right now, I  don't think he's in the best condition. . . . He could have his hands full at  Ojai."  </P> <P> Endurance will be crucial in the tournament, which begins today and runs  through Sunday. If he wins today, Martinez will play two singles and two  doubles matches on Friday and Saturday.  </P> <P> An injured rotator cuff and a bruised wrist had kept Martinez out of  competition for the past three weeks. Still, Martinez (14-2) enters the  tournament seeded No. 1 in his singles division.  </P> <P> He made rapid recovery from the layoff in his first match back Tuesday,  defeating Moorpark standout Mike Studebaker, 7-5, 6-1.  </P> <P> Other area players who could challenge Martinez at Ojai include Jason Gary, his  doubles partner at Pierce, Studebaker and Andy VanCott, also of Moorpark.  </P> <P> An upset by one of those three is unlikely. Martinez probably will get his  toughest test from Santa Barbara's John Fox, whose record against Martinez this  season is 1-1.  </P> <P> But Moorpark Coach Bud Davis believes that bumping off Martinez will be a  difficult task.  </P> <P> "Al's in a class all by himself," Davis said. "He'll just keep improving  provided he stays in shape. As long as his desire is there, the kid's got tons  of talent.  </P> <P> "He really doesn't belong at a junior college."  </P> <P> Martinez carved through the Western State Conference schedule, losing just one  match. He also won the No. 1 Division of the Sports Chalet tournament at Golden  West College. He finished ninth in the Southern California Tennis Assn. men's  open division standings.  </P> <P> Martinez, 19, also defeated Jason Netter, UCLA's top singles player, in a  preseason match. "Killed him," Martinez said of the 6-4, 6-1 victory. "And  (UCLA Coach) Glen Bassett was watching the match."  </P> <P> The brazen confidence of Martinez seems unwavering, which often unnerves  opponents.  </P> <P> "Al doesn't even talk, he goes out and hits the ball," Gary said. "Kids come  out and play Al and they're scared the minute they walk on the court. They just  feel like they're gonna lose."  </P> <P> Opponents might lose, but their demise often is drawn out.  </P> <P> "He doesn't have the killer instinct," Xanthos said. "He'll beat a kid 6-0 and  then he starts toying and gets himself in trouble."  </P> <P> Martinez has a different theory.  </P> <P> "I totally have the killer instinct," he said. "But when I'm playing someone, I  figure if he's going to come all the way out here to play me, I might as well  give the kid a workout. They start winning games and getting all pumped up and  I just finish the match off."  </P> <P> Martinez, born and raised in Chile, moved to Calabasas in the seventh grade.  Opting to play on a South American professional circuit, he dropped out of  Calabasas High during his senior year.  </P> <P> An outclassed Martinez struggled and qualified for just one tournament, losing  in the first round. The experience didn't sour him on trying again -- perhaps  next year.  </P> <P> "I think I might go to Hawaii on the circuit and shoot down to South America,"  Martinez said. "I think it's time to start winning some money. Start getting my  stuff together and play some serious tennis."  </P> <P> Starting today.  </P></p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Buy-out at Sears' Galliford division SEARS, the speciality retailer, yesterday announced the management buy-out of its Galliford Housebuilding division for Pounds 27.1m. The disposal will give rise to an extraordinary loss of Pounds 28m, which is the difference between the purchase price and net assets. This will be included in Sears results for the year ended January 31. Mr Liam Strong, chief executive, said: 'The disposal of Galliford completes the exit programme from housebuilding activities that Sears announced in 1990 and enables us to concentrate on our retail and home shopping markets.' The buy-out, financed by Schroder Ventures, has already paid Pounds 24.2m cash with the balance due in October. This will amount to Pounds 500,000 cash and Pounds 2.4m in tax losses to be transfered from the subsidiary to Sears. Galliford, which has nothing to do with Galliford plc, the northern construction company, has been loss-making for three years. However, its losses before interest have fallen from about Pounds 16m three years ago to Pounds 7.5m on sales of Pounds 48.9m in the last financial year. It has raised Pounds 10m of equity, primarily from Schroder Ventures and its affiliated funds, and Pounds 16m of debt from the Midland Bank.</p>

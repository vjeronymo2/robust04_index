He added that a decisive approach by NATO would play a  positive role. With the ending of the blockades of Sarajevo and  the Washington agreement between the Bosnian Croatians and  Muslims the tone was more hopeful, and this had created a wider  background for consideration of what the CSCE could do to solve  the Yugoslav problem.    Part of the main stream of activity should include the  renewal of long-term missions to Kosovo, Vojvodina and Sandzak.  Vacek said that the Belgrade authorities could, in exchange for  making compromises in this direction, expect certain concessions  from the CSCE, above all the reacceptance of Serbian-Montenegrin  Yugoslavia as a member.    The question of Macedonia's request for full participative  status in the CSCE had not yet been dealt with, Vacek said. The  question was being blocked by Greece and Albania, he said,  adding that it could not be ruled out that Albania would no  longer oppose the request, but Greece continued to disagree with  it. However, Vacek said it was positive that Macedonia's  request had not been withdrawn from the agenda of the council,  whose session has been running since Wednesday [2 March].    An extensive debate had been held on Georgia, with the  questions continuing to be debated of how the CSCE should  broaden its activity in South Osetia, and how the CSCE could  contribute to the achievement of political balance in the area.  This depended on the solution of the conflict in Abkhazia,  generally considered as a more complicated part of the Georgian  crisis. Vacek pointed out that here there existed a fundamental  division of the work and responsibility of the UN and the CSCE.  One of the results of the present session of the Committee of  Senior Officials in Prague could be a decision on the joint  activity of the two institutions, he said.</p>

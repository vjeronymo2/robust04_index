			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Technology (Worth Watching): Data in the style of your choosing IT'S all very well to have the latest grapical user interface on your personal computer, but if you are extracting data from a mainframe which has less sophisticated presentation standards the data cannot be displayed in the same way. To try and overcome this kind of problem, KPMG Management Consulting, of London, is launching a service which aims to bring together corporate information and display it on the PC in the way each user wants. KPMG is setting up a showcase demonstration in its own offices of its ISD (integrating services at the desktop) concept. As well as putting together hardware and software from a number of vendors, KPMG will be developing agentware - software which translates data coming into the PC so that it is in the format the user wants - rather then the way that it was written. According to KPMG the business advantages of ISD outweigh the costs: organisations can expect pay-offs of three to four times their investment through proper desk-top integration, according to KPMG research.

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Ruutel falls short of Estonia target ESTONIA'S first post-Soviet presidential elections appeared headed for an inconclusive result early today as former communist leader Arnold Ruutel failed to win an outright majority in most areas, Reuter reports from Tallinn. Mr Ruutel, chairman of parliament since 1983, had captured 43.1 per cent of the total vote based on results from 17 out of 21 cities and counties, including the capital Tallinn, election officials said. His nearest rival, Mr Lennart Meri, a former foreign minister and leader of the conservative Fatherland alliance, took 29.55 per cent. The early results suggested Mr Ruutel would fall short of the 50 per cent plus one vote needed to become the Baltic state's first freely elected president since emerging from half a century of Soviet rule. This means that the new president is likely to be chosen by parliament, also elected yesterday. Mr Meri's Fatherland alliance was widely expected to form the biggest party in parliament, but results of that vote will not be known until today. Russians, who make up about a third of the country's 1.6m population, were barred from voting because under Estonian law they have no automatic right to citizenship. In the presidential vote, Mr Rein Taagepera, a Californian university professor of Estonian birth, was close behind Mr Meri with 23.52 per cent, while National Independence Party candidate Lagle Parek took 3.83 per cent.</p>

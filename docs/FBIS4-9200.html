			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F> Serbian Krajina, and Borislav Mikelic, prime minister of the  republic of Serbian Krajina, in Knin on 21 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Martic] I am (?firmly) convinced that the  government will be capable of rising to the task before it. It  is composed of all parties -- only the Radicals did not join  owing to some reason of theirs, but I do not wish to elaborate  -- however, regardless of the parties in question, and judging  by the individuals, I believe that the government is quite a  good one and that the people and the parliament will very soon  be able to assess the work of this government. Personally, I  think that it [the government] will be a good one.    [Mikelic] I think that we are now a entering a phase in the  peace process that has been signed, and that means that we need  to make this connection selectively, from people who are going  from their positions toward production [sentence as heard]. On  the other hand, we must see which companies we will tackle  first, in individual municipalities where they have a  perspective; at the same time we need to stop certain declines,  particularly in areas where state-owned property suffered  significant damage [sentence as heard]. I am extremely glad  that this program was given general support today. I am also  glad that the Serbian Democratic Party [SDS], and its president,  Milan Babic, have managed to rise above the parliamentary  coalition that used to exist in the assembly, and that he  [Babic] has now truly placed the national interest of the  Serbian people at the forefront. I am glad that he came alone  to this post of foreign minister. The remaining ministers will  surely be capable of shouldering the burden I mentioned earlier  in my address.</p>

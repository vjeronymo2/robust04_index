			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Rolfe &amp; Nolan Profits of Rolfe &amp; Nolan, the futures and options computer bureau and software specialist, rose from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 1.57m pre-tax for the year to February 28. The outcome included a deficit from the North American operations amounting to Pounds 1.09m. Losses from this source were significantly reduced in the second half and further improvements are expected. Group turnover expanded from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 12.7m, of which Pounds 3.05m (Pounds 3.27m) came from the US. Earnings per share fell to 12.9p (17.7p) after a higher tax charge of 61.9 per cent (50.4 per cent) due to US losses not relievable against tax. A final dividend of 5.195p makes an 8p (7.2p) total.

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Economics: Figures should confirm recovery THIS week should bring statistical confirmation that the UK economic recovery is progressing well, while industrial production in France and Italy continues to fall. Provisional GDP figures on Friday are expected to show that British economy grew at an annual rate of about 1.5 per cent in the three months from March to the end of June. Analysts have been steadily upgrading their forecasts for GDP this year, with the Treasury's latest survey of independent economists indicating real growth of 1.6 per cent in 1993 and 2.6 per cent next year. Although official figures give only a partial insight into the UK's trading performance (the June figures for trade with non-EC countries are out on Wednesday), all the signs are that Britain is experiencing a well balanced recovery. Figures last week showed manufacturing output growing strongly, led by investment goods production. At the same time, unemployment has fallen further while inflationary pressures are subdued. This week's figures are expected to confirm that consumer demand continues to grow modestly, with only a gradual pick-up of bank and building society lending. Such a recovery may not win many votes - in fact it may almost go unnoticed by many people - but it offers the best chance of the UK enjoying a sustained upturn while gradually reducing its current account balance of payments deficit. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, should be able to give a generally upbeat assessment of UK economic developments when he appears for the first time before the Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee on Wednesday afternoon. On the following day, the Maastricht Treaty faces a formidable parliamentary hurdle in the UK when the Commons debates the social chapter and Labour amendments to government policy. Elsewhere, attention will be focused on German money supply. The Bundesbank is expected to announce the June data early in the week. If M3 growth lies within the 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent target range, it will encourage hopes of further interest rate cuts in Germany that could ease the strains in the European Monetary System. The following are some of the week's economic highlights and events. The figures in brackets are the median of economists' forecasts from MMS International, a financial information company.

The order called  on all troops under the command of Chengdu Military Region to  learn from the regiment.    It is learned that since the end of 1992, the regiment has  actively cooperated with and assisted the local government  departments concerned, as well as locally stationed armed police  forces, in successfully intercepting and seizing some 175  vehicles smuggled from foreign countries or regions. Moreover,  the regiment has also refused to accept bribes totalling 3.163  million yuan in cash from smugglers, including drug traffickers,  on more than 80 occasions.

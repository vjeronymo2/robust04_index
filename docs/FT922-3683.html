			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Marston flat after free trade debts BAD FREE trade debts hit full year pre-tax profits from Marston, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-on-Trent brewer in which the Whitbread Investment Company is seeking to reduce its 31.4 per cent stake. Profits for the year to March 28 fell 18 per cent, from Pounds 18.3m to Pounds 15.1m, after exceptional debt charges of Pounds 4.7m and redundancy costs of Pounds 700,000. Profits were 11.5 per cent higher before the debt charges which are now expected to return to 'normal levels' of less than Pounds 1m a year. Mr Michael Hurdle, chairman, said no discussions were being held at the moment about the WIC stake which has to be cut to at least 15 per cent by November to comply with the government's beer orders. 'A number of supposedly potential purchasers of the stake have initiated informal conversations with us over the last few months,' he said, 'but to date we have received no firm proposals.' Any hostile bidder would need a 'deep war-chest,' Mr Hurdle added. 'We are utterly committed to pursuing our own strategy as an independent vertically integrated brewer and retailer.' Trading profits of Pounds 20.4m were 7.4 per cent higher on turnover ahead 8 per cent to Pounds 116m. Though beer volumes declined in line with the industry by more than 6 per cent, the effect was more than offset by improvements in margins. Beer sales through Whitbread fell by nearly 20 per cent but volume growth in other national accounts was 17 per cent higher. The group was now focusing on a smaller number of brands which it expected to benefit from wider distribution through reciprocal trading agreements concluded recently with five other brewers. The agreements will also improve consumer choice in Marston's 866 pubs. pubs increased ahead of expectations, and the 29 catering houses more than doubled earnings. Food sales of Pounds 8.6m now amounted to nearly 25 per cent of the total managed estate's turnover. Volumes in the tenanted estate declined 7 per cent, underlining the severity of the recession. Earnings per share dipped to 12.26p (14.44p) but a final dividend of 3.57p raises the total to 4.91p (4.46p). Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer facing a Pounds 101m takeover bid from Greene King, yesterday announced a reciprocal trading deal with Everards, the Leicester brewer. Everards will introduce Morland's Old Speckled Hen beer to its 143 pubs and free trade customers in the east Midlands, and Morland will distribute Everards Tiger Best Bitter.</p>

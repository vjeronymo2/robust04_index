			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : THE TASTE OF SUGAR IN '70S SOUL AT CELEBRITY THEATRE  </P> <P> A diet of all sweets is no way to eat, and it's not the way to listen to soul  music either.  </P> <P> Sharing a '70s soul bill Friday at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim, the  Stylistics, the Dramatics and the Chi-Lites had their moments, but overall the  program left too much of a confectionary taste. The Stylistics and the  Chi-Lites were almost exclusively dependent on their falsetto lead singers;  only the Dramatics offered a rounded, balanced, satisfying sound.  </P> <P> Sweet sorrow was the emotional savor of the Chi-Lites' 45-minute opening set.  With his plaintive falsetto sounding sturdier than it did on the group's hit  recordings, lead singer Eugene Record mixed tears with sugar to good, if  unvaried, effect.  </P> <P> The headlining Stylistics' set rode on the falsetto voice of Russell Thompkins  Jr. It was a sonic marvel -- soaring, reedy, operatic and inexhaustible. But,  for all that, it wasn't especially endearing, and with little help from  Thompkins' two mates, it was far too much of a good thing.  </P> <P> The Dramatics' zestful set made one wonder what the Detroit group's place in  pop history might be had it been blessed with grade-A material. The five  singers interlocked in classic Temptations style, with the emphasis on two  compelling lead voices -- Ron Banks' assured, effortless falsetto and L. J.  Reynolds' bulldog baritone. But while the Temptations, and all the other A-list  soul vocal groups, have archives full of wonderful songs, the Dramatics' best  material is merely good. That, in the eyes of pop history, makes all the  difference. MIKE BOEHM  </P></p>

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Business gives VAT rules cool response THE FIRST six months of the European single-market rules on value added tax have yielded no benefits for the UK companies affected, a survey by accountants Price Waterhouse shows. Respondents asked to compare the possible benefits - such as the savings in time to carry goods across the European Community - with drawbacks - such as the additional requirements to report trade data - said they had not gained. The abolition of customs checks on January 1 meant companies had to record their own VAT information and compile their own trading records. Smaller exporters and importers are required to file quarterly trade figures to Customs while larger traders must make monthly returns. Customs has calculated that the changeover would cost British business Pounds 100m in the first year but then lead to net annual savings of Pounds 135m. The survey showed that 68 per cent of companies questioned were financially worse off than before. The biggest single difficulty was the completion of the trade statistics. One middle-ranking multinational had found compiling the trade data so complex that it had failed to make any returns. The second main area of complaint was the changes companies had to make to their computer systems. One company spent Pounds 500,000 on its computers. Mr Mike Arnold, VAT partner at Price Waterhouse, said transport companies did not appear to be passing on the benefits of faster transport times either in their schedules or in the prices they were quoting. There were also difficulties in dealing with some other member states, notably France, Italy and Spain. Some countries insisted on foreign companies registering locally for VAT while UK companies had encountered problems in obtaining the VAT registration numbers of customers in these countries. Forty six per cent of the UK companies interviewed said they were not looking forward to the prospect of a second round of VAT changes, intended to simplify the system and planned for 1997. Only 30 per cent were in favour of the next round of changes. Price Waterhouse's respondents ranged from 'smallish' public companies to big multinationals, to which it provided VAT advice in the approach to the single market.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOUR-DAY WEEK  </P> <P> Regarding your article on working the four-day week ("Working 7 to 5 -- Four  Days a Week," Nov. 30), small organizations are caught in a bind between  conflicting demands of two bureaucracies. Labor regulations say that a minimum  of two-thirds of the hourly work force must work a 10-hour day, or none can.  Their totals cannot be combined with the salaried employees. The Air Quality  Management District says make less trips. The Labor Board says not unless  two-thirds agree.  </P> <P> It is almost impossible to comply with AQMD demands when employees' duties are  scattered from the office to sales calls, home visits, school visits, etc. Car  pooling, or cutting down on days just doesn't work in those circumstances, yet  the rules are applied to everyone.  </P> <P> The victim (the commuter) is blamed for the problems of gridlock and smog, but  the blame really belongs on the planners who refuse to give us an efficient  public transportation system and continue to add to the problem by giving us  more freeway lanes instead of spending the tax money to develop an alternative.  </P> <P> BETTS HARLEY  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

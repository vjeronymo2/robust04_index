The dear leader, they noted, put it forward as a strategic  task that should certainly be carried out by a working-class  party and state after the establishment of the socialist system  to clear away the differences between town and country, between  the working class and peasantry by raising the role of the  county as a regional base, and made clear the revolutionary  essence and importance of the question of raising the role of  the county.    They said the work that gives a profound, unique scientific  explanation of the role of the county as a comprehensive unit of  developing the local economy and as a base of economic links  between town and country is a highly important one in which the  dear leader developed in depth the theory of socialist  construction from a new angle with his rare ideological and  theoretical wisdom.    The speakers pointed out that the dear leader's work is a  highly important work that developed the theory of socialist  construction because, by giving a scientific exposition of the  question of raising the position and role of the county in the  socialist rural construction, it provides a firm guideline in  leading the socialist rural construction and socialist  construction as a whole along a straight road to victory.    They said the idea of the regional base expounded in the  work  indicates the way of bringing earlier the complete victory of  socialism and making the popular masses masters of the state and  society by raising the role of the county.    They explained and proved that to strengthen economic links  between town and country as expounded in the work is the mighty  way of finally solving the rural question and dynamically  accelerating the building of socialism and communism.</p>

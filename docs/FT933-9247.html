			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / BOC warning blunts market euphoria: Share price falls as gases company predicts decline in profits THE LONDON equity market's euphoria over world economic recovery was damped yesterday by a profits warning from the BOC Group, the UK-based industrial gases giant. BOC described the world economic environment as 'disappointing' and said its profits would be slightly down for the year to September 30, despite help from the fall in sterling. Its shares fell 9 per cent in heavy trading. The industrial gases industry, which supplies such basic gases as oxygen and nitrogen to manufacturing and construction companies, is seen as a reliable indicator of economic activity. BOC, the world's fourth largest gases company, has the bulk of its sales outside the UK. The company, where Mr Patrick Rich has been chief executive since January 1992, said profits in the first nine months of the current financial year had risen by 4 per cent. It added, however: 'The US recovery in the last few months has slowed, recovery in Australia has stalled, the Japanese economy is still affected by policy paralysis and, while the UK shows recovery, its focus seems to be on sectors which have so far had relatively little impact on gas demand.' BOC said that whereas there was growth in sales to the food and drink industries, there was still depressed demand for gas cylinders in such basic industries as cutting, welding, metal fabrication and construction. Commenting on the share price reaction, the company said: 'The market has the bit between its teeth on economic recovery, and people have been disappointed by what they see as the rather gloomy tone of our statement. But we are being realistic in reporting what we see in the market place.' There was also pressure on BOC's medical business in the US, partly due to the Clinton administration's attempts to control healthcare costs. Forane, its leading anaesthetic, came off patent in the US in January and became subject to generic competition. Since then, BOC said, it had lost up to 42 per cent of its market. The loss should reach 50 per cent in the reasonably near future, though it was then expected to stabilise. Its new anaesthetic, Suprane, which went on sale in the US in April, would not contribute significantly to earnings for some time, the company said. BOC said its vacuum business, which supplies the semiconductor industry, had benefited from an upturn in the US electronics industry and sterling's devaluation last September. The division, which exports from the UK, had seen its profits nearly double this year. 'The exchange rate has helped, and we've taken full advantage of it,' BOC said. The company also argued that economic statistics made it clear that recovery was under way in several of its main markets, and that this should help the gases business eventually. 'When our customers start doing better, we'll get the benefits,' it said. 'We hope that won't take too long.' BOC shares finished the day 63p lower at 651p. The FT-SE 100 Index, which had risen to record heights over the past week on hopes of economic recovery and the prospect of rate cuts in the wake of the currency turmoil in Europe, had looked poised yesterday to break through 3,000 after gaining in 12 of the previous 13 trading sessions. In the event, the index closed down 14.8 points at 2,971.6. Lex, Page 14 BOC Group down 8% in its third quarter, Page 17 London stocks, Page 32</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / GLC spectre continues to haunt Tories: The rumpus over London's County Hall WHEN the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher abolished the Greater London Council in 1986 - exasperated by Mr Ken Livingstone's use of it as a soapbox for the Labour left just across the Thames from the Houses of Parliament - she thought she had neutered County Hall once and for all. Six years later, however, the building is causing ministers as much embarrassment as did Mr Livingstone in his heyday. The current rumpus, which could soon reach the courts, is of the government's making. Put bluntly, it has been unable to make up its mind about the future of the building. Five months ago it agreed that the London Residuary Body, the quango set up to dispose of the GLC's assets, could sell County Hall to the Japanese Shirayama group. The contract included an 'opt-out' clause operable until November. Everyone, not least the residuary body and Shirayama, assumed that the clause was an escape route for the Labour party if it won the general election. And a Labour victory appeared to be the only hope for the year-long campaign by the London School of Economics to move from Aldwych to the grander and more spacious South Bank site. The Conservatives won the general election. But Mr Michael Howard replaced Mr Michael Heseltine as environment secretary and Mrs Gillian Shephard, a strong supporter of the LSE, was one of the new faces at the cabinet table. Mr John Ashworth, the LSE's ebullient director, also had a route to the prime minister through well-placed advocates in the No 10 policy unit. The LSE went into top lobbying gear with its vision of being 'the European social science university' and achieved a coup last week when Mr Howard let it submit a bid. Mr Howard's action, taken after months of speculation, understandably infuriated Shirayama, which had believed that only the Labour party stood in the way of its long-cherished plans for a luxury hotel beside the Thames. It also enraged Sir Godfrey Taylor, chairman of the London Residuary Body, who felt he had been led up and down the garden path by a dithering government. This, plus irritation at the intensity of Mr Ashworth's lobbying and the belief that the Shirayama deal represented better financial value for the London boroughs, led to the residuary body yesterday issuing 'advice' in scathing terms about the LSE's bid, 'strongly urging' Mr Howard to reject it and to delete the opt-out clause. Having got so far, the LSE has problems of its own. With a tight public spending round ahead and university funding particularly constrained, it was made clear to Mr Ashworth that no handouts were on offer. The LSE had to produce a realistic bid. Accordingly, the Pounds 20m bid for the entire site offered by the university in March jointly with Advanta, a German property developer, has been increased to Pounds 65m - less than Shirayama's Pounds 60m offer for the riverside building alone. There are doubts about the LSE's ability to foot the bill. It is not just the direct financial side - in particular the optimistic assumption that its existing site in central London will net Pounds 100m by 1995. The bid also assumes that the LSE can double its postgraduate numbers within four years - which means finding another 2,500 fee-paying, high-calibre social science students, and the staff to supervise them. One LSE governor said: 'If this were France or Germany they'd be giving us the building free for prestige.' The French and Germans, of course, would not have abolished the elected governments of Paris or Berlin in the first place.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     BATTLE FOR THE COUNTY HALL SITE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1986 Abolition of Greater London Council; London Residuary Body established; Inner London Education Authority remains in County Hall  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 1990 Abolition of education authority  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Oct 1990 Collapse of LRB's contract with County Hall Development Group for mixed hotel, residential and office use  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sept 1991 Michael Heseltine grants planning permission for mixed use  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 1992 LRB sells County Hall to Shirayama for pounds 60m with Heseltine's consent (opt-out clause allows government to withdraw from deal until end of November) and rejects pounds 20m bid form London School of Economics and Advanta for County Hall and surrounding sites  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- April 1992 Michael Howard replaces Heseltine as environment secretary after general election  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 1992 Howard takes sale of County Hall out of LRB's hands; LSE bids pounds 65m for hall and surrounding sites  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Aug 1992 LRB 'strongly urges' Howard to reject LSE bid  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

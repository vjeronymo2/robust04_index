However, he refuted the allegations by certain media that  this could lead to a merging between the special services and to  establishment of a "super department" like the Ministry of  Security and Interior Affairs.    The Ministry of Security and Interior Affairs was set up in  early 1993 on the initiative of former Security Chief Viktor  Barannikov under the presidential decree. However, this  ministry was soon abolished by the president himself under the  Constitutional Court's resolution.    The Security Council's official believes that it would be  preliminary to discuss possible composition of the "community of  special services."    According to certain media, the leaders of the Federal  Counter-Intelligence Service, the Foreign Intelligence Service,  the Federal Agency of Governmental Communications and  Information, the Main Department of Defense, the president's  Security Service, the Intelligence Department of the Russian  Armed Forces' General Staff and chiefs of the departments which  are to be created on the basis of the reorganized Interior  Ministry will be included in this body.    According to the Security Council's official, it is unlikely  that the Russian president will make a practical move towards  the coordinating body's establishment. "It is necessary to  determine exactly the authority of each integral part of the new  body before this happens," the official emphasized.</p>

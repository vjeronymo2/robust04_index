			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Now Tuzla and Mostar"] </F>   [Text] So far, so good. The shelling of Sarajevo has been  stopped. NATO has not actually launched any air strikes, but no  one should doubt that its threat to do so was necessary.  Perhaps the Russian intervention was also necessary. Certainly  it made it much easier for the Serbs to comply (more or less)  with NATO's ultimatum without loss of face. But without the  ultimatum and the threat Russia would almost certainly not have  intervened in this way, and even if it had done so the Serbs  would have been less likely to comply with Russian requests.    As it is, the ultimatum has had to be interpreted creatively  to make it possible for General Sir Michael Rose, the UN  commander, to certify compliance. The effectiveness of UN  "control" over weapons remaining within the 20 km-radius  exclusion zone is uncertain. UN member states have lamentably  failed to provide General Rose with the 3,000 extra troops he  has requested, thereby continuing the pattern of  irresponsibility which has characterised all previous  international "action" in the former Yugoslavia.    France and Britain, the two leading contributors to the  existing UN force (UNPROFOR), have smugly refused General Rose's  request, suggesting it is for others to take a share of the  burden. However justified this implied criticism of the U.S.,  it is hardly a constructive response, nor is it calculated to  strengthen Atlantic solidarity in the next phase of the crisis.  Both countries should recognise that their national prestige  and interests are now irrevocably bound up with the UN operation  in Bosnia. If the operation fails for lack of manpower they may  console themselves by blaming the U.S., but it is they who will  look most foolish.  <H5>  Strategic Significance </H5>   With luck, the cease-fire in and around Sarajevo will now  hold, at least for a time. The Serbs will probably move their  weapons to other fronts of greater strategic significance, such  as Brcko and Bihac, where Bosnian Government forces are still in  a position to threaten communications between the Serb-held  areas in Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia proper. But a cease-fire  does not in itself mean that the siege of Sarajevo is lifted --  though that was NATO's declared objective when it ordered the  withdrawal of heavy weapons.    Likewise, the lifting of the siege of Sarajevo would not  relieve the suffering in other parts of Bosnia, including many  that the UN has officially taken under its protection. In two  of these (Srebrenica and Tuzla) specific actions ordered, on  pain of airstrikes, by last month's NATO summit have yet to take  place. And even the relief of all these places would not bring  peace to Bosnia as a whole.  <H5>  Exploit Momentum </H5>   So it is vital to exploit the momentum of the small success  gained in Sarajevo before it evaporates. General Rose was right  to press ahead yesterday with plans to open roads into and out  of the city and to repair water, electricity and gas supplies.  He is right, and should be given the fullest support by NATO  and the UN Security Council, in seeking to extend the Sarajevo  model to other parts of Bosnia. Opening the airport at Tuzla,  through which desperately needed food, medicine and shelter  could be brought to more than l million civilians in central  Bosnia, is an obvious priority. But the plight of Mostar, which  is worse than that of Sarajevo, must not be forgotten.    The Serbs are not the only villains in this war. It is Croat  forces, with active support from the Croatian regular army, that  have destroyed the historic bridge of Mostar and are still  raining down shells on the Moslem population trapped on the east  bank of the Neretva. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, a  protege of Germany and the Vatican, has still given no  indication that he will withdraw his troops from western  Hercegovina. An ultimatum to the Croats around Mostar would be  amply justified, would involve fewer political risks than that  to the Serbs around Sarajevo, and would make it easier to  maintain Russian support for a policy of firmness towards the  Serbs.    It is good, too, that U.S. and Russian officials are meeting  with those of the EU [European Union] and UN in Bonn today, to  push forward the diplomatic process. Only if the U.S., Russia  and Germany are very firm in urging concessions on their  respective proteges in Bosnia is there any hope of peace.</p>

			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHENEY PICKS 207 PROJECTS FOR REVIEW;  </P> <P> BUDGETS: THE DEFENSE SECRETARY SAYS THE WORK MAY BE CANCELED. HE EXTENDS A  FREEZE ON $7 BILLION IN CONSTRUCTION.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney extended the Pentagon's freeze on military  construction projects today and ordered that 207 projects -- including four  controversial Navy ports in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi and New York -- be  reviewed for possible cancellation.  </P> <P> Cheney's action caused consternation on Capitol Hill, which has been locked  with Cheney in a tense debate over slashing the defense budget and some  lawmaker's attempts to protect local jobs.  </P> <P> Cheney, in a statement issued at the Pentagon, said the order affects "more  than $7 billion in new construction contracts" in the United States, Western  Europe and the Pacific.  </P> <P> The 207 construction projects to be reviewed are valued at $1.2 billion and  include four of the sites identified by the Navy as strategic home ports in  Ingleside, Tex.; Mobile, Ala.; Pascagoula, Miss., and Staten Island, N.Y., the  statement said.  </P> <P> The secretary said he was forced to continue the freeze -- instituted in  January -- through June 15 because of possible budget cutbacks ordered by  Capitol Hill and the sweeping changes in international events.  </P> <P> "In light of the enormous uncertainty over the level of funding that Congress  will approve for future defense budgets, including the budget for fiscal 1991,  I have no choice but to extend the construction freeze," Cheney said.  </P> <P> Citing changes in the world situation and increasing budget limitations, Cheney  said, "Signifcant opportunities exist to reduce the cost and size of the future  infrastructure for the Department of Defense.  </P> <P> "Some of these actions may not be popular with members of Congress who want to  cut the defense budget even as they plead to save the projects in their own  states and districts," he said. "But when tight budgets force dedicated  soldiers to turn in their uniforms and leave the service, I cannot put  construction projects ahead of people."  </P></p>

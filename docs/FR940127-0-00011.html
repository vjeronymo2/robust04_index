Reserve accounts were previously required to be funded and used in accordance with Agency regulations, which already required the prior consent of the Agency prior to withdrawing reserve funds. However, internal Agency reviews and audits conducted by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), highlighted various violations of Agency regulations and prompted the need for this final rulemaking action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the most common concerns uncovered to date include the withdrawal of reserve funds without Agency consent, funds being pledged as security for other loans without Agency knowledge, withdrawal of interest earned on reserve funds for non-project purposes, lenders withdrawing funds for application on other defaulted loans, reserve funds withdrawn at a lending institution for application on other debts, and reserve accounts held at a lending institution for a short period of time before transferring to another institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency expects to curtail reserve fund abuses by shifting emphasis to compliance through procedures aimed at preventing abuses (e.g., requiring the countersignature of Agency officials for withdrawal of reserve funds which are to be placed in a supervised account). The Agency's earlier procedures relied on oversight through monitoring routines, with the threat of potential punitive measures being imposed should violations be discovered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency solicited comments concerning the impact of the proposed rules on those holding reserve funds in money market accounts, bonds, or financial holdings other than in checking or savings accounts in federally insured institutions. The prior rulemaking action also mentioned that the Agency is aware that the proposed rule may result in some borrowers having to pay financial fees or penalties, which will erode reserve funds, and is concerned that such adverse impacts be minimized to the extent practical. The Agency also solicited other alternative approaches to curtail reserve account abuses. The Agency desires to ensure that the rules to reduce reserve account abuses are met in a practical manner without inadvertently imposing severe financial hardship on existing borrowers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Arts: Donizetti's 'L'elisir d'amore' - Opera If an opera company wants to enter into a partnership of some kind in Europe, where better to go than Maastricht? The city that produced a treaty as full of drama and complications as any grand opera is also the part-originator of Scottish Opera's latest collaborative venture, a shared production of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore. It is a modest undertaking, accomplished without a hitch. While Euro-sceptics may look upon the treaty as a tragedy in five acts, this short Donizetti opera is a comedy which asks for a light touch. The Scottish-based producer Giles Havergal has not tried anything outlandish. Although his staging does not probe the emotional issues as tellingly as it might, the basis is there for a good, standard addition to Scottish Opera's repertory. The curtain goes up to reveal a picture of idyllic country life - literally, as the stage is encased in a giant, golden frame. As the sun beats down, women in wide-brimmed hats help their menfolk harvest the summer's crop of apples and oranges. Havergal knows how to arrange his chorus in attractive groupings. The designer, Russell Craig, has provided colourful sets and costumes, especially strong on complimentary red and green. From a programme note one might have thought that the producer intended to stress some 'magic' element in the opera, but it was not to be. Although Donizetti's quack doctor sells what he claims is a mystical elixir, it is in fact nothing but a bottle of Bordeaux. The coming-together of the young couple is achieved not by any magic potion, but through their true feelings  -the twist in the comedy that should make it touch the heart. The cast, led with brio by the conductor Marco Guidarini, does not quite manage that. Cheryl Barker sings Adina's music with sparkle and made the transition from cold, bookish minx to loveable girl-next-door wholly convincing. Simon Keenlyside's bumptious Belcore struts across the stage, tweaking his moustache, twirling his baton: another amusing characterisation from this imaginative baritone. Lisa Milne is a delightful Gianetta. The only weak link is the gruffly-sung Dulcamara of Claude Corbeil, who comes dressed like the Mad Hatter, but is not half as much fun. In the key role of Nemorino the company has fielded Paul Charles Clarke, who is probably as Italianate a tenor as Scottish Opera can hope to attract. The voice has a good ring to it at the top, though it returns to its English roots on certain vowel sounds lower down. As a bel canto stylist, he knows how to spin out the tone in an instrumental fashion when he wants to. 'Una furtiva lagrima' was well sung, but not as moving as it can be. Why? The trouble is that the role of poor, simple-minded Nemorino is an awkward one, which needs to be played with tact. Clarke laudably tries not to overdo the simplicity, but ends up failing to do enough to win one's sympathy. His Nemorino is just too sure of himself to be ignored and rebuffed, so in the last resort the heart is not warmed, the potion has not worked. In the best performances perhaps there is a kind of magic, after all. At the Theatre Royal, Glasgow, until February 11, then on tour</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> As the Dow Jones Industrial Average closes in on its all-time high, most San  Diego stocks continue to meander in a narrow range, with few exceptions.  </P> <P> New highs this past week were reached by Medical Imaging Centers, at $11.50,  and Xytronyx, at $14.125. There have been no announcements during the past week  to account for either of these moves.  </P> <P> HomeFed Corp. announced that, by merging with its thrift subsidiary, Columbus  Savings, it will use some of its net-loss carryforward of $170 million to  offset fourth-quarter loss allowances of $115 million.  </P> <P> HomeFed's allowance will serve to optimize its future earnings and capital  position as well as prepare for a possible slowdown in the economy, which might  effect California real estate values.  </P> <P> HomeFed stock, which sold in early October at $47.50, fell to $28 last week but  managed to close Monday at $31.375 as it attracted bargain hunters and found  favor with some brokerage analysts.  </P> <P> Mail Boxes Etc. seems to be in its own bear market. Reported earnings have been  rising, but the stock has been under pressure, falling $2.50 the past week. New  lows were recorded by Rohr Industries, which recently reported poor earnings,  and TCS Enterprises, which is involved in the Charles Keating-Lincoln Savings  affair.  </P> <P> First National Corp. dropped $1, to $18.75, down from its year's high of  $23.125. Agouron Pharmaceuticals holds it annual meeting at 10 a.m. Dec. 7 at  Embassy Suites Hotel in La Jolla.  </P></p>

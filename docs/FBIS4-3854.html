			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 25 (XINHUA) -- A senior U.N.  official warned here today that air strikes would be used  against Bosnian Serbs if they failed to withdraw their heavy  weapons from a 20-km exclusion zone around Gorazde by 0001 GMT  on April 27.    "If they do not comply," said Kofi Annan, U.N.  undersecretary- general, "air strikes will be used to get them  out."    Subsequently, he said, the U.N. had the exclusions around  the  other "safe areas," which if they attempted to move heavy  weapons in, they would also be attacked.    The U.N. official made these remarks at a press briefing  held  here this morning.    Annan also said that a three-km exclusion zone had been in  effect since 0001 GMT Sunday, following a decision of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on Friday [15 April].    NATO authorized the use of air strikes against the Bosnian  Serbs if they did not end their attacks against Gorazde, pull  their forces back from the city center, and allow U.N. Forces  freedom of movement there.    Annan said that the Bosnian Serbs had not complied promptly  with the first deadline, but that the U.N. Protection Force  (Unprofor) commander had decided not to use air strikes  immediately, as it felt that progress was being made and that  the Serbs would soon comply with the NATO ultimatum.    "It was important to get U.N. troops and medical units into  the city as quickly as possible and air strikes might have  jeopardized that operation," according to the U.N. official.    There are 475 U.N. personnel in Gorazde at present.    Answering questions on the deteriorating relations between  the U.N. and NATO, Annan said that "the relationship is good,  and we have excellent collaboration between the United Nations  and the NATO."</p>

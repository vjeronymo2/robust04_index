			<p>CSO     [Text] Indonesia, as chairman of the Nonaligned Movement  (NAM) will propose initiatives for an International Conference  on Bosnia-Herzegovina. For that purpose, President Suharto has  instructed the head of the Chairman's Administrative Board of  the Nonaligned Movement (BPK NAM) to look into possible ways of  implementing this. In addition, Indonesia is planning to open  diplomatic relations with Bosnia-Herzegovina. Indonesian wishes  in these matters were revealed at talks held between President  Suharto and Alija Izetbegovic, the president of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, at the presidential palace in Jakarta  yesterday.    Minister/State Secretary Murdiono told reporters that the  two  parties gave serious consideration at the talks, which lasted  from 9:30 to 10:30 AM, to the possibility of holding an  International Conference on Bosnia-Herzegovina. Murdiono said  that President Suharto gave direct instructions to Nana  Sutresna, the head of the BPK NAM, to look into and make  preparations for a possible conference. More particularly,  President Suharto asked Nana Sutresna to instruct the Indonesian  ambassador to the U.N. in New York to discuss this matter with  the NAM Coordinating Bureau.    Besides that, as chairman of the NAM, Indonesia will ask the  international community to treat Bosnia fairly. The  minister/state secretary said that the fact that the  international community has been treating Bosnia unfairly is  clear from the embargo, which has also been imposed on Bosnia,  since Bosnia is far less powerful militarily than Serbia.    In response to questions from reporters about holding a  conference, Murdiono said that he could not yet imagine what the  composition of such a conference would be. "Would Indonesia be  the host or not?" he said.    The idea must be developed and gain positive and wide-spread  support. He asserted that the idea of holding an international  conference is an Indonesian initiative, in President Suharto's  position as chairman of the NAM.    Murdiono went on to say that both heads of state agreed to  immediately open diplomatic relations. This means that  Bosnia-Herzegovina will have an ambassador to Indonesia. An  Indonesian ambassador would be accredited to Bosnia or to  Sarajevo. However, he said that the matter cannot be resolved  as easily as that because it is a high-level decision and would  take time. "As an example, the Bosnian ambassador would not  necessarily be located in Jakarta and the Indonesian ambassador  would not necessarily be located in Sarajevo. But, as I said  earlier, he could be accredited and he could be posted to  Jakarta," the minister said.    As for the possibility that Indonesia would send military  aid, Murdiono said that the matter had not been discussed at  this meeting. "I only want to remind you that humanitarian aid  has been sent there in the past," he explained.    Murdiono once again emphasized that the reasons behind the  effort to lift the weapons embargo on Bosnia are that Bosnia is  in a weaker position, from the point of view of the balance of  power. That is why in the past President Suharto, as chairman of  the NAM, instructed the ambassador and permanent representative  of Indonesia to the UN to fight for the lifting of the embargo.  Murdiono admitted that the fight had not yet been successful.    At the same time, at a news conference held after the talks,  President Alija Izetbegovic said that Indonesia is a large and  very influential country which is now in the position of  chairman of the NAM from 1992 to 1995. Indonesia, he continued,  is also influential in the Islamic Conference Organization (ICO).    Therefore, Izetbegovic respectfully asked President Suharto  to use his influence in the NAM to lift the weapons embargo  against Bosnia. "Because the embargo is really aimed at  Yugoslavia, and Bosnia isn't Yugoslavia," said Izetbegovic.    Izetbegovic made his official remarks in English. But when  he  answered reporters' questions, he used his native language,  which his son Sabina Berberovic then translated into English. He  was accompanied by Subrata, director general of the PPG [Press  and Graphics Development]; by Susilo Sudarman, foreign minister  ad interim; by A. Tahir, ambassador-at-large for the European  Region of the NAM; and by Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian  ambassador and permanent representative to the UN in New York.    He said that the only way to achieve peace is through a  balance of military power. Without this balance of military  power, every negotiating technique will end up dictating against  Bosnia. "That is why the Geneva peace talks failed," he said.    "That is also why I am asking President Suharto to use his  influence with the ICO to continue their political support and  humanitarian aid to Bosnia," added Izebegovic. He said that if  the aggression goes on for a long time, the weapons embargo must  also be matched by the imposition of an air embargo. This step  is important in opposing Serbia and the other forces which are  hampering the shipment of humanitarian aid to Bosnia.    Izetbegovic said that Bosnia is very similar to Indonesia in  several respects. "Bosnia is also a multicultural,  multireligious nation and a pluralistic society," he said. "We  think that perhaps Indonesia and the Indonesian people alone can  understand our problems," he added.    The talks between President Izetbegovic and President  Suharto  lasted from 9:30 to 10:30 AM West Indonesia time. At the same  time, talks also took place between Nana Sutresna, the head of  the BPK NAM, and Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian ambassador and  permanent representative to the UN.    Izetbegovic considered his meeting with President Suharto to  be very useful and constructive. Izetbegovic familiarized  President Suharto with all aspects of the present situation and  the history of the Bosnian crisis, especially its political and  military aspects. In particular, he conveyed his thanks to the  Indonesian nation and people, who have always supported the  Bosnian people's struggle.    Murdiono said that President Suharto in turn familiarized  his  colleague from Bosnia with the history of the struggle of the  Indonesian people from the time they obtained their freedom  until they received international recognition. President Suharto  emphasized that the struggle for Indonesian freedom required a  combination of military struggle and diplomatic struggle.    After these private talks Izetbegovic prayed at the Istiqlal  Mosque. Then, at about 12:00 noon, he kept to his promise to  meet with reporters. Unfortunately, before the reporters could  finish asking their questions, Director General of the PPG  Subrata ended the meeting saying that President Izetbegovic had  to leave for Halim Perdanakusuma Airport.    Earlier, the Indonesian Islamic Committee for  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Al-Irsjad Institute had contributed  money in the form of a check for $94,000, 64 rings, 15 necklaces  and 33 earrings. All of these contributions, which were  collected spontaneously, were handed over by Anwar Haryono,  chairman of the Indonesian Islamic Missionizing Board and  accepted by President Izetbegovic.    When he was saying his midday prayers at the Istiqlal  Mosque,  President Izetbegovic expressed his gratitude to the Islamic  community, which had always taken part in the  Bosnian-Herzegovinian struggle. He also expressed his admiration  for the attitude of the Indonesian people, who have always  helped and supported the Bosnian people's struggle.    He said that his visit to the Istiqlal Mosque had not been  on  the list of events or part of state protocol. He admitted that  he had known of the existence of the Istiqlal Mosque for a long  time. "That's why since I'm in Indonesia why not pray here and  see this glorious mosque for myself," he said.    The Bosnian presidential party arrived at Istiqlal at 1:00  pm  West Indonesia time and that is why they prayed as a group. In  one row there was President Izetbegovic hemmed in by Tarmizi  Taher, minister of religion; by Susilo Sudarman, foreign  minister ad interim; by Achmad Tahir, ambassador-at-large to the  NAM for the European Area; and by Irfan Ljubijankic, the Bosnian  foreign minister, who acted as prayer leader.</p>

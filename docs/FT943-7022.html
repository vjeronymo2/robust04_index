			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Barrick poised to win Lac with revised CDollars 2.4bn offer The management of Lac Minerals was last night poised to accept a revised offer by American Barrick valuing the Canadian gold producer at CDollars 2.4bn (Dollars 1.73bn). Barrick, one of North America's top three gold producers, has now beaten rival Royal Oak Mines for the hand of Lac Minerals and will become one of the world's biggest gold producers. It raised both the cash and share-exchange terms of its original offer. The new offer is CDollars 5 cash and 0.325 shares of Barrick for each Lac common share. Alternatively Lac shareholders can take 0.487 shares of Barrick. About half Lac's 148m shares are held in the US, and many US institutions had been awaiting the higher bid from Barrick. 'This is a friendly transaction with Lac,' said Mr Peter Munk, chairman of American Barrick resources and controlling stockholder. 'The combination is an excellent strategic fit of both companies.' Barrick said that Lac's management will recommend the new offer and co-operate in bringing in all the Lac stock. Mr Munk said Lac will benefit from Barrick's financial strengths and management experience. 'Shareholder values will be significantly enhanced for the holders of both companies. 'We are creating one of the largest and most profitable gold producers in the world with exceptional growth potential.' Barrick's new offer expires on September 6. The new offer will be mailed to Lac shareholders by this Friday. Earlier Royal Oak Mines, a Vancouver-based medium-sized gold producer extended its bid to September 6, saying it had received a 'strong response' by the previous expiry date of midnight, Tuesday. It refused to disclose the percentage of acceptance that it had achieved.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] Three U.S. congressmen failed to  land in Malanje today because of heavy shelling allegedly by  UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola].  [passage omitted]. The UNITA delegation in Lisbon has denied  the attack on Malanje. Carlos Fontoura [UNITA representative in  Lisbon] says it has all been fabricated.    [Begin recording] [Fontoura] I have to deny categorically  any  UNITA action to that effect. [passage omitted]. It is obvious  that the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] is  beginning to show a blatant and evident lack of imagination. A  few days ago -- when the visit by the Americans, the U.S.  congressmen, was being planned -- the day before they invented  and publicized a UNITA attack against Malongo, which as you know  not even the American company confirmed. Now, the day the  Congressmen were due to arrive the MPLA invents all this  guerrilla activity, which is no way part of UNITA's objectives.</p>

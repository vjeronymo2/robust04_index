			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Bank of Scotland Bank of Scotland continues to reap the rewards of prudence. A 39 per cent increase in interim operating profits before provisions represents a fine performance, especially as there was little benefit from windfall foreign exchange gains or overseas income. However, much of the growth came from wider spreads on its Pounds 5bn mortgage book. That advantage will last only as long as interest rates stay down. Of more permanent value is Bank of Scotland's continuing reduction in its cost to income ratio, which now stands at 49.6 per cent - way below that of all London-based clearing banks. But it will become progressively tougher to trim the ratio further to generate income growth. Moreover, with problem loans representing a relatively low proportion of total lending, Bank of Scotland will benefit less from declining bad debts than more reckless rivals. But as banks start to accumulate surplus capital in the upswing, attention will increasingly focus on how they intend to use it. Bank of Scotland is of the old school in believing good money can be made from lending. It promises to use its capital strength for further expansion into England without building up a costly branch network. Its progress may be unspectacular, but the strategy is a good deal less risky than Abbey National's modish foray into derivatives.</p>

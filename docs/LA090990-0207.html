			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SLAYING ENDS BEACH DISPUTE IN DANA POINT  </P> <P> An argument between two South County teen-agers on a sunny, crowded beach ended  Saturday with one of them shot to death and the other in custody, the Orange  County Sheriff's Department said.  </P> <P> The shooting took place about 1 p.m. in an area known as Dana Strand, at the  southern tip of Salt Creek Beach Park, a county-run beach just north of the  Dana Point Headlands.  </P> <P> According to Sheriff's Lt. William Francis, deputies responded to reports of a  shooting on the beach, where they found bystanders giving first aid to an  18-year-old Dana Point man with a chest wound. Paramedics took the victim to a  nearby hospital, where he was reported dead on arrival.  </P> <P> His identity was being withheld Saturday night until relatives could be  notified.  </P> <P> Sheriff's spokesman Francis said shootings on Orange County beaches are "very  uncommon." Police and lifeguard officials up and down the county coast said  Saturday that not a single beach shooting had been reported this year.  </P> <P> Witnesses to the shooting gave deputies a description of the suspect, a  16-year-old from Laguna Niguel, and the vehicle he was driving. The youth,  whose name is being withheld because he is a juvenile, was arrested without  incident a short time later at Interstate 5 and Ortega Highway in San Juan  Capistrano, Francis said.  </P> <P> The suspect was being questioned Saturday night by sheriff's deputies in Santa  Ana, Francis said.  </P> <P> Witnesses agreed that the two had been involved in a running dispute that began  before Saturday, involving a pickup truck window that had been broken.  </P> <P> The victim, according to a witness who asked not to be identified, was walking  down a bluff toward the area in the sand where the suspect and a group of  friends were sitting. The suspect saw the victim walking toward him and pulled  a small-caliber, short-barreled pistol.  </P> <P> "I looked up, and he had this gun," said Andy Manning of Monrovia in Los  Angeles County, who frequents the beach.  </P> <P> The suspect shouted, according to another witness, "Leave the beach or I'll  kill you! I'll kill you if you come after me! I don't want to kill you, just  leave!"  </P> <P> The witness said the victim replied, "Just pay me for the window!"  </P> <P> "They were both shaking," added a third witness, an 18-year-old man from Dana  Point who also spoke on condition of anonymity.  </P> <P> The two continued their shouting match as they headed north along the strand,  the victim pursuing the youth with the gun.  </P> <P> Manning said the victim said several times: "You're not going to shoot me!  You're not going to get away this time! I'm going to get you!"  </P> <P> The suspect turned and pulled the trigger -- hitting on an empty chamber,  Manning said.  </P> <P> The youth ran again, then turned, went to his knees and fired again, Manning  said. This time the pistol fired and hit the victim in the chest.  </P> <P> After the shooting, witnesses said, the suspect ran north along the beach, to a  beach path. Paul R. Jacobson of Glendale said he saw the young man calmly  walking up the beach path, with the pistol in his hand, pointed at the ground.  </P> <P> Manning said he saw police retrieve a pistol from the bushes near the top of  the beach path.  </P> <P> State parks officials who patrol San Clemente, San Onofre, Doheny, Huntington  Beach and Bolsa Chica beaches said no shootings have been reported at any of  those beaches this year; police and lifeguards at Laguna Beach, Newport Beach,  Huntington Beach and Seal Beach made a similar report.  </P> <P> However, a man was shot to death last month in the parking lot of Huntington  State Beach.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Wendy Paulson contributed to this report  </P></p>

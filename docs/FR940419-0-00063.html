			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule applies only to contracts awarded by EPA. EPA can encourage the use of similar provisions in contracts for Superfund work awarded by other agencies or States. However, it cannot require agencies or States to include similar provisions in those contracts. EPA is currently exploring the possibility of including its clauses in agreements that pertain to Superfund work in contracts awarded by other agencies or States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 19. Applicability of the Rule to Contractor Work for the Public Sector <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters suggested that the rule apply to EPA contracts only and have no bearing on work performed for other Federal agencies. It was pointed out that the rule lacks a discussion of how the restrictions in this rule bear on the ability of contractors to seek similar work from other Federal agencies and the States. Particular concern was raised that EPA not restrict its contractors from working simultaneously for other agencies such as the Department of Energy (DOE) and the Department of Defense (DOD) since this would be contrary to the public interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is committed to working closely with other agencies and States to ensure the effective and expedited cleanup of hazardous waste sites throughout the country and encourages the use of the best cleanup technology available. It is not our intention to restrict EPA contractors from working for the public sector. We strongly encourage contractors to perform work for other Federal agencies and States when such work does not create a conflict of interest problem which would impair the contractor's objectivity in performing work for EPA or damage the integrity of the EPA's cleanup and enforcement actions. We have intentionally made no distinction between the public and private sector in the rule's reporting requirements. To safeguard our programs, we must require that all actual or potential conflicts of interest be identified, avoided, mitigated, or neutralized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has the responsibility to ensure compliance by Federal and State agencies with the requirements of CERCLA and the amendments made by subsequent enactments. Because of EPA's enforcement responsibility, the interests of EPA and other public organizations will not always be parallel and may at times be distinctly at odds. For example, the interests of the EPA and DOD or DOE may be very different regarding the terms of Federal Facility cleanup agreements. Therefore, it is important that our contractors are not placed in conflict situations. When an actual or potential conflict of interest exists with work that a contractor may wish to perform with another organization, whether public or private, the contractor shall report it to its EPA Contracting Officer so that an informed determination can be made based on a careful review of the facts, the legal and program considerations, and the best interest of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 20. Qualified Contractors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that EPA may not attract the most qualified contractors or best expertise as a result of implementing the conflict of interest regulations. We disagree. EPA promotes full and open competition and attracts the most highly qualified contractors to its procurement program. Securing qualified contractors and eliminating conflicts of interest are not opposing goals. In fact, most of the highly qualified firms which compete for EPA contracts have systems established within their organizations to identify and eliminate conflicts of interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 21. Flow Down of the Clause to Subcontractors and Consultants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters stated that the categories of subcontractors and consultants exempted from the flow down of the conflict of interest clauses are too limited. They specifically questioned why the ``non-discretionary technical or engineering services, including treatability studies,'' exempted in the proposed clause, EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;74, Limitation of Future Contracting (LOFC), are not included in the flow down exemptions of all of the rule's conflict of interest clauses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In developing this rule, we carefully evaluated the types of work performed by subcontractors and consultants under EPA's contracts, and identified certain classes of work that pose a minimal risk of conflict of interest. They include well drilling, fence erecting, plumbing, utility hookups, security guard services, and electrical services. We exempted these classes from the flow down provisions of all of the rule's EPAAR conflict of interest clauses. In addition, for the LOFC clause only, we also exempted subcontractors and consultants who perform ``non-discretionary technical and engineering services, including treatability studies.'' Although we believe that non-discretionary technical and engineering services could pose some risk to the Agency, particularly since this category is so broad, we were able to exempt this work from the LOFC clause because sufficient protection was provided through coverage by the basic conflict of interest clauses, (EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;71 Organizational Conflicts of Interest, EPAAR 1552.209&hyph;73 Notification of Conflicts of Interest Regarding Personnel, and EPAAR 1552.227&hyph;76 Project Employee Confidentiality Agreement.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (7): Something's got to give - Growth plans for an expanding airport AN irresistible force is about to collide with an immovable object. The growth of Manchester Airport may well seem market-driven and inexorable but two strong groups have now emerged to try and limit it. Something will have to give, but what exactly it will be will be decided at ministerial level after a public inquiry, scheduled next year. Lobbying is already intensifying. Theoretically, Manchester Airport can grow to handle up to 24m passengers a year by extending the new Terminal 2; it already has planning clearance for this. The reality is that it will have difficulty in developing beyond 18m passengers with only one runway. This is because airports have early morning and evening rush hours like anywhere else, particularly for short-haul traffic. Business travellers want to get to mid-morning meetings throughout Europe without having to stay overnight and want to return that evening. Airlines serving scheduled and charter markets want their aircraft back again the same day. Manchester's limit for air traffic movements is 42 an hour. On typical summer days, morning and evening peaks can reach into the 30s. Moreover, many involve relatively small aircraft because of Manchester's role as a hub for feeder airports. The airport wants a second runway to enable it to move up to 30m passengers a year; it can only get it by encroaching on the Cheshire green belt. Many people living in east Cheshire have therefore formed the Knutsford and Mobberley Joint Airport Action Group (Kamjag), to fight the proposals. They are against more noise, congestion and pressure in one of the most salubrious corners of Britain. They also believe they have ecology on their side because several local sites of special scientific interest or biological importance might be affected by the expansion plans. Their campaign will certainly be well-argued. The area is one of the northern equivalents of the Home Counties' stockbroker belt; the group is well-funded, rich in professional talent, skilful, articulate, well-organised, and well-connected. They also have a new ally in the shape of Liverpool Airport, Manchester's poor relation. It has a runway capable of taking almost any aircraft. This, Liverpool claims, is north-west England's second runway. Its problem is image and under-achievement. Bedevilled by local political wrangling and consequent funding problems for much of the past three decades, Liverpool airport struggled. Liverpool's finance and management are now on an even keel because British Aerospace bought its way in, to share ownership with the five Merseyside councils - Liverpool, Knowlsey, Wirral, Sefton and St Helens - but in a dominant role. Mr Cliff Duke, the chairman, is also director of aviation services for BAe. He foresees an incremental expansion of Liverpool from 400,000 passengers a year now to 12m by 2005 if Manchester fails to get its second runway. Merseyside's political leaders are not only with him, they have stalled agreement on airports strategy by the North West Regional Association of local authorities, the majority of which favour Manchester's expansion. Politically, the Merseysiders say, the effect of forcing growth at Liverpool would be to spread the economic benefits - which it reckons at 1,000 permanent jobs per 1m passengers carried - where they are needed most. Generally, the Merseyside economy so lags that of Greater Manchester its leaders have applied to be ranked with Corsica by the EC to qualify for special funds. Some of this would go towards the infrastructure that would be needed to improve connections between Liverpool Airport and the motorways and railways. Mr Duke quotes Cheshire county council estimates suggesting 34,000 people live within Liverpool Airport's noise contour, compared with 143,000 for Manchester. Also, much of the Liverpool take-off zone is over water. He foresees Liverpool and Manchester playing complementary roles, probably with Liverpool getting mainly chartered point-to-point traffic, while Manchester grows as a hub for scheduled services. Liverpool claims travelling times would be identical for passengers coming from north or south once motorway links are in place, with only 15 minutes' extra driving from Yorkshire. Kamjag's members have yet to decide their line, but Liverpool's arguments will probably appeal. Mr Jeff Gazzard, a former marketing manager in banking, is running the campaign almost full-time. He says more than 70 per cent of Manchester traffic is outgoing holiday business. He does not believe expansion would alter the split of business and holiday traffic. 'There are 64 scheduled destinations, of which 14 are internal UK,' he says. 'It's not happened anywhere else in the world that a holiday airport has turned those percentages round. Manchester should reflect our regional commercial needs. It should not be the other way round - that we should bend to the airport's' The Liverpool proposal, however, would force airlines to fly there. Mr Jack Flanagan, Manchester airport chairman, quotes 1991 research by the Henley Centre for Forecasting which revealed airlines as 'highly resistant' to such suggestions. The Henley research reported the belief of some airlines that they might lose more than three-quarters of their Manchester business if they were required to transfer services. 'From a passenger perspective and for the economic good of the region as whole, it would be better to develop a second runway at Manchester, rather than redevelop Liverpool as a major international airport,' it said. Mr Flanagan says the north-west economy is of a similar size to those of Greece, Denmark and Portugal, all of which can only support one international gateway airport each, a role filled already by Manchester. He thinks Liverpool's role could be complementary, but only if it bases its plans on local, rather than regional or wider needs. 'Merseyside benefits substantially from access to world markets via the Manchester gateway. However, only 10 per cent of Manchester airport's traffic originates in Merseyside, compared with 20 per cent from east of the Pennines. It is simply unrealistic to expect Liverpool - based on the extreme west coast - to take over Manchester's role as a gateway.' Mr Gil Thompson, Manchester's chief executive, says the figures speak for the working of market forces. 'Leeds-Bradford is 750,000 passengers a year. We are 12.5m. I wish Birmingham well, but they are 3.5m passengers a year, Glasgow is 4.25m, Newcastle is 1m, East Midlands is 1m, Liverpool 400,000, Blackpool around 200,000. We don't have a monopoly, but you can see the way competition has worked. 'One in four of our passengers comes from Yorkshire, so when you talk of using Liverpool, can you imagine a Yorkshire person driving past Manchester to get to Liverpool? Even if they wanted to, you don't just go past a good airport. 'You would have to spend Pounds 1.5bn to bring Liverpool up to our present standards. There is civic pride involved, and I understand that. We genuinely wish Liverpool well, but we see it growing as we grow. 'When we get our second runway - not if - there will be traffic which we cannot handle or do not want. That should go to Liverpool. North-south traffic on the west side of Britain can either go right or left where the M62 or M56 crosses the M6. We are happy to assist as a sort of co-terminus, trying to choose the traffic that will be best for both of us.' Meanwhile, Manchester continues to research possible sites for its second runway, hoping to find the one which will pose the least environmental threat. Kamjag's latest recruit as vice-president, Mr Terry Waite, does not even live there, although he was born near the airport and has family in the area. But he will ensure publicity against an airport team described by Mr Gazzard as 'very skilled propagandists'. Mr Waite succeeds Mr Neil Hamilton, the MP for Tatton - which includes Knutsford. Mr Hamilton is the Department of Trade and Industry minister responsible for north-west England. With the region's business lobby generally favouring the second runway, his position was beginning to look awkward, illustrating the delicate nature of what will be a very tough decision for the environment secretary of the day.</p>

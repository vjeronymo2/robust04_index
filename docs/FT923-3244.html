			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / US Money and Credit: Weak data fails to indicate recovery POLITICS and economics are never far apart. But the approaching US presidential election, and the increasingly heated campaigning, now give an added twist to each set of dismal statistics which fails to indicate any meaningful recovery. Ten days ago, for example, yet another set of poor unemployment figures hit the news wire. So the bond market was all ears when President George Bush rose to address the Detroit Economic Club last Thursday. Traders fretted that the president, eager to boost his re-election chances, might suddenly become overly open-handed. After a few jittery minutes, they were able to pack their fears away. The president offered no new measures likely to pump inflationary pressures into the economy, and his one percentage point tax cut proposal was deemed to go little further than his statements to the Republican Convention last month. The bond markets breathed a collective sigh of relief, and the yield on the benchmark 30-year long bond fell below 7.25 per cent. It did not, however, return to the depressed 7.21 per cent seen on Tuesday evening, the lowest closing yield registered for more than seven years. This was, at least in part, due to the large number of corporate bond issues which hit the market last week - with some estimates suggesting that between Dollars 7.5bn and Dollars 8bn-worth of corporate debt was priced during the abbreviated four-day trading period. Corporate issues tend to depress bond prices, partly because underwriting firms on Wall Street sell off holdings of treasuries in order to give themselves the leeway to hold unsold corporate debt, and partly because investor demand becomes squeezed. In this particular case, traders said a large number of issues were priced aggressively - that is, offering only a minimal yield advantage over lower-risk treasuries. As a result, dealers were left holding large tranches of unsold stock. By the end of the week's trading, these technical considerations were still overshadowing the market, and even some extremely low inflation data for August - showing that the producer price index rose just one-tenth of 1 per cent during the month - failed to revive bond prices. The long bond fell by  9/16 , and its yield at the end of the week stood at 7.29 per cent. Such technical blips notwithstanding, most bond market participants are convinced that yet another easing of interest rates is on the cards and that yields have further to fall in the medium term. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, for example, is suggesting that the 30-year treasury bond yield could be down to 6.5 per cent by mid-1993. The reasoning is simple: the lack of consumer confidence, generated in part by employment worries, the extremely low rates of inflation at present, and  -against this backdrop - the extraordinarily cautious Federal Reserve policy. As Mr Robert Brusca, at Nikko Securities, argued to clients last week: 'Friday's PPI report for August shows how good inflation's performance has been. Year-over-year inflation dropped from a 1.7 per cent to 1.5 per cent rate of increase, a decline in inflation's pace of 0.2 percentage points. 'Meanwhile, the Fed has eased by 0.25 percentage points. Thus what the Fed has really done - net - is to ease in real terms by 0.05 percentage points, or 5 basis points'. This argument will probably be reinforced in the coming week, when the consumer price numbers, also for August, are released on Tuesday. After the very low PPI figure, most analysts are expecting an increase in 'core' inflation (excluding food and energy costs) of perhaps 0.2 to 0.3 per cent - a slight uptick from the July levels. Also on Tuesday's calendar are the August retail sales figures. Leading retailers have already unveiled lacklustre sales figures for the month, although they were quick to blame the relatively late date for the Labor Day holiday, saying that this had pushed some 'back-to-school' spending into September. Still, analysts now expect the overall retail sales numbers to either show a minimal advance, or even a small decline.</p>

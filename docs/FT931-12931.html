			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Hopes for Reuters service NEWS AND electronic dealing agency Reuters Holdings advanced sharply ahead of a presentation by the company today of a new information service. The optimism countered the effect that a fall in interest rates will have on the group's cash mountain of about Pounds 650m. The company has invited electronics and media analysts to a preview of Equity Focus, a system which is designed to attack the Pounds 60m a year market dominated by the Topic information service controlled by the London Stock Exchange. Following recent slides, Reuters shares bounced 35 to 1348p. The price was also supported by news that Reuters has signed a long-term agreement under which two companies will give Reuters exclusive data on certain non-US government debt securities. Mr Brian Newman, of agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite, who is an established Reuters enthusiast, added that the shares had been oversold following recent bear raids and that the shares were due for a strong rally ahead of preliminary figures on February 9. Glaxo slides A sharp shift from recession-defensive stocks hit the pharmaceutical sector in general and Glaxo in particular. The group, consistently at or near the top of the market's league of most highly valued companies, was also affected by news of a senior management appointment. The announcement that Mr Arthur Pappas has been made responsible for strategy for over-the-counter drug business in the US revived concern that the company might be considering a bid in that area. There was also a continuation of heavy US selling. Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank, was a big seller on both sides of the Atlantic. The shares retreated 13 to 682p, their lowest level since July, with 5.7m traded. Asda nerves In a buoyant food retail sector, talk of a rights issue by Asda held back the shares, which closed a mere halfpenny ahead at 66p. There were suggestions of an imminent three-for-one issue at 50p, a move which would raise about Pounds 350m for the indebted supermarket group. While many analysts were receptive to the notion, most questioned the timing, saying much of Asda's debt was fixed until the end of the year. With an improving trading position, the need for such a large amount of cash was also brought into question, although Asda's refurbishment and new store programme could be accelerated by an injection. Dealers further reported continued US selling on the back of a negative US note last week. Sellers were said to be switching into Kwik Save, up 13 at 820p. Elsewhere, Argyll Group forged ahead 14 1/2 to 398p, J. Sainsbury 17 to 572p and Shoprite 43 to 773p. Euro Disney strong Expected poor first-quarter results from Euro Disney had the unexpected effect of sending the shares sharply forward. They rose on a rumour that one big US house had turned positive, leaping 35 before receding to close 28 up at 808p. Merrill Lynch was reported to have raised its intermediate-term rating on the stock to above average from neutral, and increased its long-term rating to buy from above average. The house was unable to comment on the report. However, neither the rumour nor the results satisfied London analysts, who remained largely negative. 'I have heard nothing today to alter my pessimistic view,' said Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas, who retained his forecast of a full-year loss of FFr1.024bn (Pounds 120m). News that Kuwait is prepared to join Saudi Arabia and Iran in cutting output in order to drive oil prices higher, better than expected fourth-quarter earnings from Exxon, the US oil giant, and a fresh upsurge by Wall Street drove the oil sector sharply higher again. UK oil specialists, however, tended to adopt a cautious attitude to the sector, saying that the rise in oil prices and oil shares in recent days had already discounted any good news expected from the February 13 Opec meeting. 'It is precautionary buying, an insurance policy against oil prices moving above Dollars 20,' said one oil analyst. BP was the star performer, climbing 10 more to 241 1/2 p in the wake of some sustained buying interest from the US. Turnover in BP reached a hefty 19m shares. Shell advanced 17 to 547p on 7.5m traded. A buyer of 1m Enterprise Oil shares was responsible for driving the stock up 13 to 434p. The market was caught on the hop by the Pounds 80m rights issue from Wessex Water, the first cash call from any of the privatised utilities, to help finance the acquisition of Waste Management from NFC. Wessex shares dropped to 554p immediately following the news but later rallied to close 9 off at 568p. NFC, an exceptionally strong market since the middle of last week, appreciated 3 to 274p. Other water issues, poor performers recently as hints of possible cash calls to fund acquisitions circulated in the market, staged a good revival. North West Water, known to be keen on expanding in the waste disposal area, rallied 12 to 469p on heavy turnover of 4.1m, while Severn Trent, which bought the Biffa waste disposal business from BET a couple of years ago, added 11 at 459p with 3.3m shares traded. Thames put on 6 at 477p on 2.4m and Anglian 5 at 475p. Electricity stocks, on the other hand, underperformed the market, with dealers highlighting a shift in sentiment away from the more defensive areas of the market to the cyclical sectors. Bank shares were in the forefront of the market's surge, led by Barclays, up 20 at 435p on 13m traded, Lloyds, 22 ahead at 535p, and National Westminster, which raced up 14 to 457p. Discount houses, beneficiaries of falling interest rates, showed Cater Allen 15 better at 428p, while a strong merchant banks area was highlighted by Kleinwort Benson, 14 to the good at 332p. Royal Insurance was one of only nine FT-SE 100 stocks to lose ground over the session. Royal slipped 3 to 285p in heavy two-way trade of 6.2m amid renewed speculation that the composite insurer could be about to launch a substantial rights issue in order to rebuild its capital base. Smiths Industries, a supplier to Boeing, fell 10 to 359p after the aircraft maker announced production cuts. Turnover in British Aerospace reached 5.2m, although the strong buying of the past week appeared to have run out of steam and the stock closed only a penny firmer at 228p. Recently announced increases in steel prices helped ASW Holdings add 8 at 126p. Several stocks were assisted by yield buying. These included IMI, up 8 at 268p, VSEL, 9 better at 525p, GKN, also up 9 at 466p, and T &amp; N, which moved 7 ahead to 178p. Shares in Bromsgrove gained 5 to 87p after a buy recommendation from James Capel Unit Trusts. In transports, Associated British Ports jumped 14 to 378p on the announcement of an Pounds 18m expansion plan. A two-way pull on MFI pinned back the shares to a rise of just 2 at 139p. While a number of brokers remain positive on the stock - yesterday Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken issued a full-bodied note advising investors to 'buy on weakness' - more spurious stories were also doing the rounds, suggesting January sales had been weak. The stronger dollar, together with presentations to Scottish institutions, helped Grand Metropolitan surge 22 to 457p. Carlton Communications was held back as Hoare Govett highlighted a trade press article on the threat to the company by pay-as-you-watch transmission operations. The shares eased a penny to 790p. Conglomerate Hanson saw unusually heavy turnover of 16m, the shares closing 6 1/2 better at 243 1/2 p as chairman Lord Hanson gave a cautiously optimistic agm statement.

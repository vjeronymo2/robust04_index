			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Travel Focus - The Caribbean: Vieques: an odd experience IT is odd that the finest beaches in Puerto Rico are almost undeveloped, when a quick look at Miami Beach or the San Juan water-front shows that Americans are hardly shy of building on a good strip of Caribbean sand. And yet Vieques, a little-known island off Puerto Rico with some superb beaches, has no skyscraper hotels, no casinos and no Vegas-style entertainment. Instead, Vieques has just a few small guest houses with personable if eccentric managers. The locals spend most of their time playing dominoes and 'liming' (see A-to-Z). And, as well as deserted beaches, Vieques is the site of one of the Caribbean's most extraordinary natural phenomena - a phosphorescent lake. The reason for Vieques' lack of development is that it is mostly owned by the US Navy, which uses it as an ammunition dump and bombing range. In the second world war, Vieques was a fall-back harbour for the Royal Navy in case Britain was captured by the Germans. More recently, the mock invasions of Grenada were staged there and there was a lot of activity during the Gulf War. The navy is an ambivalent presence for the islanders. The nearby islet of Culebra was in the same position until a few years ago when the inhabitants started to organise picnics on the bombing range and the navy withdrew. But for visitors, Vieques is pleasantly undeveloped and peaceful (except for a couple of weeks a year when they are bombing). Nothing could be less military-like than the Casa del Frances, a guest house near Esperanza on Vieques' south coast. It is set in a classic West Indian estate house, wrapped with huge black-and-white chequered verandas, and has fan-cooled rooms set around a courtyard. Poking out of the rampant greenery in the courtyard, metal sculptures strike irregular, satirical poses. The same might be said for the owner, a white-whiskered roustabout by the name of Irving Greenblatt, who is something of a latterday Hemingway. He runs the guest house, which has been called an 'anti-hotel', with co-manager Frank Celeste, a self-appointed sexual chronicler (his latest best-seller: A Cookbook, Sex Manual and History of the Casa). If you can take the ribbing about the British and their food and about their being passionless, then it is an amusing place to stay. If Casa del Frances sounds too rum, you might try the Parador Villa Esperanza, a more traditional hotel on the beachfront. This is the best place from which to arrange a trip to the phosphorescent lake in Mosquito Bay. Visiting the lake is one of the oddest experiences of a lifetime. It is as eerie as it is unlikely: water that glows at the touch, glittering as it slips through your fingers. A motor boat carves an impressive trail in the water, but it is best to go by canoe, preferably on a pitch-black night. As you advance, the wake of the canoe begins to glow and each stroke of the paddle sets off a twirling vortex of green light. Startled fish dart away as you approach, tracing green streaks beneath you. The effect is created by dino-flagellytes - tiny, single-celled protozoa with a plant-like metabolism. When agitated, they undergo a chemical reaction and emit a pinprick of light. Cupped in your hands, they look like distant stars, but if you splash, the overall impression is startlingly bright. Dive and swim and you will leave a trail for 10ft behind you; flick your paddle on the water's surface and you create an arc of light like a waterfall 20ft across. Vieques offers laid-back island life Latin-Caribbean style, and feels remote even though it is just a hop from San Juan (Puerto Rico) and the Virgin Islands.</p>

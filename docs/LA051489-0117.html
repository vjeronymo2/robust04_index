			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CELTIC INTEGRITY MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE DRAFT  </P> <P> Potentially one of the ugliest moments in National Basketball Assn. history was  avoided in the last game of the regular season when a struggling former  champion refused to be seduced by the benefits of losing.  </P> <P> The Boston Celtics had much to gain by dumping that last game. A victory  guaranteed them nothing more than a first-round playoff loss to the Detroit  Pistons. A defeat created the possibility of winning the draft lottery and  getting an impact player to team with a healthy Larry Bird. The Celtics could  have regained their elite standing quickly.  </P> <P> The obvious immorality of losing on purpose was magnified by the fact that the  Celtics would have had to lose to the helpless Charlotte Hornets in front of  the Boston Garden home crowd while playing on the storied parquet floor below  16 NBA championship banners.  </P> <P> The Celtics, however, played it straight. No funny stuff with weird lineups. No  resting regulars. They won the game and lost a chance at the No. 1 pick. Then  they lost three consecutive games to the Pistons.  </P> <P> "What did we gain?" asked Boston President Red Auerbach. "Nothing. But it was a  matter of maintaining our self-respect. You try to win every single game you  play."  </P> <P> But what about Boston fans and members of the Boston media who wanted the  Celtics to lose so that they could win in the draft? "I don't give a damn about  those people," Auerbach growled. "Once a team loses its integrity, then you're  in the wrong business. It's a terrible thing to do that."  </P> <P> Which is true, but it hasn't stopped others. Anyway, the point for the Celtics  now is: Where to from here? During the 1989-90 season, Robert Parish will be  36, Bird will be 33 and Kevin McHale will be 32. McHale has trade value, so  perhaps it is time to move him for a younger player and a No. 1 pick.  </P> <P> "We don't contemplate major moves," Auerbach said. "We feel with Larry back and  the development of our younger players and adding a player in the draft, we'll  be all right."  </P> <P> And that, too, may be true. Consider the rise of the Phoenix Suns, who went  from 28 to 55 victories in one season, primarily because of the acquisition of  Tom Chambers. And the Golden State Warriors went from 20 to 43 victories with  Mitch Richmond as the only significant addition.  </P> <P> It seems now that the NBA is in an era in which teams can swing drastically  with one major and perhaps one or two minor additions. And the Celtics will  have that major addition in a healthy Bird, who is expected to be fully  recovered from heel surgery. Boston also has the 13th pick in the college  draft.  </P> <P> The playoff experience, although limited, also should help young players such  as Reggie Lewis and Brian Shaw, much as the first-round, four-game series  against the Celtics last year helped the New York Knicks' young players.  </P> <P> But more than anything else, what will help the Celtics is that they maintained  their championship tradition of trying to win. They understand that any team  that believes losing leads to winning is nothing more than a loser.  </P> <P> The Word From Bird -- Bird met with Boston reporters the day after the Celtics'  elimination, and he had some pointed comments, although he refused to name  names. "To get this going again, everybody's got to give 100 percent," Bird  said. "You (reporters) are around enough to know who's doing it and who's not.  Everybody's been sliding for a couple of years. We never had to worry about  guys not giving the effort three or four years ago, but we have that now. Not  only this year, but last year and the year before."  </P> <P> Interesting. The only other players on the roster who were in Boston during the  1986-87 season are McHale, Parish and Dennis Johnson. So who is Bird talking  about? Speculation in Boston is that Bird has not been enamored with McHale's  play, but neither player will comment on the matter.  </P> <P> If Bird is upset with McHale, that increases the likelihood of a McHale trade.  What Larry wants in Boston, Larry usually gets.  </P> <P> The Denver Bricklayers -- The Denver Nuggets won the Midwest Division  championship in 1987-88 but finished third this season, then were eliminated in  the first playoff round. Part of their problem was their reliance on outside  shooting, particularly their reliance on low-percentage outside shooters.  </P> <P> Of the top 50 scorers in the NBA, Fat Lever was 47th in field-goal percentage  (.457) and Michael Adams was 49th (.433), and those two, the starting guards,  were two of the Nuggets' top three scorers.  </P> <P> Lever has suggested that he might be traded in the off-season because he is the  Nuggets' most marketable player. Denver Coach Doug Moe said, "Nothing is 100  percent in the NBA. But the closest thing is that we're not going to trade Fat  Lever."  </P> <P> The dreaded vote of confidence. Bye, Fat.  </P> <P> Summer Games in LA -- Anyone in need of an August basketball fix might consider  a vacation in Los Angeles. David Robinson will be there, playing for the Spurs'  summer league team. And Roy Tarpley, who played in only 19 games this season  because of a knee injury and a second stint in a drug rehabilitation clinic,  will play for the Mavericks' summer league team.  </P> <P> Caught Short -- Seattle backup guard Avery Johnson had a minor problem with his  shorts in last Tuesday's Sonics-Rockets game. Johnson apparently wasn't too  careful when he dressed, so when he entered the game, he noticed that his  shorts were on backwards. Seattle Coach Bernie Bickerstaff called time out and  the Sonics players huddled around Johnson, who made the proper adjustments. "I  know everyone is laughing at me now," Johnson said, "so what can I say?"  </P> <P> He Isn't What He Drinks -- Witnessing this scene might have been worth the  price of a round-trip plane ticket to Oakland, Calif. After the Warriors  eliminated the Utah Jazz last Tuesday, there was a going-away party for Golden  State public relations director Cheri White, who will join the NBA PR staff in  New York after the Warriors' season ends. Several players attended, including  Larry Smith, who entered the restaurant and worked his way to the bar. A person  standing near the renowned Mr. Mean burst out laughing when Smith, in a deep  voice, told the bartender, "I'll have a Shirley Temple."  </P> <P> Highs and Lows -- Ricky Pierce's 35 points in last Tuesday's Bucks-Hawks game  were a career high. . . . And, as difficult as it is to believe, Bill  Cartwright is getting less aggressive. Last season, he led the NBA by scoring  37% of his points from the free-throw line. This season, he was down to 25%.  </P></p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Greed lives in the caring '90s: Dominic Lawson suggests a way to keep company executives under control BEFORE HE was exposed as a crook, Ivan Boesky was much in demand as a speaker at graduation ceremonies at US colleges. On one such occasion the great share price manipulator proclaimed to his starry-eyed audience: 'Greed is good.' A film of this speech exists, and it shows the students clapping and cheering. Perhaps a number of those students are now on the boards of unfortunate companies, busily profiting privately from the insight taught them by the future jailbird. We are often told, as if it were a fact of human evolution, that while the 1980s were the decade of greed and excess, the 1990s are a period of calm restored in the financial markets, of relative austerity. We are even told that, in Britain, John Major has ushered in a less grasping and divisive society, in contrast to the supposed excesses of unfettered Thatcherite capitalism. The recent procession of company annual reports, and the details of executive pay revealed in them, shows that this view is a myth. While no manager in Britain can compete with the Dollars 127m (Pounds 82.4m) of salary and stock options realised last year by Thomas Frist of the Hospital Corporation of America, the gains have still been spectacular. Over the past three years, according to the Institute of Management, the pay of the typical chief executive of Britain's larger companies has risen by 40 per cent. This at a time when the pay of the typical worker has risen at about a tenth of that rate, if indeed that typical worker has not been made typically redundant. Many recent examples of executive excess affect those who are leaving companies in the hands of others: a whacking final year increase has a big impact on pension payments and ensures a scrumptious retirement package: few more scrumptious than that of Sir Anthony Tennant of Guinness who, after a five years service with the company, will be collecting a pension of Pounds 500,000 a year, including a top-up of Pounds 204,000 a year above his normal company entitlement. Guinness was certainly good for Sir Anthony, although Sir Anthony, it would be fair to add, was good for Guinness. But what of Gerald Ronson? It transpired this week that bondholders in Ronson's Heron property group, which last year saw shareholders funds of Pounds 585m turned into a deficit of Pounds 328m, are asked to agree to pay Ronson Pounds 5m over the next five years, and to hand over 25 per cent of their stake in the company to Ronson and his managers, should they succeed in restoring the company's balance sheet. When Ronson owned Heron it was perfectly proper for him to pay himself whatever he wanted. (As indeed,it now appears: the company paid Pounds 1.7m of the Pounds 5m Ronson was fined for fraud in the Guinness affair, when Ernest Saunders ran Britain's most generous drinks company). But now that Heron is in the hands of bankers, they are responsible for getting the best possible deal for their shareholders, rather than for the erstwhile owner of the insolvent client. This, some other bondholders are arguing furiously, they failed to do. In this case the bankers are behaving rather like institutional investors in joint stock companies: cowardly or indifferent in the face of the demands of greedy and overpowering managers. As a result of this, some City reformers are suggesting that the pay of senior executives in public companies should be read out and put to the vote at annual general meetings. It is argued that even if the institutional investors do not care, small shareholders might embarrass the executives with awkward questions. But the sort of chief executive who terrifies the remuneration committee is just the sort who would feel no embarrassment in front of ordinary shareholders: in fact he would positively thrive on the conflict. I have an alternative remedy: that the chief executive's pay, whatever its base, should not increase in any given year by more than the average rate awarded to the company's workforce. After all, in a well-run company their increase, in aggregate, should reflect the company's performance, cash balances, and dividend obligations: why should not the chief executive's increase be subject to the same considerations? It is an extreme remedy, for a group which includes some extremely greedy people. Dominic Lawson is Editor of The Spectator.</p>

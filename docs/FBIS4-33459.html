			<p>BFN     [Text] The Nicaraguan Government has been putting off a  decision regarding the Haitian refugees with the clear intent to  avoid upsetting U.S. President Bill Clinton with a negative  response.    This is inferred from Dona Violeta's remarks upon returning  from El Salvador. She said that Nicaragua will respond to the  United States in December with regard to receiving Haitian  refugees. "I always said that all of us in Central America are  studying the request and will announce our decision at the  summit to be held with President Clinton in Miami in December,"  she said.    While the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Costa  Rica have ruled out the possibility of their countries'  receiving Haitian refugees, citing excessive poverty and a lack  of proper conditions, Dona Violeta keeps saying that the request  is being studied and that a decision will be made in December.    We must admit that this position -- a very intelligent one  --  makes it possible for the Nicaraguan Government to gain time.  According to international analysts, the problem created by the  military in Haiti will have been resolved by December. The  hypothesis that anything can happen between now and December is  much more acceptable if we take into consideration the fact that  Nicaragua will most likely support the U.S. proposal at the OAS  to restore democracy in Haiti. The U.S. proposal for Haiti even  considers the possibility of a military invasion, which, if  approved, would take place very soon thereafter, because  everything is ready.    It goes without saying that Nicaragua is in no position to  receive refugees. We must admit, however, that Dona Violeta has  already learned to deal with international politics. Too bad it  is a little late.</p>

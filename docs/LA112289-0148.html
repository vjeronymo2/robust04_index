			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THOUSANDS AT BOEING PICK UP BONUSES AS THEY RETURN TO JOBS  </P> <P> Thousands of Boeing workers returned to the assembly line today after a 48-day  strike, picking up a $500 bonus check won in their new contract and relieved to  be earning money as the holiday season begins.  </P> <P> "It feels like the first day of school," said Jerry Clark, a 42-year-old father  of two, as he showed up at Boeing's plant in Renton, where he builds plane  models for the world's No. 1 manufacturer of passenger jets.  </P> <P> "It's nice to go back. If it were another time of year it would be different,"  said Tracy Dorning, an electrical inspector at Renton. "We might have stayed  out longer."  </P> <P> The second-longest strike in Boeing history had practically shut down  production. Supervisors and non-striking personnel delivered 24 planes, but  many of the aircraft had been virtually completed before the walkout.  </P> <P> Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said most of today will be spent in meetings to  organize the start-up.  </P> <P> Gearing up is "going to be slow," he said. "It will not happen overnight."  </P></p>

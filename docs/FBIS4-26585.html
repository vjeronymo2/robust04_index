			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Li Wenzhang, an official with the State </F> Administration for Industry and Commerce: "Trademarks Ease  Shift to Socialist Market Economy"]    [Text] The transition from central planning to the market  economy can pick up pace if the special role of trademarks is  better implemented.    The importance of trademarks in opening up markets and  building economic strength requires greater attention from  Chinese enterprises.    A good trademark can bring huge economic benefits and a  bright future for an enterprise. But many firms, especially  those large- and medium-sized ones, have not fully realized the  importance of registering trademarks as an intellectual property  right. Consequently, their sense of protecting their own  trademarks is rather weak and some have suffered grave economic  losses due to infringement cases.    Since the Trademark Law was issued in 1983, China has set up  a registration and administration system as a legal guarantee  for developing the market economy.    Such a legal system is important because, first of all, it  directly regulates the performance of market competitors--both  manufacturers and sellers. The trade mark system is a basic  legal set-up for China's socialist market economy.    And as a very important part of the legal system protecting  intellectual rights, trademarks cover registrations application,  administration, and the protection of property rights.    Secondly, it is a necessary guarantee of fair competition  for  enterprises. Being independent economic bodies and facing an  open market, enterprises must seek as much profit as possible to  maintain their own interests and win market competition.    Big profits can only be achieved with quality goods and  services. Thus enterprises need to improve the quality of their  products and develop their own markets with credible trademarks.    For instance, if an enterprise develops a new product, gives  it a trademark, and has it registered it will then have made the  necessary preparations for the product to enter the market.    Its property rights will then be protected by law in case  the  trademark is infringed upon by others, whether the violation was  intentional or accidental.    China is using both administrative and legal functions to  maintain fair economic order and encourage product improvements.    Thirdly, trademarks are the basis for conducting  international economic cooperation and exchanges.    The material resources and technologies of a country are  limited. A nation can only develop more quickly and meet  domestic material demand with aid from international businesses.    In today's world economy, intellectual property is rapidly  increasing as property rights are becoming critical factors in  economic cooperation. Thus, setting up a law for intellectual  property rights, like the Trademark Law, has become  indispensable.    Such a law conforms to the interests of developed and  developing nations. This is because, without a law protecting  trademark holders, international sales of high-quality products  becomes impossible.    It is quite clear that no one wants to invest and sell goods  in a country which does not protect intellectual rights and  leaves loopholes for counterfeits of advanced foreign products.    As for domestic enterprises, their initiative for improving  product quality will be hurt if their special right for  registered trademarks is not well protected by the government  and fair competition will not be well established.    The Chinese law has promoted the rapid development of its  economy and also provided a legal basis for this rapid  development.    Trademarks, in addition, are a part of the commercial  culture. Apart from meeting the legal requirements, a producer  has to carefully study whether its trade mark will be accepted  by the public.    Popular foreign trademarks, such as Coca-Cola, Kodak, and  Mercedes Benz symbolize the economy, culture, and political and  national spirit of a country. While indicating their countries'  economic strength, they also reflect the nation's spiritual  pursuit for superb quality and perfection.    China's trademark system has basically met the needs of the  country's market economic system. However, problems still exist.    One is that public awareness about the law is generally low  and the quality of administrative workers needs to be upgraded;  more efforts are needed to protect the special rights of  trademark holders and more importance should be attached to  trademark administration in China.</p>

			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY DIGEST: NORWALK;  </P> <P> $5,000 REWARD SET FOR HELP IN GANG SHOOTING FATALITY  </P> <P> Norwalk is offering a $5,000 reward to anyone who provides information leading  to the arrest and conviction of the suspected gang members who killed an  Artesia youth during a shooting at a graduation party in June.  </P> <P> Jesus E. Diaz, 16, a reputed gang member, was shot to death on June 22.  </P> <P> Nine other youths were wounded.  </P> <P> Councilman Robert J. Arthur also proposed that the city initiate a general  reward program with fixed amounts, such as a $250 reward for information  leading to the arrest of people who mark the city with graffiti. The council  would establish a reward fund and seek contributions from businesses and  residents.  </P> <P> The Public Safety Commission and public safety director will meet to set up  guidelines for the program.  </P> <P> Last year, the City Council offered a $5,000 reward after Juan Enriquez, a  17-year-old honor student at John Glenn High School, was killed in a drive-by  shooting as he walked home from school. No one has been arrested for the  shooting, and the reward was never paid.  </P> <P> City officials ask that anyone with information on the shootings call 863-4344.  </P></p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Highland regiments hear the last post: The Queen's Own Highlanders fear peace-time defeat. Christian Tyler visits the regiment on the eve of amalgamation with the Gordons Silver goblets are carefully set in front of each officer's place along the polished mess-table. But closer inspection shows their design is not uniform. The first is embossed with a stag's head, the next with a thistle and crown - and so on, alternately, around the table. Like the clash of green and red tartan in the paintings on the walls, the goblets proclaim the amalgamation 33 years ago of two clan regiments, the Seaforth Highlanders and Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders. Today the product of that merger stands on the brink of another merger. The Queen's Own Highlanders (Seaforth and Camerons) will acquire more goblets, more tartan, more customs, when they are united this September with the Gordon Highlanders from the Grampian region to the east, foreigners from Aberdeen with strange accents and - so it is rumoured - Danish blood. More than 30 British regiments are being reduced or merged in the present round of cuts, to predictable cries of pain. Some soldiers see in this the beginning of the end of a regimental system which is reputedly the envy of the world. To the men of the Queen's Own Highlanders a stroke of the pen in Whitehall feels like a bayonet in the guts, for Highland soldiers enjoy more than a shared history and regimental loyalty: they are bound, in a way English regiments no longer are, by ties of territory, clan and family. While the rest of the British army struggles towards the classless society, theirs remains in some respects a feudal world. The officers - some still lairds in uniform - are mostly the well-spoken products of English public schools. As one young bachelor officer quipped when asked where he came from: 'The Highlands of Chelsea.' They command men they call 'jocks' who in civilian life could easily be their estate workers or gamekeepers. Highland regiments enjoy a cachet unlike other infantry units. There are few sights more stirring than a Highland regiment on ceremonial parade: a moustachioed pipe major at the head, feather bonnets nodding, kilts swinging, kettle-drums rattling and bagpipes wailing. A piece of theatre, maybe, but more than that - an expression of collective pride powerful enough to silence the most sceptical voice. That pride was poignantly displayed recently when old soldiers of the Seaforth Highlanders commemorated the 200th anniversary of the raising of the 78th Highlanders (Ross-shire Buffs), their regimental ancestor, by Francis Humberston Mackenzie, Lord Seaforth. In untypically brilliant sunshine, with the tops of Ben Wyvis uncovered behind them, they marched in column of three behind a pipe band of their own veterans through the streets of Dingwall on the Cromarty Firth. On the same day, at the southern end of the Great Glen, another band of old soldiers was parading through Fort William in memory of Alan Cameron of Erracht, founder of the 79th Cameronian Volunteers. Poignant, too, was the moment in the chapel of Fort George, the 18th century garrison which juts into the Moray Firth near Inverness, when the regimental chaplain, the Rev James Harkness, quoted from Isaiah: 'Consider the rock from which you are hewn, the quarry from which you are dug.' Watched by their colonel-in-chief, Prince Philip, the two clans combined for Beating the Retreat at the Cameron Barracks in Inverness, marching off to the air of the Mackenzie chiefs, Cabar Feidh, while the setting sun glared from the red sandstone of the barracks. It was spirited but solemn: a celebration, and a funeral march. A campaign to prevent the merger was launched by old soldiers on both sides, but apparently too late to have effect. The 'old and bold', as the Queen's Own Highlanders call their veterans, say the merger is unfair on two counts: that the QOH has barely digested its last amalgamation and that it is being penalised for the Gordons' recruitment difficulties. They hoped - still hope  -that a big UN peace-keeping force will be called for in Bosnia, further stretching an already overstretched British army and thus saving their battalion. There is resentment about those regiments which, because of political influence or logistical need, will come through diminished but undiluted. 'The politicians seem more worried about the Highlanders of Kathmandu, the Gurkhas, than us,' said Col Andrew Duncan, a former commander of the regiment. 'And why should there be three battalions of paratroopers when you cannot safely parachute into battle ever again?' Sgt John Rattray , a master tailor, complained: 'We don't have enough people in Parliament. There's quite a lot of feeling that the Black Watch and Argylls should have been disbanded - they're no Highlanders.' The Black Watch, he explained, persecuted the Jacobites in the early 18th century and were known as 'the English police'. The Massacre of Glencoe has not been forgotten. The regiment's commanding officer, and future commander of 'The Highlanders' is Lt Col Hugh Monro whose brother was CO before him and whose father is Sir Hector Monro, a minister in the Scottish Office. 'My principal concern is not kilts and customs,' he said briskly, 'but people.' His problem is to maintain morale through a reduction of the 565-strong battalion which will hurt the careers of his officers and NCOs and threaten unemployment for his men. 'If I was a retired officer it would be extremely upsetting,' he added. 'I am upset, but I haven't got time to be upset. Anyway, it would need a miracle to prevent it now.' Highland soldiers regard themselves as special. Their martial tradition is one reason. They make tough infantrymen, said Col Duncan, a legacy of the era when they were required 'only to walk bravely forward, shoot their muskets, and die when hit.' Yet they do not foster a cult of toughness like the self-proclaimed elite units. They are violent when roused, boisterous when drunk and need a lot of disciplining. They are used to military service: regiments like the Seaforths and Camerons were raised by their clan chiefs as much as anything to provide employment. And they are used to dying. The entire adult male population of Ullapool, the fishing port in the north-west Highlands, was killed in the two world wars, according to Major-General John Hopkinson, another former Seaforth and now Colonel of the Regiment. 'The jocks are fine soldiers, but a nightmare in camp', said Major Douglas Hay of 'D' company, glowing with pride after watching his men win the battalion soccer tournament in a cup final played at high speed and with considerable ferocity. 'Everyone in the army says his battalion's the best. The only difference is that in the Queen's Own Highlanders we know we are the best]'. Overt class distinction seems to bother no-one in the battalion. 'Jocks expect officers to be different,' said a lance-corporal. In spite of it  - no, because of it - officers and men alike boast of the familiarity permitted. A sergeant explained that the relationship is less stiff-necked than elsewhere in the army. Banter was tolerated short of insubordination and jocks knew where the line was drawn. There is one club for the wives of all ranks. 'Our sarn'ts (sergeants') mess is the oldest in the army. They are all real gentlemen,' said Monro. 'Class is not important in this mess either. It's performance.' These days, he said, respect had to be earned. 'There is no room any longer for the chap who can hide behind a name or what he thinks he is.' Family connections and family feeling are the glue that binds these soldiers together. Many have followed brothers, fathers, grandfathers into the regiment. 'It's all to do with family,' said an NCO storeman from Fort William. In one company there had been no fewer than six brothers serving together. Major Mike Wimberley, the second in command, was born in London and grew up in Sussex. But he has a Cameron tartan plaid spread over his desk: he is the fifth generation to join the regiment. For him, it is an extension of family life. 'The hardest thing to face,' he said, 'is that someone wants to do away with us, that someone can do away with the living thing that is a regiment - that something created which works extremely well that can just be wiped out at the drop of a pen. History doesn't count with government. It doesn't matter a damn to them how long we have been around. What matters is their ability to recruit and retain.' The last serving Seaforth in the QOH is the quartermaster, Major Murdo Macleod from the Isle of Lewis. He is old enough to remember babysitting a little girl now married to one of the sergeants. 'When you leave a civilian company,' he said, 'that's the end. But you are never, ever, retired from the Queen's Own Highlanders.' The last merger was made easier to digest by a posting to Singapore and action in Brunei. Few doubt that the impending merger with the Gordons can be made to work just as well, in spite of mutterings that their officers are not of the same calibre and jokes about their tartan having a yellow streak. Arguments about who will wear what, and when, in the new battalion have largely been resolved. General Sir Peter Graham, colonel of the Gordons, was rumoured to have threatened to fall on his sword if the Gordons lost the kilt. So it will be Gordon kilts and Mackenzie trews for the soldiers, and Cameron kilts and Mackenzie trews for the pipers and drummers. In return the Gordons will give up their cap badge - the everyday emblem of the modern soldier - of stag's head and motto 'Bydand' ('abiding') for the QOH stag's head with thistle and crown and Gaelic motto 'Cuidich'n Righ' (Help the King). Thus traditions will fuse and a new sustaining myth will have to be invented. 'We will have no trouble creating a history for the Highlanders,' said a QOH officer. 'But it has taken 20 years to get our identity accepted locally. It will take another 30 years for the new one.' But for how long can the regimental system survive such chopping and dilution? Field-Marshal Lord Carver argued 25 years ago that infantry regiments should be merged into a single corps. He has few supporters in the QOH. 'It is important to go into battle with friends, not acquaintances - to see the blue hackle,' said Capt Stuart Tootal, who saw action in the Gulf war where three men of the battalion were killed in the notorious 'friendly fire' incident. 'At the end of the day one of the biggest motivations is not to let your mates down, and I firmly believe in that.' Major Wimberley said: 'We have asked them if necessary to lay down their lives for the Queen's Own Highlanders. You cannot easily ask them to switch off and say Now I am a 'Highlander'.' But there are some who feel the campaign against amalgamation is a case of old buffers resisting the inevitable. They say the tradition of local regiments, formalised only 100 years ago, is wasteful in peacetime and inefficient in wartime, however good it may be for esprit de corps. With many regiments, like the QOH, down to a single battalion the rationale is still further weakened. 'Why not put all the Highland battalions into one regiment?' suggested a QOH dissenter. 'You could say they should have gone even further.' No doubt they wanted to, but did not dare.</p>

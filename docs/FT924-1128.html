			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / International Company News: SCA, Weyerhaeuser plan exchange of information TWO leading players in the world's packaging industry, Sweden's SCA and Weyerhaeuser of the US, plan to co-operate in production technology and product development. The two companies will exchange technical and commercial information and explore possibilities for joint research and development projects. The aim is to reduce costs and develop markets through the pooling of expertise. Mr Sverker Martin-Lo f, SCA chief executive, said the move would help the group to meet the needs of the growing segment of packaging customers that operate globally. SCA Packaging is the leading supplier of corrugated board and containerboard on the European market while Weyerhaeuser is the third largest supplier of corrugated and containerboard in the US. Mr Colin Williams, SCA Packaging president, said: 'SCA can reduce costs by learning from Weyerhaeuser's cost-effective corrugated board production while Weyerhaeuser can learn much from SCA about the application of recycled fibre in its production.' SCA also upgraded its 1992 earnings forecast yesterday, saying it now expected to make profits of SKr300m-SKr400m (Dollars 44.4m-Dollars 59.3m). This compares with the break-even result which it predicted in October when it announced a SKr62m profit for the first eight months. The company said it had benefited from the devaluation of the Swedish krona and a fast implementation of cost reduction measures. It added that its hygiene company, Molnlycke, had continued its strong development. Sweden's forestry groups are believed to be among the main beneficiaries of the weaker Swedish currency, and their shares have advanced strongly since the krona was floated on November 19. However, SCA noted there had still been no improvement in the market for traditional forest industry products.</p>

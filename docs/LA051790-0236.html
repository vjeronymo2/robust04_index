			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> VILLAINOUS, SAINTLY BOSSES GET THEIR DUE  </P> <P> A Philadelphia businessman who asked his secretary to scout for good-looking  women at a local pub and then call him on a beeper to tell him of his prospects  is a dubious "winner" in a national bosses' contest.  </P> <P> Other bad and "downright unbelievable" bosses included a New York supervisor  who followed female employees to the restroom and stood outside to time them.  </P> <P> A boss at a brokerage firm in Cleveland was awarded a special "boss-felon"  award for holding "forgery contests" among secretaries to see who could best  forge clients' signatures on stocks and bonds.  </P> <P> A boss in Gaylord, Minn., "won" for discriminating against pregnant women.  </P> <P> The contest, sponsored by a Cleveland support group for clerical workers called  9to5, National Assn. of Working Women, also honored "good" bosses.  </P> <P> Those included the president of a computer services firm in Birmingham, Ala.,  for progressive family leave policies; a department chairman at Hofstra  University in Hempstead, N.Y., for advocating pay raises, and the chairman of  Northwest Airlines for making company employees "feel like an asset to the  airline."  </P> <P> A Philadelphia secretary who nominated her boss said she was asked "to go to a  'beef &amp; beer' " to check out women before he entered.  </P> <P> "He told me to beep him if there was anyone good-looking in the bar so he  wouldn't waste his time," the woman wrote.  </P> <P> Another bad boss was nominated by a state worker in Madison, Wis., whose mother  had to be rushed to the hospital. The next day, the worker asked for the  afternoon off to visit her.  </P> <P> "Well . . . go ahead. But next time you should plan these things better," the  boss responded.  </P> <P> The manager of an insurance company in Boulder, Colo., also "won" for yelling  at a female worker to bring coffee and adding, "You squaw; me chief."  </P></p>

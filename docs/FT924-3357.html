			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Forte deal satisfies THE long-awaited and well-signalled sale by Forte of Gardner Merchant, its catering subsidiary, nevertheless managed to take the market by surprise as some investors took fright at the headline figure and sold the shares. However, an afternoon presentation by the hotel group helped soothe some of the suspicions that Gardner had been sold too cheaply and the shares regained some of their losses before the close of trading. The complex deal involves Forte investing Pounds 60m in the new venture, with the remaining Pounds 342m price tag being paid by a combination of institutions and the Gardner management. At the same time, Forte announced it was buying a chain of French roadside restaurants and sealing a similar deal in Italy, in keeping with its declared strategy of expanding its Continental food operations. Mr Ron Littleboy at Nomura said that the deal would ease dividend worries and greatly improve Forte's debt position. 'This is a very good deal for the group,' he said. Others were less impressed. One long-term bear of the stock suggested that the Gardner sale changed very little and that the problems of 'flat trading and unimaginative management' meant downward pressure on the shares would remain. Having dropped 7 on the news of the disposal, they recovered to close 2 1/2 lighter at 167 1/2 p. Turnover was a healthy 4.2m. Amstrad surprises Many market operators were surprised at the performance of Amstrad shares after suggestions in the press that the 30p a share bid for the minority 66 per cent of the shares owned by Mr Alan Sugar would probably fail. Amstrad stock dropped to 22 1/2 p at the opening as speculators sold their shares, but later stabilised and closed a net 4 off at 24p. Turnover was a rather disappointing 1.5m. One electronics specialist said he was very surprised at the shares' performance after news that then Sugar bid would probably fail: 'They've held up quite nicely, I thought they would fall to 10p.' Another analyst said he thought, 'there was very little downside from here; the stock was trading in the low 20p's before the bid was announced.' S&amp;N cheer A sigh of relief greeted interim figures from Scottish &amp; Newcastle Breweries, the shares jumping 12 to 413p, as the effect of the recession appeared to be not as bad as had been signalled last week in results from two of S&amp;N's competitors. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 108.4m against Pounds 115.7m with a slightly improved dividend also lending the shares support. However, analysts foresee a dull time for the shares in the short-term with a flat beer market and dull leisure business offering little in the way of stimulus for earnings growth. While remaining a holder of the shares, Mr Graeme Eadie at County NatWest foresees some recovery potential. 'Being concentrated in the north and Scotland, S&amp;N is likely to benefit more than the likes of Bass and Whitbread as we come out of recession.' The two classes of BT shares drifted easier, with the fully-paid closing off 7 1/2 at 403 1/2 p and the partly-paid 6 down at 301p with good volumes as the market awaited news of the appointment of the adviser to the government for the third issue of BT shares. There were hints of some determined US selling of BT stock as some investors referred to their charts of the run up to BT II, where the shares fell around 15 per cent relative to the market ahead of the listing. The Ofgas statement of 'rate of return' for British Gas was also cited as partly responsible for the slippage in BT shares. Merchant bank SG Warburg sprinted 17 higher to 516p amid strong hints that the group will again advise the Government on the sale of the third tranche of BT shares. Vodafone edged up 5 to 410p on 1.1m traded with one of the leading US brokerages, Lehman Brothers, said to have been a strong supporter of the shares. Electronics group Tunstall jumped 10 to 309p after the 20 per cent leap in full-year profits and the 12.1 per cent increase in the dividend total. Of the day's two newcomers to the market, Tadpole Technology, placed at 65p a share, opened at 73p and quickly raced up to 86p before settling at 85p. Hunters Armley, the printing group whose stock was placed in the market at 90p a share, moved ahead to touch 103p during early trading, but later eased to close at 99p. British Gas was the weakest performer in an oil and gas sector short of activity but full of stories. Gas shares retreated to 272 1/2 p before stabilising and closing a net 4 off at 274p, on turnover of 7.6m, after Ofgas, the industry regulator, issued a report of rates of return on Gas's pipeline business. The report was in favour of a reduction in Gas's real return from this business, from the 6.7 per cent level thought to be needed by Gas to the level of 2 1/2 to 5 per cent recommend by Ofgas. One of the stockmarket's gas specialists said he thought it likely that the authorities will find in favour of the Ofgas view. BP eased a faction to 228p after the company revealed a 600m barrel increase in oil reserves during its presentation to London oil analysts. US investors now account for some21.8m per cent of BP's shares. Calor held at 218p but one sector specialists said there was 'Real unease among analysts about the unexpected and unexplained resignation of the group's highly respected finance director, Mr AM Pate. 'It could just be that SHV is flexing its muscles but there are concerns that there has been a disagreement over accounting policies,' said the analyst. SHV last week increased its stake in Calor to just below 49 per cent. Impressive full year results from Airtours left analysts searching for superlatives as the tour operating group again exceeded market expectations. The company refused to comment on whether it still harboured interests in rival Owners Abroad, and this speculation was said to have held the shares - which have also run ahead prior to the results - steady at 260p. Owners edged forward a penny to 77p. Talk that Kingfisher was eyeing the German interests of US store giant Woolworth found little support and the shares drifted back 3 to 577p in thin trading. Hints from Great Universal Stores that its catalogue business was winning market share continued to underpin the shares and they rose 14 to 1667p. A shortage of stock was said to have been behind Kwik Save's jump of 24 to 775p. Speculation that British Aerospace would soon win a lucrative order for the Hawk trainer aircraft from Saudi Arabia under the Al Yamamah defence project, helped the shares buck the market trend. They gained 7 to 141p, with sentiment further boosted by reports that a collapse in the European Fighter Aircraft (EFA) project, on which BAe is the leading UK contractor, may be averted. Turnover was 4.2m. A squeeze sent Smiths Industries climbing 8 to 348p. The dividend increase at Westland as it reported an 11 per cent improvement in full year figures, just ahead of expectations, cheered the market and the shares firmed 3 to 116p. Whessoe were wanted ahead of results on Thursday. The shares gained 17 to 234p. Also wanted were Siebe, 8 better at 387p, ahead of today's interim figures. Among motor stocks, the improvement in car sales helped Lex Service gain 10 to 263p. Shares in ICI retreated following a downgrade from the company's broker. Blaming weak October trading, Hoare Govett cut its forecast for the current year by Pounds 40m to Pounds 540m, lopping a similar amount from 1994 to Pounds 680m. The shares fell 11 to 1025p. In transport stocks, P&amp;O bounced 2 to 462p, in trade of 1.8m. Strong demand was seen for NFC. Turnover rose to 8.1m and the shares having touched 284p, closed 4 harder at 282p.

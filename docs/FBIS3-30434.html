			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Presenter] The Hungarians in Vojvodina were very  pleased to hear about the discussion of Serbian President  Milosevic with the chairman of the Democratic Community of  Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK]. This was stated in the letter sent  by Andras Agoston [VMDK chairman] to the Serbian president.  (Szilveszter Varga) reports.    [Varga] The VMDK chairman informed Milosevic that the  presidium of the Vojvodina Hungarian organization felt that the  fact that Agoston was allowed to attend the meeting [on 27  January] between the Hungarian foreign minister [Geza  Jeszenszky] and the Serbian president was a gesture. In the  view of the presidium, this could mark the start of a settlement  of the unresolved problems of the Vojvodina Hungarians, whose  basis could be the VMDK's autonomy proposal in both a legal and  political sphere.    The VMDK presidium points out: The VMDK's plans guarantee  the  possibility for the Hungarians to survive as a true ethnic group  [nepcsoport] in Vojvodina.</p>

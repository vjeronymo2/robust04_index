			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Barclays to sack 500 in staff cuts BARCLAYS BANK said yesterday that 500 staff in London and the south-east were likely to lose their jobs in the first compulsory redundancies it has ever made in its branch network. It said that as many as 800 staff in the region were 'surplus' to its needs and that much of the reduction it wanted could not be met through its voluntary redundancy programme. Mr John Cotton, Barclay's personnel director, said: 'This is something we all sought to avoid but it is justified by the needs of the business and we have to face up to it. We feel great regret but these jobs are lost forever.' He said there were no further plans for compulsory job losses in the region or elsewhere for the rest of this year, but that he could not rule out more redundancies next year. Mr Cotton left open the possibility that not all of the losses would have to be compulsory, saying he was open to suggestions about how else to reduce staffing. Discussions on the reductions will take place in the next few months. He said Barclays believed 500 of the 800 redundancies would be compulsory, with some of the remainder met by voluntary departures and other 'surplus' staff retained in case of further economic recovery. Barclays said most of the reductions were not related to the recession but reflected longer-term restructuring which required fewer staff. They were part of a plan to reduce staff by 18,000 over five years from the start of 1991, with London and the south-east most affected. Bifu, the Banking Insurance and Finance Union, condemned the losses yesterday and said the announcement had 'come out of the blue'. It said its Barclays representatives had been told by senior bank officials last week that the voluntary redundancy programme had been working well and volunteers were even being refused. 'We are totally opposed to compulsory redundancies on principle,' Bifu said. 'They are unnecessary. This announcement shows that nobody in Barclays is safe in 1994.' It said it was likely to launch a publicity campaign andadded that it had not ruled out the possibility of industrial action. Barclays has reduced the number of staff by 13,500 to 45,000 since the start of 1991, of which 9,000 have been in the branch network and the rest in headquarters and support functions. About 4,000 have lost their jobs in London and south-east branches. It has cut branches from 2,400 to 2,200 in the same period and plans a reduction to 1,900 over the next two years.</p>

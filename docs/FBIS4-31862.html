			<p>BFN     [Text] Ljubljana, June 15 (TANJUG) -- The Ljubljana daily  REPUBLIKA claims on Wednesday that numerous clumsy moves by the  Zagreb regime have made Istria Croatia's biggest internal  problem, and hints at an imminent collapse of President Franjo  Tudjman's latest strategy in the battle to retain the  insubordinate peninsula under his territorial and other control.  Mistrust between Istria and the Croatian leadership or, more  accurately, their unconcealed rift, has lately been widened by  the statements of individual Istrian politicians that Zagreb's  "repressive policy" should be resisted at arms, writes the  Slovenian paper. Slovenia and Croatia share a border in that  northern Adriatic peninsula.    "Tudjman, who has lost some of his power in his ongoing  battle with the opposition, is trying to cool the passions  somewhat. However, one of the hawks in the ruling party,  Vladimir Seks, has recently made the surprising statement that  Zagreb will no longer insist on Croaticising Istria," writes  REPUBLIKA.    The daily goes on to explain that just six months ago,  Zagreb  was firmly insisting on going ahead with the plan of  Croaticisation, which would mean "strengthening the awareness of  belonging" and settling Croats from other parts of Croatia and  from abroad in Istria. There was also mention of a project of  settling 10,000 Croats from Romania and the Serbian province of  Kosovo-Metohija in Istria. Istrians feared that refugees from  Bosnia-Herzegovina, too, might decide to stay permanently in  houses where they have been temporarily accommodated.    REPUBLIKA writes that the current parliamentary crisis in  Croatia, where the opposition parties are refusing to take part  in the work of the bicameral parliament, is being reflected also  in Istria.    According to some leading Istrian politicians -- advocates  of  the peninsula's autonomy -- "the situation should be used to  defeat Croatia's ruling democratic union," and new voices are  being raised, too, demanding a firmer stand with Zagreb.  Istria's political core and many of the people already see the  peninsula as an independent state, not an autonomous region, in  the near future. This means that they are striving for  weakening the influence of Zagreb and Ljubljana, as the idea of  independence includes the Slovenian part of Istria, too, writes  the paper. Istria was under Italian rule until the end of World  War Two.    REPUBLIKA writes that Tudjman's latest strategy of apparent  easing of pressure has failed, and quotes in substantiation  Tudjman's advisor Nevio Setic as saying that "an Istrian more  has usually meant a Croat less. The same is true today, which  indicates that political disputes between Zagreb and Istria will  continue and deepen."</p>

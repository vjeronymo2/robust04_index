			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> In a country that has enjoyed almost seven years of uninterrupted economic  growth, there is a growing public concern about poverty, according to the  latest Gallup Poll. Telephone interviews with a randomly selected national  sample of 1,250 adults conducted earlier this month show that most people think  poverty in America is increasing. Only a third of Americans (33%) approve of  President Bush's handling of the problems of poverty and homelessness, while a  majority (53%) disapprove. The harshness of this rating is underscored by the  fact that as many as seven in 10 Americans (69%) approve of the overall job  Bush is doing. The vast majority of adults polled (83%) believe that the  percentage of Americans living below the poverty line is increasing from year  to year. And 45% believe that living conditions for the poor have worsened.  </P></p>

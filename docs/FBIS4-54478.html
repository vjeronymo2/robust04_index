			<p>BFN     [Text] Army General Rasim Delic, chief of the General Staff  of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, assessed the present military  situation in our country speaking on Bosnia-Herzegovina  television this evening:    [Begin Delic recording] Enemy forces are regrouping  throughout the Bosnia-Herzegovina front. Some foreign agencies  are reporting about regrouping in Posavina. This started before  their reports. Namely, armored and mechanized forces from  Krajina have started arriving. After Gorazde, and after the  withdrawal from the Gorazde area, they are stepping up their  reinforcement. The goal that the aggressor forces are trying to  realize is well known: To widen the Brcko corridor. This  regrouping is now taking place from Gradacac to Celic, i.e.,  along the entire Posavina section of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  front.    Given that we have been monitoring such events and taking  appropriate measures I do not expect that they will surprise us  in this respect. But one should say that the situation such as  the one in Gorazde and earlier in Sarajevo, when the UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] was only taking over the protection of  certain territories, creates conditions for the aggressors to  concentrate large armored and mechanized units and even  personnel in the specific areas that they chose as the target of  their aggression.    Our demand has always been for the heavy artillery, as well  as the armored and mechanized units of the two sides to be  placed under effective control. Unfortunately, in both Sarajevo  and Gorazde this did not happen and consequently there is a  danger of additional enemy involvement in some of our other  areas, taking into account the amount of heavy technology at the  disposal of the Serbian aggressors.

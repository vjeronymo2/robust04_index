			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei in fourth consecutive decline on profit-taking PROFIT-TAKING ahead of the September book closing overwhelmed expectations of an imminent cut in the official discount rate, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell for the fourth consecutive day, losing 125.01 to 20,266.03. The index was supported by public fund buying but faced profit-taking from financial institutions and fluctuated between 20,211.52 and 20,407.54. Volume came to 220m shares, against 293m, remaining below 300m for the third trading day in a row. Declines led advances by 696 to 288, with 186 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 12.44 to 1,638.90 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.00 to 1,253.19. Speculation that the Bank of Japan would lower interest rates today failed to stimulate demand; a cut of 50 basis points had been discounted into share prices by the end of last week. Institutions, looking to realise profits ahead of the end of September, are expected to remain leading sellers for the remainder of this week. Foreign investors were also seen liquidating arbitrage-linked positions. Stocks which were bought on margin during the rally in April were sold as some individuals faced margin calls. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y19,000 to Y867,000, posting its fifth consecutive decline. Other issues related to telecom infrastructure investments were also lower, with cable and wiremakers prominent. Fujikura weakened Y16 to Y876 and Mitsubishi Cable Industries Y15 to Y835. Steels and shipbuilders were also hit by profit-taking: Nippon Steel lost Y1 to Y330, Kawasaki Steel Y3 to Y323 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Y9 to Y676. Meanwhile, biotechnology issues were higher ahead of a spate of medical and academic meetings. Takeda Chemical rose Y30 to Y1,330 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical gained Y10 at Y2,450. In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 116.04 to 22,383.49 in volume of 46.3m shares. Roundup WITH South Korea as a speculative exception, gentle declines seemed to be the order of the day around a relatively subdued Pacific Rim. HONG KONG lost ground but recovered from a fall of 100 points seen in early trading. The Hang Seng index was finally 27.51 off at 7,390.60 in turnover of HKDollars 3bn. The market was closed on Friday because of a severe tropical storm. Hang Seng Bank fell HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 51.50 while Hutchison shed 20 cents to HKDollars 22.90 in active trading. Allied Group made a strong recovery to HKDollars 1.02, up 6 cents, following the release on Saturday of the results of a 13-month investigation into alleged corporate fraud. Allied Properties improved 3 cents to HKDollars 1.32. SINGAPORE closed lower on profit-taking, although brokers said they expected prices to stay mixed in the near term, supported by the prospect of enhanced market liquidity. The Straits Times Industrial index receded 10.01 to 1,998.37. Volume totalled 367.4m shares, down from 457.3m. SEOUL finished higher on expectations of a government announcement cushioning the side-effects of last month's ban on false-name financial trading. The composite index added 9.18 at 695.12 in turnover of Won280.9bn, against Won134.2bn registered in Saturday's half-day trade. Ssangyong Motor and Poongsan ended the day's limit up, both gaining Won600 at Won14,900 and Won15,200 respectively. TAIWAN was lower on profit-taking after two days of gains, following the central bank's easing of credit limits last week. The weighted index slipped a net 25.59 to 3,927.81, after an intraday high of 3,971. Turnover was TDollars 19.3bn. Construction shares were relatively strong, with Ever Fortune limit up at TDollars 67.50. AUSTRALIA was easier in quiet trading, with BHP shedding 20 cents to ADollars 15.76 following last Friday's first-quarter results. The All Ordinaries index lost 1.4 to 1,924.1. BANGKOK's SET index pierced the 1,000 level on buying of second-liners and new issues in the morning, but profit-taking pared the gains and the index finished 1.21 down on the day at 997.01. Analysts talked of a period of consolidation before a further sustained climb; investors were worried because Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai had still not announced his new cabinet line-up after dropping the Social Action party from the ruling coalition last week. NEW ZEALAND was easier but off the day's lows in thin erratic trade. The NZSE-40 capital index lost 7.30 at 1,937.93. MANILA ended lower, with a retreat by PLDT on Wall Street triggering a long-awaited consolidation that broke last Friday's strong rally. The composite index receded 28.4, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,967.97. PLDT shed 15 pesos to 1,360 pesos after a Dollars 1 fall to Dollars 48 3/8 on Wall Street.</p>

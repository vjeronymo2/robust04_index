			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     The first version of STEP, an ISO international standard  for CAD/CAM systems' data conversion, will be issued in April  1994. STEP, a product model data conversion standard, is the  result of development by specialists in Japan, the U.S., Europe  and other countries. It appears that all twelve parts of STEP's  initial release finally will be lined up and will be released as  part of the ISO 10303 document. In Japan, participants in the  STEP Center -- including companies such as Toshiba, NEC,  Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi Electric -- have succeeded in  experiments using STEP data conversion management prototype  systems to convert data from drawings, thus confirming that data  can be converted accurately. The time is arriving for practical  applications of STEP. It is anticipated that a second version of  STEP will be issued after two to three years during which data  conversion experiments involving international joint development  will continue to expand the applicability of data conversion.  <H5>  ``Version 2'' in Two to Three Years </H5>   Currently several intermediate file formats such as IGES and  DXF are used as data conversion standards for CAD/CAM systems.  However, these have defects such as vagueness in interpretation  of specifications and inability to be converted to product  management information due to data conversion's focus on display  data. Moreover, demand for data conversion between different  systems is rising with the increasing complexity and  sophistication of data conversion as LANs (local area networks)  spread and CAD/CAM systems' capabilities advance. STEP solves  the problems of existing standards and proceeds toward  standardization with the goal of achieving complete data  convertibility at all stages of product lifecycles.  <H5>  Success in Conversion Experiments </H5>   A data conversion management prototype system using the STEP  standard has already been developed. Experiments have been  carried out which successfully converted the 3-dimensional solid  model, 2-dimensional basic geometric shape, free curve and curve  shape data that is essential to STEP. The development system has  been revised for V01, V02, and the improved version of V01. For  the improved version of V02, specification definitions are  described in EXPRESS language for conversion between data models  and general-purpose systems that rely on a special application  protocol. Some of the special features are as follows. A  dictionary is automatically generated from the schema described  EXPRESS. SPI (standard application programming interface) is  offered. The dual advantages of the code creation method and the  real-time interpretation method are used. A STEP environment  (STEP cell) is offered.    This development system is used for conducting experiments  on  data conversion of 2-dimensional drawing data between current  commercial CAD systems and will expand experimentation to  3-dimensional data, product modeling, industry-specific  application models, and so on. This is for the purpose of  issuing version 2 of the ISO's STEP standard in two to three  years. The phrase ``data conversion for CAD/CAM systems''  doesn't suggest the variety and breadth of fields that are  affected by STEP.  <H5>  Unconscious of Compatibility </H5>   The first version of the standard which will be issued in  April 1994 is about two thousand pages of standards on twelve  topics [sic]: overview; EXPRESS language specifications;  physical files and mapping rules; methodology, framework, and  general concept for verification; foundation for product  description and support; framework for expression of shape  expression (geometric and phase); product structure and  composition; representation; basic models of products; drawings;  and composition management design.    Practical application of STEP, the key to integrating  next-generation CAD/CAM systems, makes possible the accurate and  efficient conversion by differing machines of vast quantities of  design data created and amassed by CAD/CAM systems. This means  that product design can be made more efficient and design  quality can be increased through the integrated use of design  data between and inside companies. Moreover, CAD/CAM users will  be able to replace and introduce new kinds of CAD/CAM systems  without thinking about compatibility. STEP-based accurate data  conversion between CAD/CAM systems is essential for progressing  with system architecture for CIM (computer-integrated  manufacturing) which is being promoted as part of the corporate  movement toward greater use of information systems.    The STEP Center is continuing with data conversion  experiments with an eye to establishing the second version of  STEP. The experiments will aim at achieving perfect conversion  of product model data by addressing problems such as the small  differences between CAD/CAM systems in data expression  specifications even when data is accurately converted by STEP.  For example, this involves small differences such as the size of  characters and shape of arrows.</p>

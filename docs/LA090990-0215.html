			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CO-OP CHOPPER? CITIES GIVE IT A WHIRL AT DEALERS' EXPENSE;  </P> <P> SURVEILLANCE: HUNTINGTON PARK, BELL, MAYWOOD AND SOUTH GATE WILL SPEND ABOUT  $72,000 IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS TO LEASE A HELICOPTER TO TRACK DRUG SUSPECTS  FROM THE AIR. IT COULD PAY OFF -- BIG.  </P> <P> Huntington Park, Bell, Maywood and South Gate are pooling their resources to  lease a helicopter to help their detectives track down major drug dealers.  </P> <P> The cities plan to spend about $72,000 in the next six months on the  helicopter, which will be used primarily to track suspected drug dealers over  city streets and area freeways. It also could be used for general  crime-fighting in the cities if needed, city officials said.  </P> <P> City officials are hoping that the helicopter will lead to more drug busts and  more federal forfeiture money for their police departments. Local police  departments receive a share of cash seized during federal drug investigations,  based on the help they provide to federal agents.  </P> <P> The helicopter should take to the air in the next month if leasing talks are  successful, officials said.  </P> <P> Each city will contribute about $18,000 in drug forfeiture money to pay for the  helicopter and pilot. Federal guidelines require that cities use forfeiture  money for police purposes.  </P> <P> At the end of six months, the cities will decide whether the helicopter is  worth the expense.  </P> <P> "It doesn't take too many major drug busts for us to make a profit on the  situation," Huntington Park Mayor Thomas E. Jackson said.  </P> <P> The four cities have combined forces in the last several years to work with  federal agents on drug investigations that often lead outside city boundaries.  Their police departments contribute detectives to a joint investigative team  called the South East Area Narcotics Enforcement Team.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the cities received more than $1 million in forfeiture funds  after their detectives played a major role in a 1989 investigation. More than  21 tons of cocaine and about $10 million in cash were seized at a Sylmar  warehouse.  </P> <P> Jackson said the cities decided to use the helicopter after they met in July  with officials of the U.S. Customs Service Office of Enforcement. Federal  officials told council members from the cities that their narcotics enforcement  team would not receive as many tips in the future unless they used a  helicopter, Jackson said. Tips would instead be passed to law enforcement  agencies that track drug dealers with choppers.  </P> <P> "It gives our team equal footing," Jackson said.  </P> <P> Maywood Police Chief Ted Heidke said the helicopter will enable detectives to  track tricky dealers who try to evade capture by driving at high speed and  making sudden turns.  </P> <P> "You're trying to follow some crook, who many times is doing 80 m.p.h. on the  freeway and watching for people following him," Heidke said. "We found in too  many cases (his officers) end up losing the guy."  </P> <P> In these times of tight budgets, the forfeiture funds offer the four  departments a chance to hire more officers and buy expensive new equipment.  </P> <P> Financially troubled Huntington Park, for example, plans to spend about $1.2  million in drug forfeiture money in the next year to hire seven more sworn  officers and six other police employees and to buy new equipment.  </P> <P> The Huntington Park City Council decided to use the forfeiture money after  voters last year rejected a proposed 7% utility tax that would have raised  money for more police.  </P> <P> If the flow of forfeiture money stops, the city will have to lay off the  additional police employees, Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly said.  </P> <P> "There is the possibility we will get more drug forfeiture money, which will  pay, we hope, for the helicopter and much, much more," Jackson said.  </P></p>

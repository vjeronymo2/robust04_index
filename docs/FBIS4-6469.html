The analyst says:    Recently, a democratic "national assemblyman" exposed at  "the  Home Affairs Committee of the National Assembly" the fact that  "secret houses" for intelligence surveillance had been installed  and operated around main universities and colleges throughout  South Korea under the disguise of dwelling houses, tong offices,  stores, etc. Even after the "civilian" regime made its  appearance.    The surveillance on campus has been made in nasty ways such  as watch from the "secret houses," the grasping of students'  movement through agents of special intelligence rings planted at  campus, watch and wire-tapping.    While talking about "civilian administration," "respect for  human rights" and "halt to intelligence surveillance," the Kim  Yong-sam group is still resorting to surveillance on campus.  This indicates that they are a group of fascist dictators  little different from former rulers.    Surveillance on campus, intelligence surveillance, is a  product of the crisis of rule.    The Kim Yong-sam group must know clearly that though it is  trying to save the crisis of its rule at the point of the  bayonet, relying on surveillance on campus, intelligence  surveillance, it will result only in precipitating its  destruction.</p>

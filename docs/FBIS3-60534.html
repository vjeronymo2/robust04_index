Is that right?'' (from reader N.  Pavlovich's letter).    A SEM DNEY correspondent has talked to Anatoliy Kozhemyakin,  chief epidemiologist of the Belarusian Ministry of Health.  [Kozhemyakin] These rumors are grounded. While  Belarus recorded 22, 26, and 66 cases of diphtheria in 1990,  1991, and 1992, respectively, over the first 10 months of this  year, we have registered already 80 patients with 38 in Minsk  and 12 in its oblast. Unfortunately, we have death cases as  well. It is too early to speak about an epidemic, but the  disease has passed to the offensive.  [Malakhovskaya] Anatoliy Kuzmich, what are the  reasons for such a rapid spread of diphtheria?  [Kozhemyakin] People perceive diphtheria as a  children's infectious disease. However, no matter how  paradoxical this may be, this disease has matured considerably.  For example, among the 80 patients, 52 people were over the age  of 15. This can be explained by the fact that the immunity  acquired through vaccination weakens over the years. According  to laboratory tests conducted in Belarus, about 40 percent of  the population, mostly adults, have no diphtheria antibodies.  Therefore, the chief sanitary inspector of Belarus has issued  an order requiring that residents be immunized every 10 years  beginning from 16 years of age.    Certainly, we must strictly observe the terms of children's  immunization. By the way, about 87 percent of the Belarusian  population was immunized or repeatedly vaccinated against  diphtheria last year. Although this is one of the best  indicators among the CIS countries, it falls short of the 95  percent recommended by the World Health Organization [WHO].  [passage omitted]  [Malakhovskaya] Anatoliy Kuzmich, we have information  that an epidemic of diphtheria has already been registered in  Russia.  [Kozhemyakin] Not only in Russia, but also in  Ukraine. About 8,000 cases of diphtheria have been recorded in  Russia over the first nine months of this year with 254 deaths  among them. People's constant migration aggravates the  situation both in our republic and abroad. According to the WHO  statistics, 6,324 diphtheria patients have been recorded in 18  European countries over the first eight months of this year,  with Russia and Ukraine accounting for 97 percent.

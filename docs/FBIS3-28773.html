			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Japan and the U.S.  headed toward a showdown Wednesday [9 February] over a plethora  of trade issues as both sides hardened their positions before  Friday's summit between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and  President Bill Clinton.    Under orders from U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor,  U.S. negotiators suspended a series of high-level negotiations  with their Japanese counterparts scheduled for Wednesday.    Kantor told reporters he decided to terminate the subcabinet  talks which he said would "create more and more frustration  among the negotiators of both sides if we continue."    The Clinton administration has demanded that Tokyo make a  firm commitment to reducing its massive current account surplus,  which totaled 141 billion dollars last year, including a nearly  60 billion dollar trade surplus with the United States.    In particular, Washington wants the Japanese to buy more  foreign cars and auto parts, medical and telecommunications  equipment, and insurance, the three industry sectors currently  the focus of negotiations between Tokyo and Washington.    Kantor's surprise move angered Japanese negotiators and left  the task of hammering out any agreement to a direct showdown  with Japan's foreign minister Tsutomu Hata, who arrived in  Washington late Wednesday.    Officials have set make-or-break trade talks for Thursday  between Hata and Kantor.    "I have brought no new proposals in my luggage," Hata told  KYODO NEWS SERVICE while en route to Washington.    "The situation is extremely critical. Both sides need to  make mutual concessions, if possible," he said.    Hosokawa is due to meet with Clinton on Friday, but Tokyo  decided to send Hata to Washington a day ahead of schedule to  give the stalled trade talks a final push.    Senior Japanese officials who have been involved in  negotiating with Washington were visibly annoyed by what they  regarded as Kantor's high-handed negotiating style.    "I suppose I can pack up and go back to Japan now," one  disgruntled Japanese official said.    Kantor, who met with a group of Japanese reporters at the  white house on Wednesday afternoon, emphasized that his "get  tough" strategy has the full support of the president.    Clinton "has made it clear to us" that no agreement is  better  than a bad agreement, Kantor said.    The impasse, both Japanese and U.S. officials say, centers  on  how to measure progress on foreign access to and performance in  the Japanese market.    Washington has insisted on using "quantitative measures" of  progress, a step which Tokyo has rejected as anathema to free  trade.    Hata also reiterated Japan's opposition to the U.S. demand  for import targets, saying, "we have to stick to our principles."    Such measures would result in managed trade, which runs  counter to the "ongoing deregulation" championed by the Hosokawa  government, Hata said.    Kantor admitted that "there may or may not be an agreement"  by the time Hosokawa and Clinton meet on Friday and repeated a  warning that the U.S. will "reevaluate" its economic relations  with Japan if the talks collapse.    He declined to specify what steps Washington would take  other  than to say, "we have numerous options."    U.S. lawmakers who have backed the Clinton administration's  aggressive trade policy on Japan were less reticent.    "Super 301 is still the best approach to Japan," said  senator  Max Baucus, referring to the lapsed U.S. trade legislation which  mandates trade sanctions against countries engaging in unfair  trade practices.    Baucus, the democratic chairman of the Senate Subcommittee  on  Trade, said he has received "plenty of signals" from the Clinton  administration that it will restore super 301 if trade talks  with Japan sour.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Camdessus pleads with US to agree increase MR Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), yesterday delivered an urgent plea to the US Congress for it to vote through America's share of his organisation's proposed Dollars 60bn (Pounds 34bn) capital increase. Calling the 50 per cent increase in the IMF's capital 'absolutely critical,' Mr Camdessus begged Washington not to delay voting on its Dollars 12bn share. Mr Camdessus warned that without new resources, he might have to halt new IMF commitments late this year or early in 1993. 'I know some people have suggested this is not urgent, that the IMF quota increase can safely be postponed. Please believe me this is not so: we need the additional funds this year,' he told the US Chamber of Commerce yesterday. But chances of winning early congressional approval for the increase appeared dimmer than ever yesterday. Advocates of the capital increase had hoped to attach the measure to a foreign aid bill before the end of this month, but the breakdown of negotiations on Israel's request for Dollars 10bn of US loan guarantees now appears to have killed any prospect of this bill emerging. Without US agreement, the entire IMF capital increase would be halted, because the organisation's rules require approval from countries representing 85 per cent of its votes. The US's 19 per cent voting share is enough to block the measure. The need for new capital is especially great because of the call on IMF resources from the countries of eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet Union. The IMF chief hopes their membership applications will have been processed by the summer. But Democrats in Congress are wary of voting for the IMF funding, which proved political suicide in 1983. They want the Republican administration to make a more public commitment to the measure to avert the possibility that their opponents might use it against them in this autumn's congressional elections.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOARING ENERGY COSTS PUSH WHOLESALE PRICES UP 1.3%  </P> <P> The economic punch of the Persian Gulf crisis hit home today as the government  reported a 1.3% increase in wholesale prices led by staggering hikes in energy  costs -- and economists said the worst is yet to come.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called the figures "a matter of  concern."  </P> <P> The Labor Department's index of crude goods, including crude petroleum  products, rose 9.3%, the sharpest hike in 17 years.  </P> <P> "Anybody who didn't know this was coming obviously doesn't own a car," said  David Wyss, an economist at DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. "We've got at  least a couple more months of prices increases."  </P> <P> "The worst of the shocks will take two to three months to manifest itself at  the producer level and could take a little longer to go through the consumer  level," said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. in  Chicago.  </P> <P> Combined with skidding retail sales, which slipped 0.6% in August, and weak  industrial production, which fell 0.2% last month, economists forecast a grim  scenario of the U.S. economy in the coming months.  </P> <P> "It's the worst of all worlds -- higher inflation and weakening demand," Wyss  said. "It's a hard combination to fight. You combine the (price) number with  the weak retail number and the economy has real trouble."  </P> <P> "The timing (of the price increases) is very bad. Consumer confidence has been  hurt," Dederick said.  </P> <P> After declining 0.5% in July, the department's index for finished energy goods  climbed 9.5% in August. The crisis in the Middle East pushed gasoline prices up  16.9% in August after they had fallen 5.3% the month before.  </P> <P> Home heating oil prices skyrocketed 38.8% in August, the largest monthly  advance since January's boost of 25.3%. Natural gas prices, however, slipped  9.4% after rising 6.6% in July.  </P></p>

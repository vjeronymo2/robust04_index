			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] After half a century, Europe is again facing a  familiar monster: fascism. And Europe is again behaving in the  same way and making the same mistake. Its politicians are again  capitulating and, what is even more pathetic, they are covering  up the crimes and siding with the criminals [words indistinct].    Half a century ago Chamberlain travelled to Munich to sign  the shameful agreement that handed Czechoslovakia over to  Hitler's bloody embrace. His name is written in the pages of  history in large letters of fear, as a warning to future  generations that failing to confront fascism can bring only a  deceptive peace of perhaps a few months, but then claim millions  of lives. Instead of Chamberlain, we now have Lord Owen, who  has emulated the former in every respect. Chamberlain would  most certainly not have dared visit a place from which the Nazis  had expelled and murdered the population of other nationalities,  nor would he have held talks with the man who ordered it. With  his visit to Zvornik and his talks with the demented  psychiatrist and mass murderer [Radovan Karadzic], Owen has  desecrated the graves of thousands of Muslims from Zvornik, and  also the graves of those Serbs who tried to protect their  neighbors. Having no understanding of Karadzic's tricks, this  English lord has himself sinned against the victims, depriving  them of peace even in the next world. These victims left this  world in 1992 as innocent children would, in the mistaken belief  that the Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] and civilized Europe would  never allow any harm to come to them. Those Zvornik people who  survived, and all other Bosnians, realized after Zvornik whose  the JNA was, who stood behind it, and with what intentions.    With his visit to Zvornik, Lord Owen has revealed the  essence  of the European silence in the face of the Bosnian bloodshed.  In other words, Europe wrote off the people of Zvornik just as  it did the Czechs before the Second World War. Some in the West  are still trying to find excuses for Owen and Stoltenberg, in  the style: Let them be, they are just after the spotlight.  They have to do something to justify those high salaries of  theirs [word indistinct]. Their bad name could not be mended  even if they were to do a complete U-turn. The bad name of  Europe can be mended only by anti-fascists, and just such a  movement is beginning to rise.    Hemingway went to Spain half a century ago, primarily as a  fighter against fascism. Bernard-Henri Levy has been touring  fighters against fascism in Bosnia now, trying to make Europe  and the world see that a new modern fascism is at work here. He  has been making films, and he has formed the Party of United  Europe, which he calls the Sarajevo List. Bosnia is the last  chance to halt the onslaught of this new fascism and a  catastrophe that will be incomparably worse that the one  elicited by Chamberlain, as this time the fascists will have  nuclear weapons, Levy says.    To remind you, Hemingway -- to the detriment of mankind --  lost the battle against Chamberlain. Is Levy to suffer the same  fate? Or perhaps we should believe that Owen's name will be the  last one in the history of the shameful [word indistinct] of  Europe.</p>

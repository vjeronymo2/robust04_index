			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentator's article: "Correctly Handle Relationship </F> Between Reform, Development, and Stability"]    [Text] This year, as a crucial year in China's march  toward the goal of establishing a socialist market economic  structure, we will face arduous and difficult tasks in reform  and development. Correctly understanding and handling the  relationship between reform, development, and stability is of  important significance to the proper manipulation of the general  work set forth by the central authorities and to the successful  completion of all tasks.    Reform, development, and stability, which form a dialectical  unity, are interrelated and complement each other. They are  three indispensable pivots supporting the comprehensive  development of society. Reform is the motivating force,  development is the goal, and stability is the indispensable  precondition for reform and development, while reform and  development on their part serve as a solid foundation ensuring  social stability and perpetual political stability. We must  certainly proceed from the general interests and make sure  everything is properly done regarding reform, development, and  stability. Failure in any one of these three aspects is bound  to affect the two other aspects and thus upset the whole  situation.    Deepening reform and expanding the opening up process is the  only way to boost the economy. Reform is a process of  self-perfection and the development of the socialist system.  Reform further revitalizes the productive forces in society and  brings forth great economic development through a profound  readjustment of the relationship between the productive forces  and production relations and of that between the economic base  and the superstructure of socialist society. The further reform  and opening up advances, the more conditions favorable to  economic development are available. In the course of its  development, China's economy still faces some contradictions and  difficulties. For instance, the unsound state of the  macroeconomic regulation and control system, the irrational  economic structure, and the serious drain on the central  government's financial and tax revenues; the overexpanded scale  of investment in fixed assets and the rather wide margin of  price increases, which have resulted in more restrictive  "bottleneck" effects on economic growth and stronger  inflationary pressures; greater operational difficulties facing  many state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises and the  undermining of agriculture as the basis; and so on. These  phenomena are due to the interaction between residual  shortcomings of the old structure and the unsound state of the  new structure and mechanisms, and are problems stemming from the  deeper level of the structure, which is inevitable when reform  is advancing on all fronts. The fundamental solution to the  problems should be to further in-depth reform. Since last year,  the central authorities have advanced reform to a new  breakthrough stage in key links and reform is advancing on all  fronts in accordance with the requirement for the establishment  of a socialist market economic structure. Plans to reform the  financial and taxation system, the banking system, the  investment system, and the foreign trade system have been  formulated and put forth, while enterprise reform is continuing  to develop in depth with the focus laid on the transformation of  operational mechanisms, and efforts are being made to foster the  market system and to establish and perfect a system of  macroeconomic regulation and control. These new measures and  plans are to meet the objective needs of and serve as an  effective guarantee for the in-depth development of reform. If  we fail to conscientiously and promptly carry out these measures  and plans, it will be difficult for us to deepen reform, the  process of establishing a socialist market economic structure  will be prolonged, and, consequently, long-term economic  development will be jeopardized. So long as we fight this  "hard-won major campaign" well and successfully establish the  basic framework of a socialist market economy, we will lay down  an important foundation for the revitalization of China's  economy. Therefore, leading people at all levels must devote  more energy to reform; work more conscientiously, more  meticulously, and in a down-to-earth manner; and ensure constant  development of in-depth reform. They must further emancipate  their minds, uphold the principle of proceeding in everything  from reality, boldly blaze new trails, sum up experiences in  good time, properly solve contradictions and problems arising  from the in-depth development of reform, and thus ensure the  successful accomplishment of all reform targets.    Development is the last word. It is the starting point and  the destination of reform, and the result of the reforms will  finally be displayed through development. In order to prepare a  solid material basis for all the undertakings of socialism with  Chinese characteristics, the key lies in economic development.  To achieve development we need new ideas and new methods, which  spring from reform. Bypassing reform as a key process means we  are seeking development through the old structure and old  methods. Only by conducting reform, establishing a new  structure, and creating new methods will we be able achieve  development. When talking about development, we not only mean  striving to achieve a quantitative increase, but also to seek a  qualitative improvement of the economy. We must increase  economic returns through structural readjustment, technological  transformation, product development, and scientific management,  and we should no longer follow the old path of extensive  management--blindly seeking high output and expanding the scale  of investment.    The normal operation and healthy development  of the socialist market economy depends on coordination between  different trades and between the part and the whole, and on the  balance between economic returns and the growth rate. When  seeking development, a locality or a sector should never  sacrifice general and long-term interests for partial and  immediate interests. Partial interests must be submitted to  general interests, and one must give consideration to partial  interests as well when seeking general interests. Only in this  way can both partial and general interests be promoted side by  side. The economic growth rate should increase along with an  improvement in economic returns. The growth rate should be set  within the limits of our resources and ability. We do not want  a high growth rate only, but also steady and solid growth with  the simultaneous improvement of economic returns ensured. This  sort of development is solid development, the sort of  development that socialism with Chinese characteristics wants  and which we are striving for while ensuring stability.    Reform and development needs a stable social environment.  Without stability, no economy can thrive under any social  system. There are no exceptions in history, in China or in other  parts of the world alike. Only when a country is enjoying  political and social stability and the public are in a tranquil  mental state can reform be carried out in an orderly manner and  can the country achieve its set targets for development.  Without stability, nothing can be achieved. Reform cannot be  carried out successfully, let alone development. As pointed out  by Comrade Deng Xiaoping: "Without a stable environment,  everything will fall through. Even achievements already made  will be void." Of course, reform and development can also give  an impetus to the promotion of stability. Reform helps eliminate  existing irregularities and problems and establishes a more  scientific and rational new structure, thus bringing about  economic prosperity and an improvement in living standards.  This is also a reliable approach to and fundamental guarantee  for the achievement of stability.    Properly handling the relationship between reform,  development, and stability is an important strategic matter  which has a bearing on the development of socialism with Chinese  characteristics. The faster reform develops in depth, the more  one needs to keep sober-headed. It is necessary to  comprehensively analyze and accurately judge the basic  conditions regarding reform, development, and stability from a  realistic point of view and in light of actual circumstances,  and then handle the situation properly.    Out of consideration for general interests which rest on  reform, development, and stability, we must treat and resolve  the issues of an overheated economy and inflation. At present,  the scale of ongoing construction projects is already very large  in our country. The scale of investment to be launched this year  is not small either, and therefore restrictions due to the  "bottleneck" effect and inflationary pressures will increase in  the wake of economic development. Nevertheless, some localities  and sectors are still blindly seeking high output value and  growth rates and are expanding the scale of investment in quite  a big way. If the scale of investment gets seriously out of  control, this will inevitably aggravate inflation and price  hikes. It will not only cause drastic economic fluctuations and  affect the sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development  process, but will also create many difficulties in the basic  livelihood of the public. Exceptional increases in commodity  prices will in turn disturb the public and cause social unrest,  affecting the smooth progress of reform and economic development  as a whole. Therefore, this problem will not only affect reform  and development but will also upset social stability; therefore,  it is necessary to deal with it seriously. All localities and  all sectors must give first consideration to general interests,  strictly implement the state's macroeconomic regulation and  control policy, set an appropriate development speed according  to their own conditions, and actively support the central  authorities in comprehensively coordinating economic operations  and maintaining a balance between aggregate supply and demand.    Out of a consideration of the general interests which rest  on  reform, development, and stability, we must make great efforts  to reinvigorate state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises  and agriculture, both of which are the mainstays and foundation  of the national economy and support social development and  stability. How well they do will not only determine whether  sustained, rapid, and healthy economic development can be  maintained, but will also have a bearing on improved living  standards for the vast number of staff members, workers,  peasants, and cadres. Running well state-owned large and  medium-sized enterprises and reform of the agricultural  structure will not only give a great impetus to overall  development and to work on all fronts, but will also help  promote closer ties between the party and the public and  consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, thus ensuring that the  party and the masses, as well as the workers and peasants, will  work together with one heart and one mind to safeguard the  general interests. All localities and sectors must place the  operation to invigorate state-owned large and medium-sized  enterprises as the order of the day, work hard to ensure a  smooth transformation of the operational mechanism of  state-owned enterprises, gradually establish a modern enterprise  system, actively improve the internal management of enterprises,  vitalize enterprises, increase their potential for development,  make sure the value of state-owned assets is preserved and  increased, and give full play to the leading role of state-owned  enterprises in the national economy. Principal leading members  of party committees at all levels must personally attend to  work; adopt effective measures to reinforce the position of  agriculture as a basic sector; promote the comprehensive  development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and  fisheries while ensuring steady growth in grain and cotton  output; keep township and town enterprises constantly growing;  and make every effort to ensure increasing peasants' incomes.    Out of consideration for the general interests which rest  on reform, development, and stability, we must correctly handle  all kinds of social problems that emerge in the wake of reform  and development. Reform as a process of readjustment in the  interest structure and relations will inevitably give rise to  one type of social problem or another. Failure to properly  solve these problems will jeopardize the general interests. Our  cadres at all levels must conscientiously look into  contradictions among the people that arise from new  circumstances, and distinguish between the two categories of  contradictions of a different nature and handle them correctly.  They must try to correctly handle relations between the urban  and rural areas, as well as the relations between the central  and western parts of the country on the one hand and coastal  areas on the other, and properly deal with issues concerning  nationality solidarity, economic development in minority  nationality areas, and the issue of unfair distribution of  income and great disparities in income. They must be concerned  about the people's livelihood. Reform has brought about  extensive, remarkable improvement in the people's living  standards, but there are still some people with limited income  or who are living in poverty. Therefore, our cadres at all  levels, while concentrating on deepening reform of state- owned  large and medium-sized enterprises and reform of the  agricultural structure, must always bear in mind the masses'  wellbeing and show special concern for and extend aid to those  in difficulties. In relaxing price controls, one should never  relax market management. By relying on market regulation alone,  we can hardly stabilize the prices of important commodities that  have a direct bearing on the people's livelihood. Therefore, we  must strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control with a view  to keeping commodity prices stable. All localities must pay  attention to the "shopping basket" project and try their best to  raise the people's living standards.    Out of consideration for the general interests which rest on  reform, development, and stability, we must carry on the  anticorruption struggle in depth, unremittingly, and more  efficiently, and step up the comprehensive management of social  order with real earnest. The struggle against corruption is a  task of vital importance to the party's survival. If we let  corruption spread unchecked, we will lose popular support. If  so, we can hardly ensure social stability even with a prosperous  economy. At present, the anticorruption struggle remains a very  arduous task and brooks no slackness. The key to the  anticorruption operation lies in strengthening leadership and  keeping up our efforts. It is necessary to perfectly combine  the anticorruption struggle with deepening reform, expanding  opening up, and expediting development; to fully rely on the  masses; to take actions to deal with both symptoms and root  causes; and to make unremitting efforts to strive for new  successes. Poor conditions of social order may have a very bad  influence on reform and opening up, economic construction, and  social stability. Straightening out social order is the  public's strong desire and an important duty of governments at  all levels. This issue must be brought to the attention of  leaders at all levels, and effective measures must be taken to  solve it. It is necessary to deal severe blows at all kinds of  criminal activities and hooligans, thieves, and robbers who  threaten and jeopardize people's lives, state security, and  nationality solidarity. It is necessary to resolutely do away  with the practice of being hard on the one hand but soft on the  other, promote both the material and spiritual civilizations,  and strive to thoroughly improve social order.    The theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics  is the basis of the scientific theory guiding us to properly  handle the relationship between reform, development, and  stability. Comrade Deng Xiaoping gave a precise and scientific  exposition of this issue in volume three of his Selected  Works. General Secretary Jiang Zemin also brilliantly  elaborated his view in this regard in his report to the 14th  party congress and in a series of speeches. By conscientiously  studying these ideological theories, thoroughly understanding  the essences of these theories, and by applying them to the  social practice of reform and opening up, we will be able to win  one victory after another in the course of reform and  development, constantly preserve social and political stability,  and continuously advance the socialist cause.</p>

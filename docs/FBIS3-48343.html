			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Puppets Are Accelerating Chemical </F> War Preparations"]    [Text] Today our people and peaceloving people of the  world are strongly demanding complete abolition of chemical  weapons, in addition to nuclear weapons -- mass lethal weapons.    Chemical weapons, which kill and injure people by using  poisonous chemical materials, are branded as the most cruel  massacre weapons in the world and thus their use and development  have been prohibited by international commitments.    Only traitor Kim Yong-sam, who hangs out the signboard of  civilian politics, is openly pursuing possession of chemical  weapons.    This shows that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is going to  openly perpetrate not only nuclear war, but also chemical war,  against fellow countrymen. We cannot but regard it as very  grave. As has already been known, successive ruling bunches have  produced and stockpiled chemical weapons from long ago. There  are more than 40 underground nuclear warehouses and underground  chemical weapon warehouses in areas around Mt. Kyeryong in South  Chungchong Province and in the area near Suwon, Kyonggi  Province. Many ion chemical weapons, known as malicious mass  lethal weapons, are stockpiled there.    While talking about possession of independent chemical  warfare capability, former South Korean dictators built more  than 10 poisonous gas plants in South Korea and produced a great  number of chemical weapons.    The rascals brought from the United States on a large scale  military aircraft capable of dropping chemical bombs and 155-mm  [word indistinct] guns capable of firing the bombs. They also  purchased gas masks on a pretext of preparing for chemical  warfare.    A chemical, biological, and radiological unit school has  been  operating in the puppet Army for a long time to train  professional chemical warfare experts.    By loudly raving that chemical warfare has become a  worldwide  trend, the former puppet warmongers exhibited various chemical  equipment they produced and even propagandized its superiority.    The Team Spirit joint military exercise, conducted every  year  in South Korea, has become an important leverage to achieve not  only the nuclear war plan, but also the rascals' chemical war  plan. New chemical war equipment was mobilized in the recent  Team Spirit joint military exercise and units specializing in  chemical war training participated in the exercise.    Reporting on the true aspect of chemical war exercises  conducted during the Team Spirit joint military exercise several  years ago, a South Korean broadcast said that in addition to  aircraft attacks on simulated areas in the North side, smoke  bombs, chemical shells, bacterial shells, and even explosive  shells, were dropped during the exercise. As the result, all  living things can barely survive.    Just as former dictators, puppet Kim Yong-sam, who claims to  be a civilian politician in South Korea, is also scheming to  inflict, not only nuclear disaster, but also poisonous gas  calamity on fellow countrymen by clinging to the sleeves of  outside forces.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, in a so-called conference of  offices and agencies concerned, decided to possess chemical  weapons and to submit the bill to National Assembly for  ratification.    This clearly shows how frantically the rascals are running  amok with chemical war preparations.    Going against the trend of the time toward disarmament and  detente, the civilian warmongers are accelerating production of  chemical weapons -- mass lethal weapons the use of which is  prohibited worldwide -- and are attempting to inflict the  disaster of chemical weapons on fellow countrymen. Their crime  will not be pardoned forever.    The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam should give up criminal  chemical war preparations and should act with discretion.    If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, in spite of the warnings  of our people and the people of the world, is advancing along  the road of continuously committing antinational maneuvers to  accelerate preparation of nuclear war and chemical war on the  Korean peninsula in collusion with outside forces, the rascals  cannot avoid the responsibility for all consequences arising  therefrom nor can they evade the stern judgment of history.</p>

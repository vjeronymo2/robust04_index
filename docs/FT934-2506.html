			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / New town body to offer land as prize The Commission for the New Towns, responsible for development and sales of publicly owned assets in 21 English towns, is offering prizes of land at a discount, or even free, to winners of a competition between councils and private-sector partners, Paul Cheeseright writes. It is asking councils which have new towns in their areas to combine with companies to submit plans by March for housing, commercial or leisure developments on or near commission land. Winning plans would receive land at less than its commercial value. The competition, announced yesterday in Telford to coincide with the new town's 25th anniversary, is designed not only to hasten development in the new towns but also to accelerate commission land sales. The commission is being wound up by the government in 1998, by which time it hopes to have sold the assets in the new towns. Since 1979 it has raised Pounds 2bn for the Treasury. Its contribution in 1992-93 was Pounds 165m and, with property markets still uncertain, is expected to be about the same this year. Assets for disposal include 9.6m sq ft of commercial premises and 18,000 acres of land. The largest concentrations of land are in Milton Keynes and Telford, each of which has about 4,000 acres controlled by the commission.</p>

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Rise in steel demand predicted: OECD sees glimmer of hope - but output is set to stagnate AVERAGE demand for steel in the industrialised world should pick up slightly this year, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), offering a glimmer of hope for the recession-hit industry The OECD's latest steel market review says prices have stabilised since the turn of the year and might rise in the second half. This follows a year in which demand and output fell abruptly, causing heavy losses and job reductions for many of the leading suppliers. The OECD forecasts a 0.5 per cent rise in steel demand, after the more than 5 per cent drop recorded last year, so bringing steel consumption in 1992 to 4.5 per cent below the level in 1990. Output should stagnate this year, after falling by 4 per cent in 1991, says the OECD. The US steel industry can expect an upturn in demand on the strength of a rise in housing starts and the beginnings of a recovery in car production. However, prices are expected to remain soft and the US industry is facing another year of operating losses, says the report. It does not expect a real increase in steel demand in the European Community, on the grounds that the EC is heading for only a slight economic recovery this year, with no significant rise in industrial investment or consumption. Steel users are expected to rebuild depleted stocks in anticipation of a stronger recovery, which should at least stabilise the market and help end the price fall. For the Japanese steel industry, the outlook is bleak. Consumption fell 2.5 per cent in 1991 and the general weakening of the national economy should produce a 'considerable' decline in steel demand in the first half of this year, in all sectors except shipbuilding. This, plus the effect of de-stocking, led to a 13.5 per cent fall in output in the first quarter and output is expected to fall another 16.8 per cent in the second, says the report.</p>

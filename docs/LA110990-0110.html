			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS-GIANTS ON TV IN L.A.  </P> <P> The Rams announced Thursday that their game against the New York Giants Sunday  at 1 p.m. at Anaheim Stadium is a sellout, allowing it to be televised locally  on CBS.  </P> <P> The network could have found itself in a jam in Los Angeles had the Raiders'  home game against Green Bay sold out as well. CBS, also televising the Raiders  because the Packers are an NFC team, would have had to make a choice.  </P></p>

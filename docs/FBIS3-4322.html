			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhang Yanning (1728 1750 1337) from "Earnestly Study the </F> `Decision' of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee" column: "My Understanding in Three Points on  Establishing a Modern Enterprise System"]    [Text] In the "decision" adopted at its third plenum, the  14th CPC Central Committee clearly defined the objectives of  enterprise reform in China for the next period. It also  proposed that a modern enterprise system, characterized by  distinct relations between ownership and management and between  power and responsibility, the separation of government functions  from those of enterprises, and scientific management, be  gradually instituted. This important move shows a certain depth  of theory and is a very significant act.  <H5>  I. The Basic Characteristics of the Modern Enterprise System </H5>   The "decision" pointed out the five basic  characteristics of the modern enterprise system as follows: 1)  The distinct relations between ownership and management of an  enterprise with entire corporate property rights [fa ren cai  chan quan 3127 0086 6299 3934 2938] formed by the investment of  all investors, including the state. 2) The right of  independent operations in accordance with the law, as well as  the obligations of assuming sole responsibility for its own  profits and losses, paying taxes according to regulations, and  undertaking to preserve and increase the value of assets  contributed by investors. 3) The limited rights and  responsibilities of the investors. 4) The ability of  organizing production and operation in light of market demands.  5) A scientific leadership structure and an organizational  management system. These characteristics are integrated,  but the most important are the explicit corporate property  system and the limited liability system of an enterprise.    The institution of a modern enterprise system calls for  a perfect corporate property system in an enterprise.  Under the traditional planned economic structure, state-owned  enterprises, being subsidiaries of state administrative organs,  did not have independent legal person status. In the course of  practicing the planned commodity economy a few years ago,  although the state instituted a legal person system in  enterprises through legislation, it was still incomplete. In  name, state-owned enterprises had legal person status, but in  reality they lacked independent property rights that legal  persons must possess, so they found it difficult to establish a  restraining mechanism for properties, and the state still had to  assume unlimited liabilities for them. Meanwhile, enterprises  were not real independent legal persons because they also found  it difficult to operate independently and assume  responsibilities for their own profits and losses.    To state-owned enterprises, the essence of the  enterprise corporate property system is the confirmation of  ownership belonging to the state and the independent corporate  property rights belonging to enterprises. On this basis,  enterprises can enjoy civil rights, undertake civil  responsibilities, solve the problem of having someone to bear  responsibilities in enterprises, and unify enterprises' capacity  to exercise civil rights and capacity to dispose of business, so  that enterprises can really become a legal entity capable of  operating independently and assuming responsibilities for their  own profits and losses. To define enterprise corporate  property rights, the crucial point is to straighten out  relations between ownership and management (chiefly, to draw a  clear demarcation between ownership and management, diversify  the main bodies of ownership and management, and to make the  trading of ownership and management convenient and the operation  of ownership and management effective, and so on). In addition,  the ownership of an investor (referring to the state) should be  separated from the property rights of a legal person (referring  to an enterprise).    Under certain conditions, the ownership of an investor is  manifested by his possession of shareholder's rights. That is,  he can take benefits derived from the assets as a shareholder  according to the law, participate in making major policy  decisions (generally including enterprise's operating  principles, long-term investment plans, fiscal budgets and final  accounts, examination and approval of plans to distribute  profits and redress losses, increase or decrease of authorized  capital, major changes in ownership and management, and others),  and select managerial personnel. The investors can neither  exercise direct control over all corporate properties nor those  parts belonging to themselves. They can use the rights vested  with shareholders to exert influence on enterprises' actions,  but cannot directly interfere in enterprises' operational  activities. When an enterprise goes bankrupt, the investors  will only assume limited liability on the enterprise's debts  according to the capital amount they have contributed to the  enterprise. The corporate property rights are demonstrated by  the enterprise's right to own and use the corporate property,  obtain initial profits, and punish relevant personnel, as well  as the enterprise's responsibility for its own operational  activities. The ownership of the investors and the corporate  property rights are confirmed and protected by the law and are,  therefore, sacred and inviolable.    Another characteristic of the modern enterprise  system is shown in its scientific organizational structure,  clear division of duties, and sound checking, balancing, and  restraining mechanisms. A company system has been  practiced in the course of reorganizing state-owned enterprises,  under which a company is constituted according to its corporate  property, and new leading bodies including a general meeting of  shareholders, board of directors, board of supervisors, and so  on are set up in accordance with the law. The chairman of a  board of directors is the corporate representative of an  enterprise, and the managers are appointed by the board of  directors and should be responsible to it, which is different  from the former factory director (or manager) responsibility  system. Various independent but interacting ties with clearly  stipulated powers and responsibilities are formed between the  operators and producers through the company's power organs,  decisionmaking organs, and supervisory organs, and are defined  and realized in line with the law and the articles of  corporation. Its core is to establish a power structure of the  shareholders, board of directors, board of supervisors, and  managerial personnel at different levels, and to form a  restraining, checking, and balancing mechanism to coordinate the  relations among shareholders, corporate representatives,  operators, staff, and workers, through the operation of the  company's organizational system including the shareholders'  general meeting, board of directors, executive body, board of  supervisors, and so on. In the meantime, modern management  methods and means will be adopted to improve and enhance the  specialized and comprehensive management of an enterprise in  various areas. The three reform measures of the enterprise  system will be carried out in light of the requirements on  enterprises in practicing a socialist market economy, while the  enterprise's administrative rating will be canceled and the  bounds between cadres and workers broken.    The organizational system of a company in Western, developed  countries has a different characteristic. In the composition of  shareholders, shares are mainly held by a corporate body. Like  Japan and Germany, corporate shareholders are mainly banks or  other enterprises. In Britain and the United States, however,  they are mainly retirement funds, insurance companies, and so  on, rather than banks or other financial institutions. U.S. law  prohibits banks from holding shares. Owing to different  compositions of shareholders, there are varying management  structures in the companies of various countries. The board of  directors in a Japanese company has more internal directors who  are members of senior management nominated by the general  manager (or president), and shareholders play a comparatively  limited role. In the United States, about two-thirds of the  company directors are from shareholders, because the law  provides that external directors must hold a certain proportion  of a listed company, and some committees of the company must be  constituted by external directors. In Germany and some northern  European countries, a dual board of directors system is  practiced, under which the board of supervisors makes strategic  policies and exercises supervisory functions, while the board of  directors acts as an executive managerial department composed of  senior administrative personnel. The German law also provides  that one-third or one-half of the members of a board of  supervisors must be elected from staff and workers so that they  can participate in decisionmaking.    There is a new development trend in the corporate management  structure in some large international companies. For example,  the ownership has undergone an extensively diversified and  decentralized transformation, the shareholders have no longer  exercised a direct control over enterprises, the board of  directors has changed its functions from management to  supervision and policymaking, the power in operation and  management has been shifted to enterprise operators, and the  operators' limits of authority have been enlarged. These  different organizational systems relating to companies are  constantly changing and making adjustments in various countries  and at varying economic development stages. Although they have  disadvantages as well as advantages, on the whole, they are  effective and relatively scientific and reasonable. The  "company law" promulgated by China and various implementation  measures now being formulated have drawn in some useful parts of  the systems practiced in Western companies. China has also  worked out relatively clear stipulations on company's  organizational system in light of the national situations. In  future experiments and operations, we should repeatedly have it  revised and refined to meet the emerging problems.  <H3>  II. The Company System Is a Major Organizational Form of  the Modern Enterprise System </H3>   Under the traditional planned economic structure, the  organizational forms of enterprises in China were differentiated  by their ownership nature. In fact, it was an operational mode  of unified state control over revenue and expenditure. But,  according to the requirement of a market economy, the modern  enterprise organizational forms are differentiated by the  organizational forms of property and the legal rights and  responsibilities that are undertaken.    In most cases, a company system is adopted as a form of  the modern enterprise organizational systems and is a main legal  form of such systems under the market economic structure.  Under this structure, the systems of enterprises are numerous  and varied. Distinguished by properties, they can be wholly  owned enterprises, partnership enterprises, cooperative  enterprises, enterprises with a company system, and so on. The  state-owned enterprises can also be in many forms, which chiefly  include state wholly owned limited companies, state-owned  companies with limited liability (whose shares are held by legal  persons), and state holding limited companies. The "company  law" promulgated by China also includes an exclusively  state-funded company as a form of limited liability company -- a  state wholly owned company. In recent years, such state wholly  owned companies have also been legally approved in some Western  countries and have attained relatively good results. The  advantage of a "state wholly owned company with limited  liability" is that investor can really represent the interests  of the state, which is conducive to exercising macroeconomic  regulation and control, optimizing product mix, and playing a  backbone role in economic development.    A limited liability company and a joint-stock limited  company are the principal forms of reorganizing state-owned  enterprises to practice a company system, and both cover  operations which are aimed at earning profits. With regard  to a limited liability company, the liability undertaken by a  shareholder to the company is limited to the amount of capital  he has paid, and the company undertakes limited liability for  its debts with its total assets. With regard to a joint-stock  limited company, its total capital is divided into an equal  amount of shares, a shareholder undertakes his limited liability  to the company with the number of shares he holds, and the  company undertakes limited liability for its debts with its  total assets. At present, the establishment of joint-stock  companies in China has just begun, and the procedures for  setting up a joint-stock limited company are strict, because its  articles of corporation should be standardized and accounts  publicized. Hence, many enterprises can hardly meet the  requirements. Relatively speaking, a limited liability company  has the general advantages of enterprises with a company system.  As shares are only subscribed internally, they have relatively  fewer shareholders and simpler procedures. Therefore, at the  initial stage of practicing a company system in state-owned  enterprises, it is suitable to reorganize them into one-share or  multi-share limited liability companies first. Some of them can  be reorganized into joint-stock limited companies, which only  absorb the staff and workers of the enterprises as shareholders.  As to some exceptionally large state-owned enterprises, they  can also be reorganized into enterprise groups controlled by  companies with limited liability or companies limited by shares.  A listed joint- stock limited company means that the stocks  issued by this company can be listed in a stock exchange for  trading provided that it has been approved by the state  administration for securities. The procedural requirements for  its incorporation are relatively strict. Internationally, the  general requirements for a listed company and the listing of its  stocks are chiefly as follows: 1) Whether it accords with the  country's law on the trading of securities and the capital  amount for a listed company as stipulated by the stock exchange;  2) the operational performance and major profit-making  capabilities; 3) the capital structure -- the composition of  self- possessed funds and borrowed funds; 4) the capability of  debt repayment; 5) the standards for distribution of stock  rights and the maintenance of adequate liquidity; 6) the market  prices of stocks to be listed for trading; and so on. The  "company law" promulgated in China sets out similar requirements  and pertinent stipulations on the temporary suspension of  trading and termination of listing. Because stock trading  involves the public interests of investors in society, only a  small number of enterprises with high returns, steady growth,  and a good reputation will be established as this type of  companies according to the law.  <H3>  III. The Points for Attention Concerning the Practice of a  Company System in Reorganizing the State-Owned Enterprises </H3>   The "decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee pointed out: "The practice of a company  system in the state-owned enterprises is a useful exploration  for the institution of a modern enterprise system." The company  system is an effective form of realizing the modern enterprise  system. The reorganization of state-owned enterprises into  those with a company system should proceed from China's actual  conditions. We must be aware that the transformation of  enterprises from the previous "factory system" to the present  "company system" is a major change in China in respect of the  enterprise system, which is of vital significance to  emancipating and developing the productive forces and ensuring  the success in enterprise reforms. This is why we must make  great efforts to do the work well.    1. The reorganization of state-owned enterprises to  practice a company system is aimed at thoroughly transforming  enterprise operational mechanisms and forming a new modern  enterprise system. During experiments with the joint-stock  system and enterprise groups in the past few years, some  enterprises placed the transformation of operational mechanisms  in a secondary position, while others thought that the  establishment of joint-stock companies simply meant turning  property rights into stocks and listing them on the stock  exchange for trading, regarding this as a short cut for raising  funds and setting up new businesses. Still others only engaged  in setting up "renamed companies." As a result, few changes  were made to the operational mechanisms so that enterprises  still lacked vitality. Therefore, we must be clear that the  purpose of setting up enterprises with a company system is  neither for simplistically changing their names nor for raising  funds. Rather, it is aimed at genuinely transforming their  operational mechanisms and instituting a modern enterprise  system. In other words, it is aimed at straightening out the  relations between ownership and management with regard to the  state and enterprises through reorganization so that enterprises  will be able to extricate themselves from their status as  subsidiaries of government organs and to cut off the umbilical  cord that integrates government administration with enterprises.  In this way, enterprises will really possess corporate property  rights, achieve unified capacity to exercise civil rights and  dispose of business, and become a genuine legal entity and main  body in market competition in name as well as in reality, which  is characterized by "independent operation, assumption of sole  responsibility for profits and losses, self-development, and  self- restraint."    2. It is necessary to persistently maintain the  position of public ownership as a main body to ensure that  public property is not infringed upon. In the course of  reorganizing enterprises to practice a company system, the  establishment of corporate property rights in enterprises on the  basis of distinctive relations between ownership and management  does not mean changing the state's ownership status. It is only  the management mode of state assets that has been changed. That  means the form of managing the assets in kind has been changed  to that of managing the assets in value. Here, the state still  controls the ownership, and the total amount of state assets has  not reduced or lost because of the change.    Moreover, through the trading of property rights, the  holding of shares by legal persons, and the diversification of  share rights, rational circulation of state assets and effective  allocation of resources can be achieved, the stock of state  assets in enterprises can be revitalized, and the preservation  and increase of the value of state assets can be guaranteed.  After the company system is practiced in enterprises, public  assets will still account for an absolutely advantageous portion  of total social assets, and the state-owned economy will still  control the lifelines of the national economy, which will  exercise an leading role in social economic development. It is  necessary to screen assets, settle claims, clear debts, and draw  a demarcation between ownership and management according to  relevant laws and regulations. For this purpose, first and  foremost, it is necessary to make a realistic evaluation of  assets, appraise and fix the amount of property held by legal  persons in enterprises, prevent stocks from being broken down  and sold at low prices or even occupied by individuals without  compensation, and avoid state assets being nibbled away and  embezzled, so as to ensure that state assets and their rights  and interests are not encroached upon.    3. It is necessary to strictly abide by the pertinent  laws, regulations, and policies of the state. We must  strive to achieve the principal objectives of separating the  duties of enterprises from those of the administration, clarify  the relations between ownership and management, intensify the  checking and balancing mechanism, shake off the unreasonable  burdens, and so on. To this end, we should conscientiously  conduct feasibility studies and demonstrations, set up a  rational and explicit structure of share rights, conduct strict  evaluation and auditing of assets, and formulate articles of  corporation. In particular, we should establish a standardized  institutional and management structure of a company, give scope  to the institution, overcome artificial interference, and  properly perform the work of convergence before and after  reorganization. Relevant departments are now studying and  working out implementation measures to enforce the "company law"  and the "regulations on supervision and management of properties  in state-owned enterprises" which will be promulgated very soon.  On the basis of the above, the reorganization of enterprises  should be brought into line with legal standardization. The  question of which pattern enterprises will be reorganized should  be guided by the terms and procedures stipulated in the "company  law."    4. It is necessary to persistently proceed from actual  conditions and avoid rigid conformity. The reorganization  of enterprises to practice a company system is a momentous  change of the enterprise system in China and is therefore an  arduous as well as complicated task. In working out measures  for implementation and operation, we should proceed from the  present conditions of our state-owned enterprises and put them  into practice by stages, in groups, and according to different  categories through experiments.    The conditions of enterprises in China differ greatly. That  is why we must proceed from the reality to resolve the problems  that exist in different kinds of enterprises accordingly. The  general situation of the state-owned enterprises in terms of  performance is: One-third of them are earning profits, one-third  are making profits by a narrow margin, and one-third have been  sustaining losses for a long time. Hence, we should draw up  reorganization plans for different kinds of enterprises in  accordance with the state's industrial policies and in line with  the requirements to ensure the leading position of the public  economy, so as to reorganize all sorts of enterprises into  different company patterns with respective equity structures in  light of their trades, scope, degree of involvement in the  market, and position in the national economy as a whole.    The reorganization of the existing state-owned enterprises  should be carried out by stages and in groups. Enterprises  which are more competitive in their trades for better  performance, lighter burdens, and stronger leadership should be  selected for experiments, and their experience should be summed  up as soon as possible and then disseminated deliberately. We  should try our best to select enterprises for experiments from  the existing companies and those which are practicing a  joint-stock system, and should not spend too much time on the  experiments. In addition, we should also select some  enterprises which correspond to the state's industrial policies,  or which have better economic results and hold a relatively  important position in the region or trade, or which have  associated operations with other enterprises. Except for those  in some specialized trades, which will be reorganized into  state's wholly owned limited liability companies, most of the  state-owned enterprises should be reorganized into limited  liability companies whose stocks are held by a number of  shareholders so that share rights are controlled by different  investment units. Those limited liability companies which have  made profits for three consecutive years, whose targets of  economic results have reached a certain level, and which have  met the requirements stipulated by the law can be transformed  into joint-stock limited companies according to legal  procedures. Only a few joint-stock limited companies  reorganized from ordinary enterprises can have their stocks  listed for trading. Moreover, only those large enterprises of  the state's backbone industries with excellent performance and  steady growth will be selected as listed companies strictly in  line with the conditions required by the law.    In practicing the company system, it is necessary to screen  the historical "burdens" of state-owned enterprises. Owing to  various reasons, there are a wide range of enterprises which  have suffered losses for a long time, and the amounts of their  losses have been very large. Some of them have been deep in  debts and found it very difficult even to survive, which have  become heavy burdens of society. With their backward productive  techniques and outmoded equipment, their products are  unmarketable and overstocked so that they find it difficult to  enter the market to participate in competition. Therefore, in  the course of reorganizing enterprises, it is necessary to  eliminate a number of enterprises which lack sound operation and  management, suffer losses for a long time, fail to offset their  debts with assets, and show no signs of turning from deficits to  profits, in the principle of market competition wherein the  superior ones will prosper and the inferior ones will be  eliminated, (but in formulating concrete measures for  implementation, consideration should be given to the tolerance  of various quarters). Of course, meticulous work should be  performed in dealing with various kinds of loss-making  enterprises, which should be appraised, differentiated, and  handled according to varying circumstances. With regard to the  enterprises capable of revival with their own efforts and a  certain external assistance, they should be given opportunities  to strive to shake off their historical "burdens" and reverse  their losing situation. The State Economic and Trade Commission  has proposed that the unreasonable debt burdens of state-owned  enterprises should be handled on a case- by-case basis. We  should resolutely work according to this proposal.</p>

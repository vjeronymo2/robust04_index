			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Arts: Orfeo - Coliseum The Orfeo that David Freeman directed for English National Opera in 1981 was his first substantial achievement in this country. The London branch of his Opera Factory was yet to get underway, and the ideas and approach to music theatre which Freeman put into into practice in his staging of Monteverdi's favola per musica must have seemed far less familiar then than they do now. Yet it emerges once again as a fascinating, penetrating piece of drama, a wonderfully imaginative and moving solution to the problems of presenting the first of all operatic masterpieces. In a programme note he describes Orfeo as 'not the work of professional opera writers: rather the response of two friends (Monteverdi and Alessandro Striggio) to the various attempts at recreating Greek drama which had taken place in the preceding ten years'. It is this mysterious mixture of theatre, religious ceremony and musical lyricism that is captured so well here. In the opening and closing acts the threads of a communal celebration are woven together with the bundle of myths out of which the story of Orfeo's tragedy gradually takes shape; in the third and fourth acts, on the banks of the river Styx and the Underworld itself, the action focuses down from the community to the individual, and in the nightmare world of Orfeo's imagination the drama passes over from ritual to fully-fledged opera. It's almost as if it is necessary for Orfeo's great aria 'Possente spirto' in Act 3 to open up that new world of musical feeling. With sets confined to some scattered boulders and patterned hangings, the sense of place is deliberately under-emphasised. The singers themselves create the atmosphere, provide all the context for the unfolding of the story. Freeman is served splendidly by his cast, which has Antony Rolfe-Johnson's Orfeo as its focus, singing with unfailing elegance and intensity, and managing even the most elaborate decoration of his arias with an ease that never neglects the expressive weight of every phrase. Elsewhere there are few weaknesses and many stylish strengths. The intelligence and lucidity of all the singing (in Anne Ridler's English translation) are characterised right at the start in the prologue by Jennifer Smith's rapt delivery of Music's invocation, and later encompasses especially Margaret Preece's Nymph, Sally Burgess's Messenger (wonderfully moving in her aria to Orfeo), Therese Feighan's Hope, and Marie Angel's distinctive, seductive Euridice. Christopher Robson leads the Shepherds with verve and rounds out every one of his phrases with eloquence. The performance is directed by Harry Bicket. At times the instrumental playing seemed less characterful than it could be, though the Coliseum is an enormous space in which to make 17th-century instruments tell expressively. And there is never anything which detracts from this profoundly revealing staging, one which gets closer to the essence of Orfeo than any more gilded, elaborate presentation seems ever likely to approach.</p>

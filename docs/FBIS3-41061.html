Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese delegation to the session,  expounded on how to effectively prevent the spread of nuclear  weapons at the second session of the preparatory committee for  the 1995 conference of parties to the treaty on the  Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which was held this week  and concluded today.    Sha said "China attaches great importance to the prevention  of nuclear weapons proliferation and the maintenance of an  effective international legal mechanism for that purpose."    "At the same time, China also believes that  non-proliferation  by itself is not the ultimate goal for mankind, and that the  objective must be complete prohibition and thorough destruction  of nuclear weapons."    As the nuclear countries fail to agree to ban and destroy  nuclear weapons, "the imbalance inherent in the treaty in the  rights and obligations between the nuclear and non-nuclear  states is perpetuated and the security demand by many  non-nuclear states cannot be genuinely assured."    So, people should put emphasis on the commitment by the  nuclear nations to non-first-use and non-use of nuclear weapons,  Sha stressed.    "The Chinese Government believes that conditions are now  ripe" for making that commitment, Sha said.    The reason, he went on, is that with the ending of the Cold  War era, the first-use defense doctrines of the East and West  based on a balance of nuclear terror and nuclear deterrence  against conventional supremacy have lost their validity and  pretext.    Sha criticized some big super nuclear powers for lack of  sincerity for peace.    "Should the nuclear states, the largest nuclear states with  global nuclear attack capabilities in particular, emphasize only  non-proliferation and their own absolute security to the neglect  of the legitimate concerns of the non-nuclear states,... how can  they expect the large number of non-nuclear states trust their  sincerity for peace," he said.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs worried by invasions of privacy THE Commons national heritage select committee yesterday expressed concern about the threat to privacy coming from easily available bugging devices and long-range cameras. Mr Joe Ashton, Labour MP for Bassetlaw, told how the committee looking into privacy and media intrusion had been briefed in a private session by police and security experts on the technology of intrusion. Apart from bugging devices there were telephoto lenses, Mr Ashton said, capable of taking pictures at a range of 1.6km. 'The technology is now available to tap into anyone, anywhere and at a very cheap price,' he added. Ms Patsy Chapman, editor of the News of the World, in evidence to the committee, said she had never been offered such material although she conceded it was a potential issue. The scale of any trouble depended on how many people were prepared to buy such material and whether a market for it developed, she said. Mr Gerald Kaufman, the chairman of the committee, said that if the police wanted to tap people's telephone lines they had to have the authorisation of the home secretary. Was it proper, Mr Kaufman asked, for newspapers to be able to publish material that would not be permitted in a court of law because it was obtained illegally? 'That is why it doesn't happen,' Ms Chapman said. 'It happened on one occasion that I know of.' She was apparently referring to the case of the recording of private telephone calls of Mr David Mellor, the former heritage secretary. At the committee Lord McGregor, chairman of the Press Complaints Commission said he was opposed to any privacy legislation. But if there had to be specific offences such as physical intrusion or electronic eavesdropping then 'the least objectionable form of legal action' would be civil offences that applied to everyone and not just journalists.</p>

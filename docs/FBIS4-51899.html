			<p>BFN       [Text] [Minister Yi continues] Although the focal point is  the nuclear problem, an even more important issue for North  Korea is whether it makes an appropriate decision that  corresponds to the trend of the international community and of  international history.    [Reporter Yi] Reports noted that there are two different  lines--hardline and moderate--in the United States, our ally,  toward the North Korean nuclear problem. On the other hand, the  people put forward the line of stick and carrot. I understand  that our government is maintaining a position that it will not  push ahead with economic cooperation with North Korea unless the  North Korean nuclear problem is solved. Do you intend to  maintain this policy in the future, too?    [Minister Yi] Yes. The nuclear issue, unlike other ordinary  issues, is one which decides the destiny of the nation. This  issue, regardless of whether one has one, two, or five nuclear  weapons, is indeed fearful. Therefore, one should not evade the  main point of the issue. We have a number of plans for economic  cooperation to be carried out when a significant progress is  seen. In addition, we also have a plan to form not only the  economic common body but also a national commonwealth through  economic cooperation. However, these plans can begin when a  significant progress is seen in resolving the nuclear problem.  Our situation is, in a sense, that we are waiting while making  preparations. I believe that this is well understood by the  North Korean side.    [Reporter Yi] We declared that we will not push ahead with  the exchange of North-South special envoys, which was put  forward as a precondition for a third round of U.S.-North Korea  talks. I understand, however, that this does not mean that we  exclude North- South dialogue. What is your view on the prospect  for North-South dialogue?    [Minister Yi] This is similar to the case of economic  cooperation. In other words, this is up to the North Korean  decision. The Korean peninsula should not remain as an exception  to the trend of international history. This is what we and our  neighboring countries wish. It is a principle that problems  should be resolved by the parties concerned. We have a framework  called the basic North-South agreement. We also have a framework  called the joint denuclearization declaration for the nuclear  problem. Based on this, various joint committees were formed. We  should begin dialogue through these channels. All this will work  as an excellent occasion for North Korea to resolve national  issues and to evade its isolation.    We hope that North Korea, keenly aware of this situation,  will make a good decision. We also urge North Korea to do so.    [Reporter Yi] The people pointed out that the unification  policy by the diplomacy-security team of the government was  confusing and inconsistent in the past. Thus, there were  problems in its team work. People also pointed out that the  Unification Board failed to play its role and functions  properly. What is your view on this?    [Minister Yi] I do not think that there was serious  confusion. As you know, each government office has its own  characteristic in deciding important works assigned to it. The  Defense Ministry is devoted to defending the nation and the  Agency for National Security Planning places priority to  security of our system and nation. The Foreign Ministry thinks  of our international image and international cooperation. The  Unification Board is the one that should push ahead with works  pertaining to unification in a progressive way.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA also evaluated the potential of add-on VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control devices (i.e., carbon adsorbers and incinerators).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although no cases are known where add-on controls are used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for outdoor painting at shipyards, they have been used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce spraybooth emissions by many other industries. Most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coating operations at shipyards take place outdoors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily because of the size of parts painted. This makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capture of emissions difficult and expensive. Use of add-on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls for outdoor painting was not selected as the basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for MACT for these reasons. It should be noted, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a portable enclosure that will contain particulate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC during abrasive blasting and coating of ships' hulls is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under commercial development. Should these enclosures prove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technically and economically feasible, their performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be considered by any State or the Federal Government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in developing future rules for this industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Two types of coating operations at shipyards where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions are more available to capture were examined more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> closely for the feasibility of add-on controls: indoor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coating operations and painting inside of ship's tanks or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other internal enclosed spaces. Based on a brief screening  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses, using the limited available data that assumes all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spray areas are continually drafted to the control device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (whether painting operations are underway in all areas or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not), add-on control was estimated to be on the order of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $150,000/Mg of VOHAP removed. The EPA believes that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost is not reasonable for this source category. As a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result, add-on controls were not investigated further nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected as the basis for MACT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In reality, the amount of VOC and HAP controlled at a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site is dependent on the rate of paint application, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration of these compounds in the exhaust air stream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the painting operation, the flow rate of the air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stream flowing into the add-on control unit and a host of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other factors. The suitability of add-on controls can only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be determined on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  After review of alternatives more stringent than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT floor, the EPA is proposing to set the MACT standard at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the floor based on the California marine coatings rule which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is for both new and existing sources. The costs of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control option for new and existing sources is expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be the same. The Agency solicits comments on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  ``Models'' of shipyards were developed to help determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the need to differentiate among classes of shipyards in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identifying the MACT.'' Models were developed for classes of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> yards based on market segment (yards that construct ships  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> versus those that only repair) and size (large versus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medium). The EPA concluded there is no basis for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differentiating among classes of major source shipyards, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically solicits comments on whether this category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be subcategorized; and if so, how.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Handling, Transfer, and Storage of VOHAP Containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on information received from industry, a variety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ``work practice'' measures are used to reduce evaporative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> losses of VOC from transfer, handling, and storage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solvent and paint wastes. These include spill minimization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> techniques (use of spouts, funnels, or catch basins during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer of liquids from one container to another), the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of normally closed containers or piping to transport  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liquids, and the use of close-fitting or tight covers on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers for solvent, wet rags, and waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Many more than five facilities employ some type of work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice measures. Facilities in California are subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations to minimize evaporative emissions; other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities employ such measures to decrease solvent usage or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to minimize exposure of workers. However, data to quantify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurately the emission reductions achievable by different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> work practice measures is unavailable. The beneficial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect of a specific change is largely a function of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previous plant practice being remedied. As a result, even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> though such activities obviously reduce emissions, there is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no way to distinguish between the ``best controlled source''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the ``best performing five existing sources.'' Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EPA has designated the same select work practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures as the MACT floor for control of emissions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling and transfer of VOHAP containing material at both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new and existing facilities. For emissions from storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers, the MACT floor is use of tight-fitting covers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that must be normally closed; that is, in place except when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials are being added to or withdrawn. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that this is a reasonable approach. Because work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice measures typically entail negligible cost, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission reduction that is achieved is believed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> worthwhile. The EPA specifically solicits comments on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>CSO     [Excerpts] This settlement of some 400 families stands out  from the rest of the villages in Tambon Phon or other tambons in  Phon Sawan District--thanks to the wealth brought to the village  by ganja (marijuana) cultivation.    Marijuana plants used to grow here in every household. They  were the only cash crop which brought wealth and prosperity to  the village.    And although marijuana cultivation was virtually abandoned  some 10 years ago due to increased suppression, the legacy left  behind by the lucrative narcotics trade can still be seen.    Television antennas pop up from the rooftop of most houses.  Electrical appliances that offer the comfort and convenience of  urban life such as refrigerators, television sets, record  players, video recorders and portable radio cassette players can  be seen in almost every household.    The modern wooden houses of Ban Taai are in direct contrast  to the dilapidated shacks which typify poverty-stricken villages  in the Northeast where farners try to scratch out a humble  living by growing legal agricultural products in drought-plagued  fields.    But nothing speaks so eloquently of the easy money to be  made  from ganja than the villagers themselves.    "Previously there were more than 100 pick-up trucks in our  village. But now less than 20 are left," said Prasob  Tarranavadee, assistant headman of Ban Taai.    Obviously, most of the cars were sold by their owners to  supplement their meagre earnings after their source of income  from marijuana cultivation dried up. Others might have had  their trucks reclaimed by the dealers because they could not  afford the instalment payments.    It was said that during their heyday each family could earn  more than 100,000 baht from buyers for each annual marijuana  crop. Almost every young man and woman helped in the  cultivation and harvesting of marijuana plantations.    But today, 10 years after the government suppression drive,  Ban Taai is a village of old people and children. Most young  men and women left the village "to chase the rainbow." The  women mostly work in factories while the men work at  construction sites in Bangkok or in foreign countries.    A handful of men who chose to stay behind continue to till  the land and eke out out a living by planting rice, chili and  other cash crops. Others, however, offer their expertise in  marijuana cultivation to financiers in other areas if the money  is right.    "I used to accept an offer of 3,000 baht a month pay  excluding free lodging and food allowance from a financier to  plant marijuana in Pha Nok Khao in Tambon Phu Kradueng of Loei  Province," one of the "self acclaimed experts" told the Bangkok  Post.    He said marijuana plantations should be cultivated for just  3-4 months before being harvested. The most enduring task is at  the beginning when marijuana plants must be cared for and manure  must be used to nurture the plants, he said.    He said his job was accomplished after the harvest, when  someone else would take care of marijuana transportation, he  continued.    The man disclosed that the normal hiring price for an  "expert" now was about 6,000 baht, which does not include free  lodging and food allowances. Sometimes, he said, the experts  were hired to plant or supervise the cultivation of marijuana  crops in Laos.    Apart from the monthly salary, some financiers also offered  a  small percentage from the sale of the marijuana crop to the  experts, said the man. Sometimes, an advance payment which is  called a "land opening fee" was made to the experts, he added.    "One of my friends accepted a contract to supervise  marijuana  cultivation in Kammuan of Laos. He claimed that sometimes a  helicopter with a few farangs would drop by to pick up the  marijuana two or three times a year," said the expert, who spoke  on condition of anonymity. [passage omitted]    The expert admitted that planting marijuana in Laos involved  a higher risk because of the uncertainty of law enforcement in  Laos. In most cases, he said, the cultivation was done in a  form of joint venture with Thai investors putting in 40 per cent  investment and their Laotian counterpart 60 per cent.    He also said that the experts risked being murdered if the  marijuana consortium was betrayed to the authorities.    Apart from Thais, several H'mong tribesmen have been hired  to  plant marijuana in Laos. Fibre from the plants can also be used  for weaving.    Inhabitants of Ban Taai who used to earn 1,500 baht per  kilogramme of dry marijuana are now making only 12 baht per  kilogramme from the sale of chili, said Mr Prasob, the assistant  headman.    "We can plant other crops. But there is the problem of  marketing," he admitted.    Without marijuana, their golden crop, the village is quiet  and lifeless. A scarecrow is put up in front of every house  purportedly to save the surviving members from the "ghosts of  widows."    "Several old and young men succumbed to these ghosts in  recent months. So we had to build scarecrows to guard every  household," said the assistant headman.    An informed source said that despite the fierce suppression  campaign, marijuana is still secretly planted among other cash  crops in Phon Sawan, Tha Uthen, Ban Paeng and LSri Songkhram  districts. Mixing crops makes detection of marijuana crops  difficult from the air.    The planting season normally begins in May when rain begins  to fall, he said.    The source further said because of the pressure applied by  narcotics suppression officials, marijuana fields are now mostly  in Laos along the Mekong River because the plants consume more  water at the initial stage.    Only a small amount is smuggled into Thailand to be exported  to third countries, said the source, adding that the bulk of the  drugs are transported to Danang in Vietnam befor being smuggled  abroad.    A police officer interviewed by th Post admitted that some  officers allowed large-scale marijuana cultivation to take place  in Nakhon Phanom.    Most of the eligible voters in Ban Taai voted for Por Ped or  Thanong Siripreechapong, former Chat Thai MP, in previous  elections.    "We used to help one another. We used to get rich together,"  said several villagers.    A sign hung in front of Thanong's office in Tha Uthen  District carries the message "Por Ped is happy to serve you."  But the volume of visitors to his office seeking to get "rich  together" has dropped significantly since he was implicated in  narcotics trafficking.</p>

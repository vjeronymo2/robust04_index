			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alois Mock by an </F> unidentified KURIER reporter "on the flight to Washington":  "Mock: `I See Light at the End of the Tunnel'"]    [Text] [KURIER] Does today's signing of the agreement  [between Bosnian Muslims and Croats] give you personal  satisfaction?    [Mock] Absolutely. The agreement is a very positive  beginning. It ensures the credibility of international  involvement. And if it is now possible to expand the security  zones -- which has always been our main concern -- the killing  of the civilian population in Bosnia will stop. However, one  cannot yet speak of an overall solution. Just the question of  cantons in the Muslim- Croatian federation alone is a sensitive  issue -- not to speak of a global solution for Yugoslavia's  successor states. However, at least it's a start.    [KURIER] Is this primarily at the instigation of the United  States?    [Mock] The United States is so deeply involved that it will  no longer be as easy as it was in the past for the warring  parties to turn away. The United States has accepted a clear  responsibility. And if cooperation with the European Union  troika and with France, which is particularly active in Bosnia,  is now intensified, I finally see light at the end of a long  tunnel.    [KURIER] Will the Serbs make compromises?    [Mock] If they reject the Muslim-Croat union, this is their  business. But one must ask them.    [KURIER] Do you see the involvement of Russia and the United  States as a staking out of their spheres of influence in the  Balkans?    [Mock] If the former parade themselves as the protectors of  one side and the latter as protectors of the other side, I do  not think much of that. This would be like the antiquated  great-power policy of the 19th century. But in the case of  Sarajevo the Russians have been very constructive.    [KURIER] Do you think that economic cooperation of the  warring parties in ex-Yugoslavia will be possible at some time  in the future?    [Mock] The trend toward integration will gain ground in  Central Europe and also in the Balkans. But that will take a  long time.</p>

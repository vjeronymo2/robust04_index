			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / International Company News: Volvo head says failed merger hit development Volvo's vehicle development programme was set back by more than six months when its plan to merge with France's Renault failed, according to Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, chairman of the Swedish vehicle manufacturer. But he signalled that the restructured company, now concentrating on its core car and truck making operations, planned to look for acquisitions and partnerships. 'We have certainly lost more than a half-year in the development of Volvo's new model programme through the broken merger with Renault. Now we must raise the tempo,' Mr Svanholm told the Swedish business newspaper Dagens Industri. Under Mr Svanholm, who succeeded Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar after Volvo's withdrawal from the proposed merger last December, Volvo has started selling off its portfolio of non-motor industry interests. By the end of 1996, Volvo could raise up to Dollars 5bn, strengthening its equity-to-assets ratio to 50 per cent and giving it the financial muscle to develop new models - and look for acquisition opportunities. 'Acquisition of companies can become a reality for all the companies within Volvo's core operations,' Mr Svanholm said. In a veiled criticism of the Gyllenhammar strategy, Mr Svanholm said the SKr16bn (Dollars 2.1bn) Volvo spent on developing its 850-series car was an 'immense' sum. 'That can hardly be repeated,' he said. The huge cost of developing new models was one of the reasons cited in the pursuit of the merger with Renault. Mr Svanholm said new partnerships and co-operation alliances were under discussion 'the whole time'. But he said these must be developed by individual divisions of the company, not the board. 'The more I learn about alliances and mergers, the more I understand that they must grow from below,' he added.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / 'Old friends' contributed to election fund, says Hayashi WHEN Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, Japan's finance minister, yesterday explained that his 'old friends', the country's leading banks, had generously contributed to his election fighting fund, voters were again reminded that, morally and financially, Japanese politics is an expensive business. Not long after, Mr Kishiro Nakamura, the construction minister, glumly confessed that he had requested funds from his 'friends', the construction industry, even though he has spent much of the week chastising four contractors for allegedly bribing a regional mayor. A Japanese television station rolled out a representative from an 'ethical political donations' citizens' group who thought it unseemly that ministers took money from the ministered, but the two politicians say they did no wrong. Mr Hayashi poetically explained that banks had given him money 'for many winters and summers'. 'I don't think they are making donations because I am the finance minister. They give money because I am a politician and they support my party,' he said. Having been forced to call a snap election for July 18, the ruling Liberal Democratic party has scrambled to raise funds from its traditional corporate donors, some of whom are concerned that there could be guilt by association with the scandal-prone party. The campaign is being fought by most parties on the issue of 'political reform' and ending the era of 'money politics', but running a campaign against 'money politics' is expensive, and not only the LDP has had to answer awkward questions over funding sources. Shinseito, the Japan Renewal party, has spent much of the week denying that its reformist leader, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the man who led the rebellion that brought down the government, went with collection plate in hand to meet the head of a Buddhist movement, Soka Gakkai. The wealthy Soka Gakkai bankrolls its own political party, Komeito, appropriately, the Clean Government party, but is also close to Mr Hata. A JRP official said the party's candidates are raising funds 'by putting up their homes as collateral', and tapping small and medium-sized companies: 'I don't know where every yen is coming from, but none of it is illegal.' As for Mr Hayashi, his office insisted that none of his support groups had accepted more than the Y1.5m limit, and the grand total received from banks is less than Y100m. Politicians get around the Y1.5m limit by setting up dozens of support groups. Some companies reluctant to make direct donations are buying advertisements in Liberal Democratic party journals, where the rates are calculated not by the centimetre, but by the depth of devotion to the party. Japan may scrap its controversial system of 'designated bidding' for public works projects, blamed for encouraging political corruption and condemned by the US for restricting market access.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Venancio de Moura today briefed  the diplomatic corps accredited in Angola on the situation in  the country. At the meeting, which took place behind closed  doors, the Angolan foreign minister briefed the diplomatic corps  on the development of the political and military situation in  Angola and the peace talks in Lusaka. Venancio de Moura also  examined the recent resolution of the UN Security Council on  Angola. The minister said that following the approval of  Resolution 992/94, it is hoped that UNITA will reconsider its  stand and end the war once and for all.    [Begin Moura recording] It was not easy to make the UN  Security Council adopt a satisfactory resolution on Angola under  the present circumstances. Some circles even tried to hide the  information on the best and final offer the Angolan Government  made to UNITA, as its contribution to the search for and speedy  conclusion of a general cease-fire and peace agreement in  Angola.

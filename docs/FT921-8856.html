			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: IBM plans computers based on MPP technology INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) is developing powerful supercomputers based upon massively parallel processing (MPP) technology. The company said yesterday it had established a new laboratory dedicated to bringing the new technology to market. Cray Research, the leading supercomputer manufacturer, also revealed this week it was developing MPP computers, based upon a powerful new microprocessor chip designed by Digital Equipment. Unlike traditional supercomputers, which are based on one or a few custom-designed powerful processors, MPP computers share complex computing tasks among hundreds or even thousands of the same microprocessor chips used in computer workstations. Until recently, this approach to achieving very high speed computing was largely experimental. Worldwide sales of MPP supercomputers were only about Dollars 100m last year, less than one-tenth of the total supercomputers market, according to industry estimates. However, massively parallel machines are widely expected to eventually achieve speeds of almost 1,000bn calculations per second, outpacing traditional 'vector' supercomputers. The endorsement of IBM and Cray Research will bring MPP into the mainstream of computing. Some industry analysts predict MPP sales could reach 50 per cent of the total supercomputer market by the late 1990s. IBM will base its MMP systems on the reduced instruction set computing (Risc) microprocessors it uses in desktop workstations.</p>

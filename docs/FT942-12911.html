			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Company News: Mt Leyshon rises to ADollars 23.4m Mount Leyshon Gold Mines, part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, yesterday announced an after-tax profit of ADollars 23.4m (USDollars 16.7m) for the nine months to end-March, compared with ADollars 15.2m a year ago. Mt Leyshon said production rose by 4 per cent, to 168,988 ounces, while gold sales revenue reached ADollars 103.1m, a 13 per cent improvement. This was attributed to the increase in production and the achieved gold price of ADollars 612 per ounce - which compared with an average spot price of ADollars 555. Mine operating costs were ADollars 346 per ounce for the third quarter, a 2 per cent reduction over the previous quarter. Mt Leyshon said this figure should fall as benefits of lower mining and crushing costs emerged from the current plant expansion. Poseidon Gold, the gold arm of the Normandy Poseidon, has a 75.6 per cent interest in Mt Leyshon. Meanwhile, Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie, part of the Normandy Poseidon group, reported after-tax operating profits of ADollars 20.3m for the same period, up 2.6 per cent on the previous corresponding period. This included a ADollars 4.2m abnormal unrealised foreign exchange gain, relating to the translation of long-term US dollar convertible bonds.</p>

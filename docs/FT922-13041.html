			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The City Bombing: Experts warn cities to prepare for further attacks TERRORISM experts yesterday warned London and other cities to brace themselves for further IRA attacks, but said it was impossible to predict the precise tactics the terrorists might use. The explosions in the City and at Staples Corner in north London on Friday were the first IRA car bombs on the mainland since the Harrods bombing in 1983. Some experts had suggested that this attack could mark a return to the use of imprecisely aimed large bombs rather than the smaller devices and firebombs used on the transport system and in shops. But Mr Ian Geldard, editor of Conflict International, a journal which monitors international terrorism, said: 'I do think we are going to see more actions, but it is impossible to predict what tactics they may use and where.' The City, with its narrow streets, tall buildings - which tend to magnify the effect of explosions - and large areas of unsecured glass, has been shown to be a particularly vulnerable target. Mr Geldard, however, said this did not necessarily mean it would suffer repeat attacks. 'The IRA is constantly changing its strategy and tactics. They have moved from targeting military bases to letter bombs, mortar bombs, and smaller devices aimed at transport, and now they've reverted to car bombs. They try to keep everyone guessing.' Experts believe the primary aim of Friday's bomb was to cause widespread damage and disruption, and that the large number of civilian casualties may have been the result of a miscalculation by the IRA, which was not expecting so many people still to be in the City in the evening. 'If they had really wanted to to cause massive civilian casualties they could have timed the bomb to go off at lunchtime,' said one specialist. The timing of the Staples Corner explosion lent weight to the theory that causing damage rather than casualties was the main objective. In the short term, Mr Owen Kelly, commissioner of the City of London police, said yesterday that he would increase the number of officers on hecks of vehicles and people. In the longer term, experts conceded little could be done to make a large area safe against car or parcel-type bombs without intruding into privacy. Moreover, if such intrusion became commonplace, the terrorists could be said to have succeeded in their aim of causing disruption. Mr David Fletcher, chief executive of the British Security Industry Association, suggested that City companies could set up a network of video cameras constantly recording movements in surrounding streets. Many banks and building societies already monitor their premises with closed-circuit television and other companies might be persuaded to follow suit to produce near City-wide cover. Mr Fletcher said the threat of being caught was one of the few effective deterrents to terrorists. 'If someone sees a camera and knows he might be recorded doing what he is doing, then he might decide not to do it.' Friday's bombing also highlighted how badly prepared the City was for such an attack.</p>

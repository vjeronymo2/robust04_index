The  objective is to join forces against drug trafficking along the  Amazon border region and get Brazil off the UN list of countries  used as transit routes by drug cocaine.    Brazilian Federal Police Superintendent Mauro Sposito has  said the strategy of Operation Blockade was discussed with  Venezuelan, Peruvian, Colombian, and Bolivian military leaders  during the Sixth Military Exchange meeting last week. So far  only Brazil and Venezuela have formally agreed to participate.  These two countries are at the start of the cocaine route that  begins in Colombia and ends in the United State and Europe. The  Colombian Army could lend its support to this project. Sposito  said this will be essential if the operation is to be successful.    Operation Blockade will be conducted on four fronts. First,  Tabatinga and Manaus river police patrols will intercept the  cocaine that is shipped by the Amazon River. Second,  enforcement actions in Colombia will be monitored. Third,  flights of aircraft will be placed under surveillance: With the  help of the Air Force, the Brazilian Petroleum Corporation,  ESSO, and Shell, the Federal Police will control the air space  thus repressing traffickers who move cocaine by air.    The fourth front has been in action since November: Radio  frequencies used by drug traffickers are being monitored from  Tabatinga and Tefe. This led to the arrest of two drug bosses  in Belem.</p>

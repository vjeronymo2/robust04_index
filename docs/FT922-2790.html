			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / A game of missed opportunities: Though the Rio Earth Summit fell short of its goals, it served a useful purpose If for no other reason, the Earth Summit will go down in history as an astonishing political event. At tea-time on Saturday afternoon, no fewer than 103 world leaders sat down at a huge round table in the Riocentro and solemnly vowed to work for a better world environment. It was, in the words of one official involved in the two-year preparations for that single moment, 'inspirational'. Mr Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister of Pakistan speaking on behalf of the developing countries, said simply: 'After this summit the world will never be the same again.' Mr Erskine Sandiford, the prime minister of Barbados was so moved that he penned an ode to the environment. But to the rest of the world, subjected for 12 days to the massive coverage provided by the 9,000-strong press corps, the results must have seemed far more confusing. What had this grandly-titled conference really been about, with its curious vocabulary of bio-diversity and sustainable development? How would it affect their lives? Did it even matter? In one sense, the Earth Summit was a dismal failure. Billed as the event that would finally place the environment at the top of the global agenda, its readily identifiable achievements were disappointingly few. All its decisions fell well short of the original goals. They also look haphazard: there are measures to protect forests, the climate and plant and animal life, but none on water or waste, or even population control which was widely hailed as the best form of environmental protection. The summit also spent an enormous amount of time arguing about aid to the Third World, a subject which, to inhabitants of the industrial world at least, might seem far removed from everyday environmental concerns. But in another sense, the Earth Summit was a monumental success. It was the first convocation of world leaders since the end of the Cold war, and as such demonstrated the strong pulling power of the environment as a political issue. The gruelling negotiations, which lasted until dawn on several nights, may have wearied the participants, but they stirred rigorous debate on whole areas of policy which had never been examined before. And the sheer weight of publicity - even of the White House's hapless handling of the event - created a momentum for environmentalists to harness. But if the summit achieved so little in hard terms, it was because it showed just how divisive even the most worthy of environmental goals can be, and the extent to which they touch upon vital national interests. This was disheartening for those who hoped for concrete results. But in another sense it was also very educative. One of the liveliest topics, for example, was the preservation of tropical forests. Yet the conference failed to agree on an international conservation treaty, ending instead with a much watered down 'declaration of principles' which was immediately denounced by Friends of the Earth, the environmental lobby group, as a 'chainsaw charter'. The real issue had nothing to do with trees but with whether the world had a right to tell a country how to manage its natural resources. The fact that it was mainly the rich countries which were trying to get the poor countries to give up their logging livelihoods only made it worse. Another knotty question arose with a bio-diversity treaty. This was originally proposed as a measure to preserve plant and animal life. But the real issue quickly became the exact opposite: how living organisms could be commercially exploited, and who should have the patent rights. The treaty that was finally agreed was more about commerce than conservation, which is one reason why the US refused to sign it even though it originally mooted the idea. As Mr William Reilly, the administrator of the US Environment Protection Agency, said: 'We would have hoped that the conference would have confined itself to protecting flora and fauna.' The other specific agreement - on climate change - threw up a further set of difficulties. The purpose of this treaty was to curb emissions of greenhouse gases which threaten to alter the planet's climate. Instead it turned into a tussle over how big a sacrifice individual countries should make to support a global cause, in this case by accepting tough emission controls even at the cost of economic growth. For President George Bush, there was a clear limit, and he insisted on weaker emission targets before he would sign. Underlying all these issues lay an even greater question: how far the world's environmental problems could be traced to the gap between the rich north and the poor south. The summit's official title was the UN Conference on the Environment and Development, a title that was supposed to stress the closeness of the two themes. For the Third World, there was no question about this link. Mr Anwar Saifullah, Pakistan's environment minister, said: 'Eighty per cent of our water is untreated. That's our biggest problem. When I have to worry about such basic provisions of life, it's a luxury to talk of environment.' Much of the world's degradation - over-exploitation of land, polluted water and deforestation - can be traced to poverty, and the voracious demands of the industrial countries, now and in colonial times. The Group of 77 developing countries came to Rio determined to secure a strong increase in aid as the price of their support for the conference. But though their case was strongly argued, and supported by the World Bank among others, the Third World did not win the day. The rich countries acknowledged that they placed the heaviest strains on world resources and bore a special responsibility to repair the damage. They also agreed in principle to provide 'new and additional financial means' to boost environmental aid for the Third World. But when it came to putting actual money on the table, they were tight-fisted, citing recession and other budgetary pressures. The financial pledges made in Rio were so vague that it is hard to size them up. But they appear to amount to Dollars 2.5bn a year. This is well below the Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn that had been predicted, and mere chicken feed beside the Dollars 70bn which the UN said was needed. To the bitter end, many rich countries resisted pressure to commit themselves to raising their aid to the UN target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by the turn of the century. But if the summit must be judged a failure for those who sought to link poverty to the environment, it achieved a success of a different sort. All the rich industrial countries committed themselves to giving more aid specifically for environmental projects, such as sewage treatment, waste management and cleaner air. Strong support was also given to the Global Environment Facility, a fund administered by the World Bank and the UN specifically to help poor countries carry out work which is of value to the planet as a whole. Environment has thus moved higher up the aid agenda. The summit also witnessed a shift of a different sort, in the relative roles of the US and Japan. Washington's aversion to environmental over-regulation, to the moral obligations included in the summit's legally binding treaties, and to the attacks that were made on the US appetite for energy and resources made Mr Bush a reluctant and prickly participant. 'Environment protection has replaced communism as the great threat to capitalism,' said one member of the faction-riven US delegation. By contrast, Japan approached Rio with a carefully planned diplomatic offensive backed by the largest offer of new environmental aid made at the summit - some Dollars 500m a year. Whatever Tokyo's motives - and sceptics were quick to hint that these were driven above all by self-interest - Japan added measurably to its international status in Rio. 'They're the owners of all the new issues - and they're getting it so cheap,' said a senior Brazilian official with mixed admiration and regret. The real question now that Rio is over is whether it will make any difference. The answer is virtually none in the short term. The measures that were agreed, and the financial commitments that were made, were so modest that the critics can convincingly argue that it was a waste of time. A more profound reason for questioning the summit's value is that it was supposed to put the world economy on a path to sustainable development - that is, by growing in a way that does not impoverish future generations. But though the summit gave ringing endorsements of this concept, it produced no binding agreements to force governments to promote it. Green lobby groups were pressing hard for measures to encourage trade in goods that are produced on a sustainable basis, or to build true environmental costs into the manufacturing process. But these were all dismissed as unrealistic in the harsh reality of the economic world. Mr Charles de Haes, director general of World Wide Fund for Nature, the green organisation which helped develop the notion of sustainable development, described the summit results as minimal. He said: 'It's all generalities. We need to know specifically what is going to be done and by when.' Yet it is hard to escape the impression that Rio did set some very large, if slow-moving, wheels in motion. Two legally binding treaties will now be implemented, and more may follow. A commission on sustainable development will be created to monitor implementation of the summit's decisions, and put pressure on countries to live up to its spirit. And even if Rio did not provide the answers, it pressed people's noses very hard against the questions. One hundred and seventy eight governments put themselves on the environmental hook, and it will be up to their constituents to keep them there. President Francois Mitterrand of France, whose stance was among the most prominent of the industrialised countries, proposed another 'rendezvous' in three to five years to review progress. 'We know we still have an enormous way to go in narrowing our points of view so as to produce common solutions,' he said. 'But our meeting will not have been in vain if it teaches the people of the south that ecology is not a rich man's luxury, and those of the north that there is no true environmental protection without help with development.' WHAT WAS AGREED AT RIO ..... Treaty on climate change to curb emissions of greenhouse gases Statement of principles on forests: non-binding agreement to conserve forests Bio-diversity treaty to preserve flora and fauna.  US refused to sign because it weakens bio-technology patent rights Agenda 21: action plan covering all aspects of environment. Non-binding, but a yardstick against which to measure government actions   ...AND WHAT WAS NOT Treaty on forests: dropped because of Third World opposition.  Its failure was summit's biggest setback. Earth Charter: its simple precepts were not up to the complexities created by summit debate</p>

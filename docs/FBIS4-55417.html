			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The free territory of Zvornik has been under  fierce attack by the aggressor, but our soldiers are scoring new  successes.    [Reporter] After the aggressor's unsuccessful attempts to  break through our defense lines in the Majevica part of the  front, soldiers of the 206th Gallant Brigade, aided by soldiers  from Teocak, have captured important hills of Domanica Kosa,  Ikovi and Suha Cesma, and are in the immediate vicinity of the  TV relay station. [passage omitted]    Brave soldiers of the 206th Gallant brigade successfully  repulsed all attacks and inflicted high losses in human lives on  the chetniks. The remaining chetniks withdrew in panic, leaving  scores of their dead behind. Unable to shift the defense lines  to their advantage, the chetniks vented their frustration by  firing from all available weapons on the free territory,  destroying whole buildings in Vitinica, (Cakula), Medjedja,  (Kobilici), Kraljevici, (Nezuk), and Zaseok. Some 1,000 highly  destructive shells fell on these locations, causing vast  material damage. Some civilians were killed and wounded.  Despite all this, our defense lines are firm and stable. This  was a report from Zvornik by the information service of the  206th Gallant Brigade.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> A collection of 44 paintings belonging to the estate of the son of the founder  of Campbell's Soup has sold for a record $116 million at Sotheby's auction  house in New York. Erratic bidding Wednesday night saw record highs and  unexpected lows, but ended with the largest total ever paid for a private  collection. The works, including Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and modern  paintings by Monet, Picasso, Van Gogh, Renoir and Degas among others, belonged  to John T. Dorrance, whose father founded Campbell's. Dorrance died in April.  An unexpected record for Henri Matisse's "Woman With Red Umbrella" came when it  sold to an anonymous bidder via telephone for $12.3 million. However, Van  Gogh's "Man at Sea," which portrays a woman clutching her child awaiting her  husband's return from the sea, sold for $7.15 million -- less than the $8  million to $12 million presale estimate -- to Kiyotaka Kori, a Tokyo dealer  representing Aska International, a Japanese concern. The record for a single  collection sale had been $85 million, set last November at Christie's auction  house for the William Goetz collection. Sotheby's had a low estimate of $93.5  million and a high figure of $129 million for the Dorrance collection.  Sotheby's reported that 15 of the 44 lots went to Japanese bidders.

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Call for EC clearance of UK review A former Conservative minister yesterday called on the government to seek clearance from Brussels to conduct a UK review of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's proposed takeover of Midland. In an amendment to an early day motion, Mr Peter Viggers, a former junior Northern Ireland minister, said that the Hongkong offer and the proposed bid from Lloyds Bank 'should both be examined under the same jurisdiction.' He urged Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, to 'request the European Commission for the examination of the HSBC bid under the British mergers regulations.' Mr Heseltine could theoretically ask for a separate UK review on the grounds either that the takeover was a threat to Midland's depositors or that it raised general issues of national concern. The original early day motion in support of Hongkong's bid has so far attracted the support of 17 MPs from both major parties. These include Mr Tim Devlin, Conservative MP for Stockton South, Mr Terry Dicks, Tory MP for Hayes and Harlington, and two Labour MPs representing Sheffield seats. Midland is the largest private-sector employer in the Sheffield area with some 2,500 employees. See Lex</p>

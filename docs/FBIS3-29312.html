			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "To Establish a Mature Relationship Between </F> Japan and the United States"]    [Text] The recent summit talks between Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton made us feel  that the two nations have entered the stage of new relationship  under the leadership of a new generation.    In past summit talks, Japan was obliged to accept  unreasonable demands in the name of the Japan-U.S. alliance, and  this caused an anti-American feeling among the Japanese. Also,  the two nations tended to reach vague agreements to patch up  things for the moment, thus leaving the seeds of conflict for  the future.    Nonetheless, Prime Minister Hosokawa and President Clinton  clearly said "No" to each other on economic issues. We believe  their approach is much better than that taken in the past when  the ultimate objective was to achieve successful agreements.    However, if this result is to become what Hosokawa called a  "mature and adult relationship," at least two conditions should  be met.  <H5>  Prevent the Expansion of Confrontation </H5>   One condition is to limit confrontation between the  Governments of Japan and the United States to bilateral trade.  It is important not to spread the conflict to the entire  bilateral relationship. Regarding this, President Clinton said  at a news conference: "The two sides will maintain good  relations in the area of politics and security." We give high  marks to his remark.    What worries us are moves in the U.S. Congress. We sincerely  hope that Congress will not present demands for Japan's greater  cooperation in security as a means to push forward trade  negotiations, and not pass discriminatory legislation against  Japan. We call on Congress to act with calm.    The other condition is for Japan to take aggressive action  toward opening its markets and reducing its trade surplus. We  support the goverment's decision to reject U.S. demands for  introducing numerical targets. The refusal, however, does not  mean that urgent issues have all been resolved.    Now that the government has rejected the path toward managed  trade, it should make efforts to increase domestic demand, to  drastically reduce government regulations and administrative  guidance, and to establish a transparent and fair market.  Further appreciation of the yen against the dollar would be an  unavoidable development for the time being.    Under the economic framework talks agreed to last July, the  recent summit meeting was a sort of mid-course examination. The  two nations plan first to produce results in the three priority  areas, and then reach a final agreement on the other issues  before the next summit scheduled for July.    Five months is not very long. The Japanese Government should  immediately set to work on devising counterproposals that will  convince the United States.    We call on the United States to take a flexible stance on  numerical targets. "The setting of numerical targets will push  Japan back to the past method of adjusting imports through  government manipualtion." Such arguments have appeared in  leading newspapers in the United States and Europe. Economists  in Japan and the United States are also opposed to numerical  targets. Washington should listen to what they have said.  <H5>  The United States Acts Too Rashly </H5>   President Clinton expressed a sense of distrust in Japan by  saying that despite more than 30 agreements reached on opening  up the Japanese market, there had been absolutely no change.  His understanding is not completely correct. Certainly,  Japan's trade surplus has not been reduced remarkably. But  bilateral agreements have produced results in the government  procurement of satellites and supercomputers as well as the  expansion of imports of beef and citrus.    It was predicted from the beginning that framework trade  talks would be rough. Some people said that the end of the Cold  War would allow the two nations to discuss economic issues  straightforwardly, and others said President Clinton, who seeks  reelection, would call for quick results. Others also pointed  to the differences in the trade policies of the two nations.    Another factor that cannot be overlooked is the return of  Japanese industry to a "Japan as Number Two" position.  Semiconductor accords used as a model by the United States in  recent trade talks and the plans by the Japanese auto industry  to buy more U.S.-made auto parts were drawn up during a time  when Japanese industry was increasing in prosperity. Faced with  the difficult position of being sandwiched between the  resurrection of U.S. industry and the rise of Asia, Japanese  industry can no longer afford to accept difficult requests from  the United States.    Because of the appreciation of the yen since last year,  Japanese industry has moved production bases overseas, and  imports from Asia and other countries have rapidly increased.  As a result, the trade surplus has begun to decrease slowly.  Some people have made hasty predictions that if this trend  continues, the fierce trade friction between Japan and the  United States will disappear.    It is unavoidable that economic relations between Japan and  the United States will continue to be strained for the time  being. It is also possible that bills will be submitted to U.S.  Congress urging hard-line action against Japan, and that the  U.S. Government will threaten to impose sanctions.    However, if the world's two economic superpowers should turn  inward and mutually implement protectionist measures, the  negative effect on the world economy will be great. We hope the  two nations will tide over the current difficulties with calm  while not losing a long-term perspective.</p>

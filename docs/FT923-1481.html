			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Accountant admits BCCI paper leak AN ACCOUNTANT working on the Serious Fraud Office's investigation into the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International leaked a highly confidential document to make money by insider dealing, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. Mr Mark Braley, who had been seconded from Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte for the BCCI probe, admitted supplying a paper relating to Control Securities, a company central to the SFO's investigation, to his co-defendant Mr Bernard Lynch, a freelance accountant. Mr Braley agreed this had been 'thoroughly wrong', but denied that he had ever intended to undermine the SFO's investigation by leaking the document. He and Mr Lynch both deny conspiring to pervert the course of justice by interfering with SFO files and passing on information relating to the inquiry. The paper, which outlined the SFO's lines of inquiry into the company, was the most sensitive material available to him and he was prepared to leak it for financial gain, Mr Braley told his counsel, Mr Vivien Robinson QC. However, he was unaware Mr Lynch would make the paper available to The Times. When, after the leak, Mr Braley took part in the raid on the offices of Control Securities, he felt 'absolutely sick' he said. He had not intended to pre-judice the SFO investigation, he told Mr Robinson. The trial continues today.</p>

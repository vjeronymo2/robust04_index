			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Arts: Takemitsu and Maxwell Davies - Promenade concerts The title, From me flows what you call Time, was the most cumbersome thing about the Toru Takemitsu work performed at the Albert Hall (British premiere) on Saturday. In other respects, any more picturesque offering from this year's BBC Proms schedule is hardly imaginable. Written for the Canadian five-man percussion ensemble Nexus to play with the Boston Symphony Orchestra during the 1990 celebrations of the New York Carnegie Hall's centenary, the piece developed its musical rationale (and title) out of the Japanese composer's vision of '100 years of time flowing through the man-made space, so full of special meaning, called Carnegie Hall'. The result is an 'architectural' composition - designed (as were, say, Berlioz's Grande Messe des morts or Messiaen's Couleurs de la cite celeste) to fill out a large space in a manner combining spectacle, ritual, and a vibrant awakening of the space in question. The Albert Hall is always an ideal space for such awakenings; and certainly, it afforded ample room for Takemitsu's 30-minute rainbow of sonorous effects. The five Nexus players, each one an extraordinary virtuoso, entered one by one with bells in hand to join the already-playing orchestra (BBC Symphony under Andrew Davis); their five widely-separated banks of exotic percussion instruments formed part of the visual fascination (the front two each connected by long coloured streamers to a set of wind-chimes hanging 'stereophonically' from left- and right-hand balconies). In a sense, the music is no more than a five-person percussion concerto, simply shaped in its connected movements, with diverse exquisite combinations of soloists (some improvised upon a basis of 'free' notation) set against a light, airy orchestral background (surprisingly sweet-toothed and succulent at times). In another and perhaps more important sense, it seems to be a tapestry of responses to the natural world, evoked in contemplative mood and designed with masterly and entirely unobvious skill to achieve the same in its listeners. In a clever feat of Proms planning, Saturday's programme (which also included Mozart and Tippett) balanced the Takemitsu with another musical act of nature contemplation, albeit of a very different - western late-Romantic  -kind. Janice Watson, a young lyric soprano of boundless potential, sang the closing scene from Strauss's opera Daphne in tones remarkably unforced and steady, not sumptuous but always cleanly floated. Her final wordless arabesques - Strauss's lambent evocation of a woman turned into a laurel tree - were pure delight.                          *      *      * The Prom on Friday brought the return of a major British work from the 1980s. The Second Symphony of Peter Maxwell Davies was heard at the Proms shortly after its Boston premiere in 1981 and memories of it as a large-scale symphony that was easy to approach were largely borne out. Not that one would have thought so from the audience response. At the end of the first movement a large number of people (more than 100) left their seats and headed for the exit door; after each of the second and third movements the ritual was repeated, as a mass departure gathered momentum. Davies was conducting the performance and from the podium he watched the audience disperse with a wry smile and no small measure of patience. The irony is that the Davies we hear in this symphony (unlike the younger composer with his fondness for parody and violence) is consciously trying to beguile the senses. References to Debussy's La Mer in the programme were well chosen. The wavelets of wind scales trickling away at the end of the first movement, the glitter of percussion, the aqueous clarity of the orchestral textures - everything has an impressionist feel to it. According to the composer's own description, the symphony was inspired by the sounds and behaviour of the sea. Various wave-types are detailed as being especially formative, although I doubt that a listener could pick out much of that without being told in advance. What one hears is rather less than a symphony, more the ebb and flow of imaginative washes of sound. There is little strong thematic material in the foreground, but the general ambience is very expressive. It seems best to take it on trust that the BBC Philharmonic's performance went according to the composer's wishes. The attractive features of the symphony, not to mention its scale, suggest that this is a Davies work that should still be in circulation a further decade hence, by which time one hopes the audience will be prepared to hear it through.</p>

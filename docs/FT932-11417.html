			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (6): Network short of space - Andrew Hill looks at transport's relation to trade BELGIANS are oddly proud of their motorway network. At night, it is said to be the only feature of Belgium visible from outer space. Alas, space is exactly what Belgium's transport network is short of, and the problem is particularly acute in Flanders. The region is home to nearly 60 per cent of the population of Belgium - not including nearly a million inhabitants of Brussels, a separate regional 'island' within Flanders - but accounts for only 44 per cent of the territory. Not surprisingly, Mr Johan Sauwens, the regional communications minister, and Mr Theo Kelchtermans, in charge of public works, have put a freeze on new road-building. For the dominant economic region in Europe's most open economy, that is a difficult decision. 'We're a transit economy,' says an adviser to Mr Sauwens, 'but that shouldn't be achieved to the detriment of the scarce remaining open space.' Instead, the stress is laid on safety - the government wants to reduce road accidents by 40 per cent by the year 2000 - and mobility. For the average commuter, that means upgrading public transport in the region's nine main urban centres to provide a viable and attractive alternative to car travel. For business, it means emphasising the region's extensive network of waterways - linking to the ports of Antwerp, Ghent, Zeebrugge and Ostend - for freight which does not need to be rushed to its destination. Mr Sauwens hopes for a 10 per cent increase in water-borne freight traffic by the end of the decade. The ports are the best symbol of Flanders' openness, and the success which it can bring. The port of Antwerp, for example, generated added value of BFr188bn in 1990, or 3.2 per cent of Belgian GNP, in spite of the growing crisis in the world shipping industry. The smaller port of Ghent, which handled some 2.8m tonnes of cargo 25 years ago, now handles 23m tonnes annually - in 1990 it generated added value for the Belgian economy of BFr82bn. The emphasis at both ports is on specialisation, but without losing versatility. Antwerp, for example, has built dedicated terminals for iron and steel trade, sugar, flour and fertilisers, fruit, liquid bulk and non-ferrous metals. Ghent has added new products to its traditional handling strengths, including cars, fruit juice, molasses and industrial glue. Meanwhile, Zeebrugge, which, like neighbouring Ostend, faces a challenge to its passenger traffic from the Channel tunnel, is constructing a new distribution park to enhance its freight reputation. However, Flemish ports - like the region itself - are vulnerable both to political and commercial convulsions. Antwerp's port managers rail against over-regulation, local or European, and all ports lament the failure to agree a world trade deal. 'World recession, high interest rates, tensions among the Europeans, tensions among the Europeans and Americans, difficult talks - not to say no talks at all - at the Uruguay Round, have had negative effects on shipping,' says Mrs Eliane Achten, chairman of the Port of Antwerp Promotion Association. If such shadows are lifted, politicians and ports alike hope that the Flemish transport infrastructure - road, rail and water - will be the vehicle for a resurgence in export-based prosperity. In the wider vision of the Flemish free-traders, all roads lead to Flanders.</p>

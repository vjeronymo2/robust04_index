			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Acas workload set to fall THE WORK of Acas, the independent conciliation service, for individual workers is expected to fall as a result of changes introduced this week under the Trade Union Reform and Employment Rights Act. Employees can now settle cases of unfair dismissal with legally binding settlements with employers as long as they are represented by qualified solicitors with insurance coverage. In the past these could not be settled without Acas intervention and the service has dealt with up to 80,000 cases a year.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> WE ALL BELIEVE IN CENSORSHIP;  </P> <P> EVEN THE PERMISSIVE AMONG US AGREE THAT STANDARDS VARY ACCORDING TO THE  CIRCUMSTANCES.  </P> <P> When Dan Rather reports on the banned-in-Cincinnati exhibit of Robert  Mapplethorpe's photographs, he does not show the homoerotic, pedophilic or  sadomasochistic pictures, the ones that brought the police and the courts, the  ACLU and Jesse Helms, the censors and libertarians into the game. Television  will show you the exquisite flower pictures and the tamer portraits. It tells  you about the nasty ones.  </P> <P> Similarly, this newspaper does not publish, say, Mapplethorpe's self-portrait  in leather with bullwhip inserted in his rectum. This quite obviously is  censorship. Why is the ACLU not protesting?  </P> <P> Because everyone, ACLU included, favors censorship in principle. No one  protests the banning of Mapplethorpe's nastier pictures from television and  newspapers because there is a general consensus that some things are not to be  shown on the mass media. But as the media become less mass -- as you go, for  example, from network to cable to videocassette -- more and more is permitted,  until we reach the point where just about anything is permitted for viewing in  the privacy of one's own bedroom.  </P> <P> This arrangement, which might be called censorship by classification, enjoys  wide support because it is a reasonable way for a pluralistic society to deal  with the question of obscenity and public standards. The question with  Mapplethorpe is how to classify his art. Should it be classified as so  outrageous and degrading as to be reserved for the most private sanctum (the  home)? Or is it serious enough to deserve placement in a public institution  such as an art gallery?  </P> <P> Note that even the museum curators who exhibit Mapplethorpe are careful to  place the most offensive pictures in special rooms under special cover. Even  they accept the principle of segregation.  </P> <P> Why? For two reasons. First, not to segregate is to risk assaulting the  unwitting. To show, say on the "CBS Evening News," a picture of one man  urinating into the mouth of another (also in the Mapplethorpe exhibit) would be  to assault the sensibilities of millions who did not seek it out. That violates  the classic liberal dictum that you can do what you want to yourself so long as  you do not harm others.  </P> <P> The other reason is that even if people aren't harming others, society has an  interest in what people do to themselves. , Libertarians don't like this kind  of pater nalism, but most people in this democracy believe that society has the  right to prevent consenting adults from, say, drug-taking or self-mutilation  (selling a kidney for money, for example). In short, society has the right --  the duty, even -- to protect people against themselves.  </P> <P> We know that drugs can injure. But can art? "What reason is there to think that  anyone was ever corrupted by a book?" asks Irving Kristol. "This last question,  oddly enough, is asked by the very same people who seem convinced that  advertisements in magazines or displays of violence on television do indeed  have the power to corrupt." because words and images have the power to degrade  that society tries to restrict certain kinds of material to the smallest  possible audience. That is why strip joints and porno houses are segregated  into combat zones. Some things may not be displayed on billboards. Some may not  be shown on TV. Some may not be shown in public galleries.  </P> <P> What goes where? That is the issue. It is one not of principle but of  classification. Take away all the posturing, and the issue with Mapplethorpe is  not, as the civil libertarians pretend, "Are you for or against censorship?"  The issue is "Where on the spectrum do you place Mapplethorpe?"  </P> <P> For what it's worth, where do I? Having seen the catalogue, though not the  exhibit, I find his work too melancholy to be offensive, too decadent to be  pornographic. Given current cultural norms, even his rougher stuff is, in my  view, correctly placed in a public art gallery.  </P> <P> The people of Cincinnati may, however, have a different standard. If they  believe that Mapplethorpe's rougher stuff ranks a rung lower, why should they  not be permitted to decide that it is too degrading to warrant public exhibit?  That is no more an attack on the First Amendment than keeping these pictures  off television.  </P> <P> The sophisticates howl at this judgment. They sneer at the yahoos of Ohio for  their small, censoring minds. Well, if the sophisticates and the civil  libertarians are so outraged by censorship, are they prepared to defend my  project to have the bullwhip-in-rectum study blown up and featured on a Times  Square billboard?  </P></p>

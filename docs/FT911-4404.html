			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: Japanese retailers feel the pinch after early spree - The trends behind this week's results from the leading store chains Japanese retailers' earnings last year showed the benefits of a consumer spending spree that began last spring but was tempered by the onset of the Gulf crisis and by more general fears of a domestic economic slowdown. Intense competition among supermarkets and convenience chains, many of which have ambitious expansion plans, has cut margins for some operators, and while results announced this week are generally favourable, profit growth is expected to be slower in the current year. Ito-Yokado, the Japanese supermarket operator, reported an 11.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y88.8bn (Dollars 651m) for the year ended February 1991 as consumer demand, particularly for foodstuffs, pushed sales higher. The company, which has just taken control of the financially troubled Southland Corporation of the US, reported that total sales rose 7.7 per cent to Y1,355bn, with an 11.6 per cent sales increase in foodstuffs, 6.6 per cent in women's clothing, and 3.3 per cent in household-related goods. Southland Corporation runs the Seven-Eleven convenience store chain in the US, while Seven-Eleven Japan is a member of the Ito-Yokado group and reported a 26.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y66.97bn. The Japanese convenience store chain, which plans to increase its network by 320 stores to 4,648, is expecting a pre-tax profit this year of Y75.7bn. Ito-Yokado, which has the best recent earnings record among the supermarket operators, expects that a slowdown in the domestic economy will hinder sales growth. However, the company announced that capital spending would be increased by 62.7 per cent this year to Y76bn, with most of the money devoted to renovation of existing outlets. Sales this year are expected to be Y1,432bn, a 5.7 per cent increase, with a pre-tax profit of Y92bn, up 3.7 per cent. This reflects concern in the industry that the lower than expected Japanese wage gains announced after the annual spring bargaining ritual will depress consumption this year. Seiyu, another leading supermarket operator and member of the Seibu Saison group, reported a 4.4 per cent increase in sales to 1,048bn, and a 10.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profit at Y10.3bn. For the current year the company expects sales of Y1,100bn, and a pre-tax profit of Y15.5bn. FamilyMart, a convenience store chain that is also a Seibu Saison group member, reported a 26.1 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Y13.71 on a 32.2 per cent increase in sales to Y60.3bn. The company said that a new point-of-sale stock monitoring system had led to a 0.3 per cent improvement in the ratio of gross profit to sales. For the year ending February 1992, FamilyMart expects a pre-tax profit of Y16.8bn on sales of Y72.7bn. Two retailers with large shareholdings held by the predatory and now financially-troubled Shuwa Corporation yesterday reported sharp falls in pre-tax profit. Nagasakiya reported a 45.8 per cent decrease to Y3.98bn, while Chujitsuya announced a 16.9 per cent fall to Y5.59bn. Nagasakiya's sales rose 0.7 per cent to Y409.2bn, but the company's profits suffered because of a large fire at a store in western Japan, which reduced gross profit by Y1.4bn and also prompted a Y600m increase in disaster protection provisions. The company, of which Shuwa owns 17.6 per cent, said earnings were also affected by an unusually warm winter that reduced demand for warm clothing, and by advertising restraint exercised in the wake of the blaze. This year, the company expects a slight increase in pre-tax profit to Y4.4bn on sales of Y440bn. Shuwa accumulated stakes in a range of Japanese retailers for the claimed purpose of restructuring the industry, though the company's stock and property excesses have forced it to use several of the holdings as collateral on loans from another supermarket operator, Daiei. Chujitsuya, in which Shuwa has a 34 per cent stake that Daiei is apparently keen to purchase, said profits fell because of a heavier interest payment burden and despite a 4.2 per cent increase in sales to Y315.47bn. The supermarket chain operator expects sales to reach Y328.6bn in the year to end February, and that pre-tax profit will be virtually unchanged at Y5.6bn.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (iv) Concentrations of emission products shall be reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in units of grams (g) per mile and in units of weight percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measured total hydrocarbons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Laboratory practice must be of high quality and must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with state-of-the-art methods as presented in current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environmental and analytical chemistry literature. Examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytical procedures which may be used in conducting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission characterization/speciation requirements of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be found among the references in paragraph (b)(5) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Characterization of the combustion emissions shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include, for products in all fuel families (except when expressly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted in this section):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Determination of the concentration of the basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions as follows: total hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, oxides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of nitrogen, and particulates. Manufacturers are referred to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle certification procedures in 40 CFR part 86, subparts B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and D (&sect;&sect;86.101 through 86.145 and &sect;&sect;86.301 through 86.348) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance on the measurement of the basic emissions of interest to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Characterization of the vapor phase of combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Determination of the identity and concentration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual species of hydrocarbon compounds containing 12 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fewer carbon atoms. Such characterization shall begin within 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minutes after emission collection is completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Determination of the identity and concentration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual species of aldehyde and ketone compounds containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eight or fewer carbon atoms. Characterization of these emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> captured in cartridges shall be performed within two weeks if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cartridge is stored at room temperature, and one month if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cartridge is stored at 0  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C or less. If the emissions are sampled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using the impinger method, the sample must be stored in a capped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sample vial at 0  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C or less and characterized within one week.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Determination of the identity and concentration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual species of alcohol and ether compounds containing six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or fewer carbon atoms, for those fuels and additive/base fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixtures which contain alcohol and/or ether compounds containing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from one to six carbon atoms in the uncombusted state. For fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and additive formulations containing alcohols or ethers with more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than six carbon atoms in the uncombusted state, alcohol and ether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species with that higher number of carbon atoms or less must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified and measured in the emissions. Such characterization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall begin within four hours after emission collection is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Characterization of the semi-volatile and particulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phases of combustion emissions to identify and measure polycyclic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aromatic compounds, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) Analysis for polycyclic aromatic compounds shall not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be conducted at or soon after the start of a recommended engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lubricant change interval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) Analysis for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and nitrated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs), specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, need not be done for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any fuels and additives in the methane or propane fuel families,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nor for fuels and additives in the atypical categories of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other fuel families, pursuant to the definitions of such families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and categories in &sect;79.56.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Analysis for poly-chlorinated dibenzodioxins and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dibenzofurans (PCDD/PCDFs), specified in paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(E)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section, is required only for fuels and additives which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain chlorine as an atypical element, pursuant to paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(2)(iv) of this section, which requires all individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission products containing atypical elements to be determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for atypical fuels and additives. However, manufacturers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline and nonbaseline fuels and fuel additives in all fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families, except those in the methane and propane fuel families,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are strongly encouraged to conduct these analyses on a voluntary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

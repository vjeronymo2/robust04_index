			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei ends above 18,000 in volatile trade Tokyo SHARES made modest gains in a volatile session and the Nikkei average rose 90.33 to 18,061.12, closing above 18,000 for the first time since June 3, agencies report from Tokyo. The market opened lower on profit-taking, with the Nikkei bottoming at 17,711.16 after 30 minutes of trading. But strong buying of incentive-backed issues helped to lift share prices. The Nikkei swung between positive and negative territory for the rest of the session, closing near its day's high of 18,119.63. Volume shrank to 550m shares from Friday's 850m. Advancing issues outpaced those declining by 676 to 344, with 102 stocks unchanged. The first section all-share Topix index was up 5.54 at 1,385.51. Traders said strong selling by foreigners was countered by buying by domestic individuals and dealers, while institutional investors remained on the sidelines. However, they added that sentiment remained positive following the government's stimulative package, announced last Friday. Construction and financial issues were bought on expectations that they will benefit from the government's Y10,700bn worth of measures aimed at boosting public works projects and helping the debt-laden financial sector. Aoki Corp gained Y35 to Y552 and Chiyoda Corp Y110 to Y1,860. Real estate companies declined in spite of statements by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, that government funds would help purchase real estate used as collateral for non-performing bank loans. Mitsubishi Estate finished Y20 down at Y1,010 and Mitsui Real Estate Y30 cheaper at Y1,080. Nissan Motor weakened Y37 to Y582 after Friday's news that the car company expected to incur its first loss since 1946 and that it was omitting its interim dividend. Aids-related issues saw strong buying interest. Most heavily traded was Green Cross, which rose Y160 to Y1,740. Meiji Milk climbed Y106 to Y1,060 and Okamoto Industries Y200 to Y1,430. Roundup PACIFIC RIM markets were mostly firmer yesterday with the exception of Australia and Manila. Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur were closed. SEOUL rose confidently in active trading and the composite index ended 23.59 up at 562.80. The index has risen 19.3 per cent since the government's support package on August 24. Turnover increased to Won428.18bn from Saturday's Won292.22bn. TAIWAN closed higher across the board as a strong rebound continued. The weighted index added 93.90, or 2.4 per cent, at 3,946.35 in brisk turnover of TDollars 29.5bn. China Steel appreciated 10 cents to TDollars 17.80 in active trading. Foreigners were allowed to redeem the company's GDRs from August 29 but brokers said foreign selling was light. AUSTRALIA was dragged lower by a larger than expected July current account deficit. The All Ordinaries index receded 6.7 to 1,547.2 in turnover of ADollars 361.9m, of which some ADollars 180m - mainly in Aberfoyle and News Corp - came from overseas. Aberfoyle retreated 25 cents to ADollars 4.65 after Cominco, the Canadian miner, sold off its 46 per cent stake at ADollars 4.57 a share. News Corp advanced 90 cents to a new post-crash peak of ADollars 24.80 after Moody's Investors Service placed it on positive creditwatch. MANILA declined further following Friday's drop, the composite index closing 10.11 lower at 1,376.66. Combined turnover fell to 144m pesos from Friday's 275m. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 capital index put on 1.36 to 1,481.92 in low volume. Carter Holt Harvey finished 3 cents ahead at NZDollars 2.63.

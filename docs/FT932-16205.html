			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Shorter degree courses proposed UNIVERSITIES are con-sidering radical changes to the academic year to increase their potential student intake. Lord Flowers, chairman of the Committee of Inquiry into the Academic Year, said yesterday that extended summertime teaching could hold the key to reducing the present overcrowding. Summer schools could allow degree courses to be completed in less than the normal three years, an interim report by the Flowers committee says. Mr John Patten, education secretary, welcomed the proposals. 'I look forward to a more flexible academic year in the future,' he told the first annual conference of the Higher Education Funding Council for England. 'It would be welcome if, at the same time as enhancing the quality of higher education, such changes to the academic year had the effect of increasing the numbers of students who could be taught.' Lord Flowers told 140 heads of universities and colleges at the conference in Birmingham that institutions would be consulted before a final report was submitted by the autumn. Many universities and colleges were already introducing or planning changes which would radically alter the conventional academic year of three 10-week terms, he said. Unions representing academic staff warned that changes under consideration would require a 'massive' injection of extra resources. 'University staff have already paid the price for the under-funded expansion of student numbers,' said the AUT/Natfhe confederation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [AFP/YONHAP from Vienna] </F>   [Text] The International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]  disclosed on 1 February that the possibility of completing  inspections of North Korea's nuclear facilities before the IAEA  Board of Governors meeting slated for 21 February are becoming  thinner and thinner. IAEA officials pointed out that even if an  inspection team leaves for Pyongyang at the end of this week,  there is not enough time for even submitting a preliminary  report to the IAEA Board of Governors meeting. The IAEA  officials said that North Korea has assumed a firm stance on a  third round of IAEA-North Korea negotiation for nuclear  inspections. They stressed, however, that the IAEA has not yet  given up all hope and that the door is still open for North  Korea.</p>

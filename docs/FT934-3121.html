			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Insurers relieved over pollution damage ruling Insurers of companies that cause pollution yesterday expressed relief after a Cambridgeshire tannery won its appeal in the House of Lords against an order to pay Pounds 1.1m in environmental damages for contaminating a water borehole. Had the five law lords ruled the other way, the concept of retrospective strict liability for environmental damage would have been introduced into English common law. It could have left insurers facing a bill of Pounds 3bn for the cost of cleaning up land already contaminated. The judges ruled that Eastern Counties Leather was not liable to Cambridge Water Company for contamination of its borehole at Sawston, Cambridgeshire, with perchloroethene, a highly volatile solvent used by the tannery for de-greasing animal pelts. The judges said the tannery could not have 'reasonably foreseen' at the time that it used the solvent, between the early 1960s and 1976, that spillages would lead to any environmental hazard or damage at Cambridge Water's borehole, 1.3 miles away. The decision pleased insurers. Mr Tony Baker, head of public affairs at the Association of British Insurers, said: 'If the appeal had not been upheld, an element of retrospective strict liability would have been introduced.' The Water Services Association, which represents the 10 large water and sewerage companies of England and Wales, said: 'We are concerned about pollution of ground water, but we are not surprised that the law lords have ruled against retrospective liability - it is not a principle which the WSA has sought to pursue.' Mr Paul Taylor, a partner with Berrymans, the solicitors representing the tannery and its insurer General Accident, said the decision meant insurers could now assess the strength of claims against a much clearer legal background. 'Insurers will still be absolutely concerned about environmental cover but there are likely to be fewer claims because plaintiffs will be more cautious,' he said. Had the ruling gone against the tannery, insurers would have been likely to hasten moves to narrow the scope of pollution coverage available in commercial liability policies. Reasonable forseeability was a prerequisite for recovery of damages under the common law rule, the law lords said. The rule imposes liability on a landowner who brings on to his land something likely to cause damage if it escapes.</p>

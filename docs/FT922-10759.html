			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Plea to end cycle of 'boom and bust' A PLEA to the government to avoid the 'roller-coaster of boom and bust' and to provide the conditions for steady and sustained economic recovery was made by Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the IoD. Mr Morgan told the conference the government had a role to play in securing renewed economic growth over the next few years and in providing business with a chance to respond to the 'critical chorus of closet collectivists' who questioned the motives of the marketplace. The general election had represented a 'day of reckoning', not only for the politicians but also for capitalism. The eventual outcome, he said, had been a 'near thing', with a real possibility that the voters would elect a which was government committed to transfer power away from the market and the consumer and back to government and the unions. Those who believed in capitalism and the markets, he added, would never be able to relax in the fight to prove that they were worthy custodians of economic power. If they did, they could lose next time. Responding to the continuing criticism of big pay rises for executives, Mr Morgan said the IoD had 'no reservations' about substantial earnings by top performers at the peak of their profession. But it did not support the abuse of executive power. He added: 'Unless directors are scrupulous in this respect, capitalism generally and directors in particular will always be vulnerable to criticism.' Mr Morgan said the IoD had consistently recommended that top executive rewards and performance payments should be independently determined and clearly reported. Shareholders and the public needed to see and understand the connection between directors' pay and directors' performance.</p>

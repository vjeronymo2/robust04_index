			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Borovkov] </F>   [Text] Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy, 28 Jun (TASS) -- An  accident has occurred at the radioactive wastes depository  situated on the shore of Seldevaya bay not far from  Petropavlovsk-Kamchatskiy. Two slabs from the covering were  damaged from being washed with water from melted snow and have  caved in. This has been reported in today's issue of IZVESTIYA,  quoting the heads of the oblast headquarters of the civil  defense. According to these data, the radiation directly above  the crack that has formed is eight milliroentgens, that is 1,000  times higher than the natural background for Kamchatka.    However, the heads of the civil defense headquarters think  that this radiation does not present a danger to the residents  of the oblast centre and the neighboring settlements: it is  local and "fades away" at a distance of a few meters. At the  present time repair work is being carried out at the burial  ground.    What is more, no one has managed to get complete and  objective information about the the situation at the storage  yet: admission to this secret facility which belongs to the  nuclear submarine flotilla, is closed to all civil inspectors.  Even the information that the civil defense headquarters has at  its disposal has been obtained from navy sailors.</p>

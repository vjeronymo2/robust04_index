			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Maastricht may face fresh delay FRESH COMPLICATIONS that could prolong the tortuous process of ratifying the Maastricht treaty emerged last night as MPs began returning to Westminster after the Easter recess. With the Commons resuming detailed consideration of the Maastricht bill tomorrow, Labour said it was still confident of forcing a vote on its potentially crucial amendment removing the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from the treaty's social chapter. Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, said there was a powerful case for a vote on the amendment 'at some stage'. If Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker who chairs the detailed discussion, sticks to his decision not to allow a vote on the amendment during the committee stage, the argument for allowing one in the subsequent report stage could be strengthened, Labour believes. Mr Cunningham has written to Mr Morris requesting a meeting today to discuss the matter. Mr Morris has received separate submissions from the Liberal Democrats and Tory Euro-sceptics. With the committee stage nearing its conclusion, some people are predicting a series of government defeats tomorrow on non-wrecking Labour amendments to increase the accountability to parliament of EC institutions. The likelihood of this receded significantly last month, however, after the Liberal Democrats decided not to support the amendments. Meanwhile, some Tory Euro-sceptics were apparently edging towards supporting a separate Labour clause to prevent powers being transferred under the bill until MPs had decided whether the social chapter should apply to the UK. With the Liberal Democrats set to back the new clause, the support of the 20 to 25 hard-core rebels would all but assure the government of an embarrassing defeat. But the clause would only force the government to choose between ratifying the treaty and accepting the social chapter if Tory rebels voted for the chapter in the subsequent debate. One Euro-sceptic yesterday predicted that more than 20 rebels were likely to support the clause. In a separate move, seven Labour Euro-sceptics have tabled five new non-wrecking amendments in a fresh bid to delay ratification.</p>

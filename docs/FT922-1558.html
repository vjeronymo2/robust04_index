			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / UK Gilts: Funding fears depress long bonds WORRIES about funding overshadowed good news on inflation, leading to a slight rise in yields at the long end of the gilt curve. Talk in the market centred on the Bank of England's auction on Wednesday of Pounds 2.75bn of 9 per cent bonds maturing in 2012. Assuming the auction succeeds, the Bank will have disposed of nearly half the gilts it will need to sell to meet this financial year's projected public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) of more than Pounds 30bn. Even though in the first three months of the year the Bank has made good progress in gilt sales, fears are growing that the pace of funding may have to be maintained because of the deterioration in public finances. Consequently the likely large glut in supply would almost certainly reduce prices, pushing up yields. Anticipating such a move, prices fell at the long end of the yield curve. At the short end there was a firmer floor for prices, a result of speculation about a reduction over the summer in UK base rates, now at 10 per cent. The 9 per cent bond due in 2008 saw its price slip by a quarter of a point over the week, closing on Friday at 99 19/32 . Its yield was pushed up 3 basis points to 9.04 per cent. As for the shorter dated 8.75 per cent stock maturing in 1997, the price was little changed at 98 17/32 , for a yield of 9.11 per cent. Fears about growing deficits were bolstered by the announcement of a Pounds 3.1bn PSBR in May. Even though this was a smaller figure than the market had expected, the underlying trend is that the Treasury's projection of a Pounds 28bn deficit for the year to next March will be comfortably exceeded. Assuming the deficit turns out to be closer to Pounds 32bn, that will leave about Pounds 36bn of gilts to be sold for the year as a whole, accounting for redemptions. Since the beginning of April, the Bank is believed to have sold nearly Pounds 13bn of gilts. Last week also saw a reminder of the weak inflationary forces in the UK economy, a result of only small increases in demand over the past few months. Growth in average earnings, as measured at an underlying level by the Employment Department, fell to its lowest level for 25 years in April - 7 per cent on a year-on-year basis - and is expected to fall further in the next few months. The slowdown in the rate of earnings growth was spread across all sectors of the UK economy. Average earnings growth for manufacturing employees fell from 7.75 per cent in March to 7.25 per cent in April. Indications that any recovery from the recession will be fragile were supported by news of a large decline in consumer confidence and a report from the Confederation of British Industry that manufacturers were expecting output to grow only slowly. Such indicators underline how the pressures pushing up prices throughout the economy will stay muted, which is good news for the gilt market. However, a slow or non-existent recovery will increase the PSBR, and produce a still higher figure in 1993-94. For the time being, the gilt market is less impressed by the inflation outlook - which it reckons it has known about for some time - and is concentrating on the funding aspects which some economists think could lead to a dire time for gilt investors in months to come.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> RAISE IN TRASH FEES VOTED BY COUNCIL  </P> <P> To offset increasing costs of trash disposal, the City Council approved a boost  in trash fees.  </P> <P> "The county is raising the dump fee, so we are just passing it on," Director of  Public Works Don Kemp said.  </P> <P> The monthly fee for residents will increase from $7 per month to $7.92. The  increase for businesses will run from $7 to $40 per month, depending on the  number of pickups.  </P> <P> Kemp said it may not be the last time the county raises its rates this year.  The county increased its prices twice in 1989, and increases were passed on to  residents. Since January, 1989, rates have gone up more than $1.50 per  household.  </P> <P> The new rate will take effect immediately.  </P></p>

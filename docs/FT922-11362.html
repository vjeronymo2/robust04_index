			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Lloyds board clears way for Midland bid LLOYDS directors yesterday approved a bid for the rival Midland Bank. However, bankers said a bid was not inevitable, and a great deal of work would be needed before one could be launched. Nonetheless, it is probable that there will be a battle for Midland, least profitable of Britain's four clearing banks, between Lloyds and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which has already made a Pounds 3.3bn bid for Midland. Approval for a bid came at a board meeting yesterday morning. Directors, led by the chairman, Sir Jeremy Morse, had been discussing whether to make a bid since their dinner together the previous evening. There was no official statement after the board meeting. Directors are understood to have been persuaded by the bank's chief executive, Mr Brian Pitman, to press ahead with preparations for a takeover attempt. Mr Pitman believes Lloyds can make huge incremental profits through combining with Midland, cutting more than Pounds 500m from the combined banks' overheads. Such savings would come from shedding more than 20,000 staff. But after sounding out Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of the Office of Fair Trading, Lloyds became concerned that a bid would be referred for investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the UK competition authority, and that the MMC might block the takeover. Lloyds understands the competition authorities fear that a takeover would reduce competition for small business loans. To minimise this threat to competition, Lloyds will try to find a bank prepared to take control of about 500 of its and Midland's branches should a bid succeed. Their purchase by a bank with a relatively small presence in England would serve as a guarantee that the small business loans market would not be dominated by just three banks - Lloyds, Barclays and National Westminster. Several banks, including the Bank of Scotland, are understood to be interested in such a deal. Bank of Scotland said yesterday that it had not had conversations with Lloyds about acquiring branches and that it remained committed to a policy of expanding in England by using 'non-traditional delivery systems'.

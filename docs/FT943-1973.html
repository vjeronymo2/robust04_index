			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (4): Slowdown after hectic pace - A look at changing market fortunes in France There was a time when Paris brokers were wont to grumble and groan about the dearth of equity coming on the French stock market: in fact, it was regarded as one of the main reasons for the relatively immature state of equity trading in France. Times change. The French market has been positively saturated with new issues for most of this year, thanks to the combination of the govern- ment's privatisation prog- ramme with a series of private sector flotations and a stream of capital raising exercises from existing publicly-quoted companies. 'This year will go down in French market history as by far and away the biggest for new issues of all kinds,' says Mr David Harrington, French market analyst at James Capel in Paris. 'The market has been absolutely sozzled with new equity.' However, most of the new issues were concentrated in the opening months of the year. The pace of activity declined during the seasonal lull of the summer holiday and has picked up slowly this autumn. There has been a significant reduction in the volume of new equity coming on to the market in the second half of 1994 compared with the first. Does this mean that the Paris brokers will soon be grumbling about a shortage of new issues again? The reasons for the slow- down are easy to see. The frenetic pace of activity during the first half was triggered primarily by the extremely buoyant state of the stock market in the opening weeks of the year. The CAC-40 Index raced ahead at the beginning of 1994 to reach an historic peak of 2360.98 on February 2. The index then fell steadily until early June when it dipped below the psychologically important 2000. It has hovered around that level ever since. The French economy is certainly not to blame for the market's bearish mood. Insee, the state statistics institute, has since early spring been churning out some remarkably reassuring monthly statistics on almost every area of the economy, from industrial production to employment. But the brighter economic outlook has failed to counter the negative impact of the weak bond market. Concern about the volatility of the US economy, fears of rising interest rates and nervousness about Germany's money sup- ply figures have all taken a toll on bonds and then on equities. However the downward trend in the stock market in February encouraged, rather than discouraged, the influx of new equity, at least for a while. The big issues of the early months of the year - notably the sale of the state's FFr35bn stake in the Elf Aquitaine oil group - were fuelled by the rising market. The next wave of issues, such as March's FFr3.96bn offer from the Peugeot motor group and FFr1.9bn issue from the Axa insurance concern, were characterised by concern that, if the market was turning bearish, these companies should raise money sooner rather than later. Some FFr108bn of new equity arrived on the French stock market in the first six months of this year. 'It's a massive amount of new stock,' says James Capel's Mr Harrington. 'The typical value of new issues over the past few years has been FFr35bn to FFr40bn. You only realise how extraordinary the level of activity has been in 1994 if you think that more money was raised in the first half than in the whole of 1993, which was itself a record with FFr89.5bn.' The pace of new issues has since slowed down. The economic outlook is still improving. Even the recent increase in bank base rates (at a time when the Bank of France has refused to raise rates to stay in line with Germany's Bundesbank) did little to dampen spirits. Mr Paul O'Brien, chief French economist at JP Morgan in Paris, concluded that recovery was 'well-enough established' for the base rate rise to have no more than a 'small' impact on the economy. However, the forthcoming presidential elections, officially set for next spring unless the ill-health of the incumbent, Mr Francois Mitterrand, neces- sitates an earlier vote, have cast a cloud of uncertainty over both currency and equity markets. Societe Generale recently concluded that political uncertainty was likely to counter any imminent improvement in the bond market. Analysts suspect that, at best, there will only be a modest rally in the French stock market during the closing months of the year. The consensus is that the CAC-40 index will be around 2150 at the end of the year. The rate of new issues is starting to perk up again. M6, the television station, is about to commence its flotation. Christian Dior, the fashion house, recently launched a convertible issue. Moreover, the government is about to begin the next phase of its privatisation programme, which was temporarily put on ice after the Elf issue and the subsequent sale of the Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP) insurance group. Mr Balladur and his ministers spent the summer deciding whether the candidate for the next sale would be the Renault motor group or the Assurances Generales de France (AGF) insurance concern. Renault has won and the Paris market is now preparing for the flotation of a large minority stake by the government. Yet AGF is still waiting in the wings as a future privatisation prospect, with a possible sale pencilled in for early next year, as are the Usinor Sacilor steel group and Bull, the computer company. Unless the Paris stock market takes a turn for the worse, the flow of new equity in France seems set to be fairly high in 1995, if not quite as high as in this record year.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: CP buys out container service partner CANADIAN Pacific, the transport, resources and industrial holdings group, has bought Compagnie Maritime Belge's 43 per cent stake in their joint venture Canada Maritime - the container shipping service which operates between Montreal and several European ports. The price of the deal was not disclosed, but CP also acquired two older container vessels from CMB. Canada Maritime was formed by CP and CMB in 1984 in a broad consolidation of north Atlantic container services following the severe 1982-83 recession. Container rates hit new lows last year but north American shipping lines have pushed container rates up by 10 to 15 per cent and this has improved returns. Eastbound traffic is firming, say shipping sources, but westbound is still very depressed. The Canada-Europe container service will continue to be dominated by Cast North America and Canada Maritime, now fully owned by CP.</p>

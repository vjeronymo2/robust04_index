			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ATHLETE OF THE WEEK;  </P> <P> GAIN WITHOUT PAIN A WINNING REGIMEN FOR MONROE'S HENSON  </P> <P> Sean Henson, hedonist?  </P> <P> A couch potato? Spud or stud?  </P> <P> Can this be the guy who struck out nine in a 4-2 win over San Fernando High in  the first round of the City Section 4-A Division playoffs last Friday?  </P> <P> Consider the Monroe High junior left-hander's less-than-stressful workout  regimen during the recent teachers' strike, which forced cancellation of play  and official team practices for two weeks. It seems that Henson spent most of  his time hanging out, rather than ironing out his hanging curves.  </P> <P> "I threw a couple of times over the vacation, uh, strike," he said. "I didn't  do much running."  </P> <P> Tim Costic, the other half of the Monroe pitching staff, says that while some  players used the break to put in some extra baseball work, Henson went his own  way. But Costic found no fault with Henson's success, i.e., Zs apparently  leading to Ks.  </P> <P> "Sean hasn't done that much," Costic said. "I think he did a lot of sleeping  in."  </P> <P> Henson, who finished with a six-hitter, kept the San Fernando bats in a deep  sleep. After the Tigers took a 2-0 lead in the second inning -- the key blow  was a triple that rolled to the fence on Monroe's lightning-fast turf (which  had not been watered because of the strike) -- Henson settled down.  </P> <P> In the late innings, Henson (5-5) escaped several jams with the strikeout and  double-play ball. San Fernando hit into inning-ending double plays in the  third, fourth and fifth.  </P> <P> With the score tied, 2-2, in the sixth, the Tigers loaded the bases and  threatened to blow the game open. Henson, however, struck out the side. In  fact, he struck out both pinch-hitter Fernando Ortega and designated-hitter  John Najar on three pitches.  </P> <P> For an encore, Henson struck out Jess Romero and Richard Ortiz -- both entered  the game with batting averages better than .400 -- in the seventh to end the  game. Of the final nine outs, six came on strikeouts.  </P> <P> "My legs were a little wobbly," Henson said, "but my arm felt real strong in  the late innings."  </P> <P> Early innings were another story. The game's first batter, Romero, was plunked  by an 0-and-2 pitch.  </P> <P> "That was nerves showing," Henson said. "I hadn't thrown and I didn't know what  to expect."  </P> <P> And with eight right-handed batters in the Tiger lineup, it looked like Henson  might not last long. Yet he soon righted the ship.  </P> <P> "I actually like throwing to right-hand batters," Henson said. "I can come in  on them and spot pitches better, and the fastball tails away from them."  </P> <P> The movement of Henson's fastball made it difficult for San Fernando to  execute. Usually a team that does the little things right, the Tigers failed  four times on sacrifice-bunt attempts.  </P> <P> "Sean's ball, with the way it moves around, is hard to lay down," said Costic,  who played first base Friday and was charging toward home plate in each  sacrifice situation. "I kept expecting to have to make the throw, but they  never got the ball down. He just challenged them."  </P> <P> It must have seemed hauntingly familiar for San Fernando, which last season was  upset by Monroe, 3-2, in the 4-A championship. Henson struck out 10 in that  game.  </P></p>

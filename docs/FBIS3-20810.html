			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Laszlo Kassovitz report: "The Offer of the Elections"] </F>   [Text] Istvan Csurka, cochairman of the Hungarian Justice  and Life Party [MIEP], was one of the speakers at the event  called "Parties' Forum" in the Kaposvar County Hall.    We have peace, we do not have order, and we have stability,  Csurka said, but not the kind that the country's people want  because it is not based on the will of the majority of the  people, and because it is not just. Order and democracy can  only be built on the basis of justice and can only appear with  the support of the majority. However, the current leadership  does not have the people's support because the government  parties, just like the opposition parties, are not implementing  the programs that they announced before the elections.    Equality, of which nothing was implemented, was the great  promise of socialism. Liberalism is the current promise.  However, liberalism is only enjoyed by those people who have  come through with an advantage from the previous regime. For  the vast majority of people, there is no freedom. There is  coercion, economic coercion, because power is concentrated in  the hands of the same people as before.    Two alternatives exist: the old and the new, the national  and the non-national.    The MIEP belongs to the national. Our political program is  to gain economic power, which can only be successful with the  help of state power. If this is not achieved then the state  will remain exposed to the nomenclature that was created in the  previous regime.    The current leadership, including the government and the  opposition, has failed. The reason has to be sought in the  pacts that were used to deceive the masses.    Who has acquired the factories that are worth huge amounts  of  money? The banks? Who skims off from the transformation?    The privatization companies, many of which are joint  ventures  or foreign owned. The reason for this situation lies in the  decision of the [former] Nemeth government to order that nothing  could be privatized without the participation of a privatization  company. In this way, he gave away the Hungarian state's  revenue and profits from the change of ownership. All the  enterprises of the State Property Management Corporation [AV RT]  did not make as much profit as the amount that had to be paid by  the AV RT for privatization.    While news of scandals in the world of banking and brokering  companies are emerging, the so-called bank consolidation has  started. All of them have to be relieved, one by one, of their  bad debts! The only thing that is not revealed is when these  bad debts arose and why the taxpayers have to bear the financial  consequences.    Naturally, some of them arose in the glorious 1980's when  the  huge enterprises had to be supported, and they still collapsed.  However, the banks are also to be relieved of those loans that  they have given out since 1990. And to whom? Since 1990, the  bad loans have originated from allocations to comrades. Now,  Hungarian society should line up and pay for the opulence of the  nomenclature, so that privatization can go ahead! This is what  they want.    Therefore, the task is to break the power of the banking  oligarchy. If this does not happen, all the parties can keep  promising anything that is pleasant to hear, but the system will  not change at all. It cannot change because it has become an  integral part of the world system based on the politics of the  World Bank, that demands a significant influence on the various  economies and financial systems.    We have to draw up our own program. We are not living in a  many centuries old economy that has developed through constant  rationalization, but rather we are in a forced situation.  Everyone has to be freed from this coercion; otherwise, people  will never accept the current order, will not multiply, will let  their territories be used by aliens, resign themselves always to  be led against their own interests, and finally disappear. This  danger will remain until they have a middle class and a  leadership with national sentiments.    For the emergence of this society with national sentiments,  the National Basic Curriculum, which was completed as long ago  as 1990, is indispensable, but the debates about accepting or,  rather, rejecting it can mostly be called sabotage. Education  was immediately removed from the program, and the Federation of  Young Democrats was the leading force in this.    It is unimaginable for the nation not to suffer serious  damage if the ranks of the Hungarian middle classes are only  filled through the Soros [Hungarian-American businessman]  Foundation, and the young people of those groups of society that  do not belong to this are automatically excluded. Money and  state support is needed for education, and a nation state is  needed to implement it. However, while the bourgeoisie that is  kept in power by the World Bank defines the use of the money,  very little is left for educational purposes.    Together with education, we also want to strengthen the  family, the basic cell of society. We say that every mother  with three children should receive the minimum wage, regardless  of whether she works, until the end of her life. Other state  benefits should be added to this to form the basis for her  pension. All this should be added to her pension basis acquired  while employed elsewhere. The precondition for all this is that  society must produce people who do not have to rely on society's  help in their adult lives.</p>

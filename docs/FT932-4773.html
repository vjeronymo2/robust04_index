			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Slash public spending, urges IoD ECONOMIC RECOVERY could be crushed unless the government acts urgently to eliminate up to Pounds 30bn of public sector debt, the Institute of Directors said yesterday. Calling for a 'revolutionary approach' to government spending, Mr Peter Morgan, the institute's director-general, said the Pounds 50bn deficit was so huge that 'no tax increases of acceptable proportions could come near to dealing with it'. He told Sussex businessmen that the scale and rate of growth of public spending constituted the economy's most serious problem. 'If the chancellor allows the government to continue to spend around half of the national income, and increases the tax burden to pay for it, then enterprise, the process of wealth creation and economic growth will be crushed,' he added. He emphasised that raising taxes to cut the budget deficit would 'simply guarantee that the ratchet of public expenditure would continue its upward thrust'. Mr Morgan claimed that Britain had been living beyond its means for years, a fact disguised only by the proceeds of privatisation and the high level of tax receipts during the 1980s. Without reform, the welfare state would increasingly fail to meet the demands and expectations that had been fostered by four decades of digging more deeply into the public purse. He urged the government to conduct a fundamental review of the public service, encompassing its purpose, efficiency and staffing levels. 'Since the middle class at present both pay (for) and benefit from the welfare state, any changes the government makes will affect them directly. 'It will be essential to win their support and convince them that their interests will be better serviced by making personal provision and exercising individual choice - and this means not increasing their taxes,' Mr Morgan added. He said the IoD would press the new chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke, to encourage those capable of making private provision by allowing tax relief on the cost of premiums and fees for welfare and health. The belief that the recovery may be slowing down has been fuelled by the first fall for a year in the Central Statistical Office's longer leading index, which tracks the economy. The index, which highlights turning points in economic activity about 11 months in advance, fell from 109.3 in March to 108.9 in April after several months of upward movements. That confirms other indications that any upturn is likely to be patchy.</p>

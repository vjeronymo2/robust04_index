			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MOVING A RUNWAY TO REDUCE NOISE  </P> <P> Hooray for Raymond Seymour (Letters, Sept. 23), who suggests that the Orange  County Airport runway be moved back to put the planes higher up when they cross  over people's homes. This idea is sensible and not too expensive.  </P> <P> The trouble is that I proposed this years ago, but the supervisors felt that it  was too late to do anything. The environmental impact report on the airport  said that the idea was impractical because they would have to move the radar.  </P> <P> Of course, the radar issue was a bunch of baloney, since it has become highly  distorted because of all the nearby high-rise buildings that have been built.  </P> <P> The San Diego freeway can very easily be put underground at low cost as no  tunneling is involved.  </P> <P> Let's look at this issue again.  </P> <P> R.M.

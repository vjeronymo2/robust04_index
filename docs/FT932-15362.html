			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Estate agents bullish about London market THROUGHOUT greater London estate agents found business disappointing over the holiday weekend, but there remains a conviction that the local housing market is showing strong signs of recovery. Mr John Lindsay, manager of the Sydenham branch of Mann &amp; Co, summed up the general feeling: 'We had the usual volume over the Easter holiday but it was quieter than recent weeks, which have been very busy. We usually tend to hold out great hopes for Easter, only to have them dashed.' He said the first quarter of the year had seen a lot of activity, with a local sale every other day compared with one a week a year ago. 'Mortgages are low, prices are low. The market is ideal for buyers,' he added. On the Monday bank holiday there were 25 requests for viewings but only five or six could be arranged immediately because vendors were away. This is a widespread problem in inner London, particularly in more up-market areas, as people tend to spend the bank holiday break out of town whether or not they are selling a house.

It was different in the suburbs, because of high activity in shopping parades, and most local estate agents remained open on Friday, Saturday and Monday. Mr Bryce Parkinson, Nationwide branch manager in Croydon, said the weekend had been reasonably active. 'There is an encouraging level of activity overall, and hopefully Easter will be a platform for take-off in the rest of the year. There are now signs of general economic improvement that should boost people's confidence - we are certainly encouraged, without going over the top,' he said. Mr Graham Bogg, a senior negotiator in the Kingston upon Thames office of Cornerstone Abbey National, said Easter was quiet but there had been 'phenomenal activity' in the area since mid-December. Sales figures had been 50 per cent higher than a year ago. Mr Jonathan Harvey, a director of Friend &amp; Falcke, an agency covering Chelsea, Knightsbridge and Belgravia, said Easter had been quiet as many vendors were on holiday. 'We expect a big increase over the next few weeks, and we are certainly short of stock in central London.'</p>

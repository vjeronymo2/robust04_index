			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TESTS FIND 'SILENT' AIDS INFECTIONS  </P> <P> New research suggests that the standard blood tests for AIDS fail to detect the  deadly human immunodeficiency virus in nearly one of every four "high-risk" gay  men who practice unsafe sex.  </P> <P> In the startling finding, UCLA researchers isolated the virus which causes AIDS  in 23% of a group of Los Angeles-area gay men who repeatedly tested negative  for the virus by standard tests.  </P> <P> Before the study, such "silent" HIV infections had been known to occur, but  were considered rare.  </P> <P> "The results are very shocking," said David T. Imagawa, a professor of  pediatrics and microbiology-immunology at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in  Torrance and the principal author of the study in today's New England Journal  of Medicine. "We expected, if anything, to find very few (antibody-negative  infected) individuals."  </P> <P> Imagawa said the results re-emphasize the need for gay men, intravenous drug  users and others in AIDS risk groups to refrain from donating blood and to  practice safe sex -- even if they have tested negative for AIDS antibodies.  Regardless of antibody test results, blood banks currently try to screen out  and eliminate donations from those at risk of being infected.  </P> <P> The team of researchers from UCLA, Northwestern University Medical School in  Chicago and Cetus Corp. in Emeryville said they isolated the AIDS virus in 31  of a group of 133 gay men who had tested antibody-negative.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dangerous Sexual Practices  </P> <P> The researchers sought gay men who they thought were likely to be infected,  despite negative antibody tests. Such men continued to engage in anal  intercourse with multiple partners and other dangerous sexual practices.  </P> <P> For this reason, the scientists cautioned that their findings could not be  generalized to others who have tested negative for AIDS antibodies, many of  whom are at lower risk of infection and may never have been exposed to the  virus in the first place.  </P> <P> "This is a select group," Imagawa said. "We cannot provide an estimate of the  proportion of (all) HIV infections that do not stimulate measurable  antibodies."  </P> <P> Antibody molecules are proteins produced by the body's immune system to fight  foreign germs, such as the AIDS virus. AIDS antibodies are measured by standard  tests called the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or "Western blot."  </P> <P> Antibodies are commonly detected in the blood within several months of HIV  infection. But previously a small number of infections had been recognized  where the delay was one to three years or more.  </P> <P> In a New England Journal of Medicine editorial also published today, William A.  Haseltine of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston said the new data may  have "encouraging" as well as "disquieting" implications.  </P> <P> The "good news" is that the evidence that some infected men have not developed  antibodies may suggest they are somehow warding off the disease. The  replication of the AIDS virus "may be spontaneously suppressed by a combination  of cellular, viral and immune mechanisms in far more people than has been  supposed," Haseltine wrote. He suggested that physicians could learn how to use  medications to similarly "induce prolonged remissions" in individuals who have  already tested antibody-positive.  </P> <P> But Haseltine acknowledged that the study raised the "sobering" possibilities  that many of the antibody-negative sexual partners of antibody-positive  individuals "may actually harbor silent infection" and that the AIDS virus "may  be transmitted by blood and organ donors who are silently infected."  </P> <P> The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that HIV may be transmitted by  blood that has tested negative for AIDS antibodies at a rate of up to 1  donation per 40,000. The CDC also estimates that between 1 million and 1.5  million Americans are infected with the AIDS virus.  </P> <P> Another leading AIDS researcher expressed skepticism about the new data, which  has not been independently confirmed. The researcher, who requested anonymity,  said that related research to be presented next week at the international AIDS  meeting in Montreal appears to contradict the UCLA finding of a substantial  number of silent HIV infections in high-risk gay men.  </P> <P> "It is such an unexpected result," the researcher said of the UCLA finding. "If  it is true, it is very disturbing. "I would like to see it confirmed by another  laboratory."  </P> <P> The new report is part of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, an ongoing  federally funded evaluation of nearly 5,000 gay men from the Los Angeles,  Chicago, Pittsburgh and Baltimore-Washington areas. Since 1984 or early 1985,  the volunteers have received semiannual exams and blood tests.  </P> <P> Initially, about 50% of the 1,637 gay men from the Los Angeles area tested  positive for AIDS antibodies and the rest tested negative, according to the  report. Subsequently, the UCLA researchers participating in the project began  an intensive effort to isolate HIV from the 133 antibody-negative men who  continued to have high-risk sex.  </P> <P> The researchers attributed their ability to find HIV in the blood of 31 of  these men to the use of a variation on a standard laboratory culturing method  for HIV isolation. These labor-intensive tests to grow the virus in the test  tube cost hundreds of dollars each and are usually performed only in research  laboratories.  </P> <P> When the standard culture procedure -- commonly employed to isolate the virus  from antibody-positive individuals -- was used, no virus was isolated from  antibody-negative gay men. But when the variation on this method was used, the  virus was isolated in the 31 men.  </P> <P> According to the report, four of the 31 gay men became antibody-positive 11 to  17 months after HIV was first isolated.  </P> <P> The other 27 men have remained antibody-negative for up to 36 months after the  virus was first isolated.  </P> <P> Many of the implications of the new data are not clear. For example, the  researchers said they do not know if antibody-negative infected individuals are  as infectious as those with positive antibody tests. Individuals with positive  AIDS antibody tests presumably have larger amounts of HIV in their bodies than  individuals who are infected with the virus but have never tested positive.  </P> <P> "The unfortunate truth is that we are much better at proving who is infected,  as opposed to proving that somebody is not infected," said Dr. Neil Schram, an  AIDS specialist at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Harbor City and a member  of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn. AIDS committee.  </P> <P> Schram said that on the basis of the new data antibody-negative individuals who  have engaged in high-risk sexual or intravenous drug use would need ongoing HIV  testing. He also said that individuals who have, for example, resumed high-risk  sex in a monogamous relationship after repeatedly testing antibody-negative  could still be putting their partners at risk for infection.  </P> <P> Dr. Steven M. Wolinsky of Northwestern University Medical School, a co-author  of the study, said that he will continue to advise patients that they are  "unlikely to be infected" if they have remained antibody-negative for "a  prolonged period of time" and have "eliminated activities that would put them  at risk for acquiring the virus."  </P> <P> Wolinsky's laboratory is in the process of performing another test that can  diagnose silent HIV infection, called the polymerase chain reaction, on nearly  3,000 antibody-negative gay men who are part of the national AIDS cohort study.  This study, which Wolinsky said should be completed within a year, should  provide a more accurate estimate of the frequency of silent HIV infections.  </P></p>

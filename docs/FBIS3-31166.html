Slovak political instability, including that of the  government, is a reality which disturbs the Slovaks and raises  doubts about the country among foreign investors, Kovac says,  adding that although blame for this does not lie squarely with  Meciar and his government, they cannot be spared it.    Rejecting a campaign aimed at discrediting his person, he  says that it has been initiated by "people from the Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), including its chairman, deputy  chairmen, and deputies."    At present, the government has enough powers to be  efficient,  he says, adding, "I believe the solution offered in the (Slovak)  Constitution to be acceptable."    Accusations leveled by Meciar that Kovac has triggered the  factional strife within the HZDS are false, Kovac says, adding  that in his meetings at their request with HZDS deputies they  ask him to explain his relations with the government. "I am  open with them, and my criticism includes myself."    Kovac also says that Meciar has informed him of cases of  deputies who requested 50 million korunas for their offers to  support HZDS. Corruption is rumored to be more and more  widespread, but on the other hand no steps have been taken to  prove it, Kovac says in the paper, adding that he urged Meciar  to "act against such people."    "Accusations of corruption should be made only when it is  possible to prove them," Kovac says, adding that empty  corruption accusations tarnish Slovakia's image.    Calling the law on the defamation of the republic a "relic  of  socialism," he says he is ready to sign an amendment to it as  soon as it is approved by parliament.    State Secretary and Government Office Head Ivan Lexa is  being  investigated on charges of violating the defamation law in  connection with pronouncements he made after Kovac repeatedly  refused to approve his appointment as privatization minister.    The government itself proposed last week that the  appropriate  articles of the law be repealed, but parliament declined to put  the issue on its February agenda.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Spanish carrier in crisis talks as strikes hit airports Airline management and unions were locked in crisis talks last night in an attempt to prevent Iberia, Spain's national carrier, sliding into bankruptcy. Strikes in all domestic airports in protest at proposed cost-cutting measures brought air traffic in Spain to a virtual halt, stranding some 110,000 passengers. Altogether 1,125 flights had been cancelled, 800 of which were Iberia flights, said officials. The airport chaos highlights a bitter confrontation over Iberia's plans to slash costs. The dispute threatens to disrupt the government of Mr Felipe Gonzalez and strain Spain's relations with the European Commission. Iberia which has reacted late to air traffic deregulation, is struggling under the financial burden of an ambitious expansion into Latin America, where it has bought substantial shareholdings in three local carriers, including Aerolineas Argentinas. Iberia has Pta150bn (Pounds 731.7m) of accumulated losses and says it faces bankruptcy early next year unless it pares costs and receives fresh state aid of some Pta130bn. However, any capital injection by the government requires the authorisation of the European Union. In 1992, Iberia was allowed a subsidy of Pta120bn on condition it did not apply for more aid until 1996. Iberia has become a test case for Madrid's determination to reduce deficits in public companies and its escalating losses will fuel the debate in Brussels over aid to publicly-owned carriers. Last night's talks were dealt an early blow when representatives of the pilots' union walked out. The pilots fear they will bear the brunt of Iberia's planned cuts and are seeking the removal of its chairman, Mr Javier Salas. Mr Salas said failure to agree a 15 per cent pay cut would mean the immediate sacking of 5,000 employees - 20 per cent of Iberia's workforce - and the break-up of the airline. The unions representing cabin crews, ground staff, mechanics and other employees, said wage cuts should be limited to 8 per cent and weighted towards the higher paid. They said they would continue to disrupt Spain's air traffic if management went ahead with the lay-offs. 'Iberia has for far too long depended on hand-outs and believed it always had a safety net,' said a Madrid government official. 'All that is over now and these are not conventional talks about pay; they are about the survival of a big company.' In the absence of a restructuring plan based on the 15 per cent wage cuts, Iberia says it will be forced to sell off its more profitable business units to raise capital through disposals. See Lex</p>

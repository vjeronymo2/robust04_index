			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GROWING SPACES;  </P> <P> KIDS' ROOMS: DESIGNING ENVIRONMENTS FOR CHILDREN THAT CAN ACCOMMODATE THEM FROM  THE CRIB TO COLLEGE CAN TEST PARENTS' PATIENCE, IMAGINATION AND POCKETBOOKS.  </P> <P> Few things are as ephemeral as the motif of a growing child's bedroom. Except  perhaps a child's shoe size.  </P> <P> It seems as soon as the crib is upgraded to that walnut-stained captain's bunk,  your toddler's a teen-ager, swapping his Batman slipcovers for a jet-black  duvet. And before you can sing "Happy Birthday," he's abandoning it for the  college dormitory.  </P> <P> Brat.  </P> <P> In the space of about 18 years, parents find themselves in an endless quest to  accommodate the fickle needs of a kid who one day wants a toy chest for his  stuffed stegosaurus, the next is stuffing it with floppy disks and college  catalogues. Too often, parents find these needs outgrow their pocketbooks.  </P> <P> Designing an environment for children that can take them from crayons to  computers is the dilemma parents confront when looking at how to stretch their  investment dollars, says Francine Pace, manager of Kids' Quarters in Orange,  which specializes in juvenile furniture. The issues, she says, are  timelessness, versatility, and of course, where to put the goldfish.  </P> <P> Whether it's pink or blue or has a bed shaped like a race car, a child's  bedroom is his or her first laboratory of self-expression.  </P> <P> Elaine Hankin of Elaine Hankin Interior Design in Huntington Beach says every  child should have his or her own special place. For 6-month-old Christina  Andrews's room in Huntington Beach, Hankin commissioned a muralist to draw a  fantasy-scape on one wall. Hankin says rooms should not be dated with trendy  furnishings ("I never used avocado green or shag") and that they should be  comfortable enough for children to grow up in. For this reason, Christina's  mural doesn't depict nursery characters but animals and fairies, and her crib  will eventually convert into a bed.  </P> <P> "Buying children's furniture is more interesting and exciting than buying other  things for the home," says Pace. "Parents feel obliged to learn at least six  technical aspects of a product like a refrigerator. Buying things for a kid's  room is a lot more fun."  </P> <P> That may be, but most parents would agree that there are still some technical  aspects to choosing a design for their children's room, based primarily on  variables of style and function.  </P> <P> Pace says the most popular plan revolves around modular units -- separate  storage pieces that can be made to fit together in a variety of ways. "It's  affordable and adaptable," Pace says. "And besides, there is always some piece  that a grandparent can buy."  </P> <P> Storage cabinets, drawers, desks and hutches, tables and even wardrobes can all  be purchased according to the basic tenet of mix and match, Pace says. Within  that framework, parents can custom design an environment that can be altered as  quickly as their child changes grades.  </P> <P> Once the child has outgrown the crib, the logical place to start spending would  be in the bed department.  </P> <P> The gamut at Kids' Quarters runs from a twin bed of simple pine for around  $120, to an oak bed "imported" from the East Coast for about $500. Similar  prices can be found at Children's World in Irvine, Kids' Room in Tustin, Al's  Woodcraft in Tustin, Anaheim and Huntington Beach and STOR in Tustin.  </P> <P> Of course, beds can be as varied as the children who sleep in them. The  captain's bunk has always been popular because of its built-in storage space,  and bunk beds are revered as an extension of the back yard Jungle Jim. Though  Pace denies that bunk beds are necessarily juvenile, their design can present a  problem to teen-agers who might one day decide that the bed they've slept in  since kindergarten is now a total gross-out.  </P> <P> That's when parents realize their initial mistake in planning their child's  room: They didn't. Pace tries to stress versatility to young families --  avoiding the cliches of childhood that spawn such trends as race car beds, in  favor of more timeless designs. That way, the room can be given a fresh look  simply by investing in a new bedspread and curtains -- a much cheaper  transition from toddler to teen.  </P> <P> The same basic rule applies when designing storage space for your child's room.  Pace says the most popular piece is the three-drawer chest, just short enough  so that most kids can reach the top drawer. Their design can range from simple  pine to sophisticated laminate -- an attractive selling point for parents weary  of fingerprints and scarring ballpoint pen marks.  </P> <P> As the need for space increases, more three-drawer chests can be added. STOR  offers a four-drawer white-lacquered particleboard system for $99, with  adaptable shelf and cabinet units. It also sells white-lacquered desktops that  can be placed on top of two narrow drawer units that will suffice until your  child goes to college.  </P> <P> Of course, parents can spend as much as they want on furniture for their  children. Bellini, an upscale juvenile furniture store in Costa Mesa,  specializes in Italian-made solid beechwood cribs, priced from $474 to $700.  Manager Courtney Alford says that although Bellini is priced higher than most  outlets, the long-term cost to parents is minimized because the cribs convert  to youth beds that can be used by children until about age 4.  </P> <P> Bellini also sells changing tables, for around $580, that convert into full  bookcases, and Canadian-made beechwood rockers that are pretty enough to  complement any room from child to adult.  </P> <P> "It's important to know how long the furniture (you're buying) will last,"  Alford says. "Is it durable enough to support older children? It's hard for  some people to look beyond the first couple of years," she continues.  </P> <P> "Typically, after two years, they start to redo the nursery. That's when they  show up here."  </P> <P> Part of children's furniture buying savvy is knowing something about its  manufacturers. The domestic furniture industry is fragmented, with more than  2,000 producers throughout the country, Pace says.  </P> <P> The East Coast, where the industry began, still specializes in hardwoods such  as oak and maple. But because of the high cost of shipping, California has a  plethora of local manufacturers offering furniture at competitive prices.  </P> <P> California entrepreneurs can offer pine, alder, and of course, redwood from the  Northwest, and ship them locally, saving 18% off their retail price tag. A  standard oak bunk bed set from the East Coast, says Pace, could cost as much at  $800.  </P> <P> West Coast furniture outlets such as STOR keep freight costs even lower by  shipping their wares unassembled, which makes for a more efficient package.  </P> <P> All of this means that parents on the West Coast can outfit their children's  rooms cheaper than parents in, say, Ohio.  </P> <P> So parents can afford to pay attention to style as well as function, says Jeff  Lee, a STOR buyer. He says we are a generation of parents who definitely care  about style.  </P> <P> "Juvenile furniture sales accelerated dramatically because of the baby  boomers," Lee says. "Women have more disposable income because they went out  and built their careers and then had their families. They took time to think  about their families, and they're interested in providing as much quality for  their children as possible."  </P> <P> Mothers are also older today than they used to be, from 25 to 38, as opposed to  "our mothers, who were 18," according to Pace's estimate. As a result, she  says, "they have had time to research their choices. They're generally more in  tune with what's available." Which of course ultimately dictates what's  available.  </P> <P> The baby boomer generation has helped establish the American Furniture  Manufacturer's Assn., a voluntary organization with guidelines that set up  safety precautions for furniture makers. The guidelines suggest such safety  items as placing a sandpaper-like strip on the rungs of metal bunk bed ladders  so that children do not fall through them.  </P> <P> Lee notes that it was this precautionary vision that prompted the redesign of  the toy box, that age-old repository of childhood. The safer "storage bench"  does not lock when it closes, avoiding the possibility of trapping a child  inside. And though it may not accommodate all of the junk a child can possibly  try to stuff into it, Kids' Quarters still carries one, in solid maple, for  $99.  </P> <P> And so does Bellini, in hand-painted solid beechwood, for $220.  </P> <P> Such well-bred quality seems to be making a comeback among homemakers who have,  in the years since their liberation, relied on convenience and disposability  for everything from diapers to dinner trays. Pointing again to the aspirations  of the baby boom generation, Alford notes the phenomenal success of  television's "thirtysomething" in portraying the successful life as one lived  among expensive and well-crafted possessions.  </P> <P> "There's been a change in the market in just the last two years," she notes.  "Everyone's more decorator-oriented. They want the look of quality."  </P> <P> Indeed, Bellini furniture and accessories have appeared in many video images of  the baby boom landscape -- the Diane Keaton film "Baby Boom," as well as "Miami  Vice" and "All My Children," to name a few."  </P> <P> Such attention to quality and durability might help establish a new generation  of family heirlooms, suggests Alford. "All of this stuff makes good  hand-me-downs."  </P></p>

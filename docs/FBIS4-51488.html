			<p>BFN     [Text] Kota Marudu, Sun -- More than 2,560 former Parti  Bersatu Sabah [Sabah United Party, PBS] members quit the party  to join the Angkatan Keadilan Rakyat, Akar, [People's Justice  Organization), a state Barisan Nasional [BN] component, here  today.    They submitted their membership forms to Akar president  Datuk  Mark Koding at the community centre.    They decided to join the Dusun-Kadazan based Akar after  Bandau MP George Sangkin left the Parti Demokratik Sabah (PDS)  [Sabah Democratic Party] to join the party last week. Sangkin  was with PBS before joining PDS.    At the gathering, Koding called on members of the PBS, PDS,  and Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah (PBRS) [Sabah United People's  Party] to join Akar.    He said the party has set a target of increasing its members  to 150,000 from the present 50,000 by the end of the year.    "Akar being a BN component is in a better position to  champion the interests of the Dusuns and Kadazans [ethnic  groups]," Koding said.    He said the newly-formed BN state government was sincere in  wanting to develop the state.    "If we continue to isolate ourselves then we would be left  behind from the mainstream of national development."    Akar deputy president and Minister of Culture, Youth and  sports Pandikar Amin Mulia and Sangkin were also present at the  function.</p>

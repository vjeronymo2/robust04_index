			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / International Company News: Lufthansa and Thai Airways in link talks Lufthansa is negotiating a co-operation agreement with Thai Airways with the aim of fashioning a network spanning the world, according to Mr Jurgen Weber, chairman. The German flag-carrier, which earlier this week offered 5m shares at DM182 (Dollars 118.10) each in a heavily oversubscribed combined rights issue and placing operation, said it expected talks to be completed before the end of November. A deal with the Thai flag-carrier would provide a crucial link in Lufthansa's growing list of partnerships built around an agreement with United Airlines of the US, which already co-operates with Thai. Meanwhile, Dresdner Bank, which led a book-building exercise for this week's capital-raising, said 3.9m shares offered in the rights issue had been widely distributed among private international investors. A further 1.1m from the federal government's holding had been placed. Heavy demand had enabled the offering to be priced at only a small discount  -DM2 - to Thursday's Frankfurt stock market closing price of DM184, it said. The issue and placing marked a decisive change in Lufthansa's status. The sale of government stock and Bonn's non-participation in the rights issue mean the government no longer holds a majority. It plans to reduce its stake further in the next year or two.</p>

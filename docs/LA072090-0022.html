			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> LANDLADY BEATEN; EVICTED TENANT HELD  </P> <P> A 38-year-old Ventura man was arrested on suspicion of severely beating his  landlady who had evicted him.  </P> <P> Raymond Gayle Wagoner, 38, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder at  4:35 p.m. Wednesday after he was located in Glendora, said Sgt. Bob Velez of  the Ventura Police Department.  </P> <P> Police said the landlady, Arlys Quinn, 47, evicted Wagoner on Monday from his  rental in the 9600 block of Coosa Street in Ventura.  </P> <P> She was aided in the eviction by the Ventura Police Department and the Ventura  County Sheriff's Department. The Sheriff's Department often oversees evictions  for overdue rent, officials said.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Wagoner stopped Quinn in a shopping center parking lot and  pleaded with her to let him into his former residence so he could retrieve some  medicine he had left behind, Velez said.  </P> <P> Wagoner told Quinn that the medicine was essential to his baby, who was ill,  and Quinn let him in, Velez said.  </P> <P> Once inside the residence, Wagoner became enraged with Quinn because of the  eviction and told her that he was going to kill her, Velez said. Wagoner then  struck Quinn with a 2-foot-long iron bar, possibly a fireplace poker, at least  a dozen times on the head and body, he said.  </P> <P> Quinn, who was bleeding profusely from her wounds, ran screaming from the  house, Velez said.  </P> <P> Witnesses, who helped Quinn, told police that they saw Wagoner walk calmly to  his car and drive away.  </P> <P> The police followed leads and discovered Wagoner was in Glendora, where the  Glendora Police Department took him into custody, Velez said.  </P> <P> Quinn remains in stable condition in the intensive care unit of Community  Memorial Hospital in Ventura, a hospital spokeswoman said.

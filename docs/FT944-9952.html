			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Arts: The hidden Orientalists - William Packer on the Impressionist treasures of an astute Egyptian collector That artists from the west travelled into the Moslem and Arab world, from Morocco in the west to Persia in the east, is a commonplace of the art history of the 19th century. Hard upon the rediscovery of relics of the civilisations of the ancient world far beyond the confines of the old Grand Tour, they were drawn inevitably by those living civilisations, no less ancient, through which they had to pass. There they tasted that heady mixture of the exotic and the refined, the cultured and the barbaric, the sympathetic and the alien, that altogether was irresistible. There was Delacroix off to Algeria, there Ingres with his bourgeois fantasies of life in the harem. Off went Edward Lear to the Holy Land, JF Lewis went native in Cairo, Gerome and Fromentin, Girardet and Guillaumet headed into the desert with the caravan. Back they came, those Orientalists, with their images of desert and harem, souk and bazaar, to great immediate success. And if their work then fell out of favour, in our own time we have seen it wonderfully restored to fashion in the auction house and the princely Arab eye. Even a lifetime ago it might have been expected that Arab curiosity would be engaged by such stuff, as much for its romantic licence and misapprehension as for any documentary value. To learn now that representative examples of the work of such as Leon Belly, Eugene Fromentin and Jean-Leon Gerome have been sitting in a museum in Cairo all this time, is not altogether a surprise. No. The surprise is to learn that this inter-cultural traffic also went on the other way. But then we forget that Egypt, francophone and francophile in her educated classes, had been under the close influence of France for the better part of a century before the British assumed the mandate in 1917. In 1908, Prince Youssef Kamal had set up a School of Fine Art in Cairo on the French model. This was followed, 15 years later, by the establishment of a Society of Friends of Art under the patronage of the prince himself and one of the ministers of the time, Mohamed Mahmoud Khalil. Khalil, who had a French wife, was a great collector of western art and, in the 1920s, extremely active in the Paris market when works of the highest quality were still reasonably cheap - Samuel Courtauld was similarly astute. Khalil's collection was to form the basis of the national collection when the Cairo Museum of Modern Art was set up in 1931. After the Nasser revolution of 1952, the royal collections were taken over and have been in the Guezireh Museum since 1957. So not only have the Orientalists been in Cairo since the 1920s, but also works of the highest quality by many of the masters of 19th century French painting, from Delacroix and Ingres to Gauguin, Renoir and Degas, with some good sculpture into the bargain, including Barye, Bourdelle and Rodin. There they have been, and there forgotten, les Oublies indeed, and quietly suffering dreadfully by modern conservation standards in the Egyptian climate. Hence this exhibition, for the programme of restoration has been undertaken by l'Association Francaise d'Action Artistique. The gaps are interesting - no Cezanne, no Manet, no Matisse, no Picasso - but hardly culpable in the face of the many lovely things that were acquired. The small reclining 'Odalisque' by Ingres, looking back over her shoulder, is magnificent, and the small Courbet nude, lying in the stream, is hardly less seductive. There is a delightful run of Sisleys, fine late Monets including a 'Nympheas' and a view of Westminster near Cleopatra's Needle, a self-portrait by the young Degas and a monumental drawing of a woman washing her hair, an extraordinary 'Cricket Match at Bedford Park' by Pissarro, and some fine riverscapes by Daubigny. As good as any are two Gauguins of the 1880s, the one of two symbolic nudes upon a beach, 'La Vie et la Mort', the other just a path through the trees. Lesser artists too are represented at their very best - a Moreau 'Salome', a Cazin 'Boatyard', a reaper reaping by Bastien-Lepage, a fishing fleet by Cottet, Regnault's 'Patio at Tangiers'. But there is no need to pick the plums, for not one of near 120 is without its interest. Les Oublies du Caire - masterpieces from Cairo museums: Musee d'Orsay, Paris 7me, until January 8.</p>

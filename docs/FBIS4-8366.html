			<p>BFN     [Text] President Tudjman has sent a letter to  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic  regarding a hunger strike by Muslim prisoners in Mostar's  prison. The following is the letter in its entirety:    It was with a great deal of surprise that I received the  news  that 225 Bosniak-Muslim prisoners were on a hunger strike in  Mostar's Heliodrom prison because of a delay in the agreement  between the Bosniak-Muslim and the Croat side on their release  and the simultaneous release of imprisoned Croats and members of  the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] from prisons in Zenica and  Travnik.    As far as the latter are concerned, your authorities have  not  given permission for them to be released because they have been  put on trial for participating in the enemy army--namely, the  HVO--and for not heeding their call-up notices. I maintain that  such actions on the part of both sides are at odds with the  Washington agreement. It is explicitly at odds with Article 3 of  the joint statement signed in Geneva on 10 February 1994 by  Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of the Government of the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate Granic, vice president of  the government and minister for foreign affairs of the Republic  of Croatia, and General Ante Roso in his capacity as a  cosignatory.    This is why I have instructed Mate Granic, vice president of  the government and minister for foreign affairs, to discuss this  issue with Silajdzic immediately as a matter of urgency. I  hereby ask you to do your best so that the prisoners from both  sides can be simultaneously released prior to my visit to the  Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This should be done regardless  of whether there are persons under investigation among the  prisoners or whether they have already been sentenced, in which  case we suggest they be pardoned or granted amnesty. Meanwhile,  both sides should take on an obligation to carry out adequate  procedures in line with jointly adopted legislation and  international conventions, once peace has been restored and the  new federal order established.    Mr. President, I appeal to you so we can together do  everything that is needed in order to resolve as soon as  possible this situation, which can only damage our efforts to  implement the Washington agreement. Let this be a concrete  contribution to the restoration of mutual trust in every area of  our coexistence. Please receive my personal regards.</p>

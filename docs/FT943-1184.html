			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (26): Maintaining a Victorian tradition - Case study The village of Saltaire in Yorkshire was created by Titus Salt  - a Victorian philanthropic entrepreneur who believed that profit could be attained without sacrificing good working conditions. Derek Oliver, design manager at Pace Micro Communications, likes to think his company maintains the pursuit of success in the tradition of Salt. Pace is a Pounds 130m turnover company designing and manufacturing satellite TV signal decoders and computer communications modems. Its headquarters are in a textile mill built for Salt's empire in 1852. Pace's 150-strong design team are located here, and a lot of thought has gone into their immediate surroundings. Most of these staff are engaged in Computer Aided Design (Cad), and spend hours working at a terminal. Oliver hopes to get the most out of this time by eliminating any cause for stress. 'Wherever possible we have installed anti-glare screens. The cheaper variety only stop reflection, but we've gone for a high specification that shield the user from radiation.' Wrist supports may sound flippant, but Oliver is a convert. 'The angle of the wrist when working on a standard keyboard can be quite steep. That tends to put the wrist in quite a stressful position. Wrist supports mean it's just a step up, a gradual run from the desk surface to the keyboard. They are very very simple, but they have a significant effect.' All fixed seating has been replaced by adjustable chairs. But according to Oliver it is an original Victorian feature that does the most to promote a productive working environment. 'The biggest plus point is the room we work in. It's large, open plan and has lots of natural daylight. Everybody feels the benefit.' Pace has turned its back on contemporary office design. 'We could put a lot of screening in place and lower the ceiling. But we've kept the original dimensions.' On a superficial basis, this is not an economical policy. 'From a heating point of view it's not the most efficient way to do things. A purpose-built office would be cheaper to run. But our workforce are happy with it, and that cuts away at indirect stress.' The benefits are difficult to quantify, but Pace has seen a difference. 'We don't have a great deal of absenteeism on grounds of illness. People do take less time off.' Oliver is convinced that watching ergonomic and environmental factors has kept his company ahead. 'It takes very little cost and effort to improve the working environment tenfold. For a very small investment you can reap a lot in terms of attitude to work. That in turn goes into getting a better product, because everyone is pulling the same way.' One measure of Pace's success is the fact that it manufactures electronic goods in the UK for export to the Far East. Exports to Asia contributed to 1.2m satellite decoding systems sold last year. So a well-planned workplace can contribute to survival in the most competitive of markets.</p>

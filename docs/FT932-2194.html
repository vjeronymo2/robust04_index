			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / How to Spend It: Bold and bright in the 1990s - Alice Rawsthorn considers the decade's emerging, technology-conscious furniture designers FOR YEARS the British furniture scene has been dominated by the same trio of designers - Ron Arad, Jasper Morrison and Tom Dixon - who made their names in London in the 1980s and who have gone on to establish themselves in the international market. It has taken time for a new wave of young designers to emerge in the early 1990s. A recession is not, after all, the best time for fresh ideas to flourish. But just as fashion is changing with the arrival of names such as Martin Margiela and Ann Demeulemeester, the next generation of furniture designers is begining to break through and to develop a different style for the 1990s. The key themes in the new furniture are bold shapes, bright colours and modern materials. Whereas fashion has gone off on a 1970s nostalgia trip, today's young furniture designers are more interested in the industrial ideals of the 1920s modernists and the space-age styles created by the French and Italian futurists in the 1950s and 1960s. Industrial production is another important theme. This is partly a backlash against the artisanal work of the 1980s, when the chairs made by Ron Arad and Tom Dixon looked more like one-off works of art than things to sit on, and partly a reflection of the academic revival of the ideas of the early modernists, Le Corbusier and Jean Prouve, who saw industrialisation as a positive force in everyday life. But the 1990s designers are also genuinely enthusiastic about the potential of today's new technologies. They are the first generation of designers to have been educated at a time when computer studies were compulsory in schools and computer-aided design systems are a standard fixture in their studios. 'I find technology incredibly exciting,' says Nick Dine, 28, whose chairs and chaises longues are sold at Fiell on London's Kings Road. 'And I think it is part of my responsibility as a designer to apply it to my work.' The hitch is that it is much more expensive to produce furniture on an industrial basis than to make it by hand. The cost of fitting out a factory to make a new design is so high that few manufacturers are able, or willing, to make the necessary investment, particularly in Britain, where the furniture industry is still shell-shocked by recession. One reason why Ron Arad and Tom Dixon taught themselves welding and sculpture techniques in the 1980s was because they had to. 'When I started out furniture manufacturers were not exactly falling over themselves to help obscure, young designers,' says Arad. 'If I hadn't made my furniture myself it wouldn't have been made at all.' Arad and Dixon established their reputations with hand-made pieces and are now able to clinch manufacturing deals with the big German and Italian furniture firms. The new designers are adopting a different approach. Rather than abandon all hope of producing their work industrially, they adapt their designs so that they are suitable for 'batch production' in small quantities by tiny workshops. Jack Woolley, 30, scouts about for metal workers and professional welders to make the components for his furniture. 'It's still difficult to find small factories that are willing to work in small batches,' he says. 'But it's not impossible. You just have to work at it.' The main disadvantage of batch production is the cost. Nick Dine's chaises longues cost Pounds 1,400 each and Jack Woolley's Stretch chairs are Pounds 400. Both say they could sell their work more cheaply if they manufactured in larger quantities. But manufacturing in small batches does have the advantage of flexibility. Allison Thomas, 28, can customise her Tutti Frutti stool for different clients. She lengthened the legs to turn it into a bar stool for one, chopped them off to make a pouffe for another and has even added a touch of 1940s glamor by embroidering the covers. 'It's fun being able to adapt my designs,' she says. 'But batch production is really a compromise. What I want is to manufacture on a proper industrial basis. It's only then that I'll get the clarity of shape I'm aiming for.' The work of Nick Dine, Jack Woolley and Allison Thomas is on show at In The Swim, an exhibition of new British design, now on at DesignLabor, Bremerhaven in Germany, which runs until June 30 and moves to London later this year.</p>

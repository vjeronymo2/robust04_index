			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> WOMEN DRAGGED FROM WAILING WALL  </P> <P> Female security forces dragged a dozen praying women from Judaism's holiest  shrine, the Wailing Wall, when disturbances erupted during a service today.  </P> <P> A group called Women at the Wall aroused anger among ultra-orthodox Jews by  holding collective prayers on the women's side of the wall. The ultra-orthodox  believe women's voices should not be heard during prayer.  </P> <P> One woman screamed at the group, throwing water and gravel at them. Others  yelled for quiet, creating a din above the prayers. About 50 of the women sat  with linked arms to avoid being carted off.  </P></p>

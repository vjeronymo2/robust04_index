			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Vosper Thornycroft plans to hire 200 new workers VOSPER THORNYCROFT, the Southampton-based naval shipbuilder, plans to take on 200 more employees over the next two years to fulfil export contracts. The increase goes against the trend in naval shipyards. The company now employs about 1,750 people after a reduction of 180 jobs last year. Vosper's prospects were changed by contracts from Qatar and Oman. Mr Martin Jay, the company's managing director, said further workers would be needed if other expected Middle Eastern contracts were won.</p>

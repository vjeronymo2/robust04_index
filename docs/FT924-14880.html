			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Sappi moves ahead 19% on rights issue interest INTEREST on the income of a R1bn (Dollars 355m) rights issue last year helped Sappi, the South African-based forest products company in the Gencor group, lift earnings by 19 per cent in the first six months to the end of August. These figures disguise the extremely difficult operating conditions the group faces. Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman, says the pulp and paper industry is facing its worst recession in 60 years. Thus, although Sappi was able to lift turnover by 14 per cent to R2.02bn from R1.78bn a year earlier, operating income fell by 14 per cent to R221.2m from R257.1m. The big fillip came in the form of a 96 per cent fall in net financing costs to R4.5m from R126.4m in 1991 owing to the interest receipts from the rights issue. This helped boost net profits by 71 per cent to R175.1m from R102.4m. A 44 per cent increase in the average number of shares in issue, however, limited growth in earnings per share to 19 per cent - up to 130 cents from 110 cents. The dividend was maintained at 80 cents per share. Highlights of the reporting period include the acquisition of a 90 per cent stake in Hannover Papier, a German coated fine paper manufacturer. The deal was partially financed through a placing of Sappi paper in Europe, and the group's subsequent listing in London, Frankfurt and Paris. Trading figures for this acquisition are not included in the current results, but the balance sheet reflects, on a consolidated basis, previously equity accounted subsidiaries of Sappi and Hannover. Mr Van As said productivity had improved at all the group's units; cost increases in South Africa and the UK had been kept below inflation; capital expenditure had slowed sharply; and there had been a significant restructuring of the UK operation.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: JAKARTA;  </P> <P> AN ASEAN CONCERN  </P> <P> The U.S. decision to open direct talks with Vietnam and drop its support at the  United Nations for the three-faction Cambodian resistance coalition is expected  to dominate this week's annual meeting of the six-member Assn. of Southeast  Asian Nations in Indonesia.  </P> <P> Leaders from Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, the Philippines and  Singapore will be able to question U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III  directly when he arrives for the end of the conference.  </P> <P> ASEAN considers an end to the 11-year-old war in neighboring Cambodia vital to  its efforts to create a stable and prosperous region and has taken a leading  role in so-far fruitless efforts to broker a peace agreement. Delegates will  also try to reverse U.S. opposition to forcible repatriation of Vietnamese  "boat people."  </P></p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Italian regional banks link up TWO of Italy's biggest regional banks have agreed to take small equity stakes in each other in what could be the first step towards the creation of a private sector financial group. Credito Romagnolo, the Bologna-based bank in which Mr Carlo De Benedetti's Cir group is one of the most important shareholders, is to buy about 10 per cent of Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna, the city's savings bank. In return, CRB will buy up to 5 per cent of Credito Romagnolo. Both sides have indicated the swap promises to be the prelude to a gradual integration of financial services in one of Italy's industrial heartlands. The two banks specialise in retail services and lending to small and medium-sized businesses, which form the economic backbone of the Emilia Romagna region. 'The agreement is the first step towards the creation of a big Bologna bank,' said Mr Gianguido Sacchi Morsiani, chairman of the savings bank. To launch their co-operation, the two banks will rationalise duplicated operations in some financial services and study setting up joint ventures in others. Credito Romagnolo, in which France's Banque Nationale de Paris has over 6 per cent, has about 350 branches and deposits of L46,000bn (Dollars 31bn). CRB has 110 branches and deposits of L11,500bn.</p>

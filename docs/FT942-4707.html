			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Company News: Ina takes the privatisation trail - The sale of 51 per cent of the insurance group will be Italy's largest disposal After a pause for mould-breaking general elections, the Italian privatisation show hit the road again yesterday. Less than three weeks after a parliamentary vote of confidence in Italy's new right-wing government, the Italian Treasury published the prospectus for the sale of up to 51 per cent of the Ina insurance group, which claims a bigger market share than any of its private-sector rivals in Italian life and non-life business. The price for Ina shares will not be set until June 25, two days before the retail offer is launched, but the Treasury has confirmed that it will be between L2,200 and L2,700 a share, valuing the whole company at L8,800bn-L10,800bn (Dollars 5.4bn-Dollars 6.7bn). That will make Ina the biggest privatisation attempted by the Italian state, although it is almost certain to be dwarfed within a year by the sale of state-owned holdings in Stet, the telecommunications group, Enel, the electricity utility and Eni, the energy and chemicals group. One challenge for Ina and its advisers is maintaining the momentum of investor interest. This was seen in the previous sales of the financial groups, Imi, Credito Italiano and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI). Domestically and internationally, both Stet - already a quoted company  - and Eni are better known. They are politically sensitive, which means they attract more media interest than Ina has in its 82-year history. That said, the Ina sale is not short on technical and political innovation. The last two public offers - of BCI and Credito Italiano - were criticised, after allies of Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank, installed their nominees on the board. New restrictions in the Ina sale will prevent such manoeuvring by treating investors linked through other companies' shareholder syndicates as though they are acting in concert. Together, such investors will not be able to buy more than 5 per cent of Ina. In addition, small shareholders' nominees will have seats reserved for them on the board, offsetting the dominance of large institutions, a trend likely to be continued. Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, Ina's chairman since 1990, and a former head of Prudential's Italian operations, believes a similar Mediobanca-inspired raid on the Ina board is unlikely. In any case, he will have enough on his plate bringing the group up to the same levels of efficiency as its competitors, without having to worry about boardroom in-fighting. Ina has been totally owned and managed by the state since 1912, and benefited from compulsory contributions from other insurance companies, until last year. 'Some other insurance companies are probably operationally more profitable than us,' admits Mr Pallesi, disarmingly. 'But our potential is much greater than theirs.' In particular, the group is hoping to take advantage of the opportunities in Italy's underdeveloped life insurance sector. Life insurance represents a comparatively low share of the overall Italian market, because of generous state pension provisions. In 1992, for example, life insurance accounted for 27 per cent of the Italian market, compared with 66 per cent of the UK market. But increasing pressure on the Italian pensions budget means life insurance and other linked savings products are likely to be taken up as alternatives. Ina still leads the sector - with an 18 per cent share at end-1992 - but has watched its hold over the market decline over the last few years. However, Ina believes it should be able to arrest the decline by revamping its extensive distribution network of more than 7,000 sub-agents and sales people throughout Italy and by tapping the fast-growing bancassurance sector through an agreement with Banca di Roma, one of Italy's biggest banks, to sell Ina's products through the bank's extensive network. Over the last year, Ina has tried to counter disaffection amid the ranks of its agents - most of whom are not employed directly by the company, but concentrate exclusively on the sale of Ina products - by promoting younger more dynamic sales people, changing about 25 per cent of the network. At the same time, the company is to promote the links between its life business and the sale of non-life products through its subsidiary, Assitalia. According to the company, this should offset the handicap imposed by new European Union regulations which prevent Ina and Assitalia from taking the logical step of uniting into a composite insurer, along British lines, just at the moment when EU liberalisation is increasing competition. The board's second task, after restructuring the distribution network, will be to attend to Ina's extensive property assets. The group starts with the advantage that its owners at the Treasury have allowed it to revalue the assets, which range from ordinary apartments to the historic Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, more than doubling their book value. If Ina sells some of its real estate - valued at just over L7,000bn - it will only have to pay tax on the increase since the year-end revaluation. Some analysts see the low yield on this property as evidence that the assets have been overvalued, but at least this strong capitalisation should mean that Mr Pallesi will be able to honour his pledge that no capital increases will be attempted 'for the foreseeable future'.</p>

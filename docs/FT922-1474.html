			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (10): 'Big Blue' attacked by smaller fry - IBM International Business Machines, 'Big Blue', is the colossus of data processing, a sprawling giant whose annual sales (Dollars 64.8bn in 1991) dwarf those of its nearest rivals; it spends more on research and development than many of them turn over in a year. Few industries have ever been so dominated by a single company. IBM's position as leader of the computer world, however, seems at last to be under attack from a succession of smaller, more agile competitors. It lost money in 1991, an event that would have been unthinkable a decade ago. It is going through a profound corporate reorganisation that will see it lighter by up to 80,000 people by the end of 1992. And it is no longer finding it easy to dictate the pace and direction of data processing as it did in the past. IBM was the role model for computer manufacturers, indeed for much of corporate America, from 1960 to 1990. Established in 1925 from the bones of the Computer Tabulator Recording Company, it grew up in the image of its founder, Thomas J Watson, an opportunistic, fiercely competitive Presbyterian who started business life hawking sewing machines and small pipe organs from a horse-drawn wagon. An apprenticeship with the National Cash Register company taught him the finer, and sometimes less scrupulous, points of marketing. But he was essentially a man of the early part of the century; it was his son, Tom Watson Jr, born in 1914, who understood the potential of the computer and steered his father's creation to its commanding position in data processing. The key to its success over the past 30 years has been its domination of the mainframe market; in its heyday, more than 70 per cent of mainframe computers worldwide were supplied by IBM. It launched the System /360 mainframes in the 1960s, one of the first and most comprehensive efforts to establish a family of compatible machines. A range of machines of different capacities to suit different sizes of company but all running the same software proved to be just what the market wanted. The machines were an immediate success. IBM frittered its advantage away, however, by building special machines for special purposes; by the 1980s, it was making seven incompatible computer families and was forced to introduce a concept it calls Systems Applications Architecture (SAA) to persuade customers it was seriously trying to resolve its electronic Tower of Babel. Marketing is one of its strengths, however. It understood at an early stage that data processing managers were both influential in the decisions which led to the purchase of data processing equipment and vulnerable to pressure from senior management who had no interest in computing as long as it provided the information they wanted. Hence the proverb: 'Nobody was ever fired for buying IBM.' It has also been a leader in technical innovation, setting standards which others have had to follow. Examples include the development of low cost magnetic 'core' memory, the 'Winchester' sealed hard disk drive and reduced instruction set ('Risc') technology. Risc processors now seem likely to dominate the mid-range computing market. Whole industries have grown up supplying either equipment which could be tacked on to IBM's mainframes or compete replacements, the so called 'plug compatible' market. The 1990s ushered in a new era in data processing, an era dominated by personal computers, corporate 'downsizing' to smaller, less costly systems and open industry standards (for open, read not controlled by IBM). Profits margins in this kind of business are tens of percentage points below the level IBM is used to, and it is having to struggle hard to match its overheads to its market expectations. It still has the lion's share of the mainframe market, but that is now a mature sector, growing at only a few per cent a year. It cannot claim to lead in portable personal computers, workstations or supercomputers, three of the most important areas of computing for the future. And while it dominates mainframe systems software with operating systems such as MVS and query languages such as SQL, it is engaging in a battle with the software house Microsoft over the operating system of choice for today's high performance personal computers. It has never been successful in applications software. As an organisation, IBM can seem paradoxical. Its corporate behaviour is often a model of integrity yet few holds are barred when it is determined to win an order or an argument. It employs most of the brightest people in the industry and many of the time servers. It pushes technological research to the limit but often markets lack lustre products. The purpose of its current reorganisation is to produce a loose federation of entrepreneurial units closely in touch with its customers and each with its own profit and loss responsibilities. Success in the transformation is by no means certain but competitors agree that only IBM has the determination and resources to survive into the next century as a full line computer supplier.</p>

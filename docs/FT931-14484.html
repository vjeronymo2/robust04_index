			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / A wake-up call from Laura Tyson President-elect Bill Clinton's selection of Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson as chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and his reliance on economic advice from the likes of Labour Secretary-designate Robert Reich, a lawyer by training, has angered many US economists. The Los Angeles Times reported a mood of 'quiet fury' at this month's meeting of the American Economics Association. Supporters and detractors of the Clinton appointees have been insulting each other for weeks on the editorial pages of leading papers. In a typical intervention, Mr Robert Barro, a leading conservative economist at Harvard, referred dismissively to Ms Tyson's 'scant academic credentials'. Mr Paul Krugman, his liberal counterpart at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, claimed Mr Reich was a 'pop-internationalist' who was ignorant of basic economic theory. Mr Krugman has more time for Ms Tyson (who has an MIT PhD), but found himself in hot water after telling one reporter she lacked analytical skills. In preferring Ms Tyson to Mr Larry Summers, a Harvard economist on leave at the World Bank, Mr Alan Blinder of Princeton University and Mr Krugman, all of whom are committed Democrats with impeccable academic records, Mr Clinton showed no respect for the profession's own pecking order. Yet claims that Ms Tyson, a Berkeley professor, is unqualified for the post are unfounded. The roll call of past CEA chairmen is actually rather undistinguished; it excludes all of the most respected postwar economists, including giants such as Paul Samuelson, Milton Friedman and James Tobin. The only true academic star to get the job was Harvard's Martin Feldstein, but he resigned in frustration when Ronald Reagan ignored his pleas for deficit reduction. Most presidents have chosen ideologically compatible, middle-ranking economists with an interest in public policy. Ms Tyson fits this bill perfectly: she was a logical choice for Mr Clinton because she has written extensively on trade and industrial policy and shares his prejudice that government inaction, especially in high-technology sectors, has helped undermine US competitiveness. By naming Ms Tyson, Mr Clinton also struck a long overdue blow against male dominance of the economics profession; only a handful of women have won tenured posts at the top ranking universities. The overall balance of Mr Clinton's economic team, however, is harder to defend. Doubts raised by Ms Tyson's appointment were exacerbated by the naming of Mr Ron Brown as commerce secretary and Mr Mickey Kantor as US trade representative. These lawyer-lobbyists have scant economic experience and will sit on a National Economic Council (NEC) that includes Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, budget director Leon Panetta (both lawyer-politicians), NEC director Robert Rubin (a lawyer-banker), Mr Reich (a lawyer-author) and Ms Tyson, an economist who is sceptical of the efficiency of free markets. The problem lies less in any individual appointment than in the fact that nobody at the highest level is a natural champion of market forces. Nobody can be relied upon to make the counter-arguments against proposals, for example, to subsidise particular 'strategic' sectors. While talented, Mr Clinton's cabinet thus lacks the kind of economic anchor that might have been provided by, say, Mr Paul Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, at the Treasury or a highly respected 'mainstream' CEA chairman. On the other hand, Mr Clinton is tapping a rich vein of talent at sub-cabinet level: Mr Summers is getting the under-secretaryship for international affairs at the Treasury; Mr Larry Katz, one of the brightest young Harvard economists, is joining Mr Reich at Labour. Mr Joseph Stiglitz, a leading theorist at Stanford, is expected to join the highly regarded Mr Blinder as a junior member of the CEA. None of these 'stars', however, will enjoy the influence or presidential access of Ms Tyson, who will rule the roost as Mr Clinton's 'chief economist'. Mr Clinton deserves credit for puncturing some over-sized economic egos. But the controversy over his team runs far deeper. By relying heavily on the unorthodox Ms Tyson and on self-styled gurus such as Mr Reich and Rhode Island business consultant Ira Magaziner (who got a top White House post last week), Mr Clinton is signalling his exasperation with the economics profession, which he feels has shed little light on the long-run forces undermining US productivity growth and living standards. This is perhaps an error. But if the profession is misunderstood it has nobody but itself to blame. It worships mathematical technique but pays little attention to the behavioural and institutional forces at play in the real world - which is too messy to model with tidy equations. It has lost relevance by trying to pretend economics is a 'hard science' totally divorced from such related subjects as politics, psychology and sociology. It has lost its ability to communicate with the laity. Ms Tyson doubtless appealed to Mr Clinton because she seemed more knowledgeable about industry and less politically naive than her colleagues. With any luck her appointment will serve as a wake-up call for economists everywhere.</p>

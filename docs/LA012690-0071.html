			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> RAUCOUS PARTIES IN ROLLING HILLS MAY NET HOSTS A BILL FROM CITY  </P> <P> The Rolling Hills City Council has introduced an ordinance that will require  the hosts of rowdy parties to pay for sheriff's deputies called to break up the  party.  </P> <P> Under the ordinance, the sheriff's deputy called to a raucous party will tell  the hosts that if additional deputies are required to break up the party, there  will be a price to pay. The deputy will issue a written notice, outlining the  ordinance and including a cost breakdown for additional police services.  Party-givers who break up the party themselves after receiving the warning will  not be charged.  </P> <P> The council unanimously agreed to introduce the ordinance Monday after noting  that eight to 10 such parties per year can make a dent in city funds. City  Manager Terrence Belanger said Thursday that the city does not know exactly how  much those services have cost, but the amount is substantial.  </P> <P> If the measure is passed as expected in two weeks, it would become effective  March 6. It would include a fee scale for the cost of additional deputies  services.  </P> <P> Capt. Dennis Gillard of the Lomita sheriff's station said the cost of  dispersing a party depends on the type of police service required. He was  unable to give a breakdown of those costs.  </P> <P> Belanger told the council that the large parties typically occur around  graduation, during the summer, at Christmastime and during spring break. They  are usually given by young adults who invite large numbers of people and a lot  of trouble, he said. "Those are the kind of parties that we're really talking  about," he said. "People coming from outside the area who have no respect for  the property or the community."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Gordana Swanson said the ordinance is a way of holding parents  responsible for the actions of their children when the parents are out of town.  </P> <P> Several other cities, including neighboring Palos Verdes Estates, enforce  similar ordinances. Gillard said Rancho Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills Estates  are also considering establishing a party ordinance. Ann Johnson  </P></p>

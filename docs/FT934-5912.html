			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Tunnel groups fined over fatality Five UK construction com-panies building the Channel tunnel were fined Pounds 40,000 each yesterday for failing to ensure the safety of a worker crushed to death while acting as a train lookout. Mr David Griffiths, aged 26, of East Street, near Dover, died when he jumped off a train to change a set of points, Maidstone Crown Court in Kent was told. He was crushed in a 12in gap between his train and another. The court heard that he had not received the required training to be a train lookout, also known as a banksman. Mr Hugh Carlisle QC, prosecuting for the Health and Safety Executive, said: 'Mr Griffiths should not have even been on the train. Not only was he not qualified as a banksman but he had also never been trained to work underground.' Mr Michel Kalipetris, defending, said: 'We accept Mr Griffiths should not have been on the train, but he slipped through a system that had been devised to stop such accidents.' Judge Felix Waley said: 'The failure in this case is one of the worst this court has heard about in the past years. This accident happened because the safety procedures in place were not properly supervised and carried out.' The Transmanche Link consortium companies, Balfour Beatty Construction, Wimpey Major Projects, Tarmac Construction, Taylor Woodrow, and Constain Civil Engineering admitted failing to ensure Mr Griffiths's safety.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Indian TV launches a real carry-on: Producers' fight for air time descends into farce Independence Day - gave Indians a freedom long denied them by Doordarshan, the country's state-owned broadcaster. It was responding belatedly to the challenge of Star Television, the Hong Kong-based satellite broadcaster which has attracted a huge audience in India with its five channels: entertainment in English and Hindi, an Asian version of the MTV music channel, sport and BBC World Service Television. However, the new offerings from Doordarshan, an unwieldy, bureaucratic organisation which previously had only two terrestrial channels, did not begin auspiciously. Those fortunate enough to have an additional satellite dish jeered the menu of old Indian films and dated programmes from the archives. In line with the government's programme to open up the economy, the launch of the satellite network using India's new Insat-2B satellite had been intended to coincide with much greater use of privately produced material. But Doordarshan's attempt to offer slots to producers on a first-come-first-served basis has descended into farce. Fearing they would be elbowed out by a rush of more aggressive bidders, seasoned producers, such as Mr Prannoy Roy of New Delhi Television and Mr Ishwari Bajpai of Octave Communications, deputed employees to queue outside Doordarshan's commercial office on Delhi's Tolstoy Marg on June 23, nearly two weeks before what was then the applications deadline. The queue became longer by the day as more than 300 people braved the monsoon rain. Producers say their men have been offered up to Rs50,000 (about Pounds 1,100) to relinquish their places. Those left out took the matter to the courts. Bennett Coleman, owners of Times Television and the Times of India group of publications, challenged the queue's validity. An interim district court judgment ordered police to dismantle it, allowing it to be re-formed two hours before the opening of the applications counter. The queue refused to disperse. Mr Roy went to the Delhi High Court, which appointed a registrar to verify the truth. Prominent film and television personalities, such as Bombay film producers Ramanand Sagar and Saeed Myrpa, and television magazine producers Madhu Trehan and Karan Thapar, have turned the sidewalk into a tourist attraction. Two parallel queues have formed, one of which includes representatives from newspapers including the Indian Express, Times of India, and Hindustan Times. The battle, waged with equal ferocity in the courtrooms as in the columns of the newspapers, remains unresolved. The Information and Broadcasting Ministry, however, had promised to launch the new channels on Independence Day. It was forced to assure the courts that it would use only in-house programming. Doordarshan is finding it difficult to keep pace with the appetite of the new channels. 'It's like expecting a roadside food vendor to cater to a five-star hotel clientele,' says a senior official. Doordarshan is paying for its dismissal two years ago of Star TV as a 'one-day wonder', a luxury that only a handful of the country's elite would be able to indulge in. Star TV, 64 per cent of which was recently bought by Mr Rupert Murdoch, now has an Indian audience of 18.8m. Though Doordarshan's reach remains enormously bigger than Star's, the Hong Kong-based network will be the biggest competitor for advertising revenue. Other adversaries are emerging in Asian skies, including: A consortium comprising Time Warner's HBO Asia, with access to Warner Brothers and Paramount films; Turner Broadcasting Systems, which owns CNN; ESPN International, the sports network; Viacom, owners of MTV; Australia's AUSTV; and Hong Kong's TVB. The Asia Television Network, which has a bank of more than 3,000 Hindi films through an arrangement with Cable Master, a video film company, and a tie-up with Sun TV of Madras to screen films in regional languages. Regional language channels such as Asianet, which will beam programmes in Malayalam, the language of Kerala, starting on August 29, through transponders hired from the Russian Ekran satellite. 'Even three years ago, we had the chance to lead the wave of government deregulation and enhanced technology in Asia, but we did little to capitalise on it,' admits a Doordarshan official. 'Now that we have woken up to the fact that Asia is indeed television's most exciting frontier, and India is one of its largest audiences, we will have to make up for lost time.'</p>

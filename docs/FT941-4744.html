			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / IADB members raise - and lower - the stakes: A look at a capital-boosting deal The US and its Latin American partners have agreed to reduce their stake in the Inter-American Development Bank as part of an accord to boost the bank's capital by Dollars 40bn (Pounds 27bn). The agreement, which will reduce the US shareholding in the bank to around 30 per cent from 34.6 per cent, also envisages the bank lifting its current bar on lending to the private sector. The capital increase, if details are finalised as expected at the bank's annual meeting in Guadalajara, Mexico, next month, would allow the bank's non-regional members - particularly Japan and Germany - to expand their small stakes in the institution. Japan, which currently holds only 1.08 per cent of the bank's capital, has been pressing for an expansion in its stake to reflect its financial support for US initiatives in Latin America. The agreement is also expected to provide Japan with an executive director on the board, which will be thus expanded to 13 members. As part of the accord, the borrowing members of the bank from Latin America and the Caribbean will reduce their combined stake from 53.8 per cent to a fraction over 50 per cent. The Dollars 40bn increase should allow the bank to continue with a lending programme of Dollars 7bn-Dollars 8bn a year for an indefinite period. Only 2.5 per cent of the increase will be paid in by shareholders, the rest being callable capital against which the bank will be able borrow in capital markets. The increase in the stake of the non-regional shareholders will reduce considerably the budget implications for the US, which is currently Dollars 847m in arrears in its commitments to international institutions. The bank's lending to the private sector will be limited to infrastructure projects, with a ceiling probably of 5 per cent - Dollars 350m to Dollars 400m a year. The bank will only lend where the private sector is also providing finance, and to a maximum 25 per cent of total lending. Under the accord, the bank will double the proportion of its lending going to so-called social sectors, such as primary health and education which are now considered the central issue for the region's development. Some 50 per cent of transactions (40 per cent by value of lending) will be directed to these areas. The bank will also direct lending for the first time to improve the quality of government - for instance, enhancing the region's judicial systems. Mr Enrique Iglesias, the bank's president, said the capital replenishment accord was 'more than a capital increase. It's a redefinition of bank policy to better respond to Latin America's problems.' However, there was still much to do before the increase was finally agreed. This includes completing discussions about the bank's soft-loan window, the Fund for Special Operations, and resolving differences over whether another seat on the board is required for the bank's Latin American members as Chile, especially, is seeking. However, a US Treasury official was optimistic that the issues could be resolved by the Guadalajara meeting and remarked on the 'positive manner' in which the discussions had been held.</p>

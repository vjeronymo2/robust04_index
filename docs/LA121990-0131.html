			<p><P> December 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> COUNTY TO SELL RANCH SEIZED IN DRUG RAID  </P> <P> Despite objections from Sheriff Brad Gates and his supporters, Orange County  supervisors voted to sell a 213-acre ranch seized in a 1985 drug raid rather  than turn it into a regional drug enforcement training center.  </P> <P> The $1.4-million ranch in east Orange County has been an object of a long  tug-of-war among county officials, who now have decided they cannot afford to  keep it. The ranch became a prominent symbol of the county's war on drugs, and  President Bush visited it in 1989 to highlight his national anti-drug campaign.  The owner of the ranch, Daniel James Fowlie, has been accused of international  drug smuggling.  </P></p>

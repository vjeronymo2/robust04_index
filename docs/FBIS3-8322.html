			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Esteemed listeners, governmental spokesman Raycho  Raykov is on the telephone to provide us with details on Prime  Minister Berov's health condition:    [Raykov] Good day to you and the listeners. A short while  ago I had a telephone conversation with Professor Petrov, head  of the Military Medical Academy, who informed me that after a  thorough checkup and examination today at 0800, the medical team  of the Military-Medical Academy's Lozenets Hospital in Sofia  established that the condition of Professor Lyuben Berov, who  suffered a heart attack yesterday, is slowly stabilizing. The  basic symptoms of the heart attack have been overcome, and the  patient is in good spirits.    There will be a news conference with the Lozenets Hospital  medical team at the Governmental Press Center at 1400 today  regarding the health condition of Prof. Lyuben Berov.    With your permission, I would like to add something. I want  to officially deny the nonsense -- to put it mildly -- published  in some of today's newspapers regarding the prime minister's  condition. I would like to invite correspondents to the news  conference to learn about the prime minister's condition.  Apparently some of them would like the prime minister to be in  much worse condition than he already is.    One more thing: No one has been fired at the Council of  Ministers. A newspaper today even claimed that Georgi Nedev,  the chief of the Prime Minister's Office, was fired yesterday.  I want to deny this report. Nothing similar has happened, and  I hope nothing will happen because the government is functioning  normally. The prime minister's scheduled meetings with  representatives of various Bulgarian and foreign institutions  will be carried out by his deputies. As you know, the prime  minister yesterday signed an order according to which, during  his sick leave, he will be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister  Evgeni Matinchev. Thank you very much.</p>

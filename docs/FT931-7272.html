			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Letter: No hold-up on statistics Sir, Measures to ensure the prompt publication of macro-economic data are at the heart of the CSO's recently announc-ed package of improved dissemination practices. In many instances publication times will be advanced significantly. The first estimate of quarterly gross domestic product, for example, will be brought forward by four weeks. There is and has been no question of CSO 'sitting on' results. There has to be a short gap between our receiving information and publishing it, so that CSO can add to its value. For example, data have to be aggregated, grossed up, seasonally adjusted and, most importantly, checked for accuracy and consistency. As Mr Davies says (Letters, February 24), this type of statistical information is price-sensitive and important to industry; it has to be released responsibly. It is simply not true that information on the latest retail price index is held back for two weeks; only the broadest of indications about the all-items index is available at that time, and this is based on partial information. The concept of a real-time RPI is interesting, and may be technically possible. But it would not be possible to collect in this way the same range of items included in the current, monthly RPI, which of necessity covers practically all the goods and services people buy.

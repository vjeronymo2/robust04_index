			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Street cars for New York New York's city council has approved a plan to bring back the trams or street cars that last rattled around the city half a century ago, Richard Tomkins writes from New York. A vote in the council at the end of last week will allow officials to seek bidders for a Dollars 135m (Pounds 90m) project to build a 2.2m tramway running the length of 42nd Street from one side of Manhattan to the other. The project is intended to cut traffic, pollution and noise, speed up travel across midtown Manhattan and help bring about the regeneration of 42nd Street. Years ago the street was famous for its night-life, but much of it is now rundown and sleazy.</p>

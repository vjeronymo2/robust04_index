			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / Accounting rule adopted early MOST BIG UK companies have adopted FRS3, a new accounting standard that virtually abolishes the extraordinary item, according to a survey by accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. The survey found that 69 per cent of the UK's biggest companies adopted the new standard before it became compulsory, which was for the financial year ending in June. Coopers &amp; Lybrand believed that early adoption of FRS3 was less common among small companies. The extraordinary item, a means of accounting for unusual gains or losses which the new standard seeks to eradicate for all but the rarest events, had not been used by any of the companies surveyed. Coopers &amp; Lybrand believed that this strong lead by large companies would make it very hard for any company to continue to use the extraordinary item. The survey found that 43 per cent of companies disclosed additional information about earnings per share, partly to counter the extra volatility of the earnings per share figure that arises from the abolition of extraordinary items. In 24 out of 30 cases the alternative earnings per share figure was higher than the earnings per share figure calculated under FRS3. The average increase was 57 per cent. Coopers &amp; Lybrand surveyed 111 large companies with year ends between September 1992 and March 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- The Russian Armed Forces are  efficient, controllable, ready to protect the state from any  encroachments and ensure national security, including in  peace-making, Russian Defence Minister General of the Army Pavel  Grachev told graduates of military academies here today.    Today's Russia has no enemies, said the defence minister.  "This is confirmed by major provisions of the Russian military  doctrine and known by the whole world. However, Russia same as  any other state has its interests of the military-political and  geo-strategic position. We have to remember about this and  proceed from national interests in military building," said  Pavel Grachev.    The minister recalled names of renowned Russian military  leaders and said they valued the soldier's confidence most. "Be  more attentive to your subordinates. Remember that an army  where an soldier believes in his officer has such an advantage  that cannot be gained with strength, materiel and any other  thing," said Grachev.    The armed forces are interested in social stability and  civic  peace. "Unity and accord are necessary for prosperity of the  state and successful development of the military sphere," said  the minister.</p>

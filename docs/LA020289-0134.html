			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: MAKING THE TOP 10 LEAVES AUSSIES COLD  </P> <P> Andrew Gaze, a native Australian who plays for the No. 10-rated Seton Hall  basketball team, said in a live radio interview back home, "We're doing very  well, we're in the top 10."  </P> <P> There was silence Down Under.  </P> <P> "They didn't understand at first," Gaze told Newsday. "Back home there are only  14 schools."  </P> <P> The subject was academics, and Illinois basketball Coach Lou Henson, who  attended Okay (Okla.) High School, told the Chicago Sun-Times: "There were 13  in my graduating class, so I can safely say I was in the top 10%.  </P> <P> "As a matter of fact, I've gone up to No. 1 because 5 or 6 years ago the school  burned and all the records went with it."  </P> <P> Trivia Time: Name the Marine Corps corporal who, on this date in 1962, became  the first man to clear 16 feet in the pole vault by winning the Millrose Games  at 16-0 1/4? (Answer below.)  </P> <P> From a column of "impertinent questions" by Phil Jackman of the Baltimore  Evening Sun:  </P> <P>  -- "If baseball players are so much better today, as some insist, how come so  many 40-year olds are still hanging up impressive numbers?"  </P> <P>  -- "Has any coach ever hung around and latched onto as many jobs without  producing any detectable results as Gene Shue?"  </P> <P>  -- "I'm confused. Were the seven Clemson basketball players suspended for a  game because they did or didn't go to study hall?"  </P> <P> 35 Years Ago Today: On Feb. 2, 1954, Bevo Francis of Rio Grande College in Ohio  scored 113 points in a 134-91 victory over Hillsdale to set a record for small  colleges. Francis broke his previous record of 84 set 2 weeks earlier against  Alliance College.  </P> <P> From Lanny Wadkins, who plans to play in the Hawaiian Open after the L.A. Open:  "After Hawaii, I'm taking a week off at Mauna Lani (to fulfill a contract  obligation). Lie on the beach. Work on my tan. Have a beverage. It's a tough  job, but somebody has to do it."  </P> <P> Said St. John's basketball Coach Lou Carnesecca, 64, when asked how long he  intends to coach: "I'm going to keep going, going until they take it away.  Hopefully, I'm smart enough to get out before I die with my boots on. But I'm  not Errol Flynn, you know."  </P> <P> Trivia Answer: John Uelses.  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda, on Orel Hershiser's performances at the end of last  season: "He had an ERA where the league owes him runs."  </P></p>

The Danish company N.R. Konsult A/C worked for 15 months on  the composition of a project for the development of business in  the region. The republic itself was the project client. The  situation with Western investors prompted it to take this step.  Their interest in the northern riches is enormous, but specific  cooperation is arranged with great difficulty. And although  one-tenth of all foreign investments in Russia is already in  Komi today, this is not the limit, by far. But in order to  interest Western investors, a guarantee of the firms to which  they are committed is necessary and, in addition, projects are  needed that are drawn up taking into account the world practice  in preparing documents of this kind. The Danish company has  undertaken to perform this work. Its interests coincided with  the readiness of the Danish Government for cooperation with  Russia; therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark  allocated the resources to cover the hard currency part of the  costs.    A project office, which received the name "Master Plan," was  opened a year ago in Syktyvkar. From the Danish side,  representatives of an aggregate of 10 companies participated in  the work on Komi territory. Komi enterprises assumed the ruble  part of the costs. Scientists and leading specialists of  branches of the economy of the republic took part in the  collection, processing, and analysis of materials. The results  of the work were formulated in the reports "Concerning the  Problems and Capabilities of the Komi Republic" and "Concerning  Strategic Recommendations," and "A Catalog of Projects."  Incidentally, implementation of part of these projects has  already been started.    The presentation of the Master Plan was held recently in  Syktyvkar. Danish specialists and managers turned out to be a  step ahead of other foreign companies: As a result of the work  that has been done, they now possess not only the most accurate  and detailed information, but they have also concluded very  specific business contacts with entrepreneurs of the Komi  Republic.</p>

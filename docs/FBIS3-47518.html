			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Press Pocket" column: "Envoy Kunadze"] </F>   [Text] New Russian Ambassador Georgy Kunadze met with  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu for half an hour yesterday [12  January] to give him a copy of the letter of credentials he will  formally present to President Kim Yong-sam later.    Kunadze is no stranger to Han as the two have met several  times as researcher and professor at academic conferences while  the former was serving at the IMEMO (Institute of World Economy  and International Relations).    He expressed a hope to learn the Korean language during  talks  with Minister Han, according to a ministry official who was  present at the meeting. Majoring in Japanese at Moscow  University, Kunadze is a fluent Japanese speaker.    The Russian envoy was quoted as saying that his government  plans to send more diplomats to Seoul, adding that the Russian  embassy is a little small. Touching on his official residence  south of Mt. Namsan, he also said that the house is good as  living quarters but small for social functions, as if suggesting  early settlement of the ownership of the former Russian legation  site in downtown Seoul, according to the ministry official.    Former ambassador Alexander Panov has started working as  vice  foreign minister in charge of Asia-Pacific affairs covering  Korea, China, Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand, Kunadze  was quoted as saying.    While serving as vice minister, Kunadze was responsible for  personnel and administration affairs in addition to Asia-Pacific  and southwest Asian affairs.    He also met with Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong for  about 35 minutes. Vice Minister Hong had served as ambassador  to Moscow for one year before he became vice minister last March.    He is expected to present the letter of credentials to  President Kim late this month or early next month along with  three other new ambassadors, the ministry official said.</p>

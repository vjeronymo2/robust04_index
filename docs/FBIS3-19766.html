			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ankara -- On Monday [21 March] Turkish security  forces restricted several groups of Germans, who wanted to  observe the Nevruz celebrations and the local elections next  Sunday in the Kurdish area, in their freedom of movement. This  was learned from reports by the people affected and by the  German Embassy in Istanbul on Monday. Turkey had previously  declared "observers" from Germany "unwanted."    In Cizre, in southeastern Turkey, one of the main sites of  the fights between the militant Workers Party of Kurdistan (PKK)  and the security forces, about 20 Germans were stuck in their  hotel on Monday. According to them, their passports had been  confiscated and would be returned only if they agree to leave  the region. Angelika Langehl-Weyrer of the North  Rhine-Westphalian land association of the Greens said they are  permitted to move around freely and have not been arrested, but  the streets are "full with military and police" and it has been  "recommended" that they stay in the hotel.    Another group of 17 Germans, who were taken from Igdir in  eastern Turkey to Erzurum on Sunday, were on their way back to  Igdir on Monday afternoon, according to information provided by  German diplomatic circles. They, too, had had their passports  taken away.    It was unclear on Monday how many German groups, including  politicians of the Social Democratic Party and Greens, trade  union representatives, and employees of relief organizations and  human rights groups, are in the region. "However, the situation  is calm and we do not have any reports that the Germans are in  danger," a spokesman of the German Embassy in Ankara said.    A group of 52 Germans who had been sent back from Van in  eastern Turkey to Istanbul over the weekend did not rule out  another attempt to go to the region of unrest. A spokesman for  the group said the three Kurdish interpreters, who had  accompanied them from Germany and whom the Turkish police wanted  to arrest, have "disappeared without trace." "The three have  not been arrested; they said good-bye to us voluntarily, after  the German Embassy did not guarantee that they could return to  Germany with us." [sentence as received]</p>

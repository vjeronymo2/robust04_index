			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Emerging Markets: Brazil's turbulence set to continue - The Emerging Investor The long-awaited sealing of Brazil's Brady plan debt restructuring this month might have been a shot in the arm for the country's capital markets. Previous deals by countries such as Argentina led to huge inflows of foreign investment. But Brazil has been affected by the recent turbulence in emerging markets linked to US interest rate rises and also faces domestic uncertainties including general elections at the end of this year and a government anti-inflation plan. This means that although the Brady deal is expected to reduce the country risk for Brazilian securities, a sea change in the attitude of international investors is unlikely in the short term. For the stock market, the announcement of the deal, which restructures Brazil's Dollars 52bn debt to foreign banks and is due to be signed on April 15, was welcomed. But there was disappointment that the IMF was not sufficiently convinced by the government's anti-inflation plan to provide a stand-by loan in support of the Brady deal. Nevertheless, for Mr Alfredo Viegas, an analyst with Salomon Brothers in New York, the potential for Brazil's equity market is staggering. He predicts that Sao Paulo's stock exchange index will repeat 1993's performance and double in value again this year. 'After the Mexican elections there will be a huge inflow and that will spill over into Brazil,' he says, noting that foreign investment on the Sao Paulo exchange, Brazil's largest, is still relatively small, averaging only 15 per cent of daily trading compared with 60 per cent in Mexico. The Sao Paulo index has climbed by about 40 per cent this year, although most of that appreciation was in January following a large inflow of foreign investment and hopes for the anti-inflation plan. Mr Viegas says his bullish scenario depends partly on expectations that a candidate from the centre, such as former finance minister Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, will be elected president. The success of the anti-inflation plan is also a key factor, he says. This involves balancing the federal budget and proposes the introduction of a currency linked to Brazil's foreign reserves to tame inflation, running at about 40 per cent a month. The doubts surrounding Brazil's economic and political development lead to difficulties in valuing the stock market. In spite of last year's doubling of the main index, blue chips like Telebras, the government-controlled telecom company, are still quoted at near or below book value. Another indication of the market's potential is that at the end of last year the market capitalisation of Brazilian stocks was 23 per cent of gross domestic product compared with 56 per cent for Mexico, according to investment bank CS First Boston. Less optimistic analysts argue the opposite. Ms Cristina Vervloet, a director at brokers Socimer do Brasil, is pessimistic about prospects for the market this year. She highlights recent political impasses, including a congressional review of the constitution, which has made little progress. The review could open up government monopolies in the telecommunications and oil sectors as well as reform the tax and welfare systems and enable the government to have more control over spending. It is regarded as essential if the inflation rate is to be kept down. 'Despite the Brady deal, the economy remains unstable and there is a lot of uncertainty,' says Ms Vervloet. She agrees that the market will be bullish if Mr Cardoso looks likely to become president and win the congressional support needed to push through structural reforms and consolidate the plan. Ms Vervloet is also worried that the new currency will be introduced by the government too early and therefore jeopardise the plan's prospects. Even with inflation of about 2,500 per cent last year, the capital markets boomed. This was caused by increased foreign investment, optimism at the appointment of Mr Cardoso as finance minister and recovery from the political turbulence caused by the resignation of former president Fernando Collor in 1992. Net foreign inflow was Dollars 5.5bn, four times more than in 1992, while Eurobond issues totalled Dollars 7.6bn compared with Dollars 4.8bn in 1992. Bankers do not expect a higher volume of Eurobond issues this year because of the market situation combined with local volatility in the run-up to elections. There is uncertainty about when, and by how much, the interest rate spreads paid by Brazilian issuers will fall. Currently, Brazilian companies pay on average about 400 basis points above the relevant US Treasury security, compared with about 300 points for Argentine issuers and 200 for Mexican companies, according to Mr Jose Eduardo Martins, a director at investment bank Patrimonio . . However, Telebras is planning an ambitious eight-year bond issue at an interest rate spread of below 300 basis points in response to the Brady deal. The success of the issue, which still has to be officially approved by the Treasury, will indicate whether Brazilian bond spreads are set to fall significantly this year. Mr Jose Luiz Lima, head of sales and distribution at Dutch-owned ING Bank's Brazilian subsidiary, believes Telebras is over-optimistic in proposing such a low interest rate spread under current market conditions. In spite of the problems that have hit emerging markets recently, there has been a growing international acceptance of Brazilian securities that is allowing an increasing number of companies to consider launches of American depositary receipts. Mr Martins says that extremely high local interest rates and the comparatively expensive cost of Eurobond issues has prompted companies to consider inter-national equity offerings.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                             31/3/94 Week on week change                                             Dollars Stock                           Country      close     Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Daewoo Heavy Industries         S.

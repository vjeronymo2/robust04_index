			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Books: Behind the man from nowhere THE QUIET RISE OF JOHN MAJOR by Edward Pearce Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 14.99, 177 pages THIS IS the first quick-fire interim biography of Mr John Major to have appeared on my desk for review. Two more are due out this spring. Mr Pearce and/or his publishers are to be congratulated for working so fast. They may have scooped the pool, for in truth there is not so much to say about the subject that one book any longer than this short one is needed, let alone three. Even recapitulations of the events surrounding the fall of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, in which one of the expected new tomes aims to excel, are becoming a drag on the market. Enough is enough. Mr Major may become a good prime minister, possibly an excellent one, but it is far too early to say. For the moment he is the quintessence of ordinariness made momentarily interesting by his sudden emergence in the top political job. That is all. Thus limited in what he can hope to achieve, Mr Pearce has done better than you might expect. He writes well; he is therefore an agreeable read. His little excursions about the nature of preferment inside the Conservative party, or the true function of the whips' office, are both necessary to an understanding his subject and a possibly useful addition to the reader's store of knowledge. As might be expected, there is not one drop of Kitty Kelley vitriol in these pages. Indeed, there are no seriously adverse comments upon Mr Major. Mr Pearce's tone is too matter-of-fact to be derided as hagiography; against that it lacks the overlay of informed criticism necessary to a rounded picture. Perhaps a posthumous biography will provide one. For now, the basic facts will have to do. Most of them are familiar. Mr Major is rare if not unique among British prime ministers in the degree of economic hardship he endured as a child. He really knows unemployment from the perspective of the dole queue. He has brains, talent, and drive, although in the case of the first two qualities, not necessarily in excess. Mr Pearce suggests that had the prime minister's lower middle-class family not fallen upon hard times he might have made it to Oxbridge; as it is he is an autodidact with a retentive memory and a quick grasp of new material put before him. His outstanding quality, whose origins are unclear, is his ability to get along with people, to be liked even by his political and other opponents. A Lambeth housing director, the late Harry Simpson, was an early mentor and tutor in the ways of winning friends and influencing the opposition. Mr Major is quoted as saying that 'he would take people who were totally opposed to his view, he would analyse their outlook, and the first thing he did was to understand their argument and why they made it. From that perspective you can dismantle it unless of course you get a better understanding and realize they may be right.' The prime minister's predecessor did not attend the Simpson school of public service, but then perhaps she might not have achieved as much as she did if she had. Combined with a willingness to master the detail of briefs, Mr Major's studied emollience worked well. It enabled an extremely ambitious politician, who was not averse to using all the normal political tricks, to rise from nowhere four years ago to prime minister today. Of the two important posts Mr Major held along the way, Mr Pearce is defensive about the brief spell as foreign secretary and rather at sea about the year as chancellor of the exchequer. As to the question, what is the real Mr Major like, this book gives the answer, which is that there is no answer. Even the prime minister cannot know it. Fate has only just picked up the clay. It is kneading it, taking its time in shaping it. We will know what the prime minister is like when office has fully formed him.</p>

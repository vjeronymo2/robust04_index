			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Trade in specimens of species transferred to Appendix II subject to annual export quotas: This refers to species of crocodilians listed in Appendix I, which have populations that have been transferred to Appendix II pursuant to annual export quotas, which are voted upon by the Conference of the Parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Trade in rhinoceros products:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This refers to the illegal trade in rhino horn, principally for the Asian medicinal market. The problem has been discussed at the last two Standing Committee meetings, will be discussed at the March 21&hyph;25 Standing Committee meeting (SC31) and is expected to be an issue of particular concern to the Parties and a subject of discussion at COP9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Trade in tiger products:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This refers to the illegal trade in tiger parts and products, principally for the Asian medicinal market. The problem has been discussed at the last two Standing Committee meetings, will be discussed at the March 21&hyph;25 Standing Committee meeting (SC31) and is expected to be an issue of particular concern to the Parties and a subject of discussion at COP9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Proposed new criteria for listing species on the Appendices:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At COP8 in Kyoto, the Standing Committee was instructed to examine the current criteria used in listing species on the Appendices. A Joint Committee Meeting of the Animals, Plants, and Standing Committees met in Brussels, in September 1993, and drafted a resolution for possible revision of the current CITES listing criteria (Resolutions 1.1 and 1.2, the so-called ``Berne Criteria''), based on a document prepared for the Parties by IUCN, the World Conservation Union. At SC31, The Standing Committee will review comments received from the Parties and possibly complete a revised draft resolution for the consideration of the Parties at COP9. Extensive discussion of this revised draft resolution, and the entire issue of criteria for listing species in the Appendices, will take place at COP9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Trade in birds:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The trade in live wild-caught birds is an issue of great concern to both the United States and the CITES Parties, in that the trade in many species of birds listed in Appendix II may be detrimental to their survival. The U.S. now prohibits the import into the U.S. of birds listed on CITES Appendix II unless the Secretary of the Interior finds that such trade will not endanger the survival of the species, based on the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992. The Service is not certain whether this item will be placed on the agenda by any Party.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Trade in crocodilian products:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This refers to work by the Animals Committee to institute a system of universal marking for all crocodilian skins in trade, as a response to serious problems of illegal trade in crocodilian skins, parts, and products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Trade in plant specimens:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nursery registration for artificially propagated Appendix I species, among other issues relating to plant species, will most likely be discussed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Significant trade in Appendix II species:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This refers to the trade in those Appendix II species identified as subject to significant trade, for which insufficient biological information exists to warrant trade at current levels. Resolution Conf. 8.9 dealt with this topic, and established a procedure for review of the status of significantly traded species, and the implementation of Article IV of the Convention by the exporting countries involved. It is anticipated that this topic will be placed on the agenda for COP9 as well.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Standardization of CITES permits and certificates:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This refers to the development of harmonized CITES permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Transport of live specimens:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This refers to a report by the Working Group on Transport of Live Specimens, which is chaired by the U.S. Office of Management Authority. The Transport Working Group met in 1993 in Senegal to assess the implementation of requirements in the CITES treaty that live animals be prepared without injury, damage to health, or cruel treatment. One or more Parties that have been active in the Working Group may propose a resolution for the Conference of the Parties dealing with species subject to high mortality rates in transport.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> XIV.

Closing remarks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Announcement of Public Meeting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To discuss with the public the upcoming thirty-first meeting of the Standing Committee and discuss issues to be considered at COP9, the Service announces that it will hold a public meeting on February 22, 1994, from 2-4 p.m. in room 7000 of the Department of the Interior building, 18th &amp; C Streets NW., Washington, DC . Persons wishing directions to the public meeting or additional information should contact the Office of Management Authority in writing (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , above) or at (703) 358&hyph;2093.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Information and Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service invites information and comments on the COP9 possible agenda items discussed above and possible resolutions the U.S. may wish to submit, excluding item XIV, ``Consideration of proposals for amendment of Appendices I and II''. A separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice has been published on these items on July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38112), which requested information from the public on animal or plant species that should be considered by the U.S. as possible amendments to the Appendices. Item XIV will be the subject of two more separate notices. Information and comments should be submitted to the Service no later than March 1, 1994 to be ensured of consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Observers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Article XI, paragraph 7 of the Convention provides:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any body or agency technically qualified in protection, conservation or management of wild fauna and flora, in the following categories, which has informed the Secretariat of its desire to be represented at meetings of the Conference by observers, shall be admitted unless at least one-third of the Parties object:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / S African jobless figure reaches 46% says central bank SOUTH AFRICA'S four year recession has left nearly half the economically active population without work in the formal economy, according to the annual economic report of the South African Reserve Bank (central bank), published yesterday. The Reserve Bank said 46 per cent of the labour force were either unemployed or involved in the 'informal sector', which involves very low-paid activities such as street hawking. It was the first accurate official estimate of national unemployment, which the Reserve Bank said had risen from 39 per cent in 1988. Private sector economists say previous official figures underestimated unemployment and underemployment. Per capita income figures have also suffered, with annualised income per capita, at R3,200 (Pounds 630) in 1985 prices, no better than the level reached in 1971. GNP per capita in the second quarter of this year was 13.5 per cent lower in real terms than when it peaked in 1988. After having declined consistently since the fourth quarter of 1989, economic output rose sharply in the first half of 1993, leading the Reserve Bank to conclude that economic activity had finally levelled off. This did not, however, indicate the resumption of significant growth, despite the fact that GDP grew by 5.1 per cent in the second quarter and 1.4 per cent in the first quarter. The improvement was attributable almost entirely to increased agricultural production, with non-agricultural sectors stagnant in the first half of the year. Business cycle indicators were 'not yet showing any clear signs of an imminent upturn in economic activity', the bank said. The bank noted that labour productivity in the non-agricultural sectors had increased at a rate substantially higher than in the past; however this reflected less a strong commitment to work than a more rapid rate of retrenchments. Growth in productivity continued to fall below pay growth, so real unit labour costs continued to increase. But inflation appeared to be coming under control, with the consumer price index falling from 16.8 per cent in October 1991 to 10 per cent in June 1993, despite a 4 percentage point rise in value added tax in April. The bank also listed factors which could lead to improved economic conditions for the rest of this year and next year, including a gradual recovery in the world's main industrial economies, the impact of several large domestic investment projects and the low level of inventories which could be expected to lead to restocking.</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Question over Alpine funds ABOUT Pounds 50,000 of pension money contributed by employees of Alpine (Double Glazing) is in a solicitor's account, the receiver to the UK windows company said yesterday, although it is unclear who has rights to the funds. The money is believed to have been deposited at the end of May with Beveridge Ross and Prevezers, a firm of London solicitors. The firm was involved in the initial purchase of Alpine out of administration in February 1992. The status of the account is not yet clear to the receiver, Mr Grant Jones of City accountants Morison Stoneham. He is unsure whether the monies are being held in trust for employees or whether the funds have been deposited in a client account. It is believed that a trust account was set up. However, the monies may be found to belong to the company rather than employees. The solicitors yesterday refused to comment due to client confidentiality. It is also unclear how much money was deducted from employees' salaries in the 14 months since the new owners took over. At least one employee, who held a senior position, claims he is owed Pounds 7,800 including the company's contribution. Alpine employed some 250 people around the country, about 100 of whom are believed to have had payments deducted from salaries. Mr Jones, appointed receiver on Friday, said yesterday he was investigating the status of the account. Separately, questions have emerged over the claim to many of Alpine's assets by Finchfleet, a Bahamas-registered, but Channel Islands-based company. It appears that in March 1992, when Finchfleet claims it had reached agreement with Alpine to take over ownership of the company's plant, machinery and office equipment, a third party had a charge over Alpine's assets. The original administrator, who sold the business to a group backed by Midlands entrepreneur Mr Clive Smith, had a charge over the assets until the final purchase payment was made in August 1992. Finchfleet had been the corporate vehicle originally suggested by BR&amp;P to purchase the Alpine business for buyers represented by Mr Robert Pollock, Alpine's current chairman. However, as there were difficulties in securing a charge over an offshore company, it was rejected by the administrators. The receiver said yesterday he was also investigating the documentation surrounding Finchfleet's claim.</p>

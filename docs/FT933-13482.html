			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Letter: Price for water must be paid Sir, You leader, 'The value of clean water' (July 14), is both one-sided and myopic. It is one-sided for looking at the question of value in strictly limited financial terms. Although the FT is a financial paper, it is still taking too much liberty in assuming that all of its readers are no more than financial zombies. To some, probably many, questions of 'cost' and 'price' are woefully one-dimensional. They also pale into insignificance when addressed in context - ie, without ignoring such questions as our health and that of future genera-tions. It is myopic for missing the opportunity to put the priorities right. The 'huge sums involved' in bringing our water up to par with the rest of the EC is surely the price we pay for neglecting its upkeep for so long. You don't have to be a financial genius to know that it is a matter of time before the price has to be paid. Why put our health and that of our children to more unknown risks by postponing further the unavoidable? For a postponement of the inevitable, in the form of longer time to meet the directives, is all we are likely to get. And while we're 'renegotiating' EC directives the price in terms of our health keeps mounting. A R T Kemasang, 50 Keswick Road, London SW15 2JE</p>

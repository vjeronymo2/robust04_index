			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by a Defense Ministry "official source"; place </F> and date not given]    [Text] With support and help from God, the heroes of our  valiant Armed Forces continued their confrontation of the forces  of apostasy and secession in various axes and sectors and foiled  all the hostile, treacherous goals of the criminal secessionist  elements in the Socialist Party leadership and inflicted on them  heavy losses in weapons, equipment, and vehicles and forced the  deceived units to flee and surrender.    In the al-Dali' sector, the forces managed to proceed with  steady steps forward. Our valiant, proud Armed Forces were able  to return the center of Musaymir in Lahij Governorate to  constitutional legitimacy.    On the Abyan-Aden axis, the forces of unity, democracy, and  constitutional legitimacy were able to score tangible progress  and chased the forces of the secessionist rebellious elements in  the Aden garrison and forced them to retreat after inflicting  heavy losses on them.    In the al-Mahfid District, units from the valiant Armed  Forces were able to attack the forces of apostasy and secession  from the Taysir Brigade and from the command of the Central Axis  and seized 18 tanks, four 130-mm armored vehicles, one 122 [mm]  Howitzer, one 85-mm gun as well as quantities of military  ammunition and vehicles.    The forces of apostasy and secession from the Taysir Brigade  and from the command of the Central Axis retreated to  (al-Naqabah) in the Shabwah Governorate. This prompts us in  this statement to underline the call of tolerance, sincere  brotherhood, and the single affiliation to all comrades in arms  in the military units that are still under the hegemony and  tyranny of the secessionist, rebellious forces. We urge them to  benefit from all the clear practical lessons that have taken  place and are taking place in the fields of confrontation  between the forces of evil, rebellion, and secession -- which  ignited the war to serve their own selfish and detestable,  suppressive party ambitions in order to fragment the homeland  and rebel against constitutional legitimacy -- and the forces of  good, right, and peace which rushed to defend unity and  democracy and to protect the national sanctities, at the top of  which is constitutional legitimacy, and to ensure respect for  the Constitution, law, and the constitutional institutions,  since this is a sacred duty that must be fulfilled by every  soldier, noncommissioned officer [NCO], and officer of the armed  and security forces; and by every citizen in any position. This  makes us pin hopes on all the soldiers, NCO's, and officers, who  are more able to reject the orders of the secessionist elements  and return to the trenches of legitimacy and defend Yemeni unity  because so doing is much easier than making themselves and their  colleague face death and defeat. He who stands against the  people's will, brings a rebellious force against the unity of  the homeland, or seeks to fragment it and the defenseless  citizens will be a loser.    O ye who believe; if you will aid the cause of God, he will  aid you, and plant your feet firmly. [Koranic verse]</p>

			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Sure-fire winner that went astray: The shooting of a terrorist has exposed panic in the Kohl administration The carefully planned anti-terrorist operation around the little railway station of Bad Kleinen, on the shores of Lake Schwerin in north-eastern Germany, should have been a public relations triumph for the law-and-order platform of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The capture of two left-wing terrorists, wanted for murder and attempted murder and on the run for the past 10 years, was just the sort of coup needed to revive public confidence in an ailing administration. What happened in a blaze of gunfire on the stairs and platforms of the rural railway station has turned instead into a potential new political disaster for Mr Kohl and his coalition colleagues. It has already claimed the heads of Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister and a close confidant of the chancellor, and of Mr Alexander von Stahl, the federal prosecutor. More heads in the security services are confidently expected to roll. And yet there is still no clear picture of precisely what happened at Bad Kleinen 12 days ago, when more than 50 crack anti-terrorist police surrounded the station cafe where Mr Wolfgang Grams and Ms Birgit Hogefeld, both members of the Red Army Faction, were sitting down to a meal of sausages and toasted Camembert. All that is clear is that Ms Hogefeld was arrested, and Mr Grams was shot dead in a furious gun battle with the police; one young policeman also died, shot through the heart. But the suspicion has emerged that Grams may have been shot in cold blood, when lying unarmed and wounded on the railway tracks. 'That is a very serious allegation in Germany,' according to one parliamentary expert on security matters. 'This is not the US. Ordinary people are horrified, even if they abhor the Red Army faction.' What has also emerged is a picture of muddle and panic at the heart of the Kohl administration, and incoherence and confusion between the multiple arms of the security services. It is not so much what happened, but the failure to tell how it happened, that has caused the political backlash. So far the only person to emerge with any distinction has been Mr Seiters himself, even though he resigned from office last Sunday without any apparent reason for doing so. Moreover, he seems to have triggered a probable domino-effect of resignations and dismissals, which could shatter the leadership of Germany's security services. And yet his resignation is praised on all sides of the political spectrum as honourable and desirable. To the outside world, at least, it must all seem confusing. Inside Germany, as usual, the only man who appears entirely unruffled is Mr Kohl himself. He stayed in the country just long enough to appoint a new interior minister, and then flew off to the Group of Seven summit in Tokyo. The Bad Kleinen affair looks like yet another example of a self-inflicted political scandal, suggesting a real crisis of leadership in the government, underlining the bickering and gloom within the coalition, the absence of a self-confident opposition, and the lack of co-ordination in key areas of the administration. Mr Seiters is the ninth minister to resign, or be dismissed, from the coalition cabinet since the beginning of last year. The opposition Social Democrats can scarcely gloat. They have lost their erstwhile leader, Mr Bjorn Engholm, leaving their electoral hopes in disarray. Their fortunes are now pinned on the untried, and largely unknown, figure of Mr Rudolf Scharping, the 45-year-old state premier of the Rhineland-Palatinate. Bad Kleinen could yet be the gift from the gods which Mr Scharping urgently needs to revive his party's fortunes, and demonstrate the incompetence of Mr Kohl's government. But until the facts are known, even that much is unclear. The problem is that far too many security organisations seem to have had a hand in the operation. The informer who tipped them off worked for the internal security service, the prosecutor ordered the arrests, the federal police were in charge of the operation and used the GSG-9 anti-terrorist unit - part of the border police - to do it. All are responsible to different masters. 'The very system was designed to be a bit inefficient, thanks to memories of the Gestapo and Nazi centralised rule,' according to one foreign observer. 'What we have seen is that it more or less lives up to expectations.' The fact that Mr Seiters quit is seen as a personal vote of no confidence in Mr Kohl and his cabinet, rather than a necessary sacrifice. 'He was tired of the bickering, and his heart was not in the battle,' according to one senior official. And yet Mr Kohl has managed to use Mr Seiters' resignation to advantage. He has brought into the government a stern advocate of law and order, Mr Manfred Kanther, leader of his Christian Democratic Union in Hesse, who could well bolster the platform in next year's elections. Mr Kanther is no shrinking violet. He has been a sharp critic of the chaos in Bonn, while sitting out in the provinces. Mr Kohl is seeking to exploit his reputation as a staunch member of the party's 'conservative-nationalist' wing and silence a potential critic. It is the sort of political trick at which the chancellor is a past master. Yet time is running out for political tricks. Mr Kohl desperately needs to prove that he heads an administration capable of coherent government - and ensuring law and order. That is precisely what the events at Bad Kleinen have undermined.</p>

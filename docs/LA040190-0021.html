			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> HANDMADE;  </P> <P> WIND-MUSIC MAN  </P> <P> WHEN THEIR AIRBORNE melodies blend with the breezes, aluminum-pipe wind chimes  have a particularly exotic appeal. They drum up visions of sailboats sliding  into the waves, the sound of metal against mast.  </P> <P> The shorter ones, 30 inches long, have a light, sweet resonance. As the pipes  grow longer, the sound becomes louder and deeper. When they reach 64 inches in  length, they sound like cathedral bells.  </P> <P> Wesley Picotte is the one-man master behind Picotte Wind Chimes of Santa  Barbara. A former furniture and clock maker, he now devotes himself full time  to making chimes. A purist, Picotte uses only clear-heart redwood for the round  disk from which he hangs his brushed-metal pipes. The wood is weather-treated  and holes are grommetted to avoid the chafing of the nylon cord. You will not  find any anodized aluminum on these wind chimes; according to Picotte, it  spoils the sound.  </P> <P> The chimes are available in four sizes -- from 30 to 64 inches in length --  prices range from $25 to $95, and each comes with a lifetime guarantee. Picotte  carefully tunes his chimes to a five-tone, pentatonic scale borrowed from Asian  music.  </P> <P>  Picotte Wind Chimes, 16 San Marcos Trout Club, Santa Barbara; (805) 683-2763.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Brigadier Yahya </F> al-Mutawakkil by unidentified correspondent in Sanaa; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [AL-HAYAH] What is the latest in the Yemeni  crisis?    [Al-Mutawakkil] It seems clear that the Yemeni crisis is  fabricated, and we have been dragged into it. It seems that  there is a plan to drag us -- through the crisis -- into a long  war of attrition and civil war. The aims are now clear -- to  fragment and exhaust Yemen through this war, which will destroy  everything.    However, I am optimistic that the Yemenis will realize their  interests and the danger surrounding them. This is why the  voice of reason has begun to prevail among the brother unionists  in the Socialist Party and to respond to the appeal made by  brother President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih urging the repeal of the  secession and a return to dialogue. I expect the voice of  reason to trimph in the end. And the unionist leaders in the  Socialist Party will revoke the secession decision, which  amounts to treason. Let us begin a constructive dialogue to  spare us falling into the dangers into which we are being  dragged.    [AL-HAYAH] But you set four conditions for a dialogue with  the other side.    [Al-Mutawakkil] There are fundamental conditions which  cannot be abandoned. And there are conditions which can be  discussed. The fundamental conditions concern unity and  legitimacy -- two conditions which cannot be abandoned. The  brothers in the Socialist Party leadership must realize that we  cannot meet together before these two conditions are agreed. I  am confident that they are as interested in unity as we are, and  we must reach an agreement in this connection.    [AL-HAYAH] In your capacity as member of the three-men  committee entrusted with opening a dialogue with the other side,  what are the results of the contacts being made to open dialogue  channels?    [Al-Mutawakkil] Although we have not yet reached a clear  position regarding contacts between us and unionist leaders in  the Socialist Party, I am confident that we will reach a  positive result. The important thing is to initiate a dialogue  and establish contacts between us now. I am confident that we  will reach a positive result. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Do you prefer to reject the Security Council's  intervention and its resolution on the crisis, or do you prefer  that amendments be introduced to the proposals submitted to the  Security Council?    [Al-Mutawakkil] We would prefer the United Nations and the  Security Council not to deal with the Yemeni issue, because it  is an internal issue. Any attempt to deal with it in any way  means interference in our internal affairs in one way or  another. As far as we are concerned, we do not want the United  Nations to deal with our issue. However, if the Security  Council must deal with this issue, it has to be within the  premise that unity is fixed and incontestable. [passage omitted]    [AL-HAYAH] Some Arab states talk about the presence of  Afghan Arab mujahidin [Arabs who fought alongside Afghan  Mojahedin against Soviets], saying their task is to bolster  extremist fundamentalist movements, especially in Algeria and  Egypt. What is your opinion?    [Al-Mutawakkil] I categorically deny the presence of any  Arab mujahidin in Yemen. With regard to Islamists, we are all  Muslims. As for the presence of Yemeni Islamic political leaders  in Yemen, this is legal for them and others. But there are no  Arab and Islamic political parties on the scene. Nor is there  any consolidation of an Islamic or political tendency as rumored  by Yemen's enemies.</p>

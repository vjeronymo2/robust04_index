			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vadim Markushin report: "Do Not Create a New Cordon </F> Sanitaire"]    [Text] The decision by the Berlin Senat to hold a  ceremonial send-off for the Russian motorized infantry brigade  separately from the other foreign contingents which are leaving  Berlin this year has been seen as political. In the same breath  people are saying that it was dictated by the expectations of  West Berliners, who retain feelings of gratitude to the  countries which supported the city materially at the height of  the Cold War.    Just who in particular "expects" this is impossible to  determine, of course. It all reminds you of the well-worn  cliche: "The general opinion is that...."    Meanwhile, questions are being asked. Why, for example, has  a decision on such an important matter, which should certainly  not be "kept within the family," been made by the Berlin  authorities? Why was the decision not made by representatives  of the governments of the countries of the former anti-Hitler  coalition in conjunction with the German Federal Government?  Why are attempts being made to split reunited Berlin again by  artificially resurrecting these old antagonisms? After all,  whatever reservations may surround the aforementioned "policy  decision," it is basically a discriminatory measure against our  victorious army, our country, and our people.    This is how things look: At the time when the vast machinery  involved in withdrawing the Western Group of Forces had only  just begun to roll and nothing but hard work could be seen on  the road ahead, Russian servicemen were buoyed up by speeches  about a new era and a new partnership. Now, however, when all  that was needed was a kind and sincere word of farewell, they  are having to look awkwardly over their shoulders and scrutinize  those gloomy times in search of reasons to justify their own  inconsistency.    And all this at a time when a joint ceremonial send-off  would  appear to offer the most natural ground for strengthening the  partnership, mutual liking, and personal contacts that are being  established. A failure to take advantage of this event just to  pander to someone's nearsightedness and capriciousness would be  unpardonable.</p>

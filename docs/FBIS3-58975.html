			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has declared that Turkey  would like the countries in the Middle East to expend their  energy and resources for the economic development of their  peoples and to solve their problems through constructive  dialogue.    Demirel hosted a dinner in honor of Israeli President Ever  Weizman. In a dinner toast, Demirel welcomed the beginning of  the Middle East peace process. He explained that the courageous  steps taken by Israel and the Palestinians last year enabled  Turkey to transport its efforts for cooperation and peace  southward. The existing desire to perpetuate peace will be  reflected widely and positively in the world, Demirel stressed.    Recalling that the relations between the Turkish and Jewish  people began a long time ago, Demirel noted that Turkish  citizens of Jewish origin contribute significantly to the  country and its cultural heritage.    In his speech, Weizman said that he came to Turkey, knowing  that it is a country with an influential role in the future  course of the Middle East. Underlining that Turkey has always  contributed to peace, Weizman remarked: The leaders and people  of the Middle East should embrace Kemal Ataturk's motto of peace  at home and peace in the world.    There are many factors that connect the two nations and the  two countries, Weizman recounted, adding that Israel will never  forget that the Jews were accepted by the Ottoman Empire when  they were expelled from various European countries some 500  years ago. Weizman pointed out that thousands of Arabs and Jews  were killed in the wars waged before it was understood that  Israel's existence in the region is a living reality. He added  that the agreement with the Palestinians constitutes the  beginning of a change in the region.</p>

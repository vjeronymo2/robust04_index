			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Reshuffle leaves City in the dark AFTER the high political drama of the previous day, financial market dealers packed up for the holiday weekend last night amid uncertainty as to what Mr Kenneth Clarke's appointment as chancellor would mean for trading in sterling, equities and government bonds. Questions about future government policy have led to a sharp weakening of sterling on the foreign exchanges. In the 1 1/2 trading days since Mr Clarke became chancellor no clear consensus has emerged from the markets on what his policy will be on inflation, the value of sterling or the state of the public finances. 'We are really in the dark about Mr Clarke,' said Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros Bank in London. 'Unlike the last three chancellors he has never been in the Treasury before and his real views are still a mystery.' The main impetus for sterling's weakness has been renewed strength of the D-Mark amid fresh tensions in the European exchange rate mechanism and a belief that German interest rate cuts are on hold. On top of this the change of chancellor has, as one dealer said yesterday, left sterling looking rudderless. The pound closed down 3 pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday at DM2.4775. That left it more than 4 pfennigs weaker than it had been on Wednesday night. Gilt prices have also suffered, falling a point yesterday amid concerns that Mr Clarke could take a softer line on UK monetary policy and public finances. But UK share prices have barely moved since his appointment, with the FT-SE 100 index of leading industrial shares closing last night down 14.6 points at 2,840.7 amid weakness in US stocks. Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at stockbrokers James Capel in London, believes the prevailing view in markets towards the impact of the reshuffle at the moment is 'suck it and see'. 'Lamont's departure and Clarke's arrival are unlikely to result in any broad change in the direction of UK economic policy,' he said. 'Besides, the markets had assumed that Lamont would be going a long time ago, the only issue was when.' However, some believe Mr Clarke is more likely to cut UK base rates from their current levels than Mr Lamont was. 'This fellow is more of a politician than anything else,' said Mr Mark Brett, an economist at BZW in London. 'I would have thought there was more chance of a rate cut under Mr Clarke, to keep political momentum going.' However, Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at investment bank SG Warburg, believes Mr Clarke will not be as easy on the public sector borrowing requirement as he might like to be. Mr Gardiner believes one of the most important decisions made by Mr John Major, the prime minister, this week was to retain Mr Michael Portillo as chief secretary to the Treasury. 'He has been confirmed in that post and will continue to be very tough on public spending,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The United States is expected to put greater  pressure on Korea to open its financial market wider and provide  national treatment to U.S. financial institutions operating in  Korea when the U.S. Congress passes a bill on financial services  and fair trade.    U.S. delegates to recent bilateral talks on financial policy  told their Korean counterparts that the U.S. Congress is  expected to approve the Riegle bill "relatively soon," the  Korean Ministry of Finance said yesterday.    The bill would allow the U.S. government to retaliate  against  nations that it regards as discriminating against U.S. financial  institutions operating in that country when they fail to reach  an accord on remedial measures after negotiations.    As signatories to the Uruguay Round accord on international  trade, Korea and the United States are set to start negotiations  on financial services six months after the accord takes effect  next year.    The Korean Ministry of Finance said it suspects the United  States would use the legislation as a tool to open up the Korean  and other financial markets at post-Uruguay Round talks on  financial services.    At the financial policy talks held in Washington Tuesday,  the  ministry said, the U.S. delegates demanded U.S. financial  institutions operating in Korea be allowed to raise more funds  in the Korean currency.    The Korean delegates told their U.S. counterparts that  measures to be taken by the Korean government soon will make it  easier for foreign financial institutions to raise funds in won.    Korea is set to reduce the minimum face value of negotiable  certificates of deposit (CDs), ensure their maturities are  flexible in a few months and advance financial liberalization  programs contained in the third-phase plan for interest-rate  deregulation.    The Korean delegates, headed by Assistant Finance Minister  Im  Chang-yul, said Korea will keep its promise to raise the 10  percent ceiling on equity ownership of stock by foreigners  during the second half of this year or next year.    Led By Assistant Treasury Secretary Jeffrey Shafer, the U.S.  team asked the Korean government not to discriminate against  U.S. business concerns when it allows Korean companies to set up  auto sales financing companies.    The Korean delegates complained that redundant and frequent  inspections by U.S. regulatory agencies hamper the business of  Korean banks operating in the United States.    They also demanded Korean banks be permitted to advance into  an area in Chicago where Korean-American residents are  concentrated. The opening of branches by Korean banks in Chicago  is now restricted to one area -- the Loop Zone, the Korean  Ministry of Finance said.</p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: China's cotton supply crisis deepens China's cotton production will fall well short of demand this year, according to a recent survey conducted by the country's State Statistical Bureau. The shortfall seems likely to exacerbate chronic supply problems at Chinese mills. The bureau, which surveyed China's nine main cotton producing areas, concluded that the area planted this year was between 5.26m and 5.55m hectares. A western agricultural attache said 5.3m ha would yield about between 4.6m ant 4.7m tonnes, 10 per cent less than the country's domestic requirement. But he also said it was difficult to forecast China's imports, which might be as high as 400,000 tonnes, without details of the extent and condition of its stockpile. China's cotton sector was plunged into crisis earlier in the year with textile mills throughout the country starved of supplies. An increase in the international price, stockpiling by local authorities and corruption in the state supply system worsened the problem. Dozens of mills were forced to reduce output or stop production altogether, causing lay-offs of thousands of employees. Chinese media this week reported a fall of 34 per cent in state purchases of cotton in the first quarter, indicating continuing supply problems. Chinese farmers in the northern regions, which account for the bulk of production, are also facing a threat from the boll worm infestation that has wrecked crops in the past few years. China's cotton harvest slumped from 5.6m tonnes in 1991 to 3.7m tonnes last year, partly because the boll worm has developed resistance to pesticides. Cotton mills have been facing dual problems of lack of supply and poor quality cotton, some of which has been adulterated deliberately to increase its weight, according to Chinese media. Newspapers reported recently that to secure a higher price suppliers, including state companies, had added to cotton bails bricks, stones, oil, rice waste, sand, husks, glass and iron chips. The Economic Daily said that a nation-wide inspection programme in March found that only 55.26 per cent of cotton was usable, down from 78.46 per cent a year earlier. Mr Huang Jin, head of the agriculture service department in the Ministry of Internal Trade said the cotton market had become extremely disorderly, characterised by panic buying, hoarding and rampant speculation, according to a Reuters despatch. Cotton is the one commodity whose supply and price is still controlled, but the chaos in the market indicates that state control is unravelling. Customs figures for the first six months this year showed that imports reached 100,000 tonnes, a 14.8 per cent rise over the same period last year.</p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CANDIDATES MARK EACH OTHER OFF FOR VOCABULARY;  </P> <P> ELECTIONS: RIVALS FOR A SAN DIEGO SCHOOL BOARD SEAT HAVE FOCUSED THEIR BATTLE  ON THE WORDING OF THEIR CAMPAIGN STATEMENTS.  </P> <P> Is Scott Harvey a lobbyist and not an educator? Is John de Beck a paid union  agent instead of a schoolteacher?  </P> <P> The Battle of the Campaign Statements heated up Thursday between the two  finalists for San Diego city schools board Seat C -- representing Point Loma,  Linda Vista and downtown -- with a series of charges and countercharges between  De Beck and Harvey.  </P> <P> The head of the San Diego Teachers Assn., whose political action committee  pumped more than $15,000 into its support of De Beck during the June primary,  charged Thursday that Harvey lied on the campaign statement he submitted for  the sample ballot booklet that voters will receive before the November general  election.  </P> <P> Harvey, who on the primary ballot identified himself as a businessman, has  changed his occupation to "educator and public policy analyst and  parent/community leader."  </P> <P> "On his ballot description, Scott Harvey, a lifelong lobbyist, identifies  himself as an 'educator,' " said Hugh Boyle, president of the teachers union.  "As a lifelong teacher . . . I strongly object to the casual use of the term  educator by Mr. Harvey. If I bang some nails at home, am I a carpenter? If I  change a light bulb, am I an electrician?"  </P> <P> "Does he face 35 students all day in an elementary classroom, or 175 students  in a high school or middle school each day?" asked Boyle, who has filed a  written request with Registrar of Voters Conny McCormack to disallow Harvey's  claim as misleading and inaccurate under provisions of the election law.  </P> <P> De Beck chipped in with his own criticism, accusing Harvey "of false and  misleading" statements.  </P> <P> "Mr. Harvey must be ashamed of his occupation," said De Beck, who retired in  June from Garfield continuation high school after 37 years as a teacher and  counselor in the San Diego Unified School District. "When he calls himself an  educator, that really was an insult to all of us who worked hard to attain  credentials to teach, counsel and administer public education this state."  </P> <P> De Beck asked why Harvey dropped the lobbyist designation that was part of his  primary ballot statement and switched to public policy specialist and educator.  </P> <P> "If my opponent is careless with the truth about his occupation, then the  voters must be cautious about his other statements," De Beck said, defending  his deviation from educational issues of overcrowding, curriculum reform and  student health.  </P> <P> Harvey fired back strongly Thursday, defending his use of educator by saying he  has frequently given talks in classrooms as an invited speaker and taught a  course at National University. He said Boyle's action shows that his opponent  is a stalking horse for an attempt by the teachers union to gain a seat on the  five-member board of trustees.  </P> <P> "I don't think you have to belong to the San Diego Teachers Assn. to be an  educator," said Harvey, a former intergovernmental affairs specialist for the  city of San Diego before going into private consulting and lobbying. "I have  spent 18 years of my life educating -- I have been invited into classrooms  individually to be part of panels, to talk about the structure of government,  about government finance.  </P> <P> "I have taught a graduate course at National University and have lectured there  frequently. I am already lined up to talk at Clairemont and Castle Park high  schools this fall."  </P> <P> Harvey said his use of the term does not imply that he is a full-time teacher.  "In that case, I would have used the word teacher," he said. Although educator  is a change from his primary booklet statement, Harvey said, it is more  accurate. "I am so much more than (a lobbyist). . . . My statement was changed  to present a more complete picture of myself and reflect the breadth of my  experiences."  </P> <P> Harvey also attacked De Beck's ties with the teachers union in his statement,  which says, "Don't let labor unions set school policy!" in bold lettering and  calls De Beck "a former union agent whose campaign is paid for by a union  political committee."  </P> <P> "That reflects the fact that he sat as a union negotiator across the table from  the (board of trustees) for many years" in salary negotiations, Harvey said. "I  question whether it is proper to have a union person on both sides of the  table."  </P> <P> Harvey said he will file his own written appeal to McCormack asking that De  Beck be required to add the word retired in front of his statement calling  himself a schoolteacher.  </P> <P> "That's OK with me," De Beck said.  </P> <P> As to the PAC support, De Beck said he has no regrets over accepting it.  </P> <P> "Even if you add its $15,000 to the $7,890 I raised (through his own  committee), that is less than what Harvey spent ($24,000) to get 26.5% of the  primary vote, compared to my 61%." (School board candidates run only in their  districts during the primary. The two top vote-getters run citywide in  November.)  </P></p>

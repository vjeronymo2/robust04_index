			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Company News: Aker foresees job cuts in face of steep North Sea output fall AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, is gearing up for a large-scale restructuring of its oil and gas division, because it is faced with a steep fall in North Sea oil and gas activity, expected by 1995. Mr Tore Bergersen, president of the division, said that to adapt to future market conditions, a significant down-sizing operation might be necessary, with the possibility of up to 3,000 to 4,000 engineering and fabrication jobs being shed within the division, which currently has 11,000 employees. In 1991 the division achieved turnover of NKr7.9bn (Dollars 1.1bn), but by the first eight months of last year turnover had already reached NKr7.5bn. Aker is due to report 1992 results on March 4. The group's oil and gas technology division supplies engineering, equipment and fabrication work to the oil and gas industry. It comprises nine sub-divisions and has a current order book valued at NKr26bn. Norwegian Contractors, a core sub-division, will see turnover of NKr3.3bn in 1993, Mr Bergersen forecast. The figure is slightly lower than what is expected for 1992, but up from NKr2.3bn in 1991. The division will also have to adapt to more compact development projects, by building much smaller scale oil and gas platforms, so that existing North Sea oil and gas infrastructure can be utilised after production from these massive installations winds down, Mr Bergersen said. Another way the division will adapt to leaner times is by entering 'partnering' projects, an industry term describing projects which extend over several years to provide oil companies with a wide-range of maintenance, engineering and fabrication projects, mostly for existing platforms. Mr Bergersen said the division recently entered a partnering relationship with British Petroleum Norway which will endure for an unlimited time or as stipulated by BP. Another way in which Aker's oil and gas technology division will adapt is by taking on international projects. The first step was taken two years ago through the acquisition of Gulf Fabricators in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Houston-based Omega Marine. Aker believes it will benefit greatly in future from earlier relationships established with major international oil companies for which it has already engineered and built numerous platforms in the North Sea. As the majors expand oil and gas production worldwide, they will need the services which Aker can provide, particularly for high-technology deep water oil and gas projects. Aker also believes Norwegian oil companies Statoil, Saga Petroleum and Norsk Hydro will demand its services as they develop oil and gas reserves which they are hoping to discover in offshore regions such as south-east Asia and West Africa.</p>

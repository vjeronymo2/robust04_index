			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Sun Jie (1327 2638) ] </F>   [Text] Fuzhou, 28 Apr (XINHUA) -- A national meeting on  civil aviation security was held in Fuzhou today. Vice Premier  Zou Jiahua of the State Council wrote a letter to all delegates  attending the meeting, stressing that the civil aviation  institution should continue to adhere to the policy of "safety  first, precaution vital" and should step up civil aviation  security work.    Zou Jiahua pointed out in his letter: Civil aviation  security  is extremely important to upholding the nation's reputation,  ensuring the safety of state property and people's lives, and  advancing economic construction. Since the beginning of this  year, the civil aviation institution has endeavored to improve  management, and good progress has been made in work in all  areas. A string of effective measures also have been taken to  reinforce aviation security. Nevertheless, we must not be lax  for a moment. The civil aviation institution must continue to  conscientiously carry out the State Council's "Circular on  Strengthening Civil Aviation Security" and "Measures on Stepping  Up Anti-Aircraft-Hijacking Work," adhere to the policy of  "safety first, precaution vital," and step up aviation security  work.    In his speech at the meeting, Chen Guangyi, director-general  of the Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC], pointed  out: Ensuring safety is the primary task of the civil aviation  institution. Leaders at all levels and all workers engaging in  civil aviation security work should ensure civil aviation  security with a strong sense of being highly responsible to the  party and the people. Since last year, the CAAC has endeavored  to carry out the instructions and guidelines provided by the  party Central Committee and the State Council; issued a series  of regulations, decisions, orders, and circulars concerning  reinforcing civil aviation security; built up and improved the  training of the civil aviation security work force; increased  aviation security personnel; improved air safety facilities and  equipment; tightened security inspection; stepped up  precautionary work; and launched an anti-aircraft-hijiacking  struggle, and good results have been achieved.    Chen Gguangyi said: The civil aviation institution should  bear in mind that the whole institution is a single entity.  Personnel at all posts should work strictly according to  relevant laws, regulations, and orders. We should avert  aircraft hijacking if we can, absolutely assuring the safety of  the aircraft and passengers. All aircraft hijackers and  attempted hijackers should be severely punished according to  law. Major civil aviation leaders at all levels should  personally take charge of security work; assurance of civil  aviation security must be considered as important as assurance  of flight safety.    On the two sides of the Taiwan Strait joining forces in  cracking down on aircraft hijacking and on repatriating aircraft  hijackers to the mainland, Chen Guangyi pointed out: Illegal  hijacking of civil airliners poses a serious threat to the  safety of passengers' lives and property -- it is a grave crime.  Over the last two years, we have taken a series of tight  precautionary measures to prevent aircraft hijacking, and we ask  the Taiwan authorities to repatriate aircraft hijackers to the  mainland according to the "Jinmen Agreement" of September 1990.  In the spirit of being highly responsible for the safety of the  lives and property of passengers, including those of Taiwan  compatriots, and with the good wish of promoting cross-strait  exchange and economic cooperation, we hope the Taiwan  authorities will take positive steps to support our efforts to  crack down on aircraft hijacking. We have noted that concerned  authorities of Taiwan have pledged "not to grant political  asylum" to aircraft hijackers and that they will severely punish  them. We also have noted that the Association for Relations  Across the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan's Straits Exchange  Foundation have reached a common understanding that in principle  all aircraft hijackers will be repatriated, and have agreed on  the basic framework for the agreement on repatriating aircraft  hijackers. We thank people from all sectors of Taiwan for  giving forceful support to the demand that aircraft hijackers be  repatriated to the mainland as quickly as possible. We believe  that, as long as concerned departments of the two sides of the  strait work hand-in-hand in resolutely and forcefully cracking  down on aircraft hijacking and as long as hijackers are  repatriated immediately, we will be able to fundamentally  prevent aircraft hijacking from taking place and to provide  reliable assurance for the safety of passengers' lives and  property as well as for flight safety.    Li Jizhou, assistant to the minister of public security,  urged public security organs across the country to regard  ensuring civil aviation security as a part of their jobs and to  give full support to civil aviation departments in ensuring  security work. He said public security organs of civil aviation  departments should step up inspection of and supervision over  the implementation of regulations and systems on civil aviation  security.    At today's meeting, Chen Guangyi, on behalf of the  mainland's  aviation idustry, expressed his condolences for the Taiwan  compatriots, other passengers, and crew members of an airliner  of Taiwan's "China Airlines" who were killed after it crashed at  Japan's Nagoya Airport on 26 April, and gave his regards to the  relatives of the victims.</p>

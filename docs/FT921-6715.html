			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: A hidden hand for the opposition - The role of Labour's backroom planner, Jim Parish THEY SHUN the limelight. But even the most glittering frontbench stars would be lost without them. Backroom tacticians will play a critical role in communicating the general election messages of their respective parties. None craves greater anonymity or has a more important role to play than Labour's Mr Jim Parish. As the party's chief campaigns officer he will act as all-purpose stage manager-cum-technician for the scores of set-piece media events before polling day. Drawing on one of his favourite slim panatellas he will oversee the design and erection of the sets, the installation of sound systems and lighting and the entrances and exits of the dramatis personae. These skilfully crafted backdrops exert a subtle but profound influence on how Labour's front-line performers are perceived, particularly by television viewers. The political impact of a slogan which catches the popular mood, or conversely of an unflattering set or technical glitch, could set the tone for the entire campaign. A gaunt figure, with a mop of greyish hair and a resemblance to actor James Coburn, Mr Parish likens his role to that of Lilian Baylis, the stage manager who 'used to fry eggs and bacon' in the wings of the Old Vic theatre. This portrait is supplemented by the comments of two reverential colleagues. Mr Philip Gould, the party's advertising specialist, says: 'Jim is central to the improvement in Labour's presentation. Mr Peter Mandelson, Labour's former communications director now standing for parliament, says: 'I used to call him my impresario. Jim was one of those who brought about the transformation of the party's image for which I was subsequently given much of the credit.' Colleagues say he can sometimes be 'prickly' in his determination to get things right. But he is a popular figure with journalists, who appreciate his convivial manner and knack of telling original jokes. After an early career encompassing the BBC, West End theatre and British Olivetti, he joined Labour as a press officer between the two general elections of 1974. Then, he recalls, the party's notion of publicity was 'for the head of communications to call a meeting and say: 'We have got a conference coming up in two weeks and we need a slogan - anyone got any ideas?'.' It is easy to forget it was only in 1983 that Labour lavished Pounds 7,500 on its very first conference set. He identifies a number of significant presentational milestones since then. First, the 1984 campaign for elections to the European Parliament, which was the first to employ 'publicity techniques that are now taken for granted'. Then the conception and design of the now ubiquitous Labour rose. He also highlights the launch of the 1987 general election manifesto at a plush conference centre. 'The Tories launched their manifesto in Central Office on the same day. They looked cramped. We looked stylish. We didn't look back after that.' Today, Labour's sets are imbued with a classy, uncluttered quality - off-white decor, off-centre lectern and copious rose-bowls - which is Mr Parish's hallmark. His chief aim in this is to focus attention on the speaker and help to 'clarify' the message. He expects this general election to be the first fully to exploit satellite communications, with the result that parties will engage in 'hour-to-hour combat'. It will also be a race for the early bird, with Labour's morning press conferences starting at 7.45am sharp. 'It is about trying to grab the issue of the day,' he explains, dismissing as 'boy scoutish' the Liberal Democrat move to summon the press at 7.15am.</p>

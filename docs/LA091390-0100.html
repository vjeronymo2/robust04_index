			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> PARKS COMMISSION WANTS PIER RESTORED  </P> <P> The Ventura parks commission recommended Wednesday that the City Council accept  $3 million in grants and borrow $500,000 to restore the Ventura Pier and build  shops at its base.  </P> <P> Since pilings were destroyed in a 1986 storm, at least 1,000 feet of the  longest pier in California have been closed.  </P> <P> The commission's recommendation will go to the City Council on Sept. 24 and, if  approved, the funds would be used to lengthen the 118-year-old pier to its  original 1,958 feet.  </P> <P> The city plans to lease 15,000 square feet at the base of the pier to  restaurants and retail stores to offset about $150,000 in yearly maintenance  costs, said John Baker, Ventura city manager.  </P> <P> "The concessions will generate a revenue fund so that the restoration will pay  for itself," Baker said.  </P> <P> A grant of $500,000 from a state special account has already been secured for  the project. The remaining $3 million will come from four sources pending  transfer of ownership to the city of Ventura from the state and assurances that  concessions will be built, said Mary Lou Schill, commission administrative  assistant.  </P> <P> The funds would include $1 million from state bonds approved by voters in 1980,  $500,000 from a loan by the California Coastal Conservancy to be paid back in  the first five years, $1 million from a California Coastal Conservancy grant  and a $500,000 grant from the Wildlife Conservation Board.

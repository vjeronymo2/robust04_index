			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Interest on solicitors' fees FUNDS from a deceased relative's estate are being withdrawn from the building society where my relative kept the funds by the firm of solicitors handling probate. The cheque is to be made payable in the name of the solicitor partnership. If that money is paid into the partnership's bank account does the interest accrue for the benefit of the legatees or does it 'by custom and practice' accrue for the benefit of the solicitors? The interest involved is quite substantial. The interest will be accounted for as income of the estate, and does not accrue for the benefit of the solicitors. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

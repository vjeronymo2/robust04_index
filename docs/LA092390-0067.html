			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BALLPARK STORY A HIT  </P> <P> I read with great enjoyment Glenn Bunting's "Take Me Out to the Old Ballparks,"  Sept. 2. Having just returned from a similar "girls-only" excursion myself, I  found the article to be an accurate reflection of our impressions as well.  </P> <P> Our one-week journey began in Chicago, continued on to Detroit and came to an  end in Cleveland.  </P> <P> Both Chicago ballparks were as exciting and magical as all the legends would  lead one to believe. Tiger Stadium in Detroit was an oasis amid an otherwise  depressed and depressing city -- not to mention home to the best hot dogs east  of Dodger Stadium!  </P> <P> Cleveland proved to be our most pleasant surprise. Forgiving the fact that the  residents clearly prefer football to baseball, we found the city to be  energetic and culturally rich.  </P> <P> RISA SLAVIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

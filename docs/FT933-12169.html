			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / People: Dawes 'earns his spurs' and comes on board at English Trust English Trust has made Simon Dawes, a corporate financier from JS Gadd, its eighth director now that he has 'earned his spurs', according to fellow director Anthony Wieler. He joins up with Stephen Goschalk and Charles Good, both former senior Gadd executives. The two moved to English Trust, Good on a non-executive basis, when the boutique merchant bank acquired the corporate finance activities of Gadd last December. Dawes, however, was not taken on immediately, but worked on a number of projects for English Trust. 'We wanted everyone to prove their worth,' Wieler explains. 'People sometimes don't bring as much business with them as they say they will.' In May, Dawes had worked on a private placement for a nursing home, Exceler, which raised Pounds 2m. English Trust reckons the pick-up in corporate finance activity in recent months signifies an end to recession for smaller companies. Dawes is understood to be working on two larger deals currently, including one cross-border venture. Previously, Dawes, 49, had spent 20 years at Laing &amp; Cruickshank specialising in engineering and then smaller companies, from the analytical and institutional broking angle. His initial foray into corporate finance was when he joined ANZ Merchant Bank in 1991, but the Australians shut down the UK corporate finance operation eight months later. At that point he moved to JS Gadd.</p>

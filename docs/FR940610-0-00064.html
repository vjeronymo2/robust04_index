			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) The assumption that the amount described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(1)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> )( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) is distributed in accordance with the payout sequence described in the governing instrument. If the governing instrument does not prescribe when the distribution is made during the period for which the payment is made, for purposes of this section, the distribution is considered payable on the first day of the period for which the payment is made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Actuarial Computations by the Internal Revenue Service.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulations in this and in related sections provide tables of actuarial factors and examples that illustrate the use of the tables in determining the value of remainder interests in property. Section 1.7520&hyph;1(c)(2) refers to government publications that provide additional tables of factors and examples of computations for more complex situations. If the computation requires the use of a factor that is not provided in this section, the Commissioner may supply the factor upon a request for a ruling. A request for a ruling must be accompanied by a recitation of the facts including the date of birth of each measuring life, and copies of the relevant documents. A request for a ruling must comply with the instructions for requesting a ruling published periodically in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (See &sect;601.601(d)(2)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of this chapter) and include payment of the required user fee. If the Commissioner furnishes the factor, a copy of the letter supplying the factor should be attached to the tax return in which the deduction is claimed. If the Commissioner does not furnish the factor, the taxpayer must furnish a factor computed in accordance with the principles set forth in this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Statement supporting deduction required.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any claim for a deduction on any return for the value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust must be supported by a full statement attached to the return showing the computation of the present value of such interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Valuation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust (as described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3) for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, is its present value determined under paragraph (e) of this section. The fair market value of a remainder interest in a charitable remainder unitrust (as described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3) for transfers for which the valuation date is before May 1, 1989, is its present value determined under the following sections: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 3,L2,tp0,i1,s10,8,xls56 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Valuation dates <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2After <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 2Before <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Applicable  <!-- PJG 007 0120 intable --> regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 007 0170 intable --> l  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 01&hyph;01&hyph;52  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.664&hyph;4A(a) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12&hyph;31&hyph;51  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 01&hyph;01&hyph;71  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.664&hyph;4A(b) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12&hyph;31&hyph;70  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 12&hyph;01&hyph;83  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.664&hyph;4A(c) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11&hyph;30&hyph;83  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 05&hyph;01&hyph;89  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.664&hyph;4A(d) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Valuation of charitable remainder unitrusts having certain payout sequences for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, in the case of transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, the present value of a remainder interest is determined under paragraphs (e)(3) through (e)(6) of this section, provided that the amount of the payout as of any payout date during any taxable year of the trust is not larger than the amount that the trust could distribute on such date under &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(1)(v) if the taxable year of the trust were to end on such date. See, however, &sect;1.7520&hyph;3(b) (relating to exceptions to the use of the prescribed tables under certain circumstances). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Transitional rules for valuation of charitable remainder unitrusts. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) If the valuation date of a transfer to a charitable remainder unitrust is after April 30, 1989, and before June 10, 1994, a transferor can rely upon Notice 89&hyph;24, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 660, or Notice 89&hyph;60, 1989&hyph;1 C.B. 700, in valuing the transferred interest.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Mexico City, 19 Feb (NOTIMEX) -- President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari stated today that the Mexican Army's  support for peace has allowed progress in the search for a  peaceful solution to the conflict in the southeastern State of  Chiapas.    "The Army, as result of its professional performance, with  the lives of its members, has allowed us to progress in  accomplishing something which is the desire of the entire  population: a definite end to the violence, as well as peace and  tranquility for Chiapas," the president's message indicated.    Salinas de Gortari's address was read by General Arturo  Cardona Marino, chief of the presidential high command, during  an event commemorating Army Day that took place on Military  Field No. 1 located north of Mexico City.    The president highlighted the government's decision to  search  for a peaceful solution from the onset of the "unpredictable"  Chiapas events, which represents "a test for all Mexicans. This  willingness for peace has been possible because the Mexican Army  performed, and performed well, during the conflict's contention  and population protection phases," Salinas indicated. [passage  omitted]    The dialogue between the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN] and Manuel Camacho Solis, commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas, is scheduled to begin this coming  Monday. Camacho Solis was appointed as peace commissioner on 10  January as a result of an initiative by President Salinas de  Gortari.    "By providing protection to the Chiapas civilian population,  the Mexican Army and Air Force have carried out their  constitutional responsibilities," the president stated. Salinas  de Gortari emphasized that these two military institutions "have  given evidence throughout the conflict of their discipline,  unalterable commitment to the state of law, support for peace,  and loyalty to Mexico."    The address also stressed the Mexican Army's contributions  to  the health sector, national natural disaster relief, drug  trafficking, and public order threats. "On this Army Day, please  receive from the president of the Republic, as commander in  chief, a most extensive congratulations and, along with this,  the acknowledgement, respect, and affection of the Mexican  people," Salinas de Gortari stated.    The president headed the ceremony accompanied by National  Defense Secretary General Antonio Riviello Bazan and Navy  Secretary Admiral Luis Carlos Ruano Angulo, as well as other  cabinet officials.    During the ceremony, Riviello Bazan indicated that the Armed  Forces "never remember their actions, but rather the spirit and  mission for which they were created," which is to serve "in  order for the nation to live in peace." He highlighted that  "this is the Mexican nation's Army, proud of its origins, an  Army of men who are loyal, capable, honest, and convinced of the  postulates ingrained in the Constitution."

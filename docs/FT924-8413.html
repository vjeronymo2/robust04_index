			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Letter: Boom and bust policy, not workers, to blame for crisis Sir, With all the integrity of a cabinet minister, you blast both trade unions and employers for failing to recognise the need for investment and profit increases, citing Ford as an example ('CBI obfuscation'). How short the memory is. Every pay and conditions settlement within Ford during the last decade was related to rationalisation and productivity improvements. During the same period Ford achieved record profits on more than one occasion. Additionally, investment in plant and people was at an all-time high. So why the economic downturn with no apparent relief in sight? Without a job you cannot afford to buy a car. If you have a job, but fear for it, you will be more than reluctant to buy a car, especially as most cars are purchased through finance agreements that require employment stability. This situation cannot be addressed by micro-adjustments. Rather, there is an urgent need for the government to provide a macro-economic framework. The UK has some of Europe's best-equipped factories and they are lying idle. These factories have received investment and are capable of high productivity but, without the consumer, they are like engines without fuel. And the only fuel on offer at present is hot air.

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Guatemalan economic developments monitored through 21  June.    Finance Minister Ana de Molina said on 15 June the directors  of the Paris Club set September as the deadline for Congress to  approve renegotiation of the debt. If the debt is not  renegotiated by then, the exemptions and advantages previously  negotiated with the Paris Club members will be canceled, and  Guatemala's image abroad will deteriorate. (Guatemala City  SIGLO VEINTIUNO in Spanish 16 June 94 p 6)    Willy Zapata, president of the Bank of Guatemala, said on 15  June there is no reason to believe that a depreciation of the  currency will occur at this point or that there will be currency  exchange problems during the year, because the mechanisms the  Bank of Guatemala has implemented are yielding positive results.  (Guatemala City LA REPUBLICA in Spanish 16 June 94 p 4)    The Spanish Government has expressed its support for  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's government by accepting the  total payment of $115 million for the debt incurred when the  plant Celgusa was built. In order to pay this debt, the plant  will be sold for U.S. Treasury bonds. (Guatemala City SIGLO  VEINTIUNO in Spanish 17 June 94 p 5)</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Drugs supported Nervousness in the pharmaceuticals sector following the previewing of US health proposals dried up yesterday as some UK houses looked at the sector's relative value against the market. NatWest Securities published a buy recommendation, arguing that 'short-term performance will continue to be underpinned by low valuations and a lack of value elsewhere'. Over the past 12 months the UK health and household sector has underperformed the FT's All-Share Index by more than 45 percentage points, and a number of economists are beginning to question whether the broader market has topped out. Meanwhile, SGST concentrated on the Clinton health reforms in its weekly reviews and said Wellcome would be the company least affected. The leading drug stocks opened weaker on the after-effects of US selling the previous night but closed up on balance. Glaxo finished 2 firmer at 625p, SmithKline Beecham 'A' 5 ahead at 409p and Wellcome up a penny at 724p.</p>

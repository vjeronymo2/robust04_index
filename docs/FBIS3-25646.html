This operation carried out against the village of Karena,  inhabited by Arab-Choa, followed clashes the previous day  between security forces and "highway bandits" who had come to  take the people to ransom, these sources added. These clashes  left three people dead, including a soldier.    According to a report from the two Arab-Choa deputies, more  than 90 villagers had to be admitted to hospital after this  operation. About 80 of them were sent to Nigerian health centers  at the border of the two countries.</p>

			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: WRIGHT DUE BACK AFTER VISITING HIS ILL FATHER  </P> <P> San Diego State running back T.C. Wright, who went to Phoenix Sunday to be with  his ailing father, is supposed to be back in time for this morning's practice,  SDSU Coach Al Luginbill said Monday.  </P> <P> Luginbill said Wright's father has a malignant tumor on his gall bladder and  will undergo surgery later this week.  </P> <P> Wright is a 5-foot-10 transfer from Mesa (Ariz.) Community College who earned  the starting SDSU running back position coming out of spring practice. He was  selected first team community college All-America at Mesa last year, when he  rushed for 1,073 yards, caught 39 passes for 473 yards and averaged 29.5 yards  per kickoff return.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Luginbill said he is giving the team the day off on Sunday, when the  Aztecs had tentatively planned to scrimmage.  </P> <P> "It was too much," Luginbill said. "We needed a day off. They start school on  Monday, and they need a day away. The coaches need a day away.  </P> <P> "We're getting in good work. We wanted to see how things progressed, and they  have progressed to the point where we don't feel we need (a scrimmage Sunday)."  </P> <P> Luginbill said SDSU will scrimmage twice during summer camp -- Wednesday and  next Wednesday.

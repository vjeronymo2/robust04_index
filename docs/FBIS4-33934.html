			<p>BFN     [Text] San Miguel de Tucuman, 11 Jun (NA) -- It has been  officially reported in this city that an alleged member of the  Peruvian Maoist organization Shining Path was arrested during a  joint Federal and Tucuman Police operation. The alleged  terrorist, identified as Jorge Diaz Reategui, was captured at a  hotel in the poor district of El Bajo, near the city bus  terminal. At the time of his capture, Reategui was with other  alleged guerrillas, who managed to escape.    Judge Ricardo Maturana is in charge of Federal Court No. 2  of  this city. On 10 June he questioned Reategui, but the details  of the questioning have not been released.    Police sources have said Reategui had been under very strict  surveillance by the Federal Police.    It has been suggested that this province is a refugee camp  for Shining Path members who clandestinely cross the border and  train Peruvian and Argentine militants who support their  ideology.</p>

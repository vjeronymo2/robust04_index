			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Singapore finds favour with foreign investors - Relaxation of rules governing savings has also boosted activity A year ago it was hard to find a happy broker in Singapore. The market was in the doldrums while Hong Kong and other regional centres were stealing all the attention. Volumes were low and margins were tight. Now things are very different. Even the most diffident of brokers admit that they have never had it so good. Until yesterday the local Straits Times Industrial Index was attaining record highs, closing on Monday at 2,045, compared with 1,500 at the start of 1993 and around 1,300 a year ago. Yesterday the market fell back on profit-taking, ending at 2,036. Singapore has benefited from the general advance in global equities. Foreign funds, particularly from the US, have been pouring into east Asia, one of the world's most dynamic economic regions. A number of Malaysian stocks are traded in Singapore over the counter and the recent vigour of the Kuala Lumpur market has also helped to push the STII to new highs. 'Singapore has been caught up in the general optimism about economic prospects in this part of the world,' says Mr Tom Inglis of Peregrine Securities in Singapore. 'There are enormous funds now flowing into the market here; Singapore has become fashionable again.' Local factors have also helped. The economic fundamentals remain sound. with growth in 1992 of 5.8 per cent, and signs of more robust growth this year. Growth was 7.1 per cent in the first quarter and 10.1 per cent in the second, partly due to a surge in earnings from the financial services sector and the equity market revival. Corporate news has also been positive, withbanks, which account for more than 25 per cent of market capitalisation, averaging earnings growth of about 30 per cent. The government, famous for its planning skills, has had a direct role in the revival of equities. Both corporate and personal taxes were lowered earlier this year and there have been a number of new listings, including some of the bigger, more profitable state concerns. Most importantly the government relaxed rules governing the use of funds from the Citizens Provident Fund, a compulsory national savings scheme. Until recently CPF funds could only be used for property purchases and investment in a limited number of stocks. The government has become worried about rampant inflation in the property sector and wants to release a portion of CPF funds for investments in various projects, particularly to back a push into the east Asia region. Hence, through a government sponsored media campaign, Singaporeans are now being actively encouraged to buy shares. Incentives to share ownership are also being offered to CPF account holders. From the beginning of next month more than SDollars 22bn (Dollars 14bn) of CPF funds will be available for equity investment. 'The release of the CPF funds is one of the most important factors in giving buoyancy to the market,' says Mr Lim Kok Ann of Merrill Lynch. 'Singapore is becoming a far more liquid market - as a result it will also become more volatile.' But Singapore is likely to remain a carefully controlled market. This was reflected in the recent government announcement giving details of next month's partial float of Singapore Telecom, the state owned telecommunications and postal service. Brokers had been billing the float as the single biggest privatisation so far in south-east Asia, valued at between SDollars 20bn and SDollars 25bn, equivalent to about 20 per cent of total market capitalisation. But the ST float has been structured very conservatively. The government plans an initial float of only between 6 and 8 per cent of ST, with 50 per cent reserved for Singaporeans, the rest available to local and foreign investors through tender. The ST float will set the pattern for future listings of state companies, including the public utilities board and the port of Singapore. 'The government is playing the ST float very carefully,' says one broker. 'It knows that there is plenty of local liquidity and it is going to make sure that foreigners do not pick up a prime state asset like ST cheaply. You cannot blame the government - but it does take the fun out of things.'</p>

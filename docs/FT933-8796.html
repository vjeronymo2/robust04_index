			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / French reserves fall by FFr190bn: Deficit explains country's caution in reducing interest rates THE Bank of France has been left with a substantial net deficit in its foreign currency reserves as a result of its attempts to keep the franc inside the European exchange rate mechanism at the end of last month. Figures issued yesterday by Bank of France showed that the country's net reserves fell by almost FFr190bn (Pounds 21.64bn) in the week to August 5, leaving the central bank with a deficit of more than FFr180bn in its foreign exchange holdings. The franc slipped against the D-Mark yesterday after the central bank figures were issued. The Danish krone also fell sharply against the D-Mark amid signs that Denmark also needed to replenish its foreign exchange reserves after the ERM crisis. The drain on French reserves will have been due almost entirely to the central bank's intervention in the currency markets to try to keep the franc above its former ERM floor against the D-Mark. On July 29 alone, economists estimate the central bank spent more than the FFr160bn used to defend the franc in its previous crises. The total amount of reserves used by the French authorities in the recent crisis is estimated at more than FFr305bn. The franc closed yesterday at FFr3.514 against the D-Mark, about a third of a centime down on the day. But at one stage, the currency was being bought at FFr3.52. The reserves data helped to explain France's cautious approach to reducing interest rates since the widening of fluctuation bands within the currency system on August 2. Economists said that if the French authorities were to lower interest rates, the currency could fall against the D-Mark - but the central bank would have no reserves with which to support the exchange rate through intervention. The krone came under even heavier selling pressure inside the ERM, in spite of Denmark's announcement of a large offering on the bond market to help replenish its foreign exchange reserves. The bond issue, worth SFr1bn (Pounds .4bn) came in the wake of a Pounds 1.3bn Eurobond sterling offering last week. But news of this latest bond tender could not prevent the krone falling in London to a close of DKr4.1135 against the D-Mark from a previous DKr3.406. The size of the capital flows is expected to spur attempts by European Community members to strengthen their defences against currency speculators. Currencies, Page 32</p>

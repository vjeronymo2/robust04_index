A security source at the Interior Ministry said one of the  terrorists is Muhammad Mustafa al-Ghawdiri, a former student at  the technical commercial institute in Port Said. He was  sentenced to two years imprisonment in a supreme state security  criminal case involving an attack on the home of Lieutenant  Colonel Mutawi' Abu- al-Naja, an officer in the Damietta state  security branch, and an attempt to assassinate him. He is also  accused in a supreme state security case involving the planning  of hostile actions.    The security source added that the second terrorist is Ahmad  Hamadah Mustafa Mursi al-Sayyid, 19, who studied at the al-  'Abbasiyah School of Art. He was a member of the group that  carried out recent bank explosions.    The source said an automatic weapon magazine, two Baretta  8.5-mm pistols, a radio set, and forged official cards and  documents were discovered during the raid, along with some  organizational papers and a four-volume telephone directory for  use in locating targeted figures.    The security source said the first terrorist was  superficially wounded by a shot fired at him when he tried to  escape. His leg was fractured when he jumped down from his  hideout. The source added that the prosecution has been  informed so that it can launch an investigation.</p>

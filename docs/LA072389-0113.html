			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HOW IS THIS FOR A COMPARISON: METS OF OLD AND ORIOLES ANEW  </P> <P> Comparisons like these -- one team from 1969, the other from 1989 -- are hokey  to begin with. So much can happen in 20 years. So many changes. Twenty years  ago, for example, The Who was still a touring rock band.  </P> <P> But let's suppose you sense a similarity between the 1969 Mets and these 1989  Orioles. Not that you automatically would -- Frank Robinson, just to pull a  name out of thin air, doesn't. "I can't talk about the '69 Mets. I only saw  them five ballgames," Robinson deadpanned, remembering the outrageous  undressing of his Orioles in that World Series. But for the sake of argument,  apart from the obvious -- that both teams were 200-1 shots going into the  season -- what basis would there be for the comparison?  </P> <P> Not pitching. The Mets starters were awesome, rotating Tom Seaver, Jerry  Koosman, Gary Gentry and Don Cardwell, and spotting Nolan Ryan and Jim  McAndrew. Together, Seaver (2.21 ERA) and Koosman (2.28) were 42-16 with 34  complete games and 11 shutouts; the full staff had 28 shutouts, most in the  last 20 years. The Orioles starters are underwhelming; indeed, their  acknowledged ace, Jeff Ballard, has looked like a candidate for Class AAA the  last month and a half. It's the bullpen, most prominently Gregg Olson and Mark  Williamson (who've had a hand in 41 of the 53 victories) that's keeping their  powder dry.  </P> <P> Not fielding. Notwithstanding spectacular World Series catches by Ron Swoboda  and Tommie Agee, the Mets, with 122 errors, were an average defensive team. The  Orioles are brilliant. More than halfway through the season they've made 48  errors, and are threatening the record low yield of 84.  </P> <P> Not hitting. The Mets hit .242, third least in the National League. The Orioles  are batting .262, and lead the American League in runs per game. The Mets poked  a measly 109 home runs. The Orioles already have 79.  </P> <P> So why compare them?  </P> <P> Because it's the same story.  </P> <P> Because in spirit, they're twins.  </P> <P> "We weren't expected to win," Ed Kranepool recalled. "But we kept winning,  winning, winning. One day we were the laughingstock of the league, and the next  day we were champions."  </P> <P> The Amazing Mets.  </P> <P> The Inexplicable O's.  </P> <P> Both the Mets and Orioles were chock full of kids -- average age 27 -- and  bereft of big stars. The Orioles have Cal Ripken Jr. That's one more than the  Mets had. Kranepool had already been around forever, but was no great shakes.  Seaver and Koosman had yet to win 20.  </P> <P> Both teams got vital, even startling offensive contributions from unexpected  sources. The Mets got a career year from Cleon Jones, who hit .340, 59 points  above his average. The Orioles already have 21 homers and 53 RBI from Mickey  Tettleton, who'd never done better than 11 and 37.  </P> <P> Unacclaimed hitters like Agee, Jerry Grote, Ken Boswell and Art Shamsky had  their most productive seasons in 1969. Players who'd soon fade from sight,  journeymen like Al Weis, J.C. Martin, Wayne Garrett and Bobby Pfeil, banged  timely hits. It's too soon to know what kind of careers Steve Finley, Randy  Milligan, Brady Anderson and Mike Devereaux will have, but the analogy breathes  for the moment.  </P> <P> The overriding thing that links these teams is the pervasive sense that they're  in the midst of doing something extraordinary, something mythical. As the Mets  did then, the Orioles go onto the field every game thinking they can win.  They've beaten Clemens, Viola, Ryan and Stewart. Who'd have thunk it? "Maybe  it's the attitude that's so similar," said Al Jackson, who's in the impossibly  coincidental position of being the '89 Orioles' pitching coach and having  pitched briefly for the '69 Mets. Pieces fall into place. A manager proves his  player was hit by a pitch by showing an umpire the shoe polish scuff on the  ball; a phantom home run wins a game; a ground rule double sends the tying run  back to third. The cavalry arrives in the nick of time. The Mets got Donn  Clendenon from Montreal in midseason. The Orioles have dialed Rochester for  emergency pitching patchwork, and Jay Tibbs, Mike Smith, Mickey Weston and Mark  Huismann are 8-0 with two saves.  </P> <P> In 1969, there was a regular who sat on the third base side of Shea, holding up  his hand-painted signs. One said, "God Is Alive And Living In Queens." It's 20  years. Maybe He's renting in Baltimore.  </P> <P> It's not an exact parallel. After chasing the Cubs all summer, the Mets finally  touched first place on Sept. 10; the Orioles have camped there the last 54  straight days. As rude as the Mets were in 1968, finishing 16 under .500, the  1988 Orioles were lead weights, sinking 53 under. But the essence and the  spirit of the turnarounds are the same. It's the American Dream, the  preoccupation with longshots.  </P> <P> The signature game for the Mets came on Sept. 15. The Cardinals' Steve Carlton  struck out 19 of them, a record then -- and Swoboda hit two two-run dingers to  beat him, 4-3. From that point on only a fool would disbelieve. If the Orioles  go on to win the pennant, last weekend's back-to-back, Deavereaux-Tettleton,  fair-or-foul cardiac comebacks against the Angels will be their signature  games.  </P> <P> Not that everybody's a believer. Skeptics abound. Were Robinson managing  another AL club he might add his voice to the herd. "I've been in positions  like this before," Robinson explained, "watching an unexpected team jump out.  And I've said, 'I'm glad they're out there, and not so and so. They're going to  come back to the pack.' But I'll tell you what. After a point you'd better step  back and reconsider. Those guys aren't going to quit. They're not going to come  back to us. We've got to catch them." Robinson leaned back comfortably in his  soft leather chair. "California left here and said, 'Their pitching won't hold  up. It won't last through September.' Maybe so. But I'm glad they're taking  that attitude." His eyes half-closed, a serene smile on his lips, Robinson said  with a lilt, "Look up in September and we may not need that pitching."  </P></p>

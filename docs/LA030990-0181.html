			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORE BITES  </P> <P> The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews.  </P> <P> Emperor's Fortune, 3820 Plaza Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 850-9008. Open Mondays  through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturdays till 11.  </P> <P>  Emperor's Fortune is the latest incarnation in haute Chinese, a Hong  Kong-elegant dining room designed with obvious expense. Everything is  well-crafted, even if the taste spectrum tends to be on the bland side, and  there is considerable imagination in the presentations. Peking duck, with an  amazingly crispy skin, is the big hitter, and you'll want to try such dishes as  Shrimp Go Nuts, mussels in garlic sauce and any of the wonderful desserts (from  Grand Finale). Expect to have your wallet lightened considerably.  </P> <P> Showley-Wrightson, 2531 Eastbluff Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 760-9700. Open  Mondays through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., Tuesdays through Saturdays from  6 to 9:30.  </P> <P>  Showley-Wrightson is an unlikely little gem of a restaurant, hidden away in a  tony Newport Beach shopping center (the owners have tried to infuse the place  with atmosphere but it still looks like an upscale grocery store with tables).  Wonderful breads like fougasse and a dense walnut loaf begin the proceedings,  and there is a wide array of entrees and desserts to choose from, all made on  the premises. Don't miss risottos, grilled smoked beef, or the flourless  chocolate cake. They pack picnic baskets too.  </P> <P> Cafe Zinc, 350 Ocean Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 494-6302. Open Tuesdays through  Saturdays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sundays 7 to 4.  </P> <P> Belisle's, 12001 Harbor Blvd., Garden Grove. (714) 750-6560. Open 24 hours a  day, 7 days a week.  </P> <P> The dilemma of where to take an out-of-town guest can be solved at Cafe Zinc, a  Berkeley-style cafe in Laguna, or Belisle's, a truck stop-style restaurant in  Garden Grove. I'll let you figure out the rest of the equation. Cafe Zinc has  remarkable, densely foamed cappuccino, fresh, imaginative muffins like millet  or cranberry and an outdoor patio. Belisle's trades on giant platters,  eye-popping pastries and true grit Americana like grits, mush and corn bread.  Good morning, y'all.  </P> <P> Dynasty, 9200 Bolsa Ave., 215, Westminster. (714) 898-3189. Open Mondays  through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., weekends from 9 a.m.  </P> <P>  A vast Hong Kong style restaurant in a Little Saigon shopping mall, Dynasty is  beginning to strut its stuff. The dining room is now in the hands of the  capable Tony Lai, a Chinese foodie with Beverly Hills in his resume, and both  food and service have taken a sharp upturn. Black pepper beef brisket from the  page one specials menu is extraordinary, and don't miss the first-rate kung pao  dishes, sand dabs with spicy salt, or soy sauce squab. On a menu with 150  entrees, there is much to choose from.  </P> <P> La Palma Chicken Pie Shop and Restaurant, 928 N. Euclid Ave., Anaheim. (714)  533-2021. Open Mondays through Saturdays from 10:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. Bakery  opens at 9.  </P> <P>  This is where you want to go for meat loaf, pan fried chicken and the other  kinds of tried and true, roadside American fare that are creeping back onto the  menus in more upscale establishments. The signature dish, chicken pie, is a  buttery, 9 oz. disc crammed with shredded meat. At $1.95 it makes a great,  affordable snack. Don't bypass the attached bakery, where the goodies include  peach pie, burnt almond cake and a rich house cheesecake, and an excellent,  springy chocolate cake is only three dollars.  </P> <P> Greek Cuisine, 13011 Newport Ave., Tustin. (714) 731-1179. Open Mondays through  Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; Sundays through Thursdays from 5 to 10, Fridays  and Saturdays till 11.  </P> <P> Flamingo, 17185 Brookhurst, Fountain Valley. Open Tuesdays through Thursdays 11  a.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11.  </P> <P> Ethnic eateries in mini-malls, Greek Cuisine in Tustin boasts exquisite taramo,  creamed carp roe, fall-off-the-bone oregano chicken and a fine array of Greek  specialties, while Flamingo in Fountain Valley is more terra incognita: seco  norteno (piquant lamb stew in onion gravy), papas a la Huancaina (potatoes in a  cheese sauce blanket), picarone (hot pumpkin fritters in blackstrap molasses).  Both restaurants are casual and inexpensive.  </P> <P> Viva Italia, 303 Broadway, Laguna Beach. (714) 497-6220. Open daily from 11:30  a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 5:30 to 10:30.  </P> <P> The VIVA in Viva Italia is an acronym for the first initials of brothers  Vittorio, Ignacio, Vincenzo and Antonio Romeo, and the restaurant seems to have  caught on as neatly. It's a somewhat cramped version of an Italian trattoria:  terra cotta floor, tile kitchen, elbow-to-elbow seating. Food is simple and  straightforward but erratic. Pastas and wood fired pizzas are the best bets.  Beach crowd salads and ill-conceived main courses can be passed over. Service  is snappy and efficient.  </P> <P> Bayou St. John, 320 Main St., Seal Beach. (213) 431-2298. Open daily from 5 to  10 p.m.  </P> <P>  Bayou St. John in quiet Seal Beach is currently Orange County's only bona fide  Cajun restaurant: The boom has faded, but not the delights of this cuisine.  Indulge yourself with such specialties as homemade gumbo, full of hidden  flavors; oysters Rousseau, a rich appetizer with cheese, bacon, cream sauce and  spicy tomato; and stuffed trout, pan fried in pure butter. Blackened items are  a must. Seafoods are flown in from the Gulf. Dixieland music on tape furnishes  the nostalgia.  </P> <P> Hyang Chon, 12921 Fern St., Stanton. (714) 891-5166. Open daily from 10 a.m. to  11 p.m.  </P> <P> Eel, grilled short ribs and barbecued herring are just a few items on this  Korean restaurant's exotic and varied menu. Pan cha, colorful side dishes, are  especially good here, with such specialties as gae jang, raw marinated crab,  and jap chae, glass noodle with meat and vegetable. Lunchtime prices are a  steal.  </P> <P> Revere House, 900 W. 1st St., Tustin. (714) 543-9314. Open Mondays through  Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sundays from 10:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.  </P> <P>  Revere House is one of those dark, woody dinner houses that were popular  during the '50s, and guess what: That's when the place opened. It specializes  in credible versions of plain old American food-prime rib, pan fried chicken,  turkey with all the trimmings-all churned out with dependable regularity. The  menu is enormous and portions are Protean. All entrees come with a choice of  Caesar or spinach salad. Desserts are the one weak spot, except for the tapioca  pudding you get for free.  </P> <P> The Hobbit, 2932 E. Chapman Ave., Orange. (714) 997-1972. Open for dinner  Tuesdays through Sundays at 7:30 p.m.  </P> <P> The Hobbit is a special occasion restaurant, serving prix fixe dinners that are  elaborate without being pretentious. Book well in advance. You begin the  evening in the restaurant's wine cellar, nibbling on Julia Child-like  appetizers, sipping champagne and chatting with total strangers. Chef Mike  Phillippi takes it all very seriously, preparing solid food that is  well-balanced, though rarely brilliant. Entrees like beef Wellington and  lobster Thermidor rotate weekly. Service is performed by smiling waitresses in  print uniforms.  </P> <P> Gandhi, 3820-D Plaza Drive, South Coast Plaza Village, Santa Ana. (714)  556-7273. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and 6 to 10.  </P> <P>  Gandhi could be called new wave Indian: it roasts quail in its clay oven and  pours Beaujolais nouveau as often as beer. Phlegmatic waiters in fancy tuxedoes  perform service on the brass enclosed patio, a former pizzeria that looks more  like Paris than Delhi. Appetizers like chicken tikka salad and the various  tandoori dishes are refined and pleasant. Spicy dishes like lamb in spinach  puree and curried eggplant are even better. Expensive.  </P> <P> Grappa, 2304 W. Ocean Front, Newport Beach. (714) 675-1930. Open Tuesdays  through Thursdays from 6 to 10 p.m., Fridays through Sundays till 11.  </P> <P>  Grappa, housed in what used to be Zeppa, is yet another beachfront Italian  restaurant in Newport. New owner Vincenzo Gentile hasn't changed the basic  concept: The restaurant still resembles a Florentine villa, with a kitchen that  churns out such favorites as great fried calamari, salads with lots of balsamic  vinegar, and upscale pastas such as agnolotti and penne. Nodino alla griglia,  an excellent veal chop grilled with aromatic herbs, is a standout. Desserts are  intelligently underindulgent.  </P> <P> Places Afar, 25932 Muirlands Blvd., Mission Viejo. (714) 581-4200. Open daily  except Tuesdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5 to 10.  </P> <P> Calesa, 2106 Tustin Ave., Santa Ana. (714) 541-6585. Open daily except Sundays  from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 10.  </P> <P> Places Afar is your basic Cuban-French-Vietnamese restaurant; the English is  circumspect, the cooking is spectacular. Start with Cuban ham croquettes  alongside greaseless plantain chips, or a bowlful of smoky black bean soup.  Then try Imperial salad from Vietnam. Evenings, there are such French classics  as couscous and choucroute. Calesa has a sign boasting "Round-the-World-Dining"  -- it's a luxurious restaurant with Filipino, Asian and Continental  specialties. There is a wide selection of main dishes from paella to sate, and  cooking is often on the sweet side. Service is formal, and waiters in tuxedos  flame desserts with enthusiasm that borders on lust.  </P> <P> Faraday's Grill and Spirits, 13102 Newport Ave., Tustin (714) 730-3442. Open  Sundays through Thursdays from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 11  p.m.  </P> <P>  Faraday's is a family restaurant with cheerful service, juicy burgers and some  mighty devoted fans. Why else would anyone wait half an hour for institutional  food on a Tuesday evening? Everybody goes ape over onion strings, mountains of  flour dredged onions deep fried until crispy, and the sappy sweet barbecue that  kids favor so shamelessly. Breakfast is actually quite credible here, with  fluffy pancakes, homemade muffins, and squeezed-to-order OJ. Portions are  predictably generous and prices are modest.  </P> <P> Baci, 18748 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 965-1194. Open Wednesdays  through Sundays from 5:30 to 10 p.m.  </P> <P>  Baci is just a storefront restaurant with modest decor, but young New Yorker  Angelo Parisi gives his food a rough sophistication; nearly all his dishes are  touched with originality. All of Italy finds its way onto Parisi's small menu.  Complimentary appetizers might be a superbly light chicken minestrone or some  cold garlic-infused broccoli. Dishes such as fettuccine agnello, flat noodles  with stewed lamb, and linguine tuttomare, with scungilli and shrimp, sustain  the enthusiasm. The best dessert is panna cotta, the poor man's creme brulee.  </P> <P> Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim. (714)  750-4321. Open Fridays through Tuesdays from 6 to 11 p.m. Call for lunch times.  </P> <P> Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant but other aspects of dining there  can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room is  predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu  features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad,  and some highly credible entrees, among them filet mignon that melts in the  mouth and a great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is  extensive and intelligent.  </P> <P> Hassan's Cafe, 3325 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4668. Open Tuesdays  through Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 5:30 to 11, Sundays from 5:30 to  11 only.  </P> <P>  Hassan's Cafe specializes in the cuisine of Lebanon -- a hybrid of Turkish,  French, and local influences -- and the restaurant is relaxing and exotic.  Mazza, one of the world's great noshes, is the absolute must here, a splendid  array of Middle Eastern appetizers such as mutebel, a smoky eggplant dip, and  warrab ennaq, vine leaves stuffed with aromatic rice. There are interesting  main dishes such as kibbe nayya, raw ground lamb mixed with bulgur wheat, sort  of an Arabic version of steak tartare. Kebabs are first-rate.  </P> <P> Nui Ngu, 10528 McFadden Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 775-1108. Open Tuesdays  through Thursdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till  8 p.m.  </P> <P> Pagolac, 14564 Brookhurst St., Westminster. (714) 531-4740. Open Tuesdays  through Sundays from noon to 10 p.m.  </P> <P> Little Saigon is always an arresting place to browse when in the mood for  adventurous inexpensive dining. Nui Ngu, in a misbegotten strip mall on  McFadden Avenue, specializes in the wonderfully obscure cuisine of Hue, in  Central Vietnam. Bun bo Hue, a peppery beef noodle soup, and banh bot loc,  sticky tapioca flour dumplings, are unforgettable. At Pagolac you can  experience a phenomenon known as bo bay mon, literally "seven courses of beef."  The Vietnamese are mad for it. Unload a truck before you go.  </P> <P> Bagatta, 3012 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4020. Open Mondays  through Thursdays from 6 to 11 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till midnight.  Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m.  </P> <P>  The early returns show Bagatta to have a healthy lead in the Newport Beach  Italian restaurant sweepstakes. It's a terrific addition to the local dining  scene. Chef Andrea Rogantini brings heavyweight experience to the kitchen.  Owner Tony Bagatta makes a charming host. Such dishes as salmon carpaccio,  latticed with a moss green pesto sauce, and dry cured bresaola make spectacular  beginnings. Pastas are beautifully textured. Desserts such as zucotto and  homemade spumoni are other-worldly.  </P> <P> Sapori, 1080 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 644-4220. Open daily from  11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., till 11 p.m. weekends.  </P> <P> Sapori is a modish, elegant neighborhood trattoria where the cooking is  serious. Chefs Adriano and Franco Maniacci hail from Palermo, Sicily, but play  no favorites with regard to the many regions of Italan cuisine. Bruschetta di  pane Saracena, triangles of roasted wheat bread with a garlic puree, are  delightful, and many pastas come blanketed in savory sauces. Suprema di rombo,  turbot in a leek and watercress sauce, pays homage to nouvelle. Veal Milanese  is the best you'll find anywhere.  </P> <P> Kitayama, 101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays  through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., daily from 6 p.m. to 10:30.  </P> <P> Kitayama, the first really serious Japanese restaurant in Orange County, is an  exquisite addition to the local dining scene. You'll think you've wandered into  a Buddhist temple -- until you taste the delicate, sophisticated cooking of  Yoshio Shirai and his team of chefs. The sho-ka-do lunch is the most beautiful  $14 meal anywhere, and the omakase kaiseki, a multicourse feast at $50 per  person, is unforgettable.  </P></p>

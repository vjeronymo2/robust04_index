			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Leading Article: Europe's real challenge HEADS of state are descending on London by the bus-load today for the inauguration of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. More than a year after the idea took firm shape, it is still not clear whether the institution they are coming to cheer is one that will make a useful, if modest, contribution to the redevelopment of central and eastern Europe - or whether it will prove to be a diversion. Look on the positive side first. The bank will be deploying the bulk of its 10bn Ecu capital in the private sector - acting as a catalyst for other investors, helping to put entrepreneurial zip into small business and to create a badly-needed service sector in economies which tend to be dominated by old line manufacturing. The job will be tricky, given that private sector lenders from the west are already trawling the region in the search for profitable opportunities. But the EBRD could turn into a centre of specialist expertise, collecting under one roof the wide range of skills that will be needed to tackle the immense task in hand. Management and technological assistance are just as badly needed as financial muscle, so the new bank's limited capital resources need not be a great handicap. And its private sector bias will help to distinguish its role from other institutions such as the World Bank, which already has very big infrastructure programmes under way. At the same time, the EBRD is making sensible noises about the need to proceed with caution, and to preserve at all costs a top credit rating. Political mandate One unique, and potentially valuable, feature of the bank is its political mandate. Its customers must be committed to promoting democracy and market economies. Again, it is easy to imagine all kinds of complications, but an institution of this kind could find it easier to make its views felt than would be possible in dealings at government level. The EBRD will also have an important lobbying role in the other direction, forcing the European Community and governments to turn their rhetoric into practical measures of assistance. But this is where the worries start. There is a risk that the EBRD has too grand a vision of its future role in Europe. And there is an even bigger risk that European governments will seize on this as an excuse to avoid the tougher and more important policy initiatives that are urgently required. Specific initiatives In an interview on page 30 of today's issue, the bank's dynamic president, Mr Jacques Attali, talks at length about his ideas. He sees the bank as the first pan-European institution, and cites the precedent of the European Coal and Steel Community as an example of how relatively specific initiatives can be a means to achieving much bigger political goals. Only time will tell what this actually means, and whether such visions can be reconciled with the practical and sometimes tedious business of helping a widget plant to improve its quality control, or a company of software designers to find the right markets. But at the moment, he sometimes sounds as though he cannot see the trees for the wood. Meanwhile, European governments face much bigger challenges than those which can be tackled by the EBRD. Agriculture, textiles and steel account for more than 50 per cent of Poland's exports to the EC. Unless it can have free access to the markets of the west, it has little chance of developing a sound market economy. At the moment, the omens are not good. Far from lowering its barriers to the east, the Community is actually dumping agricultural commodities, so undermining their comparative advantage. For their part, some east Europeans are not moving fast enough to develop the legislative structures for attracting foreign investment. So the heads of state gathered in London should spend the first five minutes of the day toasting the birth of an energetic and potentially useful institution. The rest of the time should be given over to a much more difficult and important debate. There is a unique opportunity to reshape continental Europe: it will not recur.</p>

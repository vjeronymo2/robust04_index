			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Recruitment: Easy guide to degrees of employment - Which universities are the most successful at preparing their students for work? Anybody thinking of going to university with the aim of getting a job at the end of it might be interested in the league table published here. It rates UK universities (those established before all the polytechnics were given the same status) according to the success of their first-degree graduates in finding a job after leaving. The table covers those graduates who attended degree courses over the three academic years from 1990-91 to 1992-93. The table is compiled from the 1994 edition of University Management Statistics and Performance Indicators in the UK. One reason for a variation in performance is the difference in subject mix because some subjects may be more useful vocationally than others, some are a prerequisite for certain types of employment - in medicine for example - and some may be simply more attractive to employers. The compilers attempt to take account of this, calculating the number of graduates unemployed or in short-term employment that would be expected if, in each subject, it conformed to the national distribution. The actual number of graduates without jobs or in short-term work is subtracted from the predicted figure and then expressed as a rate of excess per 100 graduates. A negative number, therefore, gives a higher than predicted number of unemployed graduates or those in short-term work while a positive figure reflects fewer unemployed than might be expected. Regular readers of the column will note that the percentages vary in degree from those published last year. That is because last year's table used a slightly different calculation. The order would be the same, however, with either calculation. While there are many variables involved in assessing a university, the league table does appear to be a good indicator of students' employability at the end of the course. As the notes to the research point out: 'The First Destination Record remains the principal source of information about graduates' destinations.' One factor in the placings not taken into account by the calculations is the provision of sandwich courses where students get work experience with an employer. This may account, in part at least, for the high placing of Brunel University, for example, which offers a larger proportion of sandwich courses than any other university. The importance of course choice for job finding is highlighted elsewhere in the statistics. Medical courses have the best record. The worst subject for leaving graduates jobless at the end of the course was forestry, followed by geography, aero engineering and zoology. The full statistics, price Pounds 20, are available from the Universities Statistical Record, PO Box 130, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire GL50 3SE. Tel: (0)242 225902. The index of advertised demand for executives compiled by MSL International, the recruitment consultant, has not increased in the past three months, although it is up on last year. Given the weakness of the jobs market during the summer, this may turn out to be just a blip in the rise out of recession. Individual job categories reveal a marked rise in the recruitment of personnel officers. Ian Lloyd, MSL's managing director, sees this as an optimistic indicator of economic growth. 'Many companies have survived in the past two years without expanding. Now they are realising that the human resource function at a strategic level is critical to the future operation of the business, we are seeing recruitment at personnel director level.' The way the index is represented has been changed to conform with Financial Times practice. Our statisticians say that the wiggly line wavering above and below the index line is the best way to show the variation from the trend.  ---------------------------------        UNIVERSITY TABLE  --------------------------------- University            % diff  --------------------------------- Oxford                   8.2 Brunel                   5.3 St Andrews               5.3 Durham                   5.0 Nottingham               4.2 Lancaster                4.2 Queen's Belfast          3.8 Cambridge                3.5 York                     3.4 Salford                  3.4 Hull                     3.2 Surrey                   2.8 Bath                     2.2 Dundee                   2.0 Exeter                   1.8 Sheffield                1.1 Aberdeen                 1.1 Leicester                0.6 Strathclyde              0.5 Reading                  0.4 Newcastle                0.3 Essex                    0.3 Heriot-Watt             -0.1 Stirling                -0.2 Ulster                  -0.2 Kent                    -0.3 Bristol                 -0.3 Loughborough            -0.4 E Anglia                -0.9 Keele                   -0.9 Glasgow                 -1.1 Leeds                   -1.7 Birmingham              -2.0 London                  -2.0 Manchester              -2.1 UMIST                   -2.1 Aston                   -2.2 Edinburgh               -2.2 Wales                   -2.4 Sussex                  -2.4 Warwick                 -3.4 Bradford                -3.7 Liverpool               -4.4 Southampton             -6.3 City                    -6.6  ---------------------------------</p>

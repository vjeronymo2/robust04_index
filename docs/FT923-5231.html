			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Observer: All change at Heineken It's changing of the guard time at Europe's big brewers. Guinness's Sir Anthony Tennant steps down at the end of the year and now Holland's Freddy Heineken is reshuffling the pack at his family-controlled brewery. But while the transition at Guinness is proceeding smoothly, Heineken, Europe's largest brewing group, is being more adventurous. It has appointed Karel Vuursteen, 51, a former chief executive of Philips' US lighting operation. He takes over the chairmanship of Heineken's executive board next April. Last year Heineken hired an ex-Volvo man, Leendert Schouten, to run its finance side, and Vuursteen's promotion is an even clearer sign that Heineken is intent on shaking off its image as a cosy family-run company. Although the jazz-playing billionaire chairman retains considerable influence, outsiders believe that Vuursteen's appointment bears the hallmark of Gerard van Schaik, who took over from Freddy Heineken in 1989. 'In spite of van Schaik's gentle and informal manner, he is the one making the decisions', says one long time Heineken watcher. Under his short stewardship, Heineken has made more money even though it has sold less beer. However, van Schaik is a Heineken veteran, whereas Vuursteen has only been there just over a year.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Getting satisfaction from staff surveys: Nigel Nicholson argues it is in management's own interest to discover what employees really think Employee attitude surveys are becoming popular in British companies. For many, they are a new addition to a portfolio of human resources management techniques. So they are big business for consultancies. But what benefits do surveys yield, and are they worth it? Management traditionalists express some trenchant objections to them which should not be dismissed lightly as primitivism, but provide pause for thought. The objections include that: Good managers already know their staff's opinions. But how do managers know if their reading of opinions is correct? In almost every company survey we have conducted, critical gaps have been revealed between what top management believe staff will say and what staff actually do say. Once managers have overcome their wounded pride at some of the responses, there is much to be learned. The news is never all bad, and there are always things to celebrate. Indeed, in many areas there may be considerable value in confirming what you suspected but could not prove - for example, that staff feel pride in the company, or positive about their immediate bosses. Most valuable, though, will be the early warning of potential trouble spots that sophisticated analysis can reveal. Last, but not least, the comments and reactions of even lowly employees will contain a wealth of perceptive and intelligent suggestions for the future. Surveys are a superficial, impersonal and bureaucratic method. Yes, they are superficial inasmuch as they must ask simple and direct questions, which is more an argument for treating surveys as a step toward deeper inquiry than as ends in themselves. Yes, they are impersonal, to the degree that they rely on standardised questions. They are no substitute for good personal communications. Are surveys bureaucratic? Undoubtedly they sit better with paper-driven than paper- phobic cultures, but management should test the climate by talking to staff doing an early pilot draft. In widely differing kinds of organisation there is an overwhelmingly favourable reaction to the survey initiative. 'Thanks for asking us' is a common response. Surveys give a free-ride to grumblers. Yes they do, but this begs the question of why people want to grumble in the first place. Moreover, there are two ways to protect against the capricious or habitual grumbler. First, benchmarking. For any question it is important to know what is the normal range of response. If you ask people if they are satisfied with their working conditions, you need to know what minimum margin of discontent can reasonably be expected. The second protection is careful question design, avoiding leading or blank-cheque negative ones. This looks easier than it actually is, and artfully designed surveys balance opportunities for open criticism with opportunities for appreciation. Surveys open cans of worms and raise false hopes. The first rule of surveying is that if you do not want to hear the answer, then do not ask the question. Management must be prepared for any possible reaction to a question, not just what it assumes is likely, or what it would like to hear. And it must start thinking, even before the question is asked, what would be its response to negative opinions. In the worst managed companies leaders are likely to explain away or deny bad news. The survey consultant bears a major responsibility here in preparing the ground. Survey design is also critical to the issue of raising of false expectations. Do not ask questions in ways which make it look as if you are holding a referendum. Surveys are not management by plebiscite. Management's commitment, clearly communicated at the outset, should be not only to take action where feasible and desirable, but also to be frank about reasons for not acting where to do so would be unreasonably difficult, contentious or costly. Fast, honest and clear feedback of results and likely outcomes is essential to the reaping of goodwill from a survey. Surveys contain built-in bias because of the unknown opinions of the many who do not respond. This is usually an exaggerated fear. Research following up non- respondents shows that bias is modest when return rates of over 50% are achieved - it is the apathetics rather than the enthusiasts or dissidents who fail to respond. But there are many other more mundane reasons for non-response, such as pressure of work, absenteeism, mislaid survey forms, and distribution failures. However, in a well-designed and carefully introduced survey, levels of 65 per cent plus can be expected. There are also technical ways of checking statistically for bias, and rebalancing data accordingly. So if surveying is not to be taken lightly, what is involved in taking it seriously, and what genuine benefits can be reaped? First, it is best not seen as a one-off exercise, but as a long term continuing commitment to listening to employees. Companies with long traditions of surveying, such as IBM and the Prudential, cultivate 'survey-friendly' environments in which employees expect to be regularly consulted, achieving a norm of high participation rates as a result. One survey is a snapshot, a series gives a moving picture. The benefit here is that the company begins to assemble a human resource database to rival those of the 'hard' functional disciplines of finance and marketing. This has the potential to be used to set targets for measurable and rewardable improvements in management practice. Second, a survey is not just a medical check-up on the corporate body but an exercise in best practice communications. The effective survey is the organisation talking to itself. This is a source of strength on the principle that the intelligent systems which have self-knowledge are better able to survive in a changing world. Surveys also send a 'cultural signal' about openness, listening and responsiveness. For this to be credible, the organisation needs to examine critically its current culture, and to ensure that the culture signal is consistent with the predominant values of the organisation. If not, then it must signal a genuine commitment to moving toward the values of a high-trust and high-involvement culture. Surveys can give a powerful impetus to culture change programmes, as our work with BP's Project 90 and with other companies has shown. But culture change back-tracking, or not seeing itthrough, will do more harm than good. This is not a failing of the survey, but of management action. Given the risks, are surveys worth the cost? A comprehensive survey programme, involving piloting, design, analysis, normative benchmarking and feedback reports can be a sizable investment, but no more than that for many management training programmes and other forms of corporate communication. What do you get for this? Surveys can range over a very wide terrain, including people's careers, their bosses' style, and their company's public image. Surveys also provide potentially valuable data about the experience and qualities of staff across levels and functions, including areas where the company is most vulnerable to losing key staff. Amateurish surveys are damaging. But well-conducted ones which feed into management training, staff development, and strategic planning really can give organisations a leading-edge advantage.

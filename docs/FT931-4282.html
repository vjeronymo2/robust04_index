			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (3): Flying in tight formation - Air Fleet application AT a time when many airlines are shrinking, Britannia, the biggest charter airline in the world, is taking on a new fleet. The project of commissioning new aircraft involves every aspect of the company's operations: engineering, flight operations, catering, cabin services, and training. It was the need to involve so many people in many different tasks that triggered off the acquisition of a PC-based project management system, Hoskyns PMW (Project Manager Workbench). Capt Paul Watson, fleet captain of both the 757 and 767 Airbuses, was designated project manager, somewhat to his own surprise, as he had no project management background. He is a working pilot, whose tasks include flying the new aircraft back from Seattle. With the help of Hoskyns - which was already working at Britannia on its strategic CORE system for crew and aircraft planning - Capt Watson decided on a PC-based solution late in 1990 to help him co-ordinate the resources. His project was to the introduction of an entire fleet over three years. By summer 1994, Britannia will have 14 new 757 Airbuses. The company caters for the charter package holiday market, which has continued to expand even during the recession: Britannia made profits of Pounds 28.7m on a turnover of Pounds 471.9m in 1991. The 757 and 767 models are so similar in cockpit design that some of the tasks can be duplicated for the introduction of both. But back in 1990, the commissioning of the very first five 757s was done within a very tight nine-month timescale. The craft had to be in operation by summer 1991, and that affected everyone in the whole airline. To meet the deadline, Capt Watson first marshalled his resources, and the first step was to sit down with a Hoskyns project management consultant, to do a 'project definition.' 'I found this an interesting exercise, as it is in the very nature of our business to use highly disciplined techniques. Good safety is good business for us, and with high capital investment, you must be able to analyse why you are doing something, how you are doing it, who needs to be involved, and how much it is going to cost. 'Where PMW came in was in deciding what degree of control you need,' says Capt Watson. In the early phases, choosing the exact specification from the 3 ins-thick book of options was a complex task. In providing its 'Royal Class' service in long and short-haul flights, Britannia needs a high standard in such things as the cabin-trim: handicap-assist rails and nappy-changing facilities in the lavatories, video entertainment for all passengers, and a galley to support hot-food service. 'The complete exercise touched everyone in the airline, and we had to have the specification definition done by the right time, which meant everyone had to feed back their requirements,' explains Capt. Watson. He put together a team of eight people, middle managers in flight operations, engineering, customer services, ground operations, pilot training, liaison and finance, helped by the Hoskyns project management consultant. Although he did not use many of the traditional PM techniques apart from Gantt charts (a way of showing project activities as bars on a time chart),the PMW software gave Capt Watson 'the big picture.' 'If I could turn the clock back, I would have used critical-path analysis: it would have been time well spent, although then, it seemed that we didn't have the time to invest in the learning curve,' he comments. Nevertheless, the Gantt chart produced at every meeting focused people's minds. 'A visible piece of paper was the focus of attention. It helped us keep project meetings short and to the point, made sure that we didn't get sidetracked and spend hours on things that could be sorted out by a couple of individual team members outside the meeting. 'Within hours I'd update the activity plan and certainly by the next working day, people had the next week's Gantt chart.' Although PMW remains 'in the toolkit,' it is no longer in active use, and the project management role, following the 1990-91 rush, has passed into other hands. By contrast the team itself has remained in place, because it proved to be such a useful mechanism for dealing with other issues that arose, such as re-organising seating plans. 'I know that I can pick up the phone and get something dealt with by the right person,' explains Capt Watson. 'It gives me a high degree of confidence that things will get done the way I want them to be, because we all talk the same language.' ***** SOFTWARE DETAILS Project Manager Workbench PMW was developed by Applied Business Technology.

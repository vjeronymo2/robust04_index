			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / A complex game of consensus: Japanese ruling party's largest faction tries to pick a new chairman HOLED UP in Tokyo hotel rooms, limousines waiting to rush them to the next closeted gathering, the senior members of the largest faction of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) are playing the complex game of consensus. For the past week, the 109 members of the faction formerly run by the disgraced 'godfather' Mr Shin Kanemaru, have attempted to pick a new chairman, a task made difficult because the faction is itself faction-ridden. Today is supposed to be deadline day, but the leading candidates have modestly denied that they are candidates, and their supporters have denied that there is division, while then accusing their opponents of not honouring an LDP agreement to exercise 'factional restraint'. The unseemly squabble, dominating the television and newspapers, yesterday prompted Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, whose own future depends on the outcome, to encourage the three cabinet ministers involved to devote more time to their portfolios. Status in the faction, often called the Takeshita faction after the former prime minister Mr Noboru Takeshita, is generally based on a simple calculation of how many times a politician has been elected to the parliament. It is a hierarchy much like that of the average Japanese sushi restaurant. Before slicing the fish, the aspiring sushi master must spend about five years, bucket in hand, swabbing the floor and soaping the sushi bench at the end of the night. LDP members, regardless of speaking skills or political vision, are expected to wait patiently in line as they move slowly through the faction and the party. Much of the argument has been among two and three-term members of the faction, who are being courted by the candidates, each of whom has been elected at least eight times. The two-term faction members have set up camp in a hotel room, as have the three-termers, while the four-to-six termers have convened meetings of their 'Isshin-kai', the One Heart Group, as well as holding separate gatherings. The three leading contenders are: Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP secretary-general and the preferred choice of Mr Kanemaru; Mr Keizo Obuchi, also a former LDP secretary-general; and Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister and the likely compromise chairman if the Obuchi and Ozawa factions cannot reach a consensus. There is a danger that the Takeshita faction will split if Mr Obuchi and his supporters suspect that Mr Ozawa has taken permanent control, leaving them dependent on his goodwill for their future ministerial appointments. After six terms, an MP can justifiably expect a ministerial job, preferably one providing corporate contacts able to provide the funds to cultivate a personal network of younger faction members. It was with this complex hierarchy in mind that Mr Seiroku Kajiyama (seven terms) expressed the collective outrage last week that a mere two-termer, Mr Norio Sugiyama, should be the first to hint to the press that the 'godfather' had resigned. For that serious breach of etiquette, Mr Sugiyama was publicly called 'stupid' and privately called much worse.</p>

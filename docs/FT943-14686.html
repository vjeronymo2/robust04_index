			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / UK Company News: EMH buys Normand for Pounds 11.75m European Motor Holdings, the fast growing motor retail and services group, is to acquire Normand Motor Group in a deal worth Pounds 11.75m which will double the size of the group. The proposed acquisition, together with the repayment of Normand's mezzanine debt of Pounds 2m, will be funded through a placing and 2-for-5 open offer at 110p a share designed to raise about Pounds 16.5m. The shares closed 2p lower at 119p yesterday. The deal is expected to be completed at the end of this month, in time for the new registrations bonanza in August. It will substantially broaden EMH's franchise base, particularly in London and south east England, and provide the group with its first Mercedes dealerships. Normand, the subject of a Pounds 31m management buy-out in February 1990 from Allied-Lyons, operates 16 car and four commercial vehicle franchised outlets from 18 locations in the north west, west and south east England and London. The group made operating profits of Pounds 2.15m from motor retail operations on sales of Pounds 11.3m in the year to February 28. Mr Richard Palmer, EMH's chief executive, when reporting a 50 per cent increase in full-year profits last week, indicated that the group was about to announce an acquisition which would require a rights issue. Commenting on the deal yesterday he said it provided, 'an excellent opportunity for the group to broaden its coverage in the motor industry both geographically and in terms of the range of manufacturers it represents.' Under the terms of the proposed deal the consideration will be satisfied by Pounds 10.6m in cash and the issue of 1.05m shares to certain vendors. The placing and open offer of 15m shares will raise Pounds 15.5m net of expenses and has been underwritten by Charterhouse Bank with Charterhouse Tilney Securities as stockbroker to the issue. COMMENT European Motor's management has a solid record for making earning-enhancing acquisitions and knocking them into shape. The Normand deal is unlikely to be an exception. The deal will propel European into the UK motor retail big league and is a good geographic and franchise fit. Meanwhile Normand's operating margin last year was a modest 1.2 per cent providing plenty of scope for improvement. Following the acquisition European should report pre-tax profits of just more than Pounds 8m this year producing earnings of 11.7p. There is little downside risk in the shares and the open offer deserves support.</p>

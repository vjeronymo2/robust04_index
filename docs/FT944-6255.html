			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Inducements to get people back to work - Long-term jobless The Budget includes a wide range of measures to encourage the long-term unemployed back into work through a mixture of incentives and new benefits. The aim is also to improve inducements for the low-paid and the jobless with families to secure full-time work. From April 1996, people who have been out of work for more than six months will be able to receive the full existing rate of housing and council tax benefit for the first four weeks after they take a job. This will cost Pounds 50m a year and help about 440,000 people. The Treasury said local authorities would be consulted shortly about this change. The provision of family credit is also to be speeded up. From April 1996, 95 per cent of family credit claims from employees will be dealt with within five working days of the claim being received by the Department of Social Security at a cost of Pounds 5m a year - helping about 400,000 people. Extra money will be provided for family credit claimants working in full-time jobs. Anyone entitled to family credit who takes a job of more than 30 hours a week will receive an extra Pounds 10 a week premium from July 1995 at a cost of Pounds 205m a year. This is intended to remove the main disincentive to work longer hours after receiving family credit. The benefit currently provides financial assistance to 580,000 families helping them to be better off in work. An extra Pounds 10 a week will ensure that someone working 40 hours a week will receive more in total income after tax than someone working 16 hours. People who also receive housing benefit and council tax benefit will be able to keep an extra Pounds 10 of income before these benefits can be affected, guaranteeing that they will benefit by the full amount of the extra family credit. It is estimated 350,000 families on low incomes will be helped. A new benefit is to be tried, aimed at couples and single people without children over a period of three years in eight locations from October 1996. A total of Pounds 75m will be provided for this. 'Unemployed people tell us three things make them hesitate over whether to take work,' said Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. 'Uncertainty about how to manage between leaving benefit and receiving the first wage; uncertainty about meeting the rent; and uncertainty about being better off. We are tackling all three issues.' The Department of Employment also announced changes to encourage more people to return to work. 'My key priority in this public expenditure round has been to ensure the help and encouragement we offer is effective and targeted on those who need it most, in particular the long-term unemployed,' said Mr Michael Portillo, employment secretary. The government's new back-to-work bonus, worth up to Pounds 1,000 in a lump sum, will be tax-free. This proposal was announced last month; it enables the unemployed to accumulate part-time earnings and receive the bonus when entering a long-term job. There is to be a national extension of the government's jobfinders grant scheme which provides one-off lump sum payments to people out of work for over two years by helping them to fund their transitional costs on returning to work. Up to 25,000 grants averaging Pounds 200 will be available from next April at a cost of Pounds 5m annually. 'Unemployed people often worry, with some justice, that delays in assessing and paying in-work benefits can leave them temporarily short of money,' said the chancellor. 'These measures will give people greater confidence they will not suffer financial hardship in the first few weeks of a new job'. Two schemes are to be introduced for 18-to-24-year-olds out of work for over a year: Workwise, based on four-week courses, and 1-2-1, a series of individual interviews after successful pilot schemes. These will provide intensive help for job searchers by improving their ability to look for work. The cost will be Pounds 10m a year. The schemes will be mandatory for those who refuse other offers of help and replace the old jobplan workshops. The community action programme for the long-term unemployed will continue for the next three years, providing 40,000 job opportunities annually. This provides work experience and a way back into work for those who need it most. Participants receive an allowance equivalent to their unemployment benefit plus Pounds 10 a week with an average stay of four months on the programme. This will cost Pounds 70m a year. Mr Portillo added that the government's main training programme - Training for Work - for the long-term jobless is to focus more sharply on getting people into work. 'We will increase the number of unemployed people who get jobs as a result of the programme from a reduced budget,' he said.</p>

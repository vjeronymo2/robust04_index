			<p>BFN     [Text] The German-Spanish summit ends today with a private  visit by Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to the island of  Ruegen. Before that, at a news conference, Chancellor Kohl and  his Spanish counterpart summarized the results of the 11th round  of government talks in Schwerin. The Spanish head of government  flies home this afternoon.    [Correspondent J. Schlaewe] The first German-Spanish summit  in one of the eastern German states was evidently blessed with  very good fortune. Helmut Kohl and Felipe Gonzalez certainly  noted complete agreement on virtually all European issues  following their talks in Schwerin. This is particularly notable  because Germany's [EU] presidency will be followed by the French  and then the Spanish presidency. This provides new  opportunities for shaping European policy. [Video cuts show  Kohl addressing news conference with Gonzalez]    [Kohl] These are important goals. I need only mention  improving Europe's position as an investment location. Many  proposals from the white paper can be cited here: work on a  joint foreign and security policy to preserve stability and  peace. Another important issue here is relations with the states  undergoing reform in Central, East, and southeastern Europe.    [Schlaewe] However, the accession of the countries  undergoing  reform is not on the agenda either tomorrow or in the immediate  future.    According to Felipe Gonzalez, another important topic of  discussion was bilateral relations. Spain wants, among other  things, to take part in the Eurocorps, which so far has been  reserved for Germany and France. Both heads of government hold  the same view about the automobile industry's problem child,  Seat, VW's subsidiary in Spain. This cooperation could be  supported but it is ultimately up to the company to resolve the  crisis.</p>

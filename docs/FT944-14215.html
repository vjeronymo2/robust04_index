			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: London The Pounds 2.5bn auction will be the focus of interest in the gilts market this week. The market often weakens ahead of auctions. The new stock, which could become next year's five-year benchmark, has already weakened in pre-issue trading. It is a quiet week for UK economic statistics, with the main event tomorrow's Confederation of British Industry quarterly survey of industrial trends. Two key indicators will be closely watched: the first is whether industrialists have succeeded in implementing their expectations of higher prices, recorded in previous surveys; the second is whether capacity utilisation has increased, a worry which was intensified by last week's British Chambers of Commerce survey. The CBI survey is one of the key indicators cited by Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, in their monthly monetary meetings. Throughout 1994, the gilts market has proved unable to escape for long the influence of international bond markets. Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, thinks that overseas statistics, notably US third-quarter gross domestic product growth and the German consumer price index, will have the most significant effect on the UK market this week.</p>

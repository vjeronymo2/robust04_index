			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equities futures and options trading Stock index futures were led lower by the sharp retreat in gilts, and fears of another fall today were heightened by a slide in the June futures contract in after hours trading, writes Joel Kibazo. The Liffe June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,125, down 30 on its previous close and around 8 points below its fair value premium to cash of about 10 points. Volume at the official close was 18,246 contracts. Buying mostly by independent traders (locals) helped the contract record a high of 3,164 in the first half of the session, before sellers gained the upper hand. June suffered further in after hours trading following a slide in the S&amp;P futures in the US which were down 7.7 points at the worst. It fell to 3,105 prompting fears of another sell off in the UK market today. In the Liffe mid-250, June closed at 3,770 on favourable volume of 632 contracts. In Liffe traded options, total volume slipped back to 41,170. The FT-SE 100 option saw business of 18,067 contracts and the Euro FT-SE 3,415 lots. Among stock options, British Gas was the most active with a total of 2,382 lots and was followed by Kingfisher at 1,439. BT, Wellcome and Allied-Lyons were also busy.</p>

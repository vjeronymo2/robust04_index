			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / IG Metall selects Steinkuhler successor MR KLAUS ZWICKEL was yesterday nominated to succeed Mr Franz Steinkuhler as president of IG Metall, the German engineering union. His selection, made by the union's directorate, was widely expected and followed Mr Steinkuhler's resignation two weeks ago after allegations of insider share trading. Mr Zwickel, formerly deputy president, is acknowledged as a tough negotiator but said to lack the political skills of his predecessor. He takes over Germany's biggest and most influential union at a time of mounting tension. Mr Hans Peter Stihl, head of the federal chamber of trade and industry, last weekend demanded a pay freeze lasting several years. Other challenges facing the union include employers' demands for an end to the steady reduction in working hours and a return to weekend working. Mr Zwickel's nomination and that of Mr Walter Riester, the Stuttgart regional leader, as his deputy, are expected to be confirmed at a union assembly in October.</p>

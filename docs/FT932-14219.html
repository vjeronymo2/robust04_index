			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / The Lex Column: French markets Investors delivered a telling verdict on yesterday's cut in French interest rates. The stability of the franc against the D-Mark underlined how far sentiment has turned, but the new government should not break out the champagne. The 35 basis point cut in the intervention rate simply brings official rates into line with the drift of money market rates since the election. Real rates remain painfully high and Mr Balladur is mulling over higher taxes. French equities were rightly unimpressed. Efforts to raise the tempo ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting will doubtless fall on deaf ears.</p>

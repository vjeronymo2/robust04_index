			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Arts: Mitridate, re di Ponto - Opera This performance caused the biggest uproar I have ever witnessed at Covent Garden, when an eagle tethered to the ground fell over and was left upside down flapping its wings through the opera's long opening aria. A pair of parakeets due to come on later wisely cancelled their appearance. By and large opera does not enflame emotions in Britain. I have been in an audience in Germany which drowned the music with whistles and football rattles; another in Italy drove the tenor off the stage before he had a chance to sing the top C they were convinced he did not have. British audiences, their laudable concern for birds and animals aside, are more tolerant and two years ago welcomed the Royal Opera's adventurous staging of Mozart's Mitridate, re di Ponto. That was Mozart bicentenary year, when it was even possible to stage a 14-year-old's first try at an opera seria. On stage his early works tend to look drily conventional these days, unless the production stamps its own personality upon them. The Royal Opera's production team - Graham Vick (producer) and Paul Brown (designer) - did just that. It may be that this Mitridate will eventually come to look typical of a passing fad for designer-label minimalist staging, but for the moment it seems fresh and striking in its simplicity, its perspectives, above all its magnificent blend of colours - deep glowing red, shot through with blues and piercing yellows. Vick has accepted that in Mozart's day the performance style would have been stylised and, shunning a straight period copy, has sought a 1990s equivalent. The result suggests Far-Eastern ritual. Arms are delicately suspended, hands preciously clasped, in a style which can quickly become irritating if it is overdone. When Lillian Watson is singing with bright spontaneity, it is no help to have her and her attendents practising slow-motion wrist exercises. When it matters, however, the idea is quietly set aside. The first sign of the great operatic master Mozart was to become occurs in the scene when Mitridate returns home from war, a foreshadowing of Idomeneo's moving homecoming. Helped by the production's ability to set a newly serious mood, Bruce Ford sang of the 'beloved shores' with masterful poise. Of his two (originally castrato) sons, Ann Murray's strong Sifare was more successful at breaking the formal mould than the soft-grained Farnace of Jochen Kowalski. The main newcomer to the cast was Luba Orgonasova as Aspasia. A perfectly-formed and delicate soprano voice, an extremely able technician, all that is known from recordings already. On stage she unfortunately sounded small-scale and unable to stir emotions with the voice. Paul Daniel was perhaps insufficiently strong-minded at shaping her slow music, but in everything that was fast he proved a positive, vital Mozart conductor. This Mitridate deserves to come back again, although next time I imagine the only birds on display will be the vocal canaries. Further performances until 3 November</p>

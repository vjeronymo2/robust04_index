			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the Hungarian </F> Socialist Party, by Julius Gembicky in Budapest; date not given:  "If I Win, I Offer Reconciliation"]    [Text] The Socialists' enormous edge in the latest polls  on party preferences prior to the May elections in neighboring  Hungary comes as a surprise, to say the least, to many  competitors. For the right-wing government coalition and the  Christian Democrats it is downright devastating. The election  campaign proper starts on Friday, 8 April; in the course of the  campaign, there will be a moratorium on press, radio, and  television interviews with the parties' electoral leaders.  NARODNA OBRODA has therefore asked Gyula Horn, chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], to reply to our questions now.    [Gembicky] Mr. Chairman, to what do you ascribe your  position as the favorite?    [Horn] After 1990, several parliamentary parties tried to  isolate the Socialists. Our reply was an intensive dialogue  with society. In Parliament we concentrated only on specific  solutions to society's transformation. Why was this important?  The fact is that we did not inherit the new social and  political configuration from Rakosi's regime. Quite the  contrary, Kadar's barracks were regarded even in the West as the  merriest in Central and Eastern Europe. Even under Kadar's  regime, there existed elements of the market economy and its  management. As early as January 1988, we passed in Hungary the  law on the freedom of private enterprise, which would have been  inconceivable in Slovakia at that time. We ourselves enabled,  by means of law, the emergence of a multiparty society and  maintained open contacts with Western democracies. This  distinguished us from the CSSR [Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]  and the other countries of this region. Hence, there was  something to build on. The new government that emerged from the  elections in 1990 tried to change all kinds of things.  Unfortunately, it did not focus on economic transformation but  on ideological issues and the unproductive reassessment of the  past. This was not all that interesting to ordinary people, who  want to know how they are going to make a living. We therefore  decided to deal precisely with those issues that are of interest  to the broadest sections of society. That is one of the main  causes of our party's popularity. We purposefully refrained  from personal invectives against political adversaries In  Parliament. Simply, we dealt with the down-to-earth problems of  our country. And, last but not least, it needs to be said that  we have a competent team of politicians and experts to translate  those principles into reality. I myself was a member of  Nemeth's cabinet, which had a European hallmark [punc] abroad as  well as at home.    [Gembicky] Even though you top the pre-election polls with  between 30 and 33 percent of the vote, it could happen to you  that your competitors join forces and push you into the  opposition once again after the elections. With whom would you  be ready to form a post-election coalition, should a coalition  be necessary?    [Horn] That is the most frequent question I have been asked  recently. The reply? It will be given by the two-round  elections. We will see then with whom we can cooperate and with  whom not.    [Gembicky] Mr. Horn, can even a coalition with the  right-wing Liberals from Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats]  be considered?    [Horn] I do not know what Fidesz is up to because it changes  its opinions every month. But we do consider the possibility of  a coalition with Liberals, particularly with the Free Democrats  [Alliance of Free Democrats -- SZDSZ].    [Gembicky] A few days ago the parties making up today's  government coalition pushed through in Hungarian Parliament the  adoption of a screening law. An important, and perhaps sole,  reason for the passage of this law was the endeavor to eliminate  the most formidable competitor -- Gyula Horn. Will the law  apply to you, in view of your participation in Ministry of  Interior units in 1956? Do you have a chance to successfully  defend yourself against this accusation and those pressures?    [Horn] This law was not passed personally against me. It  should affect, above all, hidden resident agents. There are no  secret spots in my biography, neither in the fifties, nor in the  sixties or later years. Besides, the screening law does not  provide for any sanctions. Its sole aim is to make the past of  Hungarian political officials more transparent.    [Gembicky] What is the Hungarian Socialists' recipe for  reducing tension in Slovak-Hungarian relations?    [Horn] I do not think that the Hungarians and Slovaks as  nations stand in opposition to one another. We want to push for  historical reconciliation with neighbors and, therefore, we must  not allow nationalist politicians to take the helm in any of our  countries. Therefore, there is no need to deal primarily with  the past, with the burden represented by historical treaties.  That is of no real significance. Should we become a government  party, we would want to conclude a large general agreement with  the Slovak Republic that ought to be the first big step toward  building up mutual trust. On the part of Hungary, this  agreement must chiefly contain the element of unchangeability of  current borders. At the same time, the two sides should pledge  to observe the rights of ethnic minorities living on their  territories. This commitment would apply to both Hungarians in  Slovakia and Slovaks in Hungary. The other element should be a  general activation of mutual relations because, in my opinion,  little has been done in the economic sphere although both  Slovakia and Hungary acutely need new markets. The  clarification of neuralgic points in the past should be left to  historians, instead of drawing into them politicians, who keep  reviving them and highlighting their relevance as its suits  their needs. That is pointless. As regards matters that  introduce neurosis [neurotizuju] into our mutual relations, such  as military issues, we must establish a system of mutual  consultations. It is simply not true that Hungary is building  up its army against Slovakia or that Slovakia is building up its  army against Hungary. There are several such mutual problems  that would require very intensive bilateral talks.    It would be very unfortunate if the practice of relations  introduced by the present Hungarian Government and the former  cabinet of Vladimir Meciar were to be perpetuated. Whenever any  Hungarian nationalist made any oblique remark about Slovakia,  Meciar immediately reacted to it. And the view of a narrow  group was presented as the official Hungarian position. Let me  say one more thing in conclusion. In my opinion, Hungary must  support all efforts aimed at Slovakia's integration into  European structures -- naturally, under conditions as are  applicable to everyone. And, as far as you are concerned, I  would recommend that you leave in peace the question of  bilingual city and village signposts and constitutionally  guarantee the rights of ethnic minorities. We also do not  consider right all your ideas about Slovakia's territorial and  administrative division and the reorganization of state  administration and local self-administration, because the  intended arrangement does not sufficiently accommodate the  demands of Hungarians living in Slovakia.    [Gembicky] What significance do you attribute to cooperation  among Visegrad countries from the long-term viewpoint?    [Horn] Visegrad needs to be kept alive, even though, to be  honest, I do not think that this cooperation has any great  prospects. I prefer the enhancement of bilateral relations  between the member countries of this group.    [Gembicky] One bone of contention in our relations is the  Gabcikovo hydroelectric project and the demand that we increase  the flow of water in the old riverbed of the Danube. Do you  think that you will be able to find with the provisional  government, or with the government that will emerge in Slovakia  after the fall parliamentary elections, common language and a  compromise even in this matter?    [Horn] Results can only be achieved by means of compromise.  This problem, too, needs to be consistently depoliticized and  its solution must be left to experts. The Hungarian side's  demand that Slovakia secure sufficient flow of water is  justified. Therefore, this is not a political but a practical  problem for experts. Not only the present Moravcik government  but also the one that will be appointed after the fall elections  must be a true partner in solving this problem.    [Gembicky] A broad-coalition government has taken up office  in Slovakia. Is there, in your opinion, a chance, and does the  political will exist, for a historic Hungarian-Slovak settlement  in the near future?    [Horn] I assess the first steps of the Moravcik government  positively. He wants to negotiate and cooperate, which is  encouraging. I therefore think that it is worthwhile to  negotiate with Mr. Moravcik even in the brief period prior to  the elections.    [Gembicky] Mr. Horn, do you not think that the present  government coalition headed by the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF] might try to make up for all the missed opportunities in  Slovak-Hungarian relations even before the elections, only to  reverse the preferences indicated by pre-election polls?    [Horn] Such a reversal cannot be party business. Even if we  have some disputes with the MDF in the way we view bilateral  relations, bilateral relations represent state interest and,  therefore, I do not believe that the MDF could change the  existing trend in bilateral relations in some radical way before  the elections. The opposition parties maintain good relations  with their Slovak counterparts, so that they would be capable of  securing continuity in Hungarian-Slovak relations even after the  elections.    [Gembicky] Mr. Horn, do you think that the Hungarian nation  is prepared to accept a socialist government or a socialist  prime minister?    [Horn] Let this be determined by the voters. We have a  chance to win, we have many sympathizers, but I do not know  whether this will be enough. I only know that many are ready to  accept a socialist government, not only in our own country but  also abroad, including large financial institutions. As the  Polish example has shown, a left-wing government can manage to  conclude agreements abroad that are very advantageous for the  country. I do not see any problem for the Socialists to  participate in a coalition government either.    [Gembicky] What is the nature of your relations with the  Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] of Peter Weiss? Wherein do  your views coincide and wherein do the views between the  Hungarian Socialist Party and the SDL differ?    [Horn] We have very good contacts with the SDL and with  Peter Weiss personally. We also have identical views on most  problems. If differences appear, it is always in connection with  our views on how to deal with the position of the Hungarian  ethnic minority in Slovakia. But we will be able to come to an  agreement even on this issue. The SDL's policy is in conformity  with European criteria and I am therefore an optimist even with  regard to the Hungarian minority. I have only the best things  to say about Peter Weiss. If we, but also the SDL, became  government parties after the elections, it would have a positive  influence on bilateral relations and their improvement.    [Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 9 April on page 3,  under the headline "What Has Remained in the Notebook; Mass  Media and Government Propaganda," carries the following 200-word  report:    ["Recently we published an interview that was given by  Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn to our editor  Julius Gembicky. One question from that interview, which is  topical in Budapest and Bratislava alike, remained in the  notebook:    [[Gembicky] ``During its reciprocal visit to Budapest, a  delegation of the Slovak Syndicate of Journalists familiarized  itself with the situation in Hungarian Radio and Television in  the wake of the March personnel purges in these two most  important media, which had been initiated behind the scenes by  the government. What is the Hungarian Socialists' attitude  toward these events, which took place shortly before the  elections?    [[Horn] ``We consider it unacceptable for the government to  try to bring large media under its control. Regrettably, the  enforced changes have already made themselves felt in programs,  which are dominated by government propaganda. This is  undemocratic and a gross violation of the principles of freedom  of speech. After the elections in May it will be necessary to  pass a big media law and establish a nonpartisan body to oversee  the electronic media so that they do not depend on a single  political party.'']</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Payouts from Law Society reach record The Law Society paid a record Pounds 22.7m compensation for solicitors' dishonesty last year, the annual report of the Solicitors Complaints Bureau showed yesterday. The bureau blames falling incomes in the profession as a result of the recession for a sharp increase in complaints of poor service and alleged dishonesty by solicitors. Complaints rose 15 per cent to 19,582, and the number of firms accused of dishonesty rose 14 per cent. The record Pounds 22.7m payment of compensation to the clients of dishonest solicitors represents a 52 per cent increase on the 1992 figure. The bureau also reports that applications to the Society's Compensation Fund have risen this year. The bureau was forced to intervene in the running of 85 firms last year, an increase of 20 per cent over the 1992 figure. It investigated 516 firms' accounts and in nearly 60 per cent of cases it found material breaches of the solicitors' accounts rules. Investigations revealed instances of mortgage fraud, advance fee fraud, breaches of undertakings and money laundering. There was also a rise in the number of disciplinary actions taken against solicitors. Mrs Veronica Lowe, the bureau's head, said however that there had been a significant improvement in complaints handling. The bureau had disposed of more than 18,000 complaints and 70 per cent had been dealt with without the need for a formal investigation. Mr Michael Barnes, the legal services ombudsman, criticised the bureau earlier this year for placing too much emphasis on tracking down fraudsters at the expense of dealing with the mass of complaints about poor service and delays.

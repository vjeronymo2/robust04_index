Speaking to reporters in Doha on Saturday [22 January], he  said Iran as a powerful country which plays a major role in  preservation of security and tranquility in the region, is ready  to cooperate with regional countries.    He stressed that withdrawal of foreign forces and fleet from  the Persian Gulf waters not only would not harm security in the  region but would rather reinforce it.    Referring to Iran-UAE dispute, Besharati said the two  neighbors could settle their dispute over one of the Persian  Gulf islands through negotiations and remarked that Iran had  repeatedly voiced readiness in this connection.    He further noted that interference of foreign countries  should not be interpreted as their concern for security, adding  that Iran would never interfere in the affairs of regional  countries.    On fabrications made by some western media on human rights  violation in Iran, the minister said those in fact were  supporting terrorists who were involved in the massacre of many  Iranian senior officials and civilians.    He regretted fratricide in Afghanistan and noted that Iran,  like other Muslim countries, had made diplomatic efforts to  establish peace and tranquility in that country and assured that  the dispute could be solved through negotiations.</p>

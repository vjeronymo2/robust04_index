			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Italian parties take hard line in government talks: Scalfaro plans further round of negotiations Italy's main political parties have staked out intransigent positions in the initial round of consultations held by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to resolve the country's government crisis. As the president winds up today his preliminary soundings, it has become clear that he will insist on further extensive discussions with political leaders before taking a decision. He will also be anxious to test whether there is any flexibility in the hardline positions adopted by the parties. Political commentators were saying yesterday that he was unlikely to reveal his hand before the end of next week. The prospect of a long drawn-out crisis put renewed pressure on the lira yesterday and it fell through the psychological floor of L1,050 against the D-Mark to a new record low. Following last Thursday's resignation of the eight-month-old Berlusconi government, the parties are split between those for and against early elections. Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the out-going premier, told the president bluntly this week that he had no option but to dissolve parliament and call a snap election. 'We see no other solution but going to the polls,' Mr Berlusconi said after seeing the president on Wednesday. The premier claims that he and his rightwing coalition were given a mandate to govern which can be usurped by no other political alliance. This view is shared by his allies. Mr Berlusconi has even backed up the call for a quick electoral test by suggesting the end of March as the polling date - exactly a year after he scored his triumphal success with his Forza Italia movement less than three months after entering politics. But yesterday Mr Massimo D'Alema, the leader of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left and the effective head of the opposition, voiced a completely contrary view after meeting President Scalfaro. 'We have told Scalfaro he cannot dissolve parliament so long as the majority of deputies believe a new government must be formed,' he said. In the chamber of deputies Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia, plus its remaining allies - the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, the Christian Democratic centre and the Radical reformers of Mr Marco Pannella - can muster 277 votes. Even with the backing of some members of the populist Northern League which has left the coalition, Mr Berlusconi falls short of the 316-vote majority. In contrast the combined vote of the opposition is close to 360 if the full League contingent is included. Mr Berlusconi knows the longer the delay in elections the more he is likely to lose a sympathy vote. His opponents are meanwhile determined to place as many obstacles in his path as possible to prevent him returning to government. The opposition also shares President Scalfaro's view that early elections without further reform of the electoral system and some fresh budgetary adjustments would be damaging to the country. However, these measures could not easily be forced upon Mr Berlusconi and his allies, who might retaliate by resigning en masse to demonstrate the lack of legitimacy in the continued life of the parliament.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The finance, planning, and mines and energy  ministers yesterday announced -- two days ahead -- that fuel  prices would be increased by 16.5-percent as of 26 January.    The peculiarity in this increase is that the price  adjustment  is lower than the inflation rate.    The fuel price adjustment for January will stand at 36.3  percent, compared with 38.6 percent in December. This means the  adjustment is 2.3-percent less. The drop is based on a cut in  international oil prices and an increase in the productivity of  Petrobras [Brazilian Petroleum Corporation].    This increase will have a 0.7-percent impact on the  wholesale  price index calculated by the Getulio Vargas Foundation.    Winston Fritsch, Finance Ministry economic policy secretary,  said that the policy of correcting prices below the inflation  rate will be extended to all the utility rates.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (5): Number one on the 'wish list' - Information technology moves up the table of priorities IMPROVEMENT of information technology (IT) systems is now the number one target for future development by distribution industry executives. Fuelling that interest is the desire to reduce as far as possible the paperwork traditionally associated with distribution operations. But complicating the picture is the fact that distribution companies often have to work with a wide range of customer IT systems and service requirements. According to research conducted for the UK Institute of Logistics &amp; Distribution Management's recently published 1991/92 Survey of Distribution Costs, IT improvement has moved from number three the previous year to number one on the distribution sector's 'wish list'. In terms of areas where changes were being actively considered, IT systems achieved a rating of 13 per cent, ahead of strategy review (10 per cent), centralisation of distribution ( 9 per cent), and expansion of warehouse and automation of warehouse (both 8 per cent). 'Generally, there appears to have been a shift from a short term focus to longer term issues such as IT and strategic developments,' comments the ILDM survey, conducted in conjunction with Touche Ross. Such thinking is confirmed by leading individual distribution industry executives. Mr John Galloway, logistics director of ASDA Stores, says the high ground for the 1990s will be for the retailers and distributors who plan logistics strategies based on tomorrow's expectations as well as today's requirements. 'And those expectations are the fast and accurate transfer of information and shared experiences,' he adds. Distribution industry IT development over the past few years has followed a number of paths. One has involved the establishment by large multinational operators of global systems designed to increase the efficiency of dealings with large customer bases. Particularly prominent in have been the leading express companies such as TNT, Federal Express, United Parcel Service and DHL, all of which are now important players on the general international distribution scene. Leading freight forwarders are also moving that way - Swiss-based Danzas, for example, has developed a programme called Danzlink which, it claims, will have a far-reaching effect on European forwarding. 'Danzlink allows shippers to exchange information with both Danzas and any other freight forwarder which conforms to UN/EDIFACT syntax rules, PC (personal computer) to PC and PC to mainframe,' it adds. That sort of flexibility will be crucial to future distribution industry IT development, say informed observers. IT services group Eyetech, which has worked with distribution companies such as UK parcels carrier Elan, elaborates on that point. 'A couple of years back there was a lot of talk among distribution companies about using IT systems development to tie in customers. But that was always a rather naive view - customers were never going to be happy with that sort of situation,' says Mr Alan Redhouse, chairman of Eyetech. 'The key is to find systems which are sufficiently flexible, within very wide margins, to deal with anything the customer wants to send or receive. I think we will also start to see the emergence of systems which will suit any carrier.' Another significant area of distribution industry IT development centres on finding ways of enabling smaller distribution companies to successfully participate in the use of EDI and other systems. The EC, for instance, is supporting a Pounds 5m project to test the usefulness of advanced EDI and other information systems for smaller pan-European transport operators. Britain's involvement is being co-ordinated by Professor Michael Browne who is sponsored by transport company BRS to research distribution issues. 'The success of the bigger carriers over the past five years has relied on the ability to use advanced information systems using EDI. We aim to harness technology and make it accessible to smaller operators,' he says. Another marked trend in distribution industry IT development has seen some distribution service companies' focus on the development of case-specific software and hardware solutions for particular local applications. That is the case at Transport Development Group which includes a range of different UK and Continental distribution companies. Mr Kevin Ashby, IT adviser to the TDG board, says group computer requirements are shared where feasible but individual companies then put in what they need locally 'because they are closer to the coal face'. 'We have to cater for individual customers' different IT demands and service requirements. Some customers, for instance, will insist that you, as a distribution service contractor, use their systems for things like stock control but may leave you to use your own system for fleet management,' he adds. NFC group UK delivery company Lynx reinforces the need for IT systems flexibility. 'For the larger users of our services, it is important to keep data systems flexible, to match their existing supply-chain management information systems in the areas of order processing, materials planning and inventory management,' says Mr Kevin Appleton, Lynx sales and marketing director. Another feature of general distribution industry IT development is a continuing move to expand the scope of such systems beyond simple warehouse and fleet management operations. TNT Contract Logistics, for example, has just launched a new computer software package called Class (Contract Logistics Administration Services System). Mr Iain Speak, general manager of TNT Contract Logistics Netherlands, says one of the main features of Class is that it allows the company to undertake the full accounting role for clients, in addition to providing them with distribution services. The advantages of EDI implementation to the freight and distribution industry are summed up by IT company A T &amp; T EasyLink Services. 'Companies can exchange transport data with trading partners with greater speed and efficiency and can ensure that the dispatch of goods is monitored at every stage of transportation,' claims the company.  ------------------------------------------------------------ AREAS OF FUTURE DEVELOPMENT Wish List  ------------------------------------------------------------ Position*       Desirable                         Requiring %  ------------------------------------------------------------ 1 (3)           Improve IT systems                         13 2               Review strategy                            10 3 (7)           Centralise distribution                     9 4 (2)           Expansion of warehouse                      8 5 (10)          Automate warehouse                          8 6               Move into Europe                            7 7 (6)           Improve stock control                       4 8               Introduce bar coding                        4 9               Reduce lead time                            4 10              Improve efficiency                          3  ------------------------------------------------------------ * Figures in parenthesis represent last year's survey results  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: ILDM Survey of Distribution Costs, 1991/92  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / European banks expect telephone services to grow Almost all the banks in Europe which have not already developed telephone banking facilities are planning to do so within the next six years according to a survey published today, writes Alison Smith. A poll by Datamonitor, the market research group, found that 65 per cent of banks already offered telephone banking and a further 30 per cent of total respondents were planning to provide such a service. Across 12 European countries, the target markets seen by banks for the telephone service were primarily those in the 25-44 age group. Beyond that core, however, banks in different countries diverged more significantly in their target markets. Those in Austria, France, Germany and Sweden, for example, saw the 18-24 age group as the third target area, while banks in Finland, Ireland, Spain and the UK cited the 45-54 age group as more of a priority. The 83 banks which responded to the survey expected increasingly to provide general insurance, mortgages, personal loans and financial advice over the telephone where they did not do so already. The poll found that telephone banking had penetrated the retail banking market most extensively in Sweden and Belgium, and made least impact in Italy and Portugal.</p>

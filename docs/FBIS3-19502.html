			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Patrick Anspach: "EU: $4.2 Billion in Airline </F> Aid"]    [Text] A brief comment by the Lufthansa spokesman in  Belgium aroused our curiosity. At the last meeting of the  German company with the Belgian aviation press, Paul Vandermoere  stated that, according to a "British study," each Belgian  taxpayer paid some 64,000 Belgian francs [BFr] to Lufthansa's  competitor on routes to Germany: namely Sabena.    As there are some 5.9 million taxpayers in Belgium, we  understood that the total contribution came to something in the  region of BFr38 billion. Apparently this was an underestimate,  as the individual in question had based his calculations on the  total Belgian population. Which means a true figure of some  BFr64 billion.    For 1993? We thought this was much too high. Or else there  was some misunderstanding. The only way to form a clear picture  was to take a look at the report consulted by Lufthansa, but  which the company -- understandably -- refused to supply. But  as luck would have it a copy landed on our desk one morning and  provided some very interesting facts -- and not only about  Sabena.  <H5>  Capital Increase... </H5>   The study in question was carried out by the Economist  Intelligence Unit [EIU] last year and is entitled "Travel and  Tourism Analyst."    In this study, the EIU acknowledges that "the European  Commission made no bones about finding out whether or not the  member states should or should not be airline owners," while  stating that, for the Americans at least, such a situation is  inevitably seen as favoring disguised public aid. This U.S.  accusation is countered in Europe with the argument that the  rules of Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy Code is also contrary  to the rules of fair competition. But the fact remains that,  since August 1991, several government "subsidies" have been  granted to various European airlines. These are, according to  the study:     -  Sabena: 65.4 billion Belgian francs [BFr] ($1.8  billion) in August 1991, an amount accepted by the Commission,  on condition that no other aid is granted. The study notes that  the "package" also includes the wiping off of a BFr16.2 billion  public debt and a capital injection of BFr19 billion. The  figure quoted by the Lufthansa representative does not therefore  relate to 1993, but must be a part of Pierre Godefroid's Phenix  plan for restructuring Sabena.    -  Air France: 2 billion French  francs [FFr] in December 1991, FFr1.3 billion in mid-1992 and  FFr1.5 billion in early 1993, or $370, 260, and 270 million  respectively. The EIU reports that the first injection,  although directly public, was accepted by the European  Commission as it was a capital increase by the majority  shareholder. The second relates to the BNP's acquisition of an  8.8    -  stake in the Air France capital. The third relates to an  investment by the CDC [Deposit and Consignment Office] and is  the subject of a study by the European Commission to decide  whether or not it should be considered as state aid, given the  CDC's status.    -  Iberia: 120 billion pesetas ($1.2 billion) in  August 1992, an amount accepted by the Commission as part of the  company's modernization plans, in particular for fleet  renewal.    -  Air Portugal: 35.1 billion escudos ($260 million) both  to wipe off a debt and convert 3.1 billion escudos into shares.  <H5>  Or State Aid </H5>   The recent "report of the wise men," the group headed by  Herman De Croo, seems to favor the system of "One aid, last  aid." The above companies (including Sabena and Air France)  should therefore leave it at that and, in future, expect to be  self-reliant. The EIU's report, in speaking of "possible future  aid" (remember that it dates from last year), mentions the Irish  government's contribution to Aer Lingus ($250 million) as part  of a restructuring plan, together with a new requirement on the  part of Air France for which the government would be willing to  inject FFr5 billion. Since then, it has become clear that Air  France is likely to be asking FFr8 billion.    The question now is therefore that of interpretation of the  notion of "last chance."    The management of the French company is playing a double  game which although very understandable is difficult to unravel  as it is addressed at two publics. On the one hand, it is said  that Air France could disappear tomorrow if (in this order) the  unions reject Christian Blanc's restructuring plan or if the  Commission also fails to accept it. On the other hand, it is  said that France would never abandon its national company, the  question being the price which would have to be paid.    All of which raises some real questions regarding the  "ethics" of the European Commission's work. Let's assume that  Delors and his team accept a capital injection from the French  government of Ffr 8 billion. The aim would be to ensure the  company's recovery. But what if this recovery included the  discontinuation of flights to certain destinations, leaving the  way free for the competition (which by the way?), for example?  And as Sabena is linked to Air France would it too have to  indirectly suffer? And, finally, to put it bluntly: if Air  France were to fold, what would be the fate of Sabena?    While a private investor may consider it necessary to inject  new capital into his company, the question remains whether a  government which is the majority shareholder also enjoys that  same right. Of course, you could ask that government to consult  its shareholders (the taxpayers), but that is rather a  simplistic view as the unions are at pains to point out.    Nevertheless, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit  (a  British organization), since August 1991 some $4.2 billion have  been invested by governments or public institutions in European  airlines and this may be no more than the beginning. It is  understandable that certain companies take this badly and in  particular Lufthansa which has been forced, facing a  "state-aided Sabena," to cut flights to Berlin due to  overcapacity. However, the problem lies in the status of  companies -- whether in Europe or elsewhere -- in which the  government is shareholder. This sensitive question is far from  being resolved.</p>

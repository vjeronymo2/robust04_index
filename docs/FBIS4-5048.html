			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- Japanese and Russian  shipping companies have agreed to open a ferry route between  Sakhalin and two Japanese port cities in Hokkaido -- Otaru and  Wakkanai -- in April 1995, a Transport Ministry official said  Wednesday [6 April]. The agreement, which came after two days  of talks ended in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Wednesday, also calls for  serving the new ferry route on a trial basis in July, the  official said.    The shipping talks were held under a February 1991 agreement  between the Japanese and then Soviet governments.    The two sides are slated to meet again between late May and  early June in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk to negotiate details of the  trial service, including how many and how long.</p>

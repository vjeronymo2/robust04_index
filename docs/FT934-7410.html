			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: US group buys LLMH's Roc unit LVMH, the French luxury goods group, has agreed to sell its Roc beauty products subsidiary to Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US health care products group. The French company yesterday refused to disclose the value of the sale, but industry analysts said it was likely to be at least Dollars 150m. Last year, Roc reported sales of about FFr677m (Dollars 114.5m) and net profits of about FFr20m. The sale of Roc, which makes products ranging from shampoo to skin cream and lipstick, is part of LVMH's strategy of focusing on core brands and businesses. 'We want to concentrate our efforts on perfume and beauty products, relying on our Christian Dior, Givenchy and Kenzo brands,' the company said. Roc's products are sold through pharmacies in more than 50 countries. LVMH said the distribution channels for Roc's products were different from those of other beauty goods, which was another reason for the sale. The disposal of Roc comes as the group is working on plans to reorganise its champagne interests. LVMH, which suffered a loss of FFr100m from its champagne activities in the first half of the year, denied reports in the French press that it was considering the sale of it Pommery champagne house. However, it is expected to place its Moet et Chandon and Veuve Clicquot houses under a single management structure. The reorganised champagne business is expected to be headed by Mr Yves Benard, chairman of Moet et Chandon. The stock market welcomed the sale of Roc to Johnson &amp; Johnson. Shares in LVMH rose about 3 per cent, to FFr3,761, as investors forecast that proceeds from the sale would help reduce borrowings, which resulted in financial charges of about FFr1.85bn last year. Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, expects the state-owned flag-carrier to report a loss of around FFr7bn for 1993, Reuter reports from Paris. Previous estimates from the airline pointed to a deficit of more than FFr5bn this year. The revised forecast was given at a board meeting this week which also approved the appointment of new managing director Mr Rodolphe Frantz.</p>

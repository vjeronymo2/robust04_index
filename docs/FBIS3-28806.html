			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] North Korean [NK] propaganda  claiming that Kim Chong-il is inspecting front-line units,  pushing for more military training, and carrying out other  vigorous leadership activities is greatly increasing.    Through his "outstanding, military leadership skills," Kim  Chong-il directly managed     -  the April, 1964 hostile action at the Military Demarcation  Line,    -  the January, 1968 taking of the U.S. naval vessel Pueblo,  and    -  the April, 1969 downing of an EC-121 aircraft, reported the  official North Korean Central News Agency [KCNA] through its  broadcast (on November 10th) of the "Kim Chong-il Revolutionary  History, Lecture Number 78."    Before this, through a commentary program (April 17th)  called, "With the Wisdom and Courage of a Supreme Commander,"  the KCNA claimed that Kim Chong-il "made brilliant contributions  in strengthening the nations defense in every way":     -  by visiting North Korean Army [NKA] front-line guard posts  in February, 1963, encouraging "one-is-worth-a-hundred fighting  power";    -  by visiting naval units in mid-October, 1975,  inspecting fleet maneuver training and marine training amid the  inclement weather of a driving storm; and    -  understanding the  pattern, order of battle and organization of the tactical  preparations of units above division level, by making concrete  suggestions on capability and material augmentation and on  combat usage of such units, to mark the 50th anniversary of the  founding of the NKA on April 25, 1984.    Thus highlighting Kim Chong-il's leadership activities  concerning the NKA, to further accentuate his military  leadership ability, in November NK created a new KCNA discussion  program called, "The Great Presence of the Supreme Commander"  (presently on third broadcast), and the Ministry of People's  Armed Forces [MPAF] held (November 11th) a "Forum for the Study  and Discussion of the Greatness of Comrade Kim Chong-il."    In the program (KCNA November 14), "The Great Presence of  the  Supreme Commander," Kim Chong-il was held up as, "An  extraordinarily brilliant supreme commander with complete  mastery of Kim Il-song's autonomous military thought and  tactics," and as, "an extraordinarily brilliant supreme  commander who knows not even an instant of worry or agitation,  though the most powerful enemy in the world attacks, who lays  out bold operational plans with great ease, before which his  frightened enemies fall, who has courage and will power as yet  not possessed by any other in the world."    In a forum in which senior military officials, Chief of  General Staff Choe Kwang, General Political Bureau Deputy  Director Yi Pong-won, and MPAF Deputy Minister Kim Kwang-chin  participated, Kim Chong-il was proclaimed to be the "great  leader of the people, who set up an autonomous military command  system and unceasingly increases its fighting power and  armaments."    NK's recent concentration on propaganda concerning Kim  Chong-il's military leadership activities, even presenting  concrete examples, is understood to be an attempt to placate the  military, to eliminate the debate seething within it on Kim  Chong-il's lack of experience in NK military affairs and his  resulting suitability as supreme commander of the military and  Chief of State, and to elicit loyalty from the military.    According to the testimony of recent defectors, since Kim  Chong-il was made Supreme Commander (December 24, 1991) and  Chief of State (April 20, 1992), dissatisfaction and complaints  are gradually growing within the military: "Following the  political and economic sectors, Kim Chong-il is now going to  ruin even the military." Accordingly, the MPAF is even reported  to have carried out a "Military-wide Ideological  Questionnaire-Survey" to determine trends within the military.  [passage omitted]</p>

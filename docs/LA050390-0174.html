			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'JUDAS GOATS' HELP NAVY RID SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND OF BEASTS  </P> <P> After 18 years of battling the formidable goats of San Clemente Island, the  U.S. Navy says it is about to eradicate them for good by using a new program  based on a simple premise: goats hate to be alone.  </P> <P> Since last June, the Navy has put the goats' gregariousness to work, using  seven "Judas goats" to seek out and infiltrate hard-to-find herds. Each Judas  goat is fitted with a radio transmitter, so scientists can track and kill the  sociable animals, whose grazing has threatened the ecology of the rocky island.  When one herd is shot, the Judas goats are set loose to betray again.  </P> <P> "We're exploiting goat behavior," said Dawn Seward, 25, a graduate student from  Oregon State University who spends up to 10 hours a day tracking goats on the  Navy-owned island about 60 miles off the San Diego coast. "Goats find goats  better than humans find goats."  </P> <P> So much better, in fact, that the Navy predicts that within a month, the island  will be "goat-free" for the first time since the 1800s, when sheepherders  introduced them. Since 1972, the Navy has struggled to solve the goat problem,  killing or trapping 27,000 goats on the 57-square-mile island and suffering the  ire of animal advocates. But now, only six wild goats are known to remain, and  their dwindling numbers have allowed the recovery of seven endangered native  plant and animal species that were nearly nibbled to extinction.  </P> <P> "The island had a cancer and that cancer was the goats," said Jan Larson,  natural resources manager for North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego,  which uses San Clemente Island for bombing and shelling practice and  touch-and-go landing drills.  </P> <P> Larson credits the Judas goat program with giving the island's endangered  species a real chance at survival. Already, four plant species appear to be on  the rebound, and the island night lizard may soon be removed from the  threatened species list.  </P> <P> Larson also believes that the San Clemente Island experiment, modeled on a  similar program in Hawaii, will yield valuable solutions to what he calls a  "worldwide goat problem." From the Galapagos Islands to Madagascar to Santa  Catalina, Larson said, oceanic islands suffer a continuing goat blight. In  addition, he said, of all the plants on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's  endangered and rare species list, 29% owe their precarious position to goats.  </P> <P> The success of the Judas goat program also promises to bring the Navy something  it has dearly wanted for nearly two decades -- an end to the San Clemente  Island goat controversy.  </P> <P> Since 1972, when the Navy began trying to restore the native ecology of the  island by trapping 16,500 wild goats, animal rights activists have kept a close  watch. Back then, Larson recalls, "the erosion was incredible. Tons of topsoil  were leaving the island each year. The island was almost a powdery plain."  Cactus, once a rarity, dominated the landscape. And from the air, the terrain  appeared scarred, crisscrossed with thousands of "goat highways."  </P> <P> Despite this environmental damage, when the Navy first proposed bringing  sharpshooters in to eliminate the herd in 1979, conservationists balked.  Cleveland Amory and the Fund for Animals got court injunctions to halt the  eradication program.  </P> <P> Under pressure to meet the demands of the Endangered Species Act, the Navy  sought an alternative to shooting. It hired a trapper who snared more than  6,000 goats. But the remainder retreated beyond his reach into the steep,  craggy canyons of the island's interior.  </P> <P> Then in 1985, Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger intervened on behalf of  the Fund for Animals, allowing it to conduct a goat rescue mission. The group  brought in a helicopter netting team. Flying as low as 20 feet, the capture  team dropped a net over three or four animals at a time, landed the aircraft,  and then prepared the goats for shipping. In March of 1986, after netting more  than 7,600 goats, the Fund for Animals reported it had "completed goat  removal."  </P> <P> But the organization was wrong. And soon the goats that remained were  repopulating the island nearly as swiftly as they devoured it. Larson estimates  that in 10 years, two goats can yield 5,000 descendants.  </P></p>

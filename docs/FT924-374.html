			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Reclaiming income tax I FOUND recently that I should have been reclaiming income tax deducted at source over 17 years but have not done so. How many years can I reclaim for? Provided you get your claim in by Monday, April 5, you can claim repayments of tax for 1986-87 onwards. It would be possible to go further back if your failure to claim at the right time had been the result of misinformation, for example, from a tax office but, presumably, that is not what caused your oversight. Ask the local tax office for the free pamphlets IR80(1992) (Income tax and married couples) and IR112(1991) (How to claim a repayment of income tax). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

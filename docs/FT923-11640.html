			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Union Discount suffers Pounds 14.8m half-year loss: London's short-term money markets UNION Discount, one of the leading companies in London's short-term money markets, claimed yesterday to have put the worst of its troubles behind it as it reported losses of Pounds 14.8m for the first six months of this year. The results reflect Union's struggle in recent months to shake off the effects of a disastrous diversification into leasing during the 1980s, as well as an attempt to bring its core discount house operation back into profit. Union has been one of the biggest casualties of the move by specialist financial houses to develop into other markets as a result of financial deregulation in London. The move was tacitly encouraged by the Bank of England, which halved discount houses' capital adequacy requirements in the mid-1980s to allow them to devote more of their resources to new areas. Union said it would not pay an interim dividend, and could not yet promise a final one. 'We will only pay a dividend if it is prudent. I can't make any commitment at this stage,' said Mr George Blunden, chief executive. Pre-tax losses of Pounds 14.8m in the six months to June 30 accounted for a shrinkage in the company's capital base to Pounds 41m at the end of the period, down from Pounds 72.8m a year ago. A year earlier it lost Pounds 8.4m and paid an 11.5p dividend. Losses per share were 82.1p against 33.35p. The group's discount house operations accounted for Pounds 4.2m of the loss  -Pounds 2.8m due to a deterioration in existing problem loans. The company hinted that it was close to selling a property in Edinburgh, which it took on after a disastrous Pounds 20m loan to a property company went sour. In an attempt to make the discount operations profitable, Mr Blunden said he had halved the staff since joining the company from SG Warburg in June, wiping Pounds 1m off the salary bill. Leasing, which had caused losses of Pounds 14m in 1991, was responsible for a further Pounds 5.7m of losses in the first half as Union provided Pounds 6.7m against possible bad debts. Provisions against the worst parts of the leasing portfolio now amount to 30 per cent, with an average for the whole book of more than 10 per cent. Union changed its deferred taxation policy, resulting in a tax charge in the accounts for the period of Pounds 841,000. The company also announced that Mr George Nissen and Lord Remnant had resigned from its board, while Mr Harry Taylor, deputy chairman of two subsidiaries, has been appointed. Mr Blunden said further management changes were likely. Observer, Page 17</p>

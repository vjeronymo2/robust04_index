According to Shokhin, "Vladimir Mashitz will be responsible  for the economic affairs in the ministry." As for Konstantin  Zatulin, a member of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and  Accord] faction in the State Duma, of which Shokhin is a member)  [no open parentheses as received], he is the head of the Duma's  Committee for CIS Affairs and Ties with Compatriots. Shokhin  has no information about the nomination of Zatulin as the  minister for cooperation with the CIS states.    As it was reported earlier, Shokhin was also appointed the  Economics Minister.    Shokhin hopes that the Economics Ministry will have "real  authorities, although this does not mean the revival of GOSPLAN  (the State Planning Committee)." Shokhin also expressed hope  for the real interaction with the Finance Ministry reminding  that in the past the two ministries had different approaches to  the resolution of economic problems and public discussions took  place which the new economics minister hopes to avoid in the  future.</p>

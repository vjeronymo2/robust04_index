			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemala appears on a list of nations that have  filed suits against the United States before GATT for imposing  restrictions on its tobacco imports, causing serious distortions  to the economies producing that agricultural product.    It was reported that after two days of discussions in  Geneva,  the GATT signatories said they will form a panel to debate U.S.  protectionism for the tobacco market. The long dispute initiated  by Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Thailand,  and Zimbabwe is aimed at modifying U.S. legislation regarding  the use of imported tobacco by domestic industries.    At this moment, 75 percent of the tobacco that is used for  U.S. cigarette production comes from U.S. suppliers.</p>

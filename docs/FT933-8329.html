			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Blue-eyed sheikhs get used to life without oil wealth: Albertans no longer have savings for a rainy day ALBERTA'S 2.6m residents were led to believe for almost two decades that their oil and gas wealth provided a cushion against hard times. When energy prices soared in the mid-1970s, the Canadian prairie province decided to squirrel away 15 per cent of its oil and gas royalties in a newly-created Heritage Savings Trust Fund. By the early 1980s, the fund had amassed assets of over CDollars 12bn (Pounds 6.2bn), and was investing in income-producing ventures as well as improvements to the province's infrastructure. But Albertans, once labelled the blue-eyed sheikhs, have discovered lately that oil and gas cannot protect them from free-spending politicians or the realities of the business cycle. Having posted a budget deficit for eight years in a row, the province has run up an accumulated debt of more than CDollars 11bn (including unfunded pension liabilities). A non-partisan commission, appointed by the government to examine Alberta's fiscal hangover, concluded earlier this year that 'we have effectively used up all the savings of the Heritage Fund and more . . . These funds are no longer available for a rainy day.' Such sober assessments have led Albertans to take a new look both at their past and their future. They are questioning, as seldom before, whether they could have spent their oil wealth more wisely. At the same time, a new provincial government led by Mr Ralph Klein, a former TV reporter and mayor of Calgary, has promised a new era of rigorous fiscal discipline. The treasurer, Mr Jim Dinning, said in this year's budget speech that 'optimistic oil and gas revenue forecasts have no place in the budgetary exercise. In future, we'd rather err on the other side.' The latest budget is predicated on average energy revenues over the past five years. Mr Gerry Protti, president of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers in Calgary, estimates that royalties, income taxes and other levies paid by the energy industry make up at least 40 per cent of provincial government revenues. Oil and gas have brought indisputable benefits to Alberta. Alone among Canada's 10 provinces, it has no retail sales tax. Personal income tax rates are the lowest in the country. Mr Peter Lougheed, the provincial premier from 1971 to 1985, says that his policy was to spend heavily on capital projects with the aim of building a modern infrastructure which could last for decades with minimum expansion. He ticks off an impressive list, including a network of 124 hospitals (more than three-quarters of them in rural areas); a modern highway system; libraries; two well-equipped technical colleges; an extensive tourism area in the Rockies foothills; and a CDollars 300m medical research foundation financed by the Heritage Fund. The politicians seemed not to notice when the bottom fell out of the oil price in 1985/86. Oil and gas royalties, which averaged CDollars 4.8bn a year between 1981 and 1986, sank to an average of CDollars 2.3bn between 1988 and 1993. Neither the quantity nor the quality of spending took account of this deterioration. 'Each little department of government was a fiefdom which did its own thing,' says Mr George Cornish, retired city commissioner of Calgary who is now executive-in-residence at the local university's faculty of management. In the second half of the 1980s, the emphasis shifted to diversification. Japanese and other investors built several wood-pulp mills with support from provincial coffers. A US-Canadian consortium put up a magnesium smelter with the help of CDollars 103m in government loan guarantees. The government nurtured and took an equity stake in NovAtel, one of North America's biggest cellular telephone makers. The success rate of these investments would make a banker blush. The province has already written off about 17 per cent of the CDollars 12.2bn in loans and guarantees which it advanced in the cause of diversification. NovAtel has disappeared. The magnesium smelter, which used an untried technology, has been mothballed. One source estimates that another CDollars 1bn-CDollars 2bn in writedowns are unavoidable over the next few years. In particular, the government is unlikely to realise its investment in Gainers, a troubled meat processing company. A heavy oil upgrader on the Saskatchewan border, which was built with almost CDollars 300m of taxpayers' money, is also in the red. This poor fiscal management was largely blamed on the patronage, cronyism and lack of co-ordination which flourished under Mr Donald Getty, who succeeded Mr Lougheed as premier. Mr Getty quit politics earlier this year. His successor, Mr Klein, has served notice that Albertans can no longer expect their government to keep spending in the hope that energy prices will climb. A Deficit Elimination Act, passed last spring, requires that the budget be balanced again within four years. The government has promised that, in the words of a budget document, 'there will be no loopholes'. The oil-boom largesse is being scaled back. The provincial health department is considering closing several of the hospitals built in the good years. Mr Klein has promised to end direct subsidies to business. In one small but controversial move, the government has stopped paying daily allowances to prisoners in provincial jails. Mr Protti says the mood among oil and gas producers has also changed. The industry is 'no longer a high-flying play based on commodity prices. Today, the attitude is very much that if you can't make money at Dollars 18 a barrel, you had better make the changes required to make money, otherwise you're going out of business.' Even the Heritage Fund is not expected to survive the new climate of austerity. The fund stopped growing a decade ago when its investment income was funnelled into general revenues. The book value of its assets is now less than half the size of the provincial debt. The Financial Review Commission proposed that the fund be abolished as a separate entity. After a period of public consultation, the government is expected to concur.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> PTE 83&hyph;1 and the Underwriter Exemptions are conditioned, among other things, upon the certificates purchased by plans not being subordinated to other classes of certificates issued by the same trust. The commenter further noted that, in a typical asset pool investment trust, one or more classes of subordinated certificates are often issued. Underwriters and issuers will sell senior certificates to plans in reliance on PTE 83&hyph;1 and the Underwriter Exemptions, but will not knowingly sell any of the subordinated certificates to plans. Thus, the Above-described exemptions provide relief for the operation of a pool that sells senior certificates to plans, but provide no relief for the same acts of the pool trustee and servicer if plans purchase subordinated certificates issued by the same trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter stated that life insurance companies have been significant purchasers of subordinated certificates. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris Trust <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision raises the potential for servicers and trustees of pools to be subject to excise taxes and civil penalty liability for the same acts involving the operation of trusts which would be exempt if the certificates were not subordinated. Accordingly, the commenter believes that exemptive relief is especially appropriate in situations where insurance company general account investments in subordinated classes of certificates causes plan ownership of such classes to equal or exceed 25 percent. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  In support of this request for specific relief, the commenter provided the following reasons: (1) asset pool investment trusts are fixed pools, the assets of which are generally not subject to change once the certificates are sold; (2) the pool sponsor's discretion and the servicer's discretion with respect to assets included in a trust are severely limited and are governed by a written pooling and servicing agreement that is available to investors prior to purchasing a certificate; (3) the assets in the trusts represent secured obligations; and (4) trustees of asset pool investment trusts must be independent of the pool sponsors. Moreover, the commenter argued that the fact that the certificates acquired by a general account are subordinated should not preclude the Department from providing exemptive relief since the certificates will have been analyzed by insurance company purchasers, who are presumptively sophisticated investors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In this regard, see 29 CFR 2510.3&hyph;101(f) for a description of the ``significant participation test'' contained in the plan assets regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department believes that the commenter's recommendation has merit and has determined to propose exemptive relief on its own motion. Section III of the proposal would provide relief from sections 406(a), 406(b), and 407(a) of ERISA for the operation of asset pool investment trusts in which the insurance general account has an interest as a result of the acquisition of subordinated certificates. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  The proposal requires that the conditions of either PTE 83&hyph;1 or an applicable Underwriter Exemption be met other than the requirements that the certificates acquired by the general account not be subordinated and receive a rating that is in one of the three highest generic rating categories from an independent rating agency. In addition, the Department has proposed additional relief for the operation of such trusts where a plan acquired subordinated certificates in a transaction that was not prohibited or otherwise satisfied the conditions of PTE 75&hyph;1. The department has proposed this exemption in recognition that no relief would be available for the operation of a trust if a plan purchased subordinated certificates in a transaction that was not prohibited (or was otherwise covered by PTE 75&hyph;1) and the underlying assets of the trust includes plan assets under the analysis adopted in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harris Trust <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision as a result of the application of the significant participation test under the plan asset regulation (section 2510.3&hyph;101(f)) to the general account's investment in such subordinated certificates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Department notes that Section I of the proposed exemption provides relief for the acquisition, sale and holding of asset-backed pass-through certificates representing a beneficial ownership interest in a pool of obligations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV contains general conditions which are applicable to all transactions described in sections I and II of the proposed exemption. Transactions must be at least as favorable to the insurance company general account as arm's-length transactions between unrelated parties. The proposal would also require that the transaction not be part of any agreement, arrangement, or understanding designed to benefit a party in interest. Lastly, the party in interest entering into the transaction cannot be the insurance company, any pooled separate account of the insurance company, or any affiliate of the insurance company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> General Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The attention of interested persons is directed to the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions of the Act and the Code, including any prohibited transaction provisions to which the exemption does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act which require, among other things, that a fiduciary discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interests of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

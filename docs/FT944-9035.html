			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / The Queen's Speech: Ministers plan body to probe miscarriage of justice claims - Legal reforms The government has bowed to growing pressure from senior judges by including in the Queen's Speech a bill to establish an independent body to investigate alleged miscarriages of justice. The Criminal Cases Review Authority was first recommended by last year's report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice after a damaging series of wrongful convictions dented public confidence in the criminal courts. Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, and other senior legal figures pushed for its early introduction after the government failed to include it in this year's Criminal Justice Act. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, indicated earlier this year that the government was committed to introducing the authority, but only when parliamentary time permitted. The criminal appeal bill will not be published until later in the parliamentary session, to allow time to secure cross-party agreement on outstanding issues. The bill will reform the powers of the Court of Appeal by clarifying the grounds for allowing a criminal appeal and making new provisions for retrials and the acceptance of fresh evidence. At present the Home Office reviews about 700 cases a year, with the home secretary referring about 10 to the Court of Appeal. Between 1988 and March last year the government paid Pounds 3.4m in compensation and ex gratia payments to 70 people who had been wrongfully convicted. The new authority will act as a body of last resort after normal avenues of appeal have been exhausted, and will refer cases back to the Court of Appeal where appropriate without any recommendation. It will have no investigative powers of its own but will be able to institute inquiries, obtain access to relevant information and commission police investigations. There will be no right of appeal to another body against its decisions, but they will be open to judicial review by the High Court. The bill will set out the criteria for referral to the courts on the basis that there should be some new matter for them to consider. The authority, which will operate in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, will also take on responsibility for investigating wrongful convictions and inappropriate sentences in magistrates' courts. Leaders of the legal profession welcomed the bill's inclusion in the Queen's Speech. Mr Robert Seabrook QC, chairman of the Bar, said it provided 'a much-needed signal of the government's commitment to restoring confidence in the criminal justice system'.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / MGN recovery clears way to early sale of shares A STRONG recovery in profits at Mirror Group Newspapers has cleared the way for an early disposal of the 54.8 per cent stake in MGN held by administrators controlling the collapsed Maxwell private empire. MGN shares rose 8p to 186p after the company reported that pre-tax profits shot up from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 69.9m in the six months to June 27. Trading profits, which it said reflected increased revenues and reduced costs, climbed 16 per cent to Pounds 57.3m. Mr David Montgomery, MGN chief executive, said the circulation of the Daily Mirror and Scotland's Daily Record had not been hurt by News Corporation's rival tabloid, The Sun, which since July has been undercutting its MGN rivals by 7p per copy. Mr Montgomery said the Daily Mirror's circulation rose 65,000 in August, although it was too early to predict the outcome of the newspaper price war. Advertising revenues rose 6.5 per cent, helping group turnover rise 1 per cent to Pounds 237.2m. Reductions in staff and efficiency benefits had cut costs by Pounds 4m in the first half and would produce annualised savings of Pounds 17m, which might be partly offset by increased costs in other areas. Staff numbers had fallen from 3,601 to 2,998 in the half-year and would be down to 2,850 by the year-end. Mr Montgomery said a new culture had been established and 'defiant' elements in management and workforce had been removed. Mr John Talbot of Arthur Andersen, who is joint administrator to the private Maxwell companies, declined to comment on rumours that the stake of 200m shares would be placed soon. Mr Montgomery said there had been no sign of any single buyer for the stake. He hoped it would find a home with institutions, which would allow editorial independence. But any decision on the stake was up to the administrator. Pre-tax profit before exceptionals rose from Pounds 15.3m to Pounds 33.8m. Exceptional credits, as the company adjusted Maxwell-related provisions, totalled Pounds 36.1m. The company expects to begin paying dividends again next year. The exceptional gains included a release of Pounds 30m against provisions for pensions, less Pounds 10m of deferred tax. There was another release of Pounds 9.5m in provisions for restructuring charges. That was offset by a charge of Pounds 10.7m to cover the costs of shifting the company's headquarters from Holborn Circus to Canary Wharf. The proposed settlement with private Maxwell companies brought a Pounds 15.2m release, and another Pounds 11.4m in provisions was set aside to cover other London leasehold properties. The deal with the private Maxwell companies diminished MGN's tax charge for the half by Pounds 4.1m to Pounds 17.9m, compared with Pounds 5.3m last time. Earnings per share rose to 13p (from 2.6p), although the underlying figure, minus exceptionals, was 6.4p (against 2.6p). Lex, Page 28 Observer, Page 27</p>

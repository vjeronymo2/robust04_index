			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Geneva talks will determine Korean destinies: John Burton on a fine line between war and peace on the peninsula Whether there will be war or peace on the Korean peninsula will be largely determined by a round of high-level US-North Korean talks that begins today in Geneva. The US agreed to conduct the talks after North Korea promised two weeks ago to suspend its nuclear programme if dialogue with Washington was resumed on possible diplomatic recognition and economic aid. The talks, in addition to the forthcoming summit on July 25-27 between the presidents of the two Koreas, have cooled tensions on the Korean peninsula after confrontation appeared imminent last month over Pyongyang's unsupervised removal of plutonium-rich nuclear fuel from its reactor. Many observers believe the outcome of the two events may soon trigger vast regional changes. 'If North Korea is unwilling to make concessions, then we are heading for a crisis. But if North Korea is ready to strike a deal, we could see an acceleration of developments that may eventually lead to the reunification of Korea,' said one western diplomat in Seoul. The US-North Korean talks will be the main test of Pyongyang's intentions. The outline of an agreement to resolve the nuclear dispute is already clear. The US wants North Korea to return to full membership of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and accept full international nuclear inspections. This would include checks on suspected, but undeclared, nuclear facilities, such as two nuclear waste dumps that could provide the answer to whether North Korea reprocessed plutonium to build at least one atomic device in 1989. In return for North Korea's compliance, the US is offering a number of concessions. These include gradual normalisation of diplomatic relations beginning with the establishment of liaison offices, the lifting of the US trade embargo against Pyongyang, and US support to replace the North's plutonium-generating graphite reactors with safer light water ones. Several obstacles have prevented this agreement being concluded earlier. One problem is procedural, with the US demanding that North Korea first accept full nuclear inspections before concessions from Washington can be implemented. In contrast, the North has demanded a package deal with both sides taking steps simultaneously. Another concern is that the North may attempt to up the ante by making new demands at the Geneva talks, including the signing of a peace treaty formally ending the 1950-53 Korean War that would require the US to withdraw its military forces from South Korea. One factor complicating the American negotiating stance is that it must co-ordinate its actions with those of South Korea. The US is mindful that it must not make concessions that would undercut Seoul's bargaining strength at the Pyongyang summit or weaken the defences of South Korea. The likely US negotiating strategy will be to link the outcome of the Geneva talks with the results of the inter-Korean summit to prevent North Korea driving a wedge between Seoul and Washington. But North Korea is certain to resist that strategy. It may refuse to make concessions to Seoul at the summit and blame lack of progress at the Geneva talks for its intransigence. Pyongyang could also threaten to start reprocessing recently removed reactor fuel rods, with enough plutonium to make four to six nuclear devices, if Washington does not offer concessions by the end of August, when the spent fuel will be ready for reprocessing. If the US-North Korean talks founder on these diplomatic obstacles, Washington will have little choice but to revive its suspended effort to impose UN economic sanctions against the North and increase the preparedness of US forces in South Korea for a possible military solution to the dispute.</p>

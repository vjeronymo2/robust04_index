			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Patten orders urgent review of school technology MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday launched an urgent review of the curriculum for technology at schools in England and Wales, following a highly critical report by the schools inspectorate. The report highlights the ill-effects of the devolution of most funding from local education authorities to schools, one of the government's key education policies. 'At a time when teachers need advice and support with the introduction of technology,' said the inspectorate, 'many local authorities have reduced the number of advisory teachers and closed technology in-service training centres, often in order to reduce expenditure and to enable them to delegate more money to schools'. The inspectorate found that at primary level much technology teaching was constrained 'by the teachers' limited technological capability,' while at secondary level barely half of all lessons in design and technology observed were satisfactory or better, with lesson planning in the subject 'piecemeal'. At both levels, schools had difficulty in providing challenging work for more advanced pupils. In a Commons written answer, Mr Patten said the review, to be conducted by the inspectorate, was intended 'to specify more clearly the skills and knowledge which pupils should acquire at each stage' and 'to enhance the practical element' in the curriculum. 'I am determined to increase teachers' expectations of childrens' abilities,' said Mr Patten. A new curriculum framework for school technology is expected to be introduced in 1994 for pupils up to 14, and a year later for pupils over 14. This will involve new syllabuses for GCSE. Mr Patten's action was also promoted by advice from the National Curriculum Council, an advisory body, which urged a review to relate conceptual work in technology more closely with practical skills, and to reduce the complexity of the curriculum. The Engineering Council, which published a sharply critical report on the issue last month, said: 'technology should be a subject in which students design and make useful products or systems, developing their ability to solve practical problems.' Independent boarding schools should be eligible to opt for grant-maintained status and become fully-fledged state schools, according to the director of the Independent Schools Information Service. Pupil numbers at independent boarding schools have fallen by more than 10 per cent in the last three years, and the call is seen as further evidence of the plight of the sector.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- Former Soviet Army  surgeon Mikhail Shulman recently published an article headlined  "Benevolent Politics of Comrade Kim Chong-il Is Eternal  Cornerstone of Unity and Victory".    In a lengthy article with subtitles "`We Serve the People  Exclusively'" and "Even if the Earth Is Broken", the author says  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is confidently leading the  whole party, all the people and the entire Army to the victory  of socialism with his spirit of devoted service to the people,  distinguished leadership ability and iron faith and will.    Shulman, far above 80, visited Korea several times from  August 1945 when Korea was liberated from the colonial rule of  Japanese imperialism.    He says:    What I cannot forget any moment among many unforgettable  things in my life is the great personality and outstanding  leadership ability of Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Kim  Chong-il, the great leaders of the Korean people, and the  brilliant looks of socialist Korea which is soaring imposingly  above the clouds in the east.    Pointing to the superior health care system of Korea where  doctors visit residents, before the patients come to them,  everyone gets medical assistance without paying a penny, and is  provided with all conditions for the promotion of health by the  state, the author says: The noble human love, great human love  of Comrade Kim Chong-il is, indeed, a panacea for the longevity  of the people in good health.    He went on:    Korea which was a colonial agriculture country with backward  economy for many years and, worse still, was reduced to ruins in  a three-year war built solid foundations of an independent  national economy diversely developed and equipped with modern  technologies in a few years. This is a miracle and change which  can be brought about only in Korea where everything serves the  people and their strength is the driving force of social  development.    The imperialists in the West are decrying the economy of  Korea, alleging that it has gone bankrupt. But this is a  sophism to mar the image of socialist Korea.    I fully grasped the greatness of the leader through the  reality of Korea which is constantly developing politics,  economy and culture with main emphasis on the ideological,  material and cultural life of the people.    Comrade Kim Chong-il who is possessed of the quality,  personality and ability to make everything serve the people,  believing them as heaven, is, indeed, a man for the people, the  greatest of the great.    There were in history great men who earned fame with wisdom,  famous generals who earned fame with martial arts and  politicians who won popular sentiments with benevolence. But  none of these great men can be equal to the great personality of  Comrade Kim Chong-il with literary and military accomplishments,  loyalty and filial duty, iron will and grit.    Socialism collapsed in some countries at present. But Korea  is firmly defending socialism and winning victory after victory,  smashing the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists.    Now the people of many countries question what is the secret  that Korea, not a big country, is fighting the United States  singlehanded and overwhelming it thoroughly at a time when even  influential politicians cringe if the U.S. shout at them.    I clearly saw the source of the strength of the Korean  people  while visiting Korea.    The singlehearted unity of the party and the popular masses  united rock-firm around Comrade Kim Chong-il, supreme commander  of the Korean People's Army, is the source of invincible might  which can create something out of nothing and defeat any  formidable enemy.    It is the distinguished merit of Comrade Kim Chong-il  possessed of outstanding idea and theories and preeminent  leadership ability that the singlehearted unity of Korea is so  solid and virile as today.    The outstanding leadership of Comrade Kim Chong-il in  strengthening the working-class party, the general staff of the  revolution, enhancing the leadership role of the party in every  way, effecting a fundamental turn in the building of the  revolutionary Armed Forces and fully displaying the advantages  of socialism in economy, culture and all other domains has  instilled deep into the hearts of the entire people the firm  faith and will that when they uphold his leadership, they can  surely occupy any fortress in socialist construction, drive back  the counterrevolutionary offensive of all the enemies and always  win victory. The singlehearted unity of Korea is so powerful  because the whole society is overflowing with this faith and  will.    What I want to stress as regards the singlehearted unity of  Korea is that it is a crystal of benevolent politics, politics  of love and trust of dear Comrade Kim Chong-il.    The mighty unity of the entire people like the singlehearted  unity of Korea can be achieved only by the strength of idea, the  strength of politics and the strength of love of such  illustrious leader as Comrade Kim Chong-il who enjoys undisputed  trust of the people.    The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a country guided  by the illustrious leader, where the people is the master of the  state and society and the singlehearted unity of the entire  people has been achieved, will further prosper, displaying its  might to the whole world as a fortress of socialism and a beacon  of the hope of mankind.</p>

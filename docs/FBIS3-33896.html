Sha'th denied an earlier Israeli television report that  talks  would resume in Cairo Wednesday.    The two sides are due to meet again to finalise an accord on  launching Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho,  following the meeting in Davos, Switzerland, last weekend  between PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres.</p>

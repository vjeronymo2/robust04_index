			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MYSTERY OF SAN MARINO'S EERIE MANSION COMES TO LIGHT;  </P> <P> ESTATE: MANY DETAILS ABOUT THE HOME AND LIFE OF HELEN MORGENTHALER REMAIN  HIDDEN. BUT THE STRUCTURE CLEARLY WAS A MIX OF THE WILDLY ECCENTRIC AND THE  SURPRISINGLY ORDINARY.  </P> <P> Orville Houg followed a flashlight beam through the daytime darkness of the  boarded-up San Marino mansion that for decades has fascinated schoolchildren,  baffled adults and irritated officials in this affluent enclave.  </P> <P> The mysterious structure has now been unmasked, its Mediterranean-style,  pastel-stucco front discovered to be an exaggerated facade masking a crumbling,  two-story stucco and wood-frame house with a leaky tar-paper roof and a shaky  river-rock foundation. A small wood-frame structure, not much bigger than a  shack, is melded onto the rear of the house.  </P> <P> A local real estate agent, Houg was doing what many people in this small town  confess they have always wanted to do: He was taking a peek around the estate  of Helen Morgenthaler, a reclusive eccentric whose father made a comfortable  living in the wall-covering business.  </P> <P> Even before Helen Morgenthaler's recent death, local and county officials,  citing property maintenance statutes, had begun cutting away jungle-thick brush  and trees that covered the nearly two-acre site and blocked all but the front  view of the home.  </P> <P> The county's Public Guardian agency, which had been handling Morgenthaler's  affairs since January, put the 3,000-square-foot house on the market in August.  And with her death Oct. 29 at the age of 88, Morgenthaler and her home have  become the talk of the town.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a fabulous, big mansion like everybody else," said real  estate agent Kim Atkinson-Melin, who is handling the property's sale with Houg.  </P> <P> She was wrong.  </P> <P> On his recent tour, Houg turned the flashlight on an intricately carved wooden  fireplace mantel. "This is the only thing that has value . . . and it's  downhill from there," he said.  </P> <P> The structure now standing on the property apparently came together in a  piecemeal fashion, with some parts dating from just before the turn of the  century.  </P> <P> According to the skimpy historical material available, the original structure  was a house on stilts that was later replaced by the stucco house. It is not  clear how, when or why the facade front came to be.  </P> <P> Morgenthaler apparently told one friend that her mother cruised the streets of  San Marino and Beverly Hills looking for housing ideas and then added the  facade while her father was out of town. But some local historians have cast  doubt on that theory.  </P> <P> At one time the two-story home was said to be quite nice, but it never matched  the majesty of its front.  </P> <P> Now this tear-down house on a 400-by-200-foot lot has become one of the hottest  properties in the Western San Gabriel Valley. The lot is large enough to allow  for construction of three to five houses selling for up to $1.5 million each,  Houg said.  </P> <P> The asking price is $4 million, but a new -- perhaps lower -- figure will  likely be set.  </P> <P> Even with a housing downturn, Houg and Atkinson-Melin said, they have been  astonished by the number of calls they have received on the property. "I've had  well over 180 inquiries since August," Houg said.  </P> <P> Real estate agents, probate attorneys, developers and heirs are sorting out the  intricacies of the estate in the 1700 block of West Drive.  </P> <P> Still, the woman who lived there -- behind electrified barbed-wire fences,  alone, except for her snapping guard dogs -- remains an enigma.  </P> <P> A lifelong San Gabriel Valley resident who was married briefly but had no  children, Morgenthaler grew up in the house with her sister and parents.  </P> <P> Morgenthaler's own words, in a rambling oral history filed at the San Marino  Public Library, reveal a few odd details of her life. She said her  great-grandfather was an Austrian prince and a grandfather "owned the first  large building in Chicago."  </P> <P> She described her father as "king to the decorator trade" who "only got the  very finest things in the house," such as the hand-painted French furniture and  "the most beautiful cut glass chandeliers you ever saw."  </P> <P> In its prime, she said, the grounds surrounding her house had a grove of 50  orange trees, Concord grapevines, blackberries, "persimmons that made the best  persimmon pudding" and "Chelsea plums that were out of this world."  </P> <P> But the once-fine gardens became chaotic, and officials of San Marino  repeatedly asked her to trim back the growth.  </P> <P> In recent times, Morgenthaler lived in retirement homes. Through a court order,  officials with the county's Public Guardian, part of the Department of Mental  Health, took over her affairs.  </P> <P> Citing privacy laws, Christopher Fierro, deputy director of the department,  said he could only say that his office enters a case "when someone is  substantially unable to manage financial affairs or is subject to undue  influence or fraud."  </P> <P> Through a county intermediary, her heirs -- a niece in Florida and one in  Virginia -- declined a request for interviews.  </P> <P> But through friends and acquaintances a picture -- albeit a fuzzy one --  emerges.  </P> <P> "She was quite a mysterious lady . . . a crusty lady," said Sydney Baxter,  administrator of Casa La Villa, a Pasadena retirement home where Morgenthaler  lived. "I probably knew her better than anyone here, but I don't have much  light to shed."  </P> <P> "She knew people thought of her as (eccentric)," added Thomas W. Sullivan, a  Pasadena real estate agent who lived four blocks from Morgenthaler and, out of  curiosity, visited her from time to time.  </P> <P> She told him that she patented a process of dying grasses used in wallpaper,  that she was married briefly, and that as a child she played with the children  of railroad and real estate giant Henry Huntington. Her home's front door  archway -- carved to resemble a cascading grapevine -- came from a movie set,  she told him.  </P> <P> "She admitted she wasn't very friendly with her neighbors," he said.  </P> <P> The other day, as Houg and Atkinson-Melin walked the parched grounds filled  with the stumps of fruit trees, Atkinson-Melin said: "It's going to be sad when  the house goes, because San Marino has been talking about it for 50 years."  </P></p>

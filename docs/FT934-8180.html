			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Italy to lease spare RAF jets THE MINISTRY of Defence is expected to earn Pounds 110m by leasing spare RAF Tornado jets to the Italian air force. Mr Fabio Fabbri, Italian defence minister, said in London yesterday that the Tornado F3 air defence fighter had been chosen in preference to similar licensing proposals involving two US aircraft, the Grumman F-14 and the McDonnell Douglas F-15. He added that Italy wanted to use the deal to launch closer defence collaboration between the two countries. The MoD confirmed that a leasing arrangement had been discussed but said no agreement had been signed. In addition to the payment to Britain, the plan also involves some L430bn (Pounds 176m) worth of work for Italian industry including provision of spares and support. Italy wants the jets to replace its ageing F-104 Starfighters before delivery of the new four-nation Eurofighter 2000.</p>

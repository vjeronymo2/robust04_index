			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Call for halt to changes in curriculum A THREE-YEAR halt to further changes in the national curriculum was urged yesterday. A report by Dr Rosemary Webb of Manchester University, found that teachers laboured under an 'enormous burden of work' and no longer found any joy in the job because of the number of changes already implemented. The report is aimed at Sir Ron Dearing, who is conducting an urgent government-ordered review of the national curriculum. In her study of primary schools, commissioned by the 146,000-strong Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Dr Webb described the national curriculum as 'overloaded'. A reduction in content was needed across all subjects, she said. During the three-year lull, Dr Webb suggested schools should be allowed to choose to cover 70 per cent of the curriculum subjects.</p>

U.S. Ambassador  William Lacy Swing has warned that any Senate member who would  prevent the Senate from fulfilling its constitutional  responsibilities will be considered by the U.S. Government to be  acting in disregard of the New York pact.    Mr. Swing was referring to the senators elected in the 18  January 1993 elections, not acknowledged by the international  community. Ambassador Swing reminded them of their  responsibility to fully and officially respect the commitments  to which they subscribed within the framework of the New York  pact.    This pact, made in July 1993 by Haiti's antagonistic  political forces, provides for those [contested]  parliamentarians to refrain from sitting in parliament until a  solution is found regarding their status.    The Haitian Senate is divided into two antagonistic blocs:  one led by Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, recognized by the  international community; the other by Sen. Bernard Sansaricq,  whom the unacknowledged senators elected their leader. Only one  of these [contested] senators, Serge Gilles [head of the  Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti], a  socialist official, continues to respect the New York pact. The  others say the arbitration commitments provided for in this pact  have not been respected.    The parliamentary plan for solving the Haitian crisis  provides for the early retirement of General Raoul Cedras, head  of the Army, before a new prime minister takes office -- but  sets no date for the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide to Haiti.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department agrees with the comments made by the Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers and Whirlpool Corporation regarding replacement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerants for R&hyph;22. Since no prototypes exist, the Department did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyze replacement refrigerants as a design option for room air conditioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers provided extensive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments regarding the computer simulation model used by the Department to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyze room air conditioners. The Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers proposed the following changes to the computer simulation model:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Modification of the compressor subroutine to model rotary compressors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to simulate reciprocating compressors better; (2) correction of the condensate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spray subroutine to predict its effect on system performance better; (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition of correction factors to account for indoor/outdoor air leakage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> short-circuiting of indoor air, and heat leakage through the divider wall; (4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition of multiplication factors to modify coil heat transfer coefficients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a result of using enhanced fin surfaces; (5) addition of correction factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to modify such values as the compressor power and refrigerant mass flow rate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in order to assist in calibrating the model to test data; and (6) addition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a psychometric heat balance routine to check that the results from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simulation model are thermodynamically consistent. In addition to making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes to the simulation model, the Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers requested that DOE calibrate the model to match industry test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data for the baseline models chosen to represent each of the room air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioner product classes. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also requested that the room air conditioner industry be given the opportunity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to conduct experiments to judge the model <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s validity after the needed changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the model were completed. The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also stated that manufacturers' data should be given significant weight in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> predicting the increases to efficiency due to design modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 2,3). Whirlpool  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation stated that it fully supports the Association of Home Appliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers's recommended changes to the computer simulation model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Whirlpool Corporation, No. 31 at 15).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has made the changes to the simulation model that were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed by the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers. Simulation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> baseline models were calibrated against test data submitted by manufacturers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department encourages the room air industry to test the validity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simulation model and submit results in response to the standard levels being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Rocky Mountain Institute proposed that latent cooling be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in room air conditioner energy savings, and that DOE investigate whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spread between evaporator temperatures has been reduced to a minimum. (Rocky  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The computer simulation model used in the analysis of room air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditioners evaluated the thermodynamic performance of the refrigerant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system. In this evaluation, the removal of latent heat was calculated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minimization of the difference in evaporator inlet and outlet temperatures is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an inherent consideration in heat exchanger and system design. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature difference was determined by the simulation model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

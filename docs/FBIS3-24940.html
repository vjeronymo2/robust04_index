It was announced at the party's federal congress on  Thursday that Mr Hernus Kriel, Dr Kraai van Niekerk and Dr  Tertius Delport, would be candidate premiers for the Western  Cape, Northern Cape and Eastern Cape regions respectively, and  Mr George Bartlett for Natal/kwaZulu.    State President and leader of the NP F W de Klerk said the  federal council of the party had decided to allow four regional  preferences and each of the provinces could choose the  procedures they would allow for nomination of candidates for  premiership in the various regions. During discussions in the  federal council, some regions declared they would prefer to  appoint a candidate for premier from the elected members after  the election.</p>

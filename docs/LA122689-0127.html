			<p><P> December 26, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RELIGION;  </P> <P> ISRAELI COURT LIMITS CITIZENSHIP  </P> <P> Messianic Jews are not entitled to automatic Israeli citizenship, Israel's  Supreme Court has ruled, concluding that their belief in Jesus makes them  Christians instead of Jews.  </P> <P> The ruling, published in Israeli newspapers today, was a boost to  ultra-Orthodox religious interpretations of the state's 1950 Law of Return. The  law forms the basis of Jewish immigration to Israel.  </P> <P> The law and its subsequent amendments defines a Jew as a person born to a  Jewish mother or who converts to Judaism and professes no other faith.  </P> <P> Orthodox politicians have long sought a more precise definition, and the  court's Christmas Day ruling has resolved one issue.  </P> <P> The 100-page decision said belief in Jesus makes one a member of another faith  and ineligible for automatic Israeli citizenship.  </P></p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Haiti: High hopes from Haiti's downtrodden - The country's economy is at rock bottom President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, being returned to power on the back of American pressure, will face a devastated economy and high economic expectations from Haiti's poor majority. In spite of a reputation as a left-wing liberation theologist, he has indicated to donors that he intends to introduce an economic reform programme backed by an International Monetary Fund standby loan. According to a study by the International Development Association, the soft-loan arm of the World Bank, the country will need some Dollars 550m (Pounds 354m) in foreign assistance in the first 12-15 months. Mr Aristide's officials have calculated some Dollars 770m in aid commitments over the same period, though it is not clear that the type of commitments exactly meet assistance needs. The US has indicated it will provide some funding, while traditional donors such as Canada and France will also contribute, along with the international financial institutions led by the IMF. Some funds will come from the unlocking of Haitian foreign assets which have been frozen as part of the economic embargo. Mr Rainer Steckhan, the World Bank official leading aid efforts for Haiti, said the initial priority is humanitarian assistance and poverty relief. Per capita income has dropped unremittingly since the early 1980s with a precipitous decline in living standards in 1992 and 1993, in the face of international economic embargoes following the 1991 coup. Half the 7m population is receiving just 75 per cent of nutritional requirements; one in 10 babies die before they are one-year-old. The next step should be one of reconstruction and rehabilitation: rebuilding bridges, rural roads, port facilities, and public services such as waterworks. The World Bank estimates that in Port-au-Prince, a city of between 700,000 and 1m, only 50,000 people receive water from the water company. The next priority is the development of infrastructure, in particular power generation and water treatment, which envisages an important role for privatisation and a reduction of the role of the state in the economy. In rural areas, where initially some credit will be needed for small-holders for example to buy seed, help will be needed to reforest the country and prevent further soil erosion. According to an assessment presented to donors in Paris last month by the IDA, a series of reforms to modernise the state is necessary. A cut in the size of the armed forces, perhaps to a fifth of their 7,500 strength, and creation of a proper police force are seen as the main priorities. The number of public servants, estimated at around 45,000, should be cut and the civil service reformed. This should be accompanied by privatisation and deregulation, including an ending of exchange controls. Some of these will be difficult and unpopular decisions. Public service has been traditionally used to offer jobs as a reward for political favours and the envisaged trade liberalisation will be resisted. The IDA has recommended that import restrictions be lifted and that tariffs removed, except those on rice, corn, beans and sorghum, which should be halved. Economic improvement in the months after a change of power will depend on the speed at which important institutions can be rebuilt. The integrity of the commercial banking sector has been undermined by increasing interference by the monetary authorities seeking finance for the state. The position of the banking sector worsened last month after virtual raids by the central bank inspectorate, ostensibly to verify foreign currency holdings. The country's fiscal accounts, usually in deficit, have depended in better times on ever increasing customs duties applied to a dwindling volume of imports. The money printing presses have been used freely to finance the military government, leading to inflation and sharp currency depreciation. The gourde, Haiti's currency, has devalued 60 per cent since the start of this year. Inflation, 15 per cent in 1991, rose to 48 per cent last year, while unemployment is estimated at 55 per cent, although about two out of every three Haitians are not part of the formal economy. The light manufacturing sector, based on assembly for export - mainly of sporting goods, textiles and electrical appliances - has been killed by the trade embargo. A similar fate has overtaken export agriculture with coffee the main export. According to the IDA, Haiti saw its exports decline from Dollars 163m in 1991 to Dollars 72m in 1993, while imports fell from Dollars 300m to Dollars 173m in the period. Successive administrations have defaulted on repayments on the foreign debt of Dollars 820m, and the country is in arrears to the international financial institutions by about Dollars 80m. These arrears will have to be cleared - probably by donors - before the IMF, World Bank and InterAmerican Development Bank can resume lending. The country will also need debt write-offs similar to that in July 1991 when France forgave Dollars 55m. Any post-Cedras government is likely to find itself under pressure to deliver quickly. Mr Aristide's supporters, mainly from Haiti's poor majority, had expected an almost immediate improvement in living standards when he took office in 1991. His return would refuel expectations.  ----------------------------------------------------------- Haitian profile  ----------------------------------------------------------- Land area:                                27,560km2 Coastline:                                  1,771km Land Boundary: (Dominican Republic)           275km Population:                                    6.5m  Capital - Port-au-Prine               700,000 - 1m GDP:                                  Dollars 2.2bn  ----------------------------------------------------------- Exports:  Main products:               %   Main destinations:    %  Light manufactured          65   US                 76.7  Coffee                      19   EU                 16.5  Other agriculture            8  ----------------------------------------------------------- Imports:  Main products:               %   Main destinations:    %  Machines &amp; manufactures     34   US                 56.3  Food &amp; beverages            22   EU                 16.9  Petroleum products          14  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: CIA, ABC-Clio and EIU estimates, 1988-91  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Legal actions on BCCI jeopardised Legal actions and payouts to creditors in the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International could be jeopardised in squabbles over access to essential documents, following the Luxembourg ruling against the liquidators' plans late last month. Most of the background papers vital to the legal actions brought by the liquidators at accountants Touche Ross against BCCI's auditors and the Bank of England are held by the government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder in the bank. The surprise ruling from the Luxembourg appeals court on October 27 has now threatened to put new obstacles in the way of access to these documents by the liquidators. A translation of the full text of the hearing, which was circulated late last week, accused Abu Dhabi of breaking Luxembourg law by refusing to hand over documents to liquidators. So far, Touche Ross has had relatively free access to the papers, most of which have been held under strict security conditions in Abu Dhabi where they were moved during the late 1980s. But this co-operation is threatened now that the liquidators may be forced either to ask Abu Dhabi for a greater financial contribution for creditors or to threaten to sue it. One senior professional involved in the case said yesterday: 'There is a grave danger that the shutters will go up all round. Everybody has got themselves into an almighty wrangle.' The government of Abu Dhabi has so far paid several millions of pounds and co-ordinated most of the legal and accounting work necessary in preparing the legal actions, although they have been publicly carried out in Touche Ross's name. As part of the 'contribution agreement' negotiated in early 1992 with BCCI's liquidators, Abu Dhabi would have handed over up to Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) to creditors, but would have taken a half share in any proceeds from successful legal actions - a point the Luxembourg courts ruled unjust to other creditors. BCCI's Treasury operations - and related papers - were moved from London to Abu Dhabi in 1987. Other essential documents on the workings of the bank and its systems have been systematically moved there since. One professional from the liquidators' side admitted there could be problems over access, but said: 'We would not have issued our statements of claim unless we had evidence to back them up.' Touche Ross has begun legal actions against the former auditors to BCCI: Price Waterhouse, Ernst &amp; Whinney, which is now part of Ernst &amp; Young, and Interfiduciaire, a firm which audited the bank in Luxembourg. It has also sued the Bank of England for failing in its regulatory duties on behalf of creditors, and begun a separate action against National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia and Sheikh Khalid bin Mahfouz, former chief operating officer.</p>

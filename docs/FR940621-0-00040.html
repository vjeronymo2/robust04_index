			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Another change is being made to paragraph (a)(2) of &sect;91.207 to correct an error that inadvertently occurred when former &sect;91.52 was revised and renumbered as &sect;91.207 during the recodification of part 91 in 1990. Former paragraph (b)(4) of &sect;91.52 (the predecessor to paragraph (a)(2) of &sect;91.207) contained a reference to three preceding paragraphs. That is, paragraph (a)(1)(i) was included in the subject reference. The reference also should have included paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (a)(1)(iii). This correction is effected by replacing the reference to ``(a)(1)(i)'' with ``(a)(1)'', which subsumes all of the provisions of paragraph (a)(1) into the reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to survival ELT's, the TSO authorization withdrawal will become effective two years after publication of this final rule. The FAA is allowing additional time for the manufacturers of survival ELT's to begin producing, and for operators to begin installing, TSO&hyph;C91a ELT's. For new installations, the new requirements include satellite compatibility, crash survivability, and certain environmental specifications (temperature, water resistance, etc.) that will provide definite improvement at reasonable costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a change is made to &sect;&sect;121.339, 121.353, 125.209, and 135.167 to correct inadvertent errors that were made when the applicable parts were codified in 1971 and 1980. These sections refer to survival ELT's and specifically describe the timely replacement of transmitter batteries. Currently, these sections state that the transmitter batteries must be replaced when the transmitter has been in use for more than one hour  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> and <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when 50 percent of its useful life has expired (according to the specific expiration date). The FAA has always intended and enforced these regulations concerning survival ELT's to prescribe a change of transmitter batteries when either the battery has been in use for more than one hour  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> or <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , when 50 percent of its useful life has expired. This correction is consistent with &sect;91.207 regarding automatic ELT's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Technical Standard Order <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Published simultaneously with this rule, the FAA, pursuant to &sect;21.621 of the Federal Aviation Regulations, is withdrawing each TSO authorization to the extent that it authorizes the holder to identify or mark ELT's with TSO&hyph;C91, effective six months after the publication of this rule for automatic ELT's, and effective two years after publication of this rule for survival ELT's. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed changes to Federal regulations must undergo several economic analyses. First, Executive Order 12866 directs that each Federal agency shall propose or adopt a regulation only upon a reasoned determination that the benefits of the intended regulation justify its costs. Second, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 requires agencies to analyze the economic effect of regulatory changes on small entities. Third, the Office of Management and Budget directs agencies to assess the effects of regulatory changes on international trade. In conducting these analyses, the FAA has determined that this rule: (1) Will generate benefits that justify its costs and is not a significant regulatory action as defined in the Executive Order; (2) is significant as defined in DOT's Policies and Procedures; (3) will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities; and (4) will not constitute a barrier to international trade. These analyses, available in the docket, are summarized below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Costs_Automatic ELT's <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the comments received in response to the NPRM, the FAA has revised its estimates of the rule's costs. The FAA now estimates that the incremental selling price of new ELT's will be $125 per unit above those of old ELT's and that the incremental installation costs will be $150 per unit. The FAA has also re-estimated automatic ELT acquisitions to 3,500 units annually, including units installed on new airplanes and replacements on existing airplanes. Applying these revised estimates to the first 20 years of the rule (1995&hyph;2014), the costs of automatic ELT's will total $19.3 million (or $10.2 million in 1993 dollars at 1994 discounted present value). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Costs_Survival ELT's <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recent efficiencies in production techniques have reduced the costs from those estimated in the NPRM. As a result, the incremental acquisition cost of survival ELT's is estimated to total $500 per unit. The FAA estimates that, during the 1996&hyph;2015 evaluation period, 3,081 new survival ELT's will be installed, costing $1.5 million (or $0.8 million, discounted). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

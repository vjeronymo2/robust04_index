			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Battle lines drawn on health care WITH the publication of President George Bush's 'Comprehensive Health Reform Program' yesterday, the lines have been drawn for a fierce political battle over the US medical system. Mr Bush's proposal is based on providing vouchers of up to Dollars 1,250 per person to help low income families pay for health insurance, as well as allowing middle income families expanded tax deductions for their medical expenses. 'I think the President's plan is one that is comprehensive and compassionate. It provides for the first time a vehicle to finance health insurance for the poor as well as to help those with incomes up to Dollars 80,000. That's 90m Americans who will be benefited,' said Mr Louis Sullivan, secretary of health. The US can in many ways claim unparalleled medical excellence. It also spends more money on health care than any other nation - an estimated Dollars 817bn this year - yet leaves many of its citizens without access to this care. Most Americans believe the system needs reforming. A recent Gallup poll showed 91 per cent agreed there was a health care crisis, but 73 per cent were satisfied with the treatment they received. This paradox helps explain why politicians have for so long regarded health as a no-win issue: any reform proposal was bound to irritate powerful lobbies such as doctors, medical insurance companies or retired people - an influential group who vote in far greater numbers than their younger compatriots. Nevertheless, two glaring problems have at last driven health to the top of the political agenda. The first is that over 35m Americans, most of them employed by businesses that cannot afford coverage for their workforce, have no health insurance and are bankrupted or reduced to charity to obtain medical treatment. The second is runaway inflation in medical costs that has placed an ever-growing burden both on businesses which provide insurance for their employees, and on the US government. The government foots an increasing portion of the US medical bill through Medicare, the federal insurance plan for over-65s, and Medicaid, under which all states except Arizona provide basic health services to the poor. Businesses have long complained about the costs they have to bear. Recently, however, their employees, too, have begun to complain, as companies have boosted the amount of any bill patients must pay themselves and excluded more and more medical services. Three main types of solution have been proposed: A national health insurance system similar to that in Canada. This is proposed notably by Senator Bob Kerrey, one of the Democratic presidential candidates. Its drawback is that it would create a new bureaucracy that would have to be funded by taxes, and would put the private health insurance industry, with an estimated 174,000 employees, out of business. It is viciously attacked by the Republicans as 'socialised medicine,' a charge which ignores the fact that 44 per cent of all health spending already comes from government, through Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' hospitals and other programmes. 'Play or pay,' where employers would choose between providing insurance for employees or paying into a state pool, which would provide basic coverage. This is favoured by many Democrats, including Senator George Mitchell, Senate majority leader, but is criticised by the administration for imposing new costs on business. The voucher system proposed by President Bush to allow low income families to buy their own insurance, coupled with increased tax deductibility for medical expenses to help middle income families. The Bush plan also includes arrangements to help small businesses pool their insurance buying in health insurance networks (HINs.) All of these approaches would address the problem of those with no medical coverage. The administration says its plan would cover 24.1m Americans who are currently uninsured, through vouchers or tax deductions, and 5m more through the reforms it proposes to the insurance market. It acknowledges, however, that 4.9m people will remain uncovered. Some of the sources of soaring costs are easy to pinpoint - unnecessary medical tests, wasted paperwork, and higher malpractice insurance costs as doctors seek to protect themselves against lawsuits. President Bush's proposal to provide vouchers for the poor would, the administration argues, end the problem of cost-shifting, by ensuring that everyone can pay their hospital bills. The administration also hopes to reduce unnecessary medical procedures by encouraging 'co-ordinated care' such as health maintenance organisations (HMOs). In their simplest form, HMOs involve a clinic or group of doctors undertaking to provide all of their members' medical care for a flat annual fee, thus reducing the incentive to order expensive and redundant tests. The administration's white paper claims to offer savings on total US health expenditure of between 6 and 14 per cent - a cumulative total of Dollars 394bn by 1997 and Dollars 954bn by the end of the century. However, President Bush has ducked the question of how to pay the immediate costs to the government of reform. The decision to backpedal on funding is viewed by many as a signal that Mr Bush has no intention of pressing hard for health care reform before the election. He would not be alone among politicians in contiunuing to view health care as a no-win issue.</p>

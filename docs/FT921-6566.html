			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Benson returns to the black with Pounds 27.9m KLEINWORT BENSON, the merchant bank, yesterday disclosed that in 1991 it had recovered to pre-tax profits of Pounds 27.9m from the 1990 deficit of Pounds 68m. Mr David Peake, chairman, also said that talks were continuing on the formation of an alliance with Banque Nationale de Paris, the French bank. However, these talks were unlikely to be completed until BNP had completed its discussions on forming a separate link with Dresdner Bank, the German bank. Kleinwort's 1991 profits were less than it had been anticipating a year ago, because the recession in the UK forced it to make a Pounds 39m provision against possible losses on loans. The bulk of these losses were incurred on loans to small- and medium-sized companies. During the year, the group reduced its portfolio of corporate loans to Pounds 661m (Pounds 880m). 'The level of provisioning should be lower in the current year,' Mr Peake said. He was pleased with the progress of Kleinwort's equities or stockbroking activities, which caused it considerable problems in the early years after they were acquired outright in 1986. Kleinwort made 'steady profits' from market-making, or the wholesaling of shares, and it also increased its market share of business with investment institutions. The merchant banking segment, which includes the corporate finance department and securities operations, made profits of Pounds 24.7m on loan capital, against losses of Pounds 35.1m. There was a modest fall from Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 27.4m) in profits of the investment management division. Mr Peake blamed a small bad debt incurred in the private banking operations and a decline in unit trust sales. The full-year dividend is maintained at 16p with an unchanged final of 10.7p. Earnings per share were 14.34p (losses 36.77p). Separately, Kleinwort announced the retirement of Mr David Benson, a member of the bank's founding family, as vice-chairman - though he will remain a non-executive director - and the appointment to the new post of deputy chairman of Mr Simon Robertson, already a Kleinwort director. As a result, Mr David Clementi will become sole head of the corporate finance department, a role he had been sharing with Mr Robertson. COMMENT Kleinwort's return on capital is still a long way short of satisfactory. Profits after tax equated to just 4.5 per cent of shareholders' funds - it would have done considerably better to have invested its capital in a building society account. It has been a difficult year for most lending banks and corporate financiers. However, it is making something of a habit of earning lowly returns - it has done so in four out of the last five years. Poor performance has forced it to pay part of the dividend out of reserves, having paid all of the dividend from reserves in 1990 and a large slice of it from reserves in 1988. On a more positive note, the equities division is at last performing reasonably following years of difficulties. The pruning of the loan book probably also means that loan losses will diminish. Pre-tax profits should recover to about Pounds 45m in the current year which would at least cover a maintained dividend, putting the shares, at 265p, on a yield of 8 per cent - which is about right. There may even be some upside, if BNP and Dresdner decide to bid for all or some of the shares.</p>

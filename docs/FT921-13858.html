			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Private View: Portrait of the artist as moral campaigner - Victoria Gillick is a single-minded self-appointed campaigner against sexual licence and the Progressive Establishment. She explains her views to Christian Tyler 'EITHER I'M mad, or I do have a point,' said Victoria Gillick. She was sitting in the scruffy living room of her house, rubbing her arms and explaining why she campaigns against sexual licence. 'I am under no illusion that what I am doing is fruitless. But it has to be done. It's a war of attrition. In the end, even if I did nothing the thing would resolve itself - because history always does.' Victoria Gillick has the singleminded boldness of the revolutionary. Her enemy is the Progressive Establishment, which she sees as a conspiracy of social engineers with discredited theories who are undermining parents and damaging their children. Although she claims the support of a silent majority she runs no organisation. Consequently, she has left herself, her artist husband Gordon and their ten children vulnerable to derision, abuse and the obsessive attention of the prurient Press. I travelled to the foggy fenland town of Wisbech where the Gillicks live after reading last week that Mrs Gillick had reported the head doctor at the Brook Advisory Centre in Birmingham to the General Medical Council. She alleges that the clinic is flouting a 1985 ruling of the Law Lords in a famous case which she herself brought that only in exceptional circumstances could doctors give contraceptive advice or treatment to girls under 16 without their parents' consent. Victoria Gillick is not quite the militant earth-mother I had expected from reading her book, A Mother's Tale, an apologia by turns trenchant and sentimental. I found a strong, feminine woman, gentle-voiced with a husky laugh. Occasionally her eyes had the fey look one imagines in a Thomas Hardy heroine. She was serious enough, but her suspicion of me and my trade made her skittish. Her first explanation of her motives came as a surprise. She said it was her training as a painter. 'I've often worried why one felt so ill at ease in this society, and I can only think it's for the same reason as someone like Mary Whitehouse (the veteran broadcasting campaigner). She, too, was art trained. 'All your instincts are to try and make harmony and order and sense. All one's training is for that purpose. I feel ill at ease when I find the moral images, the way people behave, out of kilter. The colours are wrong, the balance has gone, the composition is all out.' I ventured to suggest it was more psychological than that - perhaps to do with the fact that her own parents separated. She would have none of it. 'That's what the New Statesman said. They said I actually didn't like children: that's why I went on having lots and lots of them, to try and demonstrate that I did like them.' Wife and husband are Catholics, and Gordon - a strong-minded and articulate man - appears to support his wife on every point. They told me that as Catholics they belonged to a critical, non-conformist, tradition more truly English than Protestant puritanism. They are proud to be non-joiners, outsiders, who have no social status and therefore none to lose. Isn't it moral or religious fervour that drives you? 'No', she said, quietly. 'I have a strong faith, but I'm not a very good Christian. I'm a practising Catholic, but I'm not a very good one.' What is it that you're bad at? 'That's my business.' Then she conceded: 'It's not believing in God that's difficult, but day-to-day living.' I pressed. You could be seen as some sort of religious nutter, couldn't you? 'Well, only because for some reason or other we tolerate journalists exposing their own religious prejudices, to the extent that I am always referred to as 'a Roman Catholic mother-of-ten.' I have a theory that this is what one person referred to as up-market, middle-class Paki-bashing. I notice that when Enoch Powell brought in his Embryo Bill nobody ever referred to him as an Anglican father-of-two. That would have been an insult against the monarchy, an attack on the State itself.' I suggested that it was disingenuous of her not to recognise that being a Catholic and against artificial contraception had got something to do with it. 'It's not got something to do with it for me. It might for those who look on.' Where does your being a Catholic come into this? 'The Catholics are used to being at the sharp end of moral issues. They have a history and tradition of radicalism. I believe that the individual conscience has to take precedence over everything.' Aren't you asserting your views at other people's expense? 'Yes. But that is my democratic right. There's nothing wrong in that. People only think you are exerting your views over them when they disagree with you. 'I have not introduced any law allowing the unborn to be destroyed. But for criticising politicians for introducing that law I am called undemocratic. I haven't taken away anybody's life. You see, it's a peculiar reversal. If I criticise doctors for doing something, they ask by what right do I try and impose my views on them. But they are already actually doing the thing.' Are you a self-appointed champion? 'I don't even think in terms of champion. This is journalese.' You tell me what you call it. 'I call myself a ratcatcher, actually.' You do it with distaste? 'No. That's not true.' How is it, then? 'Like, I believe, some men feel when they are in the heat of battle. They don't do it with distaste, they do it because it's a job that's got to be done. 'I just get so boiled up and angry that other people should have an opportunity to promote their views in the papers and I can't be heard when mine is as valid as theirs. 'I'm a big mouth that speaks for other people. The media need a voice. I'll be the voice. I'm only sad when they try to hit the person behind the voice, or, even worse, hit the children of the person behind the voice. That's when I wonder whether it was worth it.' You feel the family has paid too high a price? 'I know the family's paid too high a price.' In what ways? 'Exposure. The feeling of being tailed, dogged, taunted by the media.' Do you lie awake at night? 'Only when the children have suffered. I do consider that grossly unfair that women who have children can be shot down through their children. Men are protected. Politicians are not attacked for that.' Half-way through the interview, Victoria Gillick broke off suddenly and said: 'Here comes scum on legs.' She had seen a Sun reporter crossing the road. A photographer waited in the car. 'They hang about for days. Then you get the telephoto lens on the house, day after day after day. You end up having to shut the shutters up. You can't go out. What a disgusting job to do.' She laughed bitterly. I turned to the subject of her opponents, suggesting that they, too, might be well-intentioned ratcatchers. No, she said. Her targets were not doctors and other professionals but 'those who are actually creating policy. They know precisely what they are about.' Why are they doing it? 'I don't know. I know I am following the Ten Commandments. I don't know what they are following.' When you meet them don't you find well-meaning people who have just got it wrong? 'No - and I am not just saying this - I feel like some kind of rumbustious anarchist. I feel like someone who's alive. They always strike me as being intensely puritanical. 'That is a peculiarity about people who are intensely involved in sexual matters, which I'm not, funnily enough. I'm just an observer. They always strike me as cool to the point of being semi-dead - the most inappropriate people to talk about these subjects to youngsters. Curious. 'If I showed you some of the books they've written, you'd say they must be really raunchy, I mean they must be Wow] Then you meet them and they're the most tight, quiet, intense little people. And you think they actually don't like their own bodies. 'I get the feeling they don't like procreation. There's something that disgusts them. They're the first to condemn me for having ten children, as though I had committed some heinous sexual sin. They've been thrown into a dilemma: they've said because I'm a Catholic I have most terribly repressive ideas about sex, and then they say 'she's a sex maniac because she's got ten children.' They can't sort it out.' Why did you have ten children? 'I'm very good at having children. In the past women couldn't easily have them. This is a golden age for having children. I wanted lots of children.' She denied that any special sacrifice was involved. If the family was relatively poor, that was because as artists she and her husband were 'not very good at earning a living.' 'I consider that we live very well, because we live in a big house, though by most people's standards probably battered and dirty. But we are energetic about it and Gordon can build and make things. And what we prize - anyone with a large family would prize - is a certain degree of space and time with the children.' It wouldn't suit everybody, I said. 'No. It's your free choice. My choice was to have children.' I suggested to her that people would inevitably judge her by her children, five girls and five boys, ranging from 23-year-old Ben to nine-year-old Clemmie. 'Well, they misunderstood me. I brought the case against the government not because I thought that I was inviolate - one or two of the judges misunderstood this too - but because I felt as vulnerable as everybody else.' Parents, she said, were exceptionally vulnerable. 'They don't have any trade union to defend them. A parent can end up in court far faster than a doctor can or a teacher. I've always believed that being a parent was not a difficult job provided others in the community supported it.' Only a minority, she argued, had abdicated to the extent that state intervention was needed. Victoria Gillick thinks she will be proved right in the long run, like those who have campaigned against environmental pollution. 'In time we will look back on this age, in which we drugged women, daily drugged them, in order to make them infertile, as insane. 'What people do is between them and their Maker. All I know is that what contraception was supposed to cure it hasn't cured. There is the same poverty. It hasn't improved living accommodation. It hasn't made men more caring and thoughtful and responsible towards their wives. When anything goes wrong with the relationship they simply walk away.' She thinks we have not yet recovered from the shock of two world wars and an acceptance of then-necessary state intervention and mobilisation. 'People have not learned really how to assert themselves.' Moral teaching had been forgotten. 'Your average youngster doesn't know what you are talking about when you talk about traditional Christian behaviour. They don't know where they have gone wrong. It's tragic. It's like looking at people who are sitting down to a complicated game of chess, and though they know the general idea is to enjoy yourself and to win something at the end of it, they haven't got a clue what the rules are. They are what has been called technological giants and moral pygmies. 'Being of an older tradition than the humanist, I am not surprised to find, when you legislate against the Ten Commandments - which are so very simple and basic to the smooth running of society - that you end up with an epidemic of killing disease, a level of rape and child abuse and the general dishonesty that we have. 'Why did we have the Ten Commandments in the first place? We don't impose such things to make life difficult, but to make life easy. The government has tried to make life easy. It's in fact made it very, very difficult.' Victoria Gillick may never see the code she lives by legislated back into our secular state. But the moral tide may, after all, be turning. Shortly after meeting her I read that Marks &amp; Spencer was withdrawing some children's clothes after complaints that they were sexually provocative. Victoria Gillick is not mad. Personally, I think she has a point.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Cairo bomb kills four A bomb killed four people and injured 16 outside a police station in central Cairo yesterday, the bloodiest bomb attack in more than a year of political violence in Egypt, Reuter reports from Cairo. The explosion fits a pattern of violence by Moslem militants fighting to turn Egypt into a strict Islamic state. More than 120 people have been killed since March last year, by militant gunmen and bombers or in retaliatory raids by the security forces. The blast was in an area near the headquarters of two daily newspapers and Cairo's main railway station.</p>

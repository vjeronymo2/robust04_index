			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Tiphook agrees to sell container business for maximum of Pounds 757m Tiphook, the debt-laden UK transport leasing group, has agreed to sell its container business for a maximum of Pounds 757m - Pounds 73m below the Pounds 830m price it agreed in November with the buyer, Transamerica, the US financial services group. The proceeds could be further reduced by between Pounds 38m and Pounds 48m, which will be placed in an escrow account and be subject to further claims by Transamerica under the disposal agreement. This means that Tiphook should receive a minimum of Pounds 709m for the container business, the group's largest asset. Although significantly less than initially announced, the consideration is still above earlier market expectations and should substantially reduce Tiphook's debts of about Pounds 1.1bn. Tiphook's shares last night closed 6p down at 66p. Tiphook said that the detailed terms of the contract were being negotiated and would be finalised 'as soon as possible'. However, the group said it was confident that 'this is the final price'. The proceeds will be enough to pay off Tiphook's total secured debt of Pounds 480m owed to the group's banks, which are led by National Westminster and Commerzbank of Germany. However, unsecured US bondholders, who have lent Tiphook Dollars 700m, are in a more exposed position. The US bonds were last night trading at just over a 10 per cent discount to face value. Bond market experts believe Tiphook could still be deluged by litigation from bondholders, claiming to have been misled by over-confident assertions about the company's prospects. Tiphook's debt was downgraded to so-called junk-bond status within months of issue last year. Tiphook believes it will be able to service its remaining debt by retaining the group's other activities - including its fleet of 25,037 truck trailers, the biggest in Europe. The group said a circular on the containers disposal, which must be approved by shareholders and certain providers of finance, would be sent out as soon as practicable. Results for the six months to October 31 will be announced then. The results are likely to be poor. Tiphook yesterday emphasised that it was experiencing pressures on margins in most of its markets, although December's monthly fleet utilisation figures were stable.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Lafarge lifts profits 50% to FFr1.04bn Lafarge Coppee, the French construction materials group, yesterday announced net profits of FFr1.04bn (Dollars 190m) for the first half, an increase of 50 per cent compared with the same period in 1993. The increase was achieved on a rise of 8 per cent in sales to FFr15.4bn and reflected a strong improvement in many of its business sectors and a reduction in financial charges. Earnings per share rose by 20 per cent to FFr13.50. Lafarge Coppee said the first half saw significant recovery in prices and margins in the North American market, an improvement in the Spanish market and increased profitability of its plaster operations in Europe, underpinning a 38 per cent increase in operating profits to FFr2.01bn. Performance was further improved by lower financial charges following a reduction in the company's debts. At the end of June this year, net debts stood at FFr4bn, compared with FFr5.4bn at the beginning of the year. The reduction partly reflected net gains of FFr2.1bn from asset sales. The building materials group revealed a sharp increase in investments for the first half of the year, increasing expenditure by 22 per cent to FFr2.36bn.</p>

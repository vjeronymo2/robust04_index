			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / World Trade News: NCM may expand into Asia NCM, the Dutch-based international credit insurer, said yesterday it was considering expanding into Asia, where credit insurance was relatively under-developed compared with Europe, the group's main market, writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam. Mr Harry Groen, NCM's chairman, said the company hoped to have a 'presence of one form or another' in Asia within the next couple of years, extending growth abroad that has seen the company buy or launch operations in six countries, including Britain, since the early 1990s. NCM last year insured deliveries of goods and services worth Fl 147.9bn (Pounds 52.6bn). Recent economic difficulties in Germany had led to a rise in credit insurance claims from companies doing business with German customers. The company had also recently tightened its policy on covering trade credits on business with Italy, Spain and Portugal because of several years of high claims.</p>

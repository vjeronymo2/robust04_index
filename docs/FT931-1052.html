			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Akers-Jones asserts his loyalty to HK SIR David Akers-Jones, the former chief secretary of Hong Kong who will shortly become China's first expatriate adviser on the colony's affairs, is a little confused. He has been surprised and yes, a little saddened, by the reaction to his appointment in Britain, the land of his birth. The adjective 'perfidious', which China reserves for Governor Chris Patten, has, in the UK at least, now been used to describe his decision to accept Beijing's shilling; his loyalty has been questioned. 'There is no question about my loyalty,' Sir David said yesterday. 'My loyalty is to Hong Kong and my desire to do all I can to help Hong Kong with its relations with China - to ensure co-operation and understanding.' Sir David's mooted appointment as a China adviser, which has yet to be formally announced, has drawn a cool response from the Hong Kong government, his former employer. Between clenched teeth, colleagues are contemptuous of his decision. 'The Chinese are welcome to him,' said one. Others commented that, in his professional life, he had always been willing to see China's point of view and had advocated a slow development of democracy in the colony. Sir David, who is clearly proud of being chosen as China's first expatriate adviser, says he hopes to be able to contribute advice to China from a different point of view to its local Hong Kong Chinese advisers. 'I have been involved in the political development of Hong Kong for a great deal of my professional life as well as in its planning and infrastructure development. I think I know what we need to do for the territory's future development,' he said. 'There is a lack of knowledge in Beijing of how the Hong Kong government works and how decisions are taken. This could be very useful to China and so I hope to be able to bring some of that knowledge and understanding to bear in the advice I give.' As for Hong Kong's political system, he regards the introduction of limited democratic elections, in September 1991, as a retrograde step. They did not, he believes, produce a Legislative Council (the local law making body) 'representative of Hong Kong's polity'. He is concerned about the government's plans for elections in 1995 and accepts China's reading of the current breakdown of relations. 'I would like to see the government return to the understandings reached (between the UK and China in early 1990) and the assumptions the Chinese quite reasonably made from those exchanges.' In particular, the Hong Kong government should shelve its plans to create nine new LegCo seats, the electorates of which are drawn from Hong Kong's 2.7m working population. Instead, they should resemble the existing 'functional' seats which draw their voters from the professions and business groups. 'One of the achievements of Lord Wilson (the colony's former governor) was the idea of the smooth transition and the 'through train' concept, whereby those elected in 1995 served after 1997. It is an achievement that should not be sacrificed.'</p>

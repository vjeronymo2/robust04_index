			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Private View: Inner struggle of a fighter in Britain's coal war - Neil Greatrex is the new head of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers. Nine years ago he helped lead his men out of the NUM. He explains why he is still a leftwinger IT IS A story of conflicting loyalties and apparent betrayal, a story in which the enemy of the enemy proved to be no friend. Neil Greatrex is a Nottinghamshire coal-miner who helped lead his men out of the National Union of Mineworkers yet keeps an NUM loyalty certificate hanging proudly in the hall of his house. 'People who've been round say: What the bloody 'ell you got that up for? But I was a member of the NUM for 20 years, and proud of it.' Elected president of the rebel Union of Democratic Mineworkers three months ago, Greatrex is lobbying ministers and managers as the future of British coal is re-assessed in a White Paper expected in the next couple of weeks. He may be an NUM rebel, but Greatrex is no friend of the government which profited from the union split to defeat the 1984-5 miners' strike: he condemns it not because it betrayed the union rebels but because it is Conservative. 'When people say to me the government owe you, they don't owe me a thing,' he said. 'Because I've never done anything to support 'em. 'That's where people get it wrong. We're often accused - and you (the Press) do it more so than anybody - of being a breakaway union that supported the government in '84. Now I'm telling you, nobody in Notts supported the Tory government. What they did was to fight for the right to democracy within the NUM.' The UDM president is an abrasive, humorous man very much in the mould of his area and profession. He was always an activist. What is more, unlike most Nottinghamshire miners, he was a left-winger. His political baptism came at the age of 16 when he raised his hand at a branch meeting in support of his elder brother. His intervention swung the decision against the right-wing leadership; so they disallowed his vote. 'I thought, if that's the attitude of the union officials we're supposed to elect and supposed to be democratic . . . So I started a bit of a campaign - probably arrogance more than anything - against them.' Five years later he got his way: he was one of a group of young left-wingers who toppled the old guard. A few weeks into the 1984 strike, history repeated itself. Arthur Scargill, president of the NUM, had come to meet the Nottinghamshire branch officials who were refusing to call their men out without a ballot. 'I gave him merry 'ell,' Greatrex recalled. 'I practically begged him to call a ballot even then. And he turned to Heathfield (Peter Heathfield, NUM general secretary) and said: 'You answer 'im. I don't want to talk to 'im'. And Heathfield says: 'You're not having a ballot because we don't trust you.' That's the worst thing he could have said.' Greatrex had been a militant in the 1972 and 1974 coal strikes and had campaigned for both Scargill and Heathfield. 'I'm not ashamed to say it, even now, because I felt at that time they would be better for the membership. Unfortunately everyone's got a cross to bear, and that's probably mine.' He read his Marx and Engels, and the works of an obscure Chinese revolutionary recommended to him by Joe Whelan, the Communist former secretary of the Nottinghamshire area. He wielded a shovel on the coalface as a ripper before graduating to union safety officer. 'I was ripping all day, I was footballing all weekend and boxing three nights a week.' Was he any good as a boxer? 'I did it for fun more than anything. But my nose is still straight so I couldn't have been too bad at it,' he laughed. The day he got married to his wife Sheila, there was a reception at Bentinck colliery welfare club. It happened that a union meeting had been called downstairs for 6pm to vote on whether one coalface (where Greatrex was working) should stay on four shifts while the rest went down to three. 'So me and 20 others had to go down to union meeting. The in-laws haven't got over it from that day to this,' he laughed. 'And we still lost the vote.' Like many miners, Greatrex contemplated another career. His mother wanted something better for her sons. But his father refused to sign the paper necessary for him to join the Army as an engineering cadet ('If it's good enough for me it's good enough for you,' was his response) and a joinery apprenticeship turned out to mean sweeping up in the shop for only Pounds 2.50 a week. So, like his grandfather, father and three brothers, down the pit he went. At least it was a secure job. Greatrex said: 'You didn't really worry about the security. You never gave that a second thought. Everybody knew that mining had been about for years and they expected it to carry on for years.' Greatrex ascribed the union split to two things: Scargill's refusal to take the constitutional route and the behaviour of the flying pickets who came across the border from Yorkshire and one day turned over the three-wheeler car of a crippled Bentinck miner, with the man inside it. He blames Scargill not only for a gross tactical error which he believes led to an acceleration of pit closures - 120 were shut, 13 of them in Nottinghamshire - after the strike was lost. 'I'll never forgive Scargill. All he's done is ruin thousands of people. He's ruined thousands of family relationships.' He said his own relationship with his elder daughter, Colette, was ruined for years. She was 10 at the start of the strike and, at the age when she was expecting a bit more freedom, could not understand that threats against the family made it dangerous for her go outside alone. 'It's took nearly eight years to get that relationship right again,' Greatrex said. His father, a Scargill supporter, stopped talking to his son in 1984 and went to his grave five years later without breaking his silence. The UDM president did not get on too well with his own predecessor, either. He describes Roy Lynk, the man he defeated last December, as a one-man band who kept his cards to his chest and was deceived into thinking he had friends in high places who would protect the jobs of the miners who had broken with the NUM. One-man bands were bad for winning popular support. The public outcry that helped overturn Michael Heseltine's decision to close 31 pits as a prelude to privatisation had been 'nothing short of a miracle', he said. 'And I think, to be fair, Scargill has played his role in this. He's been told to tone it down because of public support, so he's played his role by keeping his gob shut. 'I think people right throughout the land are pig sick of unemployment and they've said 'Enough's enough'. That's what worries me about the campaign we're doing now. I know it focuses on mining, but I've tried to get the message across that you can't just isolate miners in this argument. It's everybody, every form of worker that's losing their jobs.' At the age of 41, Greatrex has found himself unexpectedly propelled into a national political crisis. I asked him for his impressions of Whitehall and Westminster. You have talked to Heseltine, I said. 'Well, we shouted the first time, but we've spoken since.' What do make of him? 'Heseltine's bothered about Heseltine and nobody else.' What about John Major? 'I had a different impression of him entirely. I've always seen him on television as somebody guarded; he looks like you could pick him up and shake 'im to shake some life into 'im. In real life it's not like that at all. I honestly believed there was some compassion in the chap and that he genuinely wanted to help to resolve the situation.' He described Sir Marcus Fox, the Yorkshire MP who is chairman of the Conservative backbenchers, as 'a genuine chap' who wanted to help - 'not because we're the UDM but because we're mineworkers.' By temperament and political background Neil Greatrex is uncomfortable about hob-nobbing in private with Conservative politicians or British Coal managers. Although he clearly regards Scargill's puritan refusal to engage at all as irresponsible, he is aware of the dangers of the backstairs chat. 'I've prided meself that I never wanted to change from when I was branch president at Bentinck and I've worked hard at not changing. 'I've seen it happen that many times when you've got a branch lad elected to a full-time official and he seems to change overnight. He becomes aloof from the membership, becomes aloof from all the friends he's had. I've never wanted to do that. I take people as I find them and they take me as they find me.' Shouldn't a union leader be leading his members as well as serving them? 'Its a compromise of both. One reason I stood against Roy Lynk is because Roy refused to take people to meetings. No-one knew what were being discussed and I object strongly to that. A leader should keep his national executive committee informed when he's discussing thousands of other people's lives - for his own sake, too. 'Obviously there's times when you've got to lead from front anyway and I've always been prepared to do that.' Have you got a different view of the system than you had? 'I have, and it annoys me. It annoys me in the sense that there's more compromises or agreements made sitting round a table over lunch than what there is sat in a formal meeting with proper negotiations. I don't like that. Going into bloody alleys and doorways with British Coal . . . that's what happens. But if you want to get the agreements for your members you have to go along with that. I find it difficult but I'll get used to it.' Won't you get corrupted by it? 'No.' After a pause, he added: 'You all know it happens that British Coal and people offer you various things: 'Would you like to come to 't races?' or things like that. Without fear of contradiction I don't think you'll find that Neil Greatrex goes to many of them, if any.' No box at Ascot, not even the silver ring at Doncaster? 'Well, that wouldn't bother me 'cos I hate bloody horse-racing anyway.' He laughed. 'It would have to be something like Razor Ruddock fighting Lennox Lewis.'</p>

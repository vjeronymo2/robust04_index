			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Nato allies to reassure Yeltsin THE main Nato allies will try to reassure Russia about the prospects for an early enlargement of the alliance without ruling out the possibility that some eastern European countries may eventually join. Britain, France, Germany and the US will co-ordinate their responses to a letter from President Boris Yeltsin warning against an expansion of Nato and proposing joint arrangements for guaranteeing the security of eastern Europe. The letter was sent to the countries which were party to the 1990 'Two plus Four' treaty on German unification. Although Russian officials said the contents of the letter were confidential, they made clear that Moscow considered an extension of Nato would be in conflict with the spirit of the treaty. The treaty, which allowed the whole of Germany to be part of Nato, prohibited the stationing of foreign troops or nuclear weapons in former eastern Germany. British officials said they rejected Moscow's interpretation of this as precluding enlargement of the alliance. Article 10 of The North Atlantic Treaty stipulates that any other European state may be invited to join. Mr Yeltsin's initiative is seen as a bid to rectify what appears to have been a rash statement during a recent visit to Warsaw, when he indicated that Russia would have no objection to Poland's joining Nato. This was poorly received by Russia's military establishment, which sees Russia threatened with isolation next to an overwhelmingly dominant military bloc. Nato's policy towards countries such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, which all aspire to join, is set to be the focus of an alliance summit in January. France and Britain, in particular, have been urging caution. In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's office said it saw Mr Yeltsin's letter not as a rebuff 'but as an offer of co-operation'.</p>

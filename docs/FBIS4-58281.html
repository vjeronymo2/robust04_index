			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "An Evil Omen"] </F>   [Text] The indication given by the U.S. Administration that  it will impose the "Special 301" trade law on India is proof of  the U.S. mentality of economic imperialism. Overlooking the  provisions of the "GATT" world trade agreement in making such a  decision could ultimately lead to a new Cold War -- a situation  that could prove harmful to the United States -- because no  country can ignore its economic interests to defend U.S.  economic and trade interests. It is true that the United States  is the only superpower in the world today, but it would be an  intolerable situation if it were to act unilaterally and resort  to bullying tactics.    The U.S. Administration's endeavors to maintain its own  economic prosperity following President Clinton's assumption of  office is totally unjustifiable. There was a time when U.S.  presidents -- President Kennedy, for instance -- tried to rid  the world of poverty and tried to see that poor nations  prospered along with the United States. Today, however, the  Clinton Administration is hell-bent on acting arbitrarily. If  the United States continues to act this way, it will loose the  sympathy of other countries in the world. When this happens,  ill will may develop and it is likely that developing countries  may start to regard the United States as a hostile country. It  is certain that if it looses the sympathy of the developing and  poor countries, the United States will have difficulty finding  markets for its products. It is no secret that the United  States is currently facing a recession, and many East Asian  countries and Japan are not proving to be suitable markets for  the United States. In fact, it is impossible for the United  States to act arbitrarily simply because it is a leading country.    The U.S. argument regarding the application of "Special 301"  to India is that the Indian Government has not taken effective  steps on copyright and patent issues. This argument is not  completely correct. The truth is that the Indian Government has  taken considerable and effective steps regarding copyright and  patent issues. Because of these steps, there is no logic in  imposing the "Special 301" law on the pretext of "inaction" on  the issue. Of course, it is only right that those who want to  get rich by copying U.S. products should be restrained; no  encouragement should be given to theft and copying. When it is  amply clear that the Indian Government is taking every step to  curtail this, however, the United States should refrain from  adopting aggressive postures.    The U.S. Administration's decision to brand China as the  biggest thief of U.S. products reflects the imperialistic  mentality of the United States. Undoubtedly, the theft and  copying of products by some people does not warrant declaring  the entire country a thief, and punishing or imposing sanctions  against it is not natural justice. If the United States tries  to defend its economic and trade interests by wielding a "big  stick," such action could not be called appropriate.    As far as patent rights are concerned, the United States has  enforced a "product patent" policy under which any scientist or  entrepreneur has the right to produce and sell special products.  Without permission, nobody can produce or manufacture that  product. India has a "production system" patent policy. Under  the Indian policy, no other person can adopt a patented  production system, but the same products can be manufactured by  a different production system. The United States wants India to  enforce the same "product patent" policy that is prevalent in  the United States. It is clear that the Americans want to  become the owners of products developed from hidden natural  wealth or by scientific techniques. Accordingly, the United  States has enforced a "product patent" policy. If the United  States does not want to share its intellectual, scientific, and  technical knowledge with all of humanity, it could only be  described as anti-humanist.    It would be better if the United States reconsidered its  patent policy. If the United States wants to remain the leading  nation in the world, it will have to share its intellect and  skill with the entire world and all of humanity. Neither the  United States nor any country can claim to be a superpower if it  does not show magnanimity. If the United States tries to remain  a superpower by adopting bullying tactics or starting an arms  race, it will earn only ill will -- not sympathy -- which will  create economic as well as political problems for itself. The  indications that the United States will bring India under  "Special 301" are not only a bad omen, they strengthen  apprehensions regarding its intentions at a time when the prime  minister's U.S. visit is only a few days away. Maybe the  "Special 301" question has been raised in an attempt to pressure  India regarding the signing of Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Raising this issue on the eve of the prime minister's U.S.  visit, though, cannot be taken as a positive gesture. It would  be better if the United States came to understood fully that  India will never yield to such pressure tactics.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURDER-FOR-HIRE SUSPECT BROUGHT TO L.A. FOR TRIAL  </P> <P> The woman accused of directing the murder-for-hire of New York theatrical  producer Roy Radin was booked for investigation of murder after her extradition  to Los Angeles from Florida, authorities said Saturday.  </P> <P> Karen De Layne Greenberger, 41, known as "Lanie," arrived Friday from Florida,  where she was arrested in early October for allegedly commissioning Radin's  death in 1983, Sheriff's Deputy Detta Roberts said.  </P> <P> Greenberger, formerly known as Elaine Jacobs, has been described by authorities  as a West Coast cocaine dealer. She was in custody and scheduled to be  arraigned Monday, Roberts said.  </P> <P> Greenberger, along with alleged triggermen William Molony Mentzer, Alex Lamota  Marti and Robert Ulmer Lowe, could face the death penalty if convicted of  murder with special circumstances. The complaint alleges that they killed Radin  for financial gain.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Radin was killed because he rebuffed efforts by Greenberger  for payments she sought in connection with the financing of the 1984 movie,  "The Cotton Club."  </P></p>

That was the blunt choice facing Mr Major and the  Government yesterday, according to one leading Tory Euro-sceptic.    Yet at Westminster there was an air of disbelief at the way  a  dispute over arcane procedures for voting in the EC's [European  Commission] Council of Ministers had re-opened Conservative  divisions on Europe and put Britain at odds with 10 other  members of the Community.    Since the Maastricht Treaty became law last July -- after  bringing the Government to the brink of defeat -- there had been  an uneasy truce between the pro and anti-European wings of the  Conservative Party.    Attention had switched to the delicate task of drafting a  Tory manifesto on which Mr William Cash -- the arch Euro-sceptic  -- and Mr Hugh Dykes, a staunch federalist -- could campaign  with some unity in the elections to the European Parliament on  June 9.    But the ferment among Conservative MPs over the past 48  hours  is proof that the party's fault lines over Europe are as active  as ever below the surface.    Many regard the question of voting rights as a key test of  whether or not the Government would stand by assurances that the  Maastricht Treaty represented the limit of further transfer of  sovereignty to Brussels -- at least until the next  inter-government conference on the future of the Community in  1996.    "Maastricht was supposed to be the high-water mark," said  one  Euro-sceptic. Another accused the EC of deliberately seeking to  water down Britain's ability to block controversial European  legislation on the environment and health and safety issues --  which could result in measures in the Social Chapter being  forced through piecemeal.    There is little doubt that the disquiet goes far wider than  the usual hard-core of 30 or so determined Euro-rebels. A  number of mainstream Tories, who would normally opt for a quiet  life, have signalled their opposition to any cave-in to  Brussels. They believe the only hope the Conservatives have of  bringing their supporters out in the Euro-elections is to tap  public concern about the way the EC interferes in national life.  One of the few issues on which the Tories still lead Labour in  the opinion polls is on standing up for Britain against  Brussels. That is a trump card which could lose its potency if  the party was plunged into an acrimonious internal dispute over  weakening Britain's voting strength in the Community.    Yet the dispute puts at risk what Mr Major has regarded as  one of the crowning achievements of British diplomacy  post-Maastricht -- enlargement of the Community. Further delay  could sink plans for the admission early next year of Austria,  Finland, Sweden and Norway.    On his return to London yesterday Mr Hurd said getting those  four likeminded countries, which would be net contributors to  the EC budget, would be a "huge prize." It seems inconceivable  that Mr Hurd and Mr Major would risk derailing the enlargement  process.    But the Government appears to be backed into a corner of its  own making. Instead of preparing the ground for the change,  arguing that it was a necessary price for the wider benefits of  enlargement, which might help to curb the rising cost of British  membership of the Community, it has turned it into the biggest  confrontation with the EC since the Social Chapter.    The advice of British diplomats in Brussels, led by Sir John  Kerr, Britain's ambassador to the EC, was that keeping the  blocking minority at 23 was unattainable. It was, he said, a  battle that should not be fought.    Yet Mr Major has decided to play to his domestic audience.  Certainly, Conservative whips have told Ministers there is a  strong groundswell of opinion among Tory MPs against making  further concessions to Brussels.    Some MPs fear that Mr Major has stumbled into a Euro  cul-de-sac without having an escape route planned. When the  inevitable climb-down comes, with some inglorious Brussels fudge  which would concede the central principle of a bigger blocking  minority, the humiliation will be all the greater. It will be a  damaging blow to the Prime Minister's authority and could reopen  the Maastricht wounds in the Tory party.    Even now, the Foreign Office is working on possible  compromises. The Community has been to the brink of disaster so  many times before that most observers find it hard to believe  that the crisis will NOT be averted.    But Mr Major may yet decide that a bust-up with the EC could  pay electoral dividends for the Conservatives in the European  elections -- though it seems unlikely he can delay a decision  until after polling day on June 9.    For most of her 11 years in power Mrs Thatcher was in a  permanent state of confrontation with the rest of the Community,  swinging her "handbag" at fellow European leaders with gusto.  But she usually knew when to stand and fight and when to beat a  tactical retreat.    Mr Major's trouble is that few Ministers or MPs believe he  has chosen an issue on which he can win -- or back down without  inflicting further political damage on himself.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Ministers query cost of trade groups THE prospect of streamlining the hundreds of trade associations in the UK to bring greater efficiency into industrial lobbying is being raised by ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry, concerned that the plethora of organisations could be hindering business's competitiveness. In informal meetings with industrialists and businessmen, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, have been asking whether companies are getting value for money from their membership of a range of associations. The ministers are conscious that even medium-sized businesses may spend several thousand pounds each year on membership of as many as 20 trade associations. Most trade associations employ a levy formula based on a percentage of the member company's payroll or turnover, or both. The Chemical Industries Association, for example, charges its 220 members using a formula based on turnover and the actual number of employees. The CIA has a turnover of Pounds 4.2m a year and the minimum charge is Pounds 3,650. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has 100 members charged Pounds 14,000 to Pounds 180,000 a year. While the DTI emphasises that the future of trade associations must be for industry to decide, in making it clear which organisations they take seriously, Mr Heseltine and his colleagues have a powerful way of putting pressure on those they see as less valuable. The dual pressures on associations - declining income combined with increasing costs as they have to operate in Brussels as well as at Westminster - are seen by ministers as providing an opportunity for industry to ensure it is getting a good deal. One example of the sort of changes which could come about was seen at the start of this month, when a number of organisations in the clothing and textile industries joined forces to strengthen their lobbying power by forming the British Apparel and Textiles Confederation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by Qol Yisra'el Arabic correspondent </F> Qaysar Kabaha, a member of the Israeli Arab delegation currently  visiting Damascus -- live]    [Text] The delegation's three-hour meeting with President  al-Asad this afternoon was very warm and lively. President  al-Asad shook hands and talked with everybody. When we all sat  down he addressed us like family. Al-Asad said: With the help  of God, peace will come. We talk about it and the entire world  talks about it. Syria was the one to start the peace process.  Since 1973, Syria has been leaning in that direction and agreed  to accept UN resolutions. He mentioned by name only UN  Resolution 338, which according to al-Asad refers to withdrawal  from all the territories and giving the Palestinians back their  rights. He said there has been no progress since then due to  the Israeli claim that Syria agreed to the UN resolution because  it misunderstood the resolution. He said there have been many  U.S. and Soviet initiatives since 1973, but that the latest U.S.  peace initiative clearly shows that Syria wants peace on the  basis of the UN resolutions, which means an Israeli withdrawal.  The U.S. initiative conforms with that demand, he said.    Al-Asad said that one of the reasons for Labor's success in  the last elections, as he understands it, is its peace slogan.  After Labor came to power, the atmosphere in the talks  improved, and they began to discuss issues of principle, but no  progress has been made.    The Syrian president sharply attacked Israeli leaders and  said that they always make new demands of everybody else. Since  the start of the peace process, Syria has contributed a great  deal -- it has always initiated things -- while the Israeli  Government has contributed almost nothing. Everybody knows that  Israel has a policy of procrastination, he said. Israel  participated in the Madrid conference because it was under  pressure. He presented examples of Israel's foot dragging.  Al-Asad said: We offered the land-for-peace principle. The  Israelis said it was good, but not enough. We said okay, we  will offer a different principle: full withdrawal for full  peace. They said it is not sufficiently clear and they do not  know what it really means. There is therefore a general  impression that Israel is dragging its feet.    On the state of Syrian Jewry, President al-Asad said that  Israel more that anybody else is responsible if any harm comes  to Syrian Jews. It is true that in the 1970's there were  restrictions on Syrian Jews, which was vital following the  establishment of Israel in 1948. We did not take those steps  because we wanted to exploit them, he said. Syria does not  deprive anybody; there is freedom of religion and ritual. The  constraints were limited to ID's, leaving the country, and  movements inside Syria. In the 1980's, and even before that, we  understood that there was no justification for continuing those  procedures. We decided to discontinue restrictions on 5,000 or  6,000 people because five or six Jews ran away or tried to run  away. President al-Asad said that he reached the conclusion  that Syrian Jews are Syrian citizens and lifted the restrictions  on them. We made life easier for Syrian Jews, but I have  learned that many of them have returned to Syria, al-Asad said.    Another issue al-Asad referred to was that of Israeli MIA's.  He said that Israel has asked almost the entire world to raise  the issue with him. Every delegation and VIP that comes to me  brings a letter and manifesto from the families of Israeli  MIA's. I understand that it is a humanitarian issue and we  respect the dignity of man. We always discuss it for moral and  humanitarian reasons, but one of our officers once asked a U.S.  Congressional delegation why Israel does not permit us to look  for our missing, since there are many Syrian MIA's.    Al-Asad said that peace is on the agenda and that he wants  peace, but that what Syria is being offered is inappropriate and  does satisfy the Arab people. When Israel makes offers with the  aim of dragging its feet, that means that they do not take the  concerns of others into account, or that they make light of  them, or ridicule them. Al-Asad said he is always told to copy  the late President al-Sadat, but I am not al-Sadat, he said. Do  any of the international agreements or UN resolutions contain a  clause that al-Asad has to copy al-Sadat? he asked. In  reference to peace, he said that Israel has a policy of foot  dragging and trying to put up obstacles.    Al-Asad was asked why he does not agree to meet with Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and when will the peace talks be  renewed. He said, and I quote: Our delegation is conducting  negotiations with the Israeli delegation. When they make  progress we will discuss anything necessary.    There was an impromptu news conference tonight at the hotel  where we are staying with the leader of the Jewish community in  Damascus. The main speaker was Yusuf Jajati, deputy head of the  community.    [Jerusalem Israel Television Channel 1 Network in Hebrew at  1800 GMT on 9 March quotes the Committee of Arab Local Councils  and the Supreme Arab Follow-Up Committee as saying that "Knesset  Member 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah's delegation does not represent  the Israeli Arab community. The spokesmen told our  correspondent Moti Eden that the delegation at best represents  the Arab Democratic Party."]</p>

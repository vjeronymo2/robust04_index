			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Adam Koronowski] </F>   [Text] The companies that produce telecommunications  equipment in Poland have found themselves in an extremely  difficult situation in the "transition stage." The problem has  mainly been that there has been no chance to reach a  technological and organizational level that would allow them to  compete on the Polish and foreign markets with the well-known  foreign manufacturers.    To illustrate this point, let us compare the potential of  the  Polish telecommunications industry to that of foreign  manufacturers. The combined sales of five Polish enterprises  covered by the privatization policy--i.e., "Telfy" SA  [Incorporated], "Teletry" SA, PZT SA, ZWUT SA, and "Elwro" SA  (this group is not fully devoted to  telecommunications)--amounted to just under $60 million per year  (in 1992). Sales in 1991 of public telecommunications systems  (to include only exchanges and transmission units) amounted to  almost $8 billion for Alcatel, $6 billion for AT&amp;T, and only  slightly less for Siemens. For all of these companies, this  accounted for only a portion of their overall sales, which  amounted to approximately $20 billion (Alcatel), about $14  billion (AT&amp;T), and $44 billion (Siemens). Because of these  production volumes, these companies are able to allocate $3-5  billion annually to research and development. As we see, this  amount exceeds the value of the sales of the entire Polish  telecommunications industry by several orders of magnitude.  <H5>  Financial Problems </H5>   Polish companies that produce telecommunications equipment  and, in particular, exchanges for the public net have found  themselves in serious financial straits. An example of this is  Warszawskie Zaklady Wytworcze Urzadzen Telekomunikacyjnych, ZWUT  [Warsaw Telecommunications Equipment Production Plants], a  company with roots in the sector that extend very far back and  that has a considerable share of the market. In 1992, its losses  amounted to 41 billion zloty [Z], and for the first half of 1993  to Z81 billion. Faced with scant prospects for developing and  selling its main product, the Pentaconta analog exchange, ZWUT  quickly approached the brink of bankruptcy. A total of 2,600  workers were laid off. The losses of the "Elwro" enterprise  amounted to Z185 billion in 1992, and to Z90 billion over the  first six months of 1993. The enterprise found itself in a  similar situation, which meant layoffs for 1,200 people. The  "Telfa" enterprise, which was sold previously, also racked up  losses. During the last half of the year before "Telfa" was  sold, losses amounted to Z20 billion. Only PZT and "Teletra"  were operating near the breakeven point, but even they have few  prospects of surviving on the market.    At the same time, the domestic demand in this area is, as we  know, tremendous. The poor state of Polish telecommunications is  not only a source of daily frustration but also by itself one of  the most serious barriers to attracting foreign capital to  Poland.    It is estimated that, by the year 2000, an average of  600,000  new lines will be installed per year, at an average cost of  $1,500 per line. This means that the value of telecommunications  deliveries to the Polish market will be approximately $900  million per year, of which about $240 million will be for  exchanges, transmission equipment, and related services. This  last group is a market segment covered by regulations that are  to be introduced.  <H5>  Auction Card </H5>   Everything seemed to indicate that the benefits of the rapid  modernization and development of the Polish communications  system would go to foreign companies, while the Polish ones  would not survive. In addition, the uncontrolled proliferation  of foreign suppliers on the Polish market would create the  danger of introducing too many switching systems offered by the  respective manufacturers. In Western Europe, there are two or  three systems in operation in each country. In these countries,  this equipment has resulted from many years of natural selection.    It should be emphasized that the situation of Polish  companies that manufacture exchanges for the public network has  not attracted a great deal of interest from foreign capital.  True, partnerships with foreign capital interests have been  active in some of them, but the foreign shareholders have not  been interested in expanding their investments under the  existing conditions.    Assuming correctly that the powerful auction card the Polish  side has to play is the opportunity to sell equipment on an  eager Polish market, two solutions present themselves that would  allow foreign companies to profit from access to this market,  provided conditions are ensured for Polish manufacturers to  develop. First, the order from the Minister of Communications  requires that deliveries of switching equipment for the public  network have a 50-percent national content. Second, a decision  made by KERM [Economic Committee of the Council of Ministers] in  October 1992 directs that the number of installed remote  switching systems, as well as the number of suppliers, be  limited to three. These suppliers, according to the KERM  decision, are to be selected during the course of the  privatization of the group of Polish telecommunications  enterprises that is to be carried out in three transactions.  What has been accomplished in the natural course of events in  many countries has, in Poland, had to be carried out in a way  that is regulated and makes it possible to avoid "creative  chaos."    The solution that has been adopted has assured foreign  companies access to the Polish market by putting it up for  auction in connection with the acquisition of Polish  enterprises. Investment commitments that investors have given in  a buy-sell agreement, as well as the requirement for national  content, ensure that the access gained to the market will be  turned into a way of guaranteeing the development of production  in Poland.  <H5>  Theory and Practice </H5>   Let us take a look at the first of the tools utilized in  this  connection: the requirement for 50-percent national content.    In this regard, it was assumed that each of the three  suppliers would capture one-third of the Polish market--i.e.,  would sell the equipment that is needed for the installation of  200,000 lines per year. It would then be necessary to answer the  question of how much of the production volume could be handled  effectively in Poland. It would also be necessary to outline the  possibilities for contributing to deliveries of equipment to the  national market. Finally, it would be necessary to estimate the  impact of Polish price realities on the altered cost structure  in relation to the altered structure of the same costs abroad.  Of course, all of this research required consideration of the  time factor for estimating when the pledged level of national  content could be achieved.    As a result of the research based on the methodology  outlined  above (the research, a portion of which is presented here, was  carried out by Bain &amp; Co. at the request of the MPW  [Ministry of  Privatization]), it was found that achieving the target national  content of 50 percent would not be possible from the technical  standpoint unless the investors were allowed to include in the  shipping cost to Poland the price paid for the shares of the  Polish telecommunications enterprises acquired. This is, in  fact, the solution that was adopted in the order from the  Minister of Telecommunications. The order also allowed a period  of three years for the required level of national content to be  reached. At the expiration of this period, fulfillment of this  requirement will be verified by an independent unit on behalf of  the Ministry of Communications. The equipment suppliers are also  obliged to file annual reports.    As we know, requiring a specified national content is a  protectionist tool. Consequently, in theory, it would lead to an  increase in the costs of production and the prices for the  equipment. It turns out, however, that, in the situation in  question, the risk is not so great. First, it should be  emphasized that the commitment for the successful suppliers to  capture one-third of the market does not mean that access to  this much of the market is awarded to them. On the contrary, all  suppliers who emerge during the course of privatization are  entitled to the same access to the market, not just a certain  share allocated to them. This means that they will be obliged to  compete in auctions organized by the operators (Telekomunikacje  Polska, SA). This will undoubtedly put strong downward pressure  on prices.    Next, we should recall that, in outlining the extent of  national content, consideration was given to how much of the  equipment could be produced effectively (i.e., at competitive  prices) in Poland at the intended scale of production. The  requirement for national content is not supposed to become a  pretext for obsolete and expensive local products because it  applies to manufacturers who are world leaders in terms of the  development of technology in the telecommunications area.  Finally, it should be emphasized that the order from the  Minister of Communications calls for controls on supplier  pricing practices, as well as on technology transfer.    The second of the solutions implemented (linking market  access to the acquisition of Polish enterprises that produce  telecommunications equipment) is certainly better known because  it was the subject of press items that appeared at the time the  regular transactions were completed. Just remember that the  right of exclusive access to the market was granted for a term  of six years to the suppliers whose systems have already been  adopted in Poland and who made the purchases within the  framework of one of the three proposed transactions. The objects  of these purchases were packages of 80 percent of the shares of  "Telfa" in Bydgoszcz, "Teletra" in Poznan, and PZT and ZWUT in  Warsaw, to which "Elwro" in Wroclaw was also added by decision  of KERM. The buyers were, respectively, the U.S. concern  AT&amp;T,  Alcatel SESA from Spain, and Siemens from Germany. All of these  firms are world leaders in the field of telecommunications.    In discussing the results of the three transactions  together,  we note that the sale of 80 percent of the shares of the five  enterprises funneled $70 million into the state budget, and the  buyers pledged to invest $162 million over six years, subject to  agreed-upon penalties [for failing to do so] and to raise the  paid-in capital by a total of $70 million over two years. They  also guaranteed jobs for 5,600 workers for 18 months.    These transactions do not, of course, encompass the entire  telecommunications industry. Additional privatization  transactions are also slated for this sector of industry. The  most important decision that will have to be made, however,  pertains to the fate of the main operator in Poland,  Telekomunikacja Polska SA, which holds a monopoly position.</p>

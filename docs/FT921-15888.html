			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Survey of Kenya (14): Crops bend to price fluctuations - The coffee sector is under pressure while tea production increases COFFEE and tea continue to form the backbone of Kenya's merchandise exports and the bulk of cash income for smallholder farmers who are their main producers. However, both crops are highly sensitive to international price fluctuations, conditions in other producing nations, the local incentives system given to farmers and political interference. While Kenyan coffee and tea remain largely at the mercy of external developments, many of the pressing domestic reforms necessary to make the best of a poor international climate have either not been taken or have had to slog their way through the opposition of powerful vested interests. Coffee, until 1987 Kenya's top export earner, has been severely hit. Production has slumped from 130,000 tonnes in 1987-88 to an estimated 75,000-90,000 tonnes for 1990-91. Foreign exchange earnings have fallen from Dollars 278m in 1989 to an estimated Dollars 140m for 1991. Bad weather and a fall in international prices after the collapse of the price-supporting International Coffee Organisation have played a critical role in the decline of the Kenyan coffee industry. But serious mismanagement in the government and the state-run agencies involved in the coffee industry have contributed significantly to the coffee slump. The government has been fairly candid about corruption in the industry. An official report compiled last year said there was 'chaotic mismanagement of financial affairs' in the state-run Kenya Planters Co-operative Union which processes coffee on behalf of farmers. It said that senior KPCU officials had obtained nearly Ksh70m (Dollars 2.5m) in unsecured loans while others had fraudulently received gifts of Mercedes-Benz cars. The decline in coffee production has mostly taken place in the smallholder sector, which traditionally accounted for about 70 per cent of annual production. Farmers have faced not only low international prices but also a hopelessly inefficient and tortuous payments system which gets money back to them as much as 18 months after crops have been delivered and after several unexplained and large deductions have been made by the various agencies between the producer and the marketing board. The result has been that many small farmers have neglected their coffee trees, failed to apply fertiliser and pesticides and even gone as far as breaking the law by uprooting their trees and replacing them with other, more lucrative crops. Smallholder production fell from 85,000 tonnes in 1986 to 45,000 tonnes in 1990. To improve incentives to farmers, the World Bank is lending Kenya Dollars 46.8m for a Second Coffee Improvement Project. A primary aim of the project is to set up a much faster flowing payments system to the farmer, using a Dollars 10m revolving fund at the Co-operative Bank to cut out the lengthy and obscure cash flow, particularly by eliminating the role of the KPCU. The project aims to provide speedy loans to farmers to pay for vital inputs, such as fertilisers and fungicides. However, for the past five months the KPCU has been fighting a rearguard action to sabotage the project and maintain its financial hold over the industry. As vested interests have threatened its reforms, the government has appeared a helpless spectator. Falling international prices have exposed the inefficiencies of the coffee industry. In tea, however, Kenya has been able to exploit strengthening world prices and strong demand for its quality tea. The closure of plantations and processing plants in Assam, because of terrorist activity, and the poor levels of production in Sri Lanka, are likely to lift Kenyan tea even further. Tea production has been steadily increasing with estimates for 1991 at just above 200,000 tonnes. In 1989, tea overtook coffee as the second biggest earner of foreign exchange, winning Kenya Dollars 264.3m. Tea earnings for 1990 were Dollars 273m. The government is pursuing an aggressive expansion of planted tea acreage with a goal to produce 300,000 tonnes by the end of the century. Present indicators suggest that is an achievable target. But the problems which plague the coffee industry also undermine that goal for tea. The first problem is the rise in fertiliser prices, its uncertain availability at critical times and the lack of financial credit for small-scale farmers to buy the necessary inputs. Mr Eliud Mahihu, chairman of the Tea Board of Kenya, has said that the misuse of funds collected from levies imposed on farmers, which are supposed to go toward improving tea access roads, could affect the steady growth in production. He has alleged that Ksh90m collected by local authorities from tea farmers in 1990 was misappropriated. Foreign exchange earnings and agricultural incomes from coffee and tea will continue to be vital to future economic growth. However, if the Kenyan authorities are to give encouragement to expanding tea production and save coffee from spiralling into crisis, the reforms which the government has articulated need to be implemented more swiftly and with greater disregard for vested interests.  ------------------------------------------ AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS (DOLLARS M)  ------------------------------------------             Coffee    Tea   Horticulture 1970         62.3    37.0      13.4 1975         95.9    62.5      36.8 1980        291.6   156.3      76.1 1985        280.7   233.0      77.2 1986        478.8   213.0      96.8 1987        236.5   198.5     118.4 1988        275.8   208.9     142.6 1989        198.2   264.3     123.9 1990        191.0   273.0     139.0  ------------------------------------------ Source: Kenya government  ------------------------------------------</p>

Laar said Estonia had delivered its notification to Israel  and the issue is to be settled soon.    "The arms purchase agreement is a detailed one and ensures  full control of the arms that are arriving," he explained.    The head of Estonia's Central Staff, Colonel Ants Laaneots,  at a meeting with the chairman of the Committee of Directors of  Israel's military industries, General Dan Shomron on Monday [7  February] delivered his department's claims regarding the  completeness of the weapons consignment.    The prime minister in his remarks indicated there was no  connection between the additional arms given by Israel as gift  to Estonia and "possible irregularities" in fulfilling the arms  deal. Israel granted to Estonia a consignment of older  Soviet-made trophy weapons.    "Estonia's arms purchase was a very successful one, and in  addition were given a gift. Surely we will also in the future  consider the possibility of complementing our supply of arms and  technical equipment with the help of Israel. For the time being  we must determine our defense concept and make clear what kind  of army and weapons we need," Laar told BNS.    He said Israel offered a wide variety of military equipment,  including border guarding technologies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 30 (CNA) -- The Republic of China [ROC]  hopes to develop substantive ties with all friendly, democratic  countries in a pragmatic manner, President Li Teng-hui said  Monday [30 May].    Li made the statement while meeting with Nikolay I. Ryzhkov,  a former prime minister of the now defunct Soviet Union, who is  currently on a week-long visit here.    After more than 40 years of development, Li said, Taiwan has  emerged as an economic powerhouse in East Asia.    "We are willing to share our experience in economic  development with other countries," Li told his guest.    For years, Li said, Taiwan has also provided financial aid  for many developing countries as part of its effort to return  what it has received from the international community during its  development process.    With the demise of communism, Li said he believes civilian  exchanges between Taiwan and Russia will grow steadily in the  years ahead.    Ryzhkov said he was impressed by the social stability and  economic prosperity here. "I hope relations between our two  countries can be further strengthened," he added.    Ryzhkov told Li he has joined with several Taiwan and  Russian  politicians and businessmen to form a permanent organization to  boost economic, cultural and technological cooperation between  the two countries. The new body is called the Republic of China  and Russia International Association for Humanitarian Dialogue.    Li said he appreciates Ryzhkov's effort to help forge  Taipei-Moscow ties by creating the new dialogue channel.  "Increased civilian exchanges will lay a foundation for our  future cooperation," he added.</p>

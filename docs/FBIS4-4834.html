			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kevin Barrington] </F>   [Text] Phnom Penh, April 5 (AFP) -- Thailand helped Pol  Pot, the leader of the notorious Khmer Rouge [KR], to flee a  recent government offensive on the radical faction's resource  rich headquarters at Pailin in northwest Cambodia, Co-premier  Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Tuesday.    "Thailand will not be happy with us but we have pictures to  prove it," the prince told reporters during a break in the  second session of parliament.    "I can show you a picture of Pol Pot, his house being  attacked, and Pol Pot escaping with cars and a convoy of trucks  driving on a tarmac road inside Thai territory," the prince said.    The prince was adamant that the shadowy guerrilla leader --  who was responsible for the Khmer Rouge's 1975 to 1979 reign of  terror during which some one million Cambodians died of illness,  starvation or execution -- escaped through Thai territory.    "It was not inside Cambodia. Cambodia does not have such  good smooth roads in that region," he said.    He did not specify how the photos were obtained.    Government forces seized the rebel headquarters and the  surrounding resource rich region March 19.    The Khmer Rouge financed their guerrilla organisation by  selling logging and mining concessions to primarily Thai  business consortiums, many of which are believed to be  controlled by or have links with the Thai military.    The Thai consortiums that were working in the Pailin area  were eager for the government to honour contracts they signed  with the guerrillas.    The prince, however, was evasive on this issue.    "Before talking about any kinds of contracts we need to have  regional security from both sides ... we need to request that  Thailand consider us as the one legitimate government," he said.    Although Bangkok has said it recognised the royal government  and did not support the Khmer Rouge in any way, recent actions  cast this into doubt.    The prince criticised the Thai government for not consulting  Phnom Penh about the fate of some 25,000 refugees, most of whom  were the family members of guerrillas, who fled to Thailand from  Pailin.    The government wanted Thailand to give the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) or the Red Cross access  to the refugees in order to give them a choice whether they  wanted to return to government or Khmer Rouge controlled areas  in Cambodia.    "Where did the Thais send these people? They sent them to  the place the Khmer Rouge decided they should go" the prince  said.    The prince said he had "lowered himself" to meet with Khmer  Rouge nominal leader Khieu Samphan to discuss a peace proposal  put forward by his father King Norodom Sihanouk.    But while Khieu Samphan was expressing his support for the  peace proposal, Khmer Rouge guerrillas attacked a former  stronghold of the Prince's party in northwest Cambodia and burnt  down 265 homes, he said.    "If we don't attack them they will attack us," the prince  said, adding:    "But the government's stand is that the door is still open  to  the Khmer Rouge."    He said talks were still possible but they would have to  take  place in a different "mood" as the guerrillas had lost  bargaining power since the government forces now controlled  Pailin and had pushed the Khmer Rouge out of another major base  at Anlung Veng in northern Cambodia.    Meanwhile co-Defence Minister Tie Banh refused to comment on  reports that the government was planning to attack a Khmer Rouge  base at Phnom Malai some 70 kilometers (44 miles) north of  Pailin.    "We cannot say when we will attack because we cannot arrange  military schedules like some festival programme," he said.</p>

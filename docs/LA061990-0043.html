			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> PANEL ASSAILS BOLD COLORS OF RESTAURANT  </P> <P> Restaurant owners Marty Gay and Michelle Sandoval, who successfully turned a  Ventura sandwich shop into the fancy restaurant Voila, are being criticized for  their newest restaurant's colorful paint job by advocates of muted colors in  downtown Ojai.  </P> <P> The Ojai Redevelopment Commission was so appalled at the restaurant's burnt  orange, green and purple paint job that it has asked the city's Redevelopment  Agency to consider banning certain colors from downtown buildings.  </P> <P> The agency has yet to take up the request.  </P> <P> Opposition to the colors came up last week when the Redevelopment Commission  reviewed the restaurant's sign permit. "The sign is great, but the building has  got to go," Commissioner William Hattabaugh said.  </P> <P> The redevelopment area has color guidelines for signs, awnings and building  trim that complement the tan and red-tile theme of the Ojai Arcade, an arched  walkway in the heart of downtown. But the area has no restrictions on building  colors.  </P> <P> Gay and Sandoval, both Ojai residents, recently transformed the old Backstage  cafe into MK's, an eatery with a "Mexican Moorish"-style interior. The same  bold color scheme extends through the restaurant's rear entrance onto its  stucco walls that are visible from Signal Street.  </P> <P> Gay said he has had "a lot of positive response" to the bold scheme from his  customers. "We like the colors, and we didn't think they were offensive," he  said.  </P> <P> At its meeting last week, the commission also found that one of the  restaurant's proposed signs did not meet the rule that all signs be made of  wood.  </P> <P> Gay said he will redo the sign, but the buildings' colors will remain the same  until the city orders them changed.  </P> <P> "We're not trying to change Ojai," he said. "We're just trying to show a style  that's authentic to Old California." THIA BELL  </P></p>

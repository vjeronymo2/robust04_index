			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: N Ireland prison staff vote for action NORTHERN Ireland's 3,000 prison officers have voted overwhelmingly in favour of industrial action because of overcrowding in jails. Prison Officers' Association officials in the province said yesterday that 80 per cent of those members balloted supported some form of action. The POA committee for Northern Ireland is due to meet today to discuss what form the action should take, but it is not expected to involve a strike. Any action will hit the Maze, Crumlin Road, Magilligan, and Maghaberry prisons as well as a young offenders' centre in Belfast. The Northern Ireland Office said overcrowding claims were exaggerated but POA officials said the situation in the province had become intolerable. Some prisoners were having to share two to a cell, and in some cases there were three to a cell, it said. Speculation that US president Bill Clinton may send a peace envoy to the province was renewed yesterday. The new US ambassador to Ireland, Mrs Jean Kennedy Smith, presented her credentials to Irish President Mary Robinson in Dublin and said she planned to visit Northern Ireland. Mrs Kennedy Smith, sister of President John F Kennedy, said a US peace envoy was still on the agenda 'and may come up at a future date', but added: 'At the moment, it's not being considered.' She took up her position almost 30 years to the day after she accompanied President Kennedy on his historic first visit to Ireland.</p>

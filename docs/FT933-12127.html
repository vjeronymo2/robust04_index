			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK housebuilders Investors who backed the recent spate of rights issues from housebuilders must be irritated that no sooner have they parted with their cash than the market softens. Housebuilders' sunny suggestions that reservations were rising at an annual rate of up to 40-50 per cent may have been true for the first quarter. Since then, however, the market has turned as flat as the Headingley cricket pitch. It is now clear that some specific factors were previously at work. Economic scares last September deferred demand for new housing. The autumn statement initiatives also tempted housing associations into the market. The current worry is that with price rises in the secondary housing market stalling, housebuilders will have to keep discounting to sell new houses, undermining profitability. Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests land prices are now rising far faster than house prices. Housebuilders flush with rights issue money are bidding up prices. Tighter planning restrictions have also increased the scarcity value of land. This raises the spectre that margins will be further squeezed unless price inflation returns to the system. The pure housebuilders boasting long land banks may still be best placed to exploit the housing upturn but their shares have surely run ahead of the game. The market has already begun to take the gloss off the sector but housebuilders' premium ratings remain suspiciously heavy.</p>

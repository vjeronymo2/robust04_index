			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Kovalenko report: "Aeroflot Passengers Forced To </F> Play `Russian Roulette'"]    [Text] Paris -- Dutch pilot Bart Bakker, president of the  International Federation of Airline Pilots Associations, arrived  in Russia 11 April to meet with Alfred Malinovskiy, head of  Russia's pilots organization, and other officials to warn them  of the need for urgent measures.    In turn the International Airline Passengers Association  [IAPA], whose headquarters is in Washington, warned of the risk  to life to which citizens from Western countries are exposing  themselves by flying on our aircraft over Russia. It also  called the territory of the former Soviet Union one of the two  most dangerous areas in the world for air passengers.    I would also point out that many French firms are  confidentially banning their staff from flying Aeroflot on  business from Paris to Moscow, never mind using our domestic  routes. The Swiss newspaper LE NOUVEAU QUOTIDIEN recently  published a report eloquently headlined: "Aeroflot Passenger  Plays `Russian Roulette.'"    Russian aircraft are in a disastrous state, the author  writes. Airports are like hostile jungles. No one is  responsible for them any more -- or for passengers. The  journalist sees the "crazy privatization" of the air sector as  the main reason for the prevailing unimaginable chaos.    At the same time as Bart Bakker's visit to Moscow, IAPA  published a new report painting a gloomy picture of the  situation in CIS countries' civil aviation. "We are extremely  concerned by the state of affairs in Russia," IAPA Director  David Stempler said in an interview with THE EUROPEAN. "Our  report cites specific examples and gives advice to travelers.  Russian airline safety is rapidly deteriorating. It will not  come as a surprise to anyone if Russia shortly descends to  China's level in this respect."</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Minister warns of tougher pollution penalties INDUSTRY may face much higher charges for discharging polluted water into rivers, Mr David Maclean, environment minister, said yesterday. He told the second day of the Financial Times European Water Conference that higher charges for companies abstracting water from rivers were also on the cards. 'A charge based on the amount and type of pollutants discharged to water would give a direct financial incentive for cleaner effluent,' he said. 'Those who polluted least would pay the lowest charge.' A government report is being prepared giving the options for using financial instruments to curb water pollution. Present licences for discharging and abstraction, which are issued by the National Rivers Authority, charge in proportion to pollution, but it is allowed only to recover its monitoring costs. The NRA expects to receive Pounds 44m for discharges and Pounds 79m for abstraction in the year to March 1994, but new charges are likely to be much higher. Mr Guy Liardet of the Chemical Industries Association said yesterday: 'We are very keen to improve our performance and we are keen to play along with government policy provided it is rational, achieves its aims and does not destroy UK industry's competitiveness. We just ask that the chemical industry's pollution is considered in the context of everyone else's pollution, particularly farm waste. Mr Maclean also said that the government would urge the European Commission, which is reviewing all its water quality directives this year, to accommodate more subsidiarity - allowing countries to decide some of their water standards themselves. 'The Community should exercise a certain humility,' he said. Water companies should also look at charging households special high tariffs for using water at peak times, according to Mr Chris Mellor of Anglian Water, which covers the region likely to have the greatest shortages of water. The supply of water at peak times was nearly double the average daily level, he said, and supplying the peak demand could account for half of a water company's costs. Peak-time charges could be applied only to houses fitted with water meters. Anglian, which has introduced compulsory metering to help cut future demand, now has 160,000 metered customers. The present installation charges of Pounds 145 to Pounds 185 could fall as more customers were metered, he said. Exports of ice cubes are expected to rise, after the water used by a producer in north-west England passed stringent hygiene tests. The Packaged Ice Company of Fleetwood uses ordinary north-west drinking water in quantities of up to 60 tonnes a day. Its cubes are being sold by the Belgian-owned Multi-Frost chain of frozen food stores. Further expansion into continental Europe can take place following certification of water quality by the health authorities of France and the Netherlands. The ice-making company is a subsidiary of the 85-year-old Fylde Ice and Cold Storage Company. The parent diversified into bulk ice cubes in 1986.</p>

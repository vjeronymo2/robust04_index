[passage omitted]    A former officer [Captain Barril] is reported to have got  hold of the black box in Kigali, where he went at the request of  the family, who have found refuge in France, so that he could  start all inquiries he deemed useful to find the truth about the  attack:    [Begin recording] [Mrs. Habyarimana, Rwandan president's  widow] You know, inquiries have been started, but I can tell you  that people said straight away that the RPF [Rwanda Patriotic  Front] was behind the attack but, since I left the country  without knowing what people were saying, I can guarantee that  the Rwandan army did not shoot at the president because the  Rwandan army did not have any missiles. [end processing]  [passage omitted]    The Dassault-Aviation company has just issued a  clarification  that goes against Captain Barril's revelations: According to  Dassault-Aviation, there was no black box on the former Rwandan  president's plane, a Falcon-50.</p>

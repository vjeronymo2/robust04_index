			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] British Deputy Foreign Secretary Tom Richardson  arrived in Cyprus this afternoon. [passage omitted]    Richardson said his country wants to see the  confidence-building measures succeed and described them as a  very significant step. He added that he does not believe the  confidence-building measures process has failed.    Asked if the reason for his visit is to persuade Turkish  Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas to accept the confidence-building  measures, the British official said his country has been  attempting this for a long time. He added: The British  Government is in continuous contact with Turkish Prime Minister  Tansu Ciller, Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin, and the  leaders of the Turkish Cypriot community. Richardson said he  assumed his current duties three months ago, but that he had  dealt with the Cyprus issue in his former position of British  alternate representative to the United Nations.</p>

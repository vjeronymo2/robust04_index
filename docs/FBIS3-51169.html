The Argentine delegation  made the proposal. [Chilean] President-elect Eduardo Frei is  also invited.    Patricio Aylwin, Sanchez de Lozada, and Eduardo Frei will  hold complementary meetings with their Mercosur counterparts but  they will not formally participate in the deliberations.    It is being reported in Santiago, Chile, that President  Patricio Aylwin is studying the possibility of attending the  summit, which will be held in Colonia on 17 January. The  presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay -- the  Mercosur member countries -- invited Aylwin and also his elected  successor, Eduardo Frei, to participate.    Frei is unable to attend; he is resting following a inguinal  hernia operation today. Chilean Foreign Ministry economic  delegation sources told the afternoon newspaper LA SEGUNDA that  Chile should send a high-ranking representation to the meeting,  even though it is not a Mercosur member and clearly cannot  become one.</p>

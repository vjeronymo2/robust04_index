			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 18 Apr (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR writes that Iraq's  surprise decision not to consider Kuwait as its 19th province  raises many questions and even doubts. In a commentary in its  Tuesday edition, the paper says that many observers think that  this decision is not prompted by a desire to return to what is  right nor does it mean that Iraqi President Saddam Husayn has  repented. The decision has another purpose. It shows the  failure of the Iraqi regime's repeated attempts to end the UN  sanctions that have been in effect since the crime of the  invasion of Kuwait. It also reflects the Iraqi regime's desire  to bring about the release of its frozen assets in some world  countries and resume the exportation of Iraqi oil.    AL-AKHBAR concludes by saying that irrespective of the  Baghdad regime's intentions in making this surprise announcement  regarding its attitude to Kuwait, the departure of Saddam Husayn  remains the basic condition for the resumption of normal  relations with Iraq by the majority of the Arab world.</p>

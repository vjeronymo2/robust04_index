			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> The Newport Harbor Art Museum has purchased a $100,000 sculpture by Robert  Irwin, a nationally known artist from Los Angeles. The untitled work, a  12-foot-tall acrylic column made in 1970, refracts light from its surrounding  environment and complements California light and space pieces in the museum's  permanent collection, spokeswoman Maxine Gaiber said. Museum officials hope to  display the work this summer.  </P></p>

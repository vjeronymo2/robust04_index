			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "London Last Minute" program] </F>   [Text] There is an apparent war of disinformation under way  in Angola: there are many contradictory reports concerning the  evolution of the Lusaka peace talks. Correspondents in the  Zambian capital say that the National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola [UNITA] has made concessions, in the wake  of the government's refusal to disband the Riot Police, also  known as ninjas. News agencies with representatives in Luanda  are citing an article carried by the JORNAL DE ANGOLA newspaper  today saying that the talks are deadlocked and that prospects  for an accord are rather dim. What is more, those news agencies  report that the Angolan Government and UNITA teams have not  achieved any consensus over the general principles that will  guide the formation of the future national police force. Joao  van Dunem, a BBC Portuguese Service reporter, interviewed UNITA  Information Secretary Jorge Valentim this afternoon and he  affirmed that consensus has already been reached on the general  principles that will govern the formation of the future police  force. Dr. Jorge Valentim added that only the specifics of that  matter are being discussed now.    [Begin recording] [Valentim] The talks are going very well.  After we had defined the general principles of the legal  framework governing the creation and operation of the police  force in a legal state, we moved on to discuss specific  principles. UNITA has presented a document containing more than  18 points and it has to do with specific principles which also  concern the Riot Police. Our approach was creative,  imaginative, and realistic. It is our view that, in any legal  state, the national police has certain special functions. Now,  we have policemen, said to be riot policemen or whatever other  name they may have been given, who are acting within the context  of a legal framework.    [Dunem] That means, then, that the legal framework has been  defined in full and that the government and UNITA have reached  consensus?    [Valentim] There is already (?common) ground. The framework  has been defined, even with regard to UNITA's participation:  the way the police force will operate, who does what, when the  police force should intervene, and what its limits are. All  that has been defined. We can tell you that, contrary to what  has been reported by some international circles, things are  moving forward. The only problem is that legal work is rather  picky and sensitive work and we were not helped by the fact that  such legal work had not been done before. So, it has taken a  while but now there are concrete results.    [Dunem] That means, then, that the Lusaka peace talks are  now  focusing on specific principles?    [Valentim] Absolutely. We are discussing specific principles  and also regulations. Since when does a riot police force  abandon its barracks to intervene in social affairs that should  be the responsibility of political and administrative  authorities? Such a police force should only intervene, and  then in accordance with the law, once it has become clear that  the normal police force does not have the means to restore  order, after which they must promptly return to their barracks.  Those are things that were not enshrined in the law.    [Dunem] Dr. Valentim: at the weekend, Savimbi signed a  communique which observers have perceived to be a clear  declaration of war. That communique says that, unless the  international community recognizes the (?flaws) in the September  1992 elections and the concessions that have been made by UNITA,  the Lusaka peace talks are just a waste of time. What did Dr.  Savimbi mean by that?    [Valentim] Well, I would like to say that a correct  interpretation of UNITA President Dr. Savimbi's thoughts will  show that this was in response to a situation seen from within:  there is ever growing tension in the country because of the  movements of government forces. The UNITA president was just  urging the international community to exert greater pressure to  prevent warmongering (?moves) in the country. UNITA believes in  the talks but, by the same token, the international community  must not just fold its arms in the face of Angola's increasingly  serious situation.    [Dunem] Just to conclude, Dr. Valentim, I would like to cite  another passage from that communique: quote, we, in UNITA, are  not pacifists, unquote. What is that supposed to mean?    [Valentim] That means that the government is attacking many  UNITA positions. If UNITA is forced to defend itself so it can  survive, then UNITA will not fold its arms. [end recording]</p>

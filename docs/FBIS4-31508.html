			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bea Lachowszky] </F>   [Text] Bavaria is providing 1.8 million marks worth of new  subsidies for small and medium-sized businesses. RKW (Board for  the Economy's Rationalization), headquartered in Frankfurt, has  opened an office in Hungary. Its purpose will be to subsidize  consulting for businesses that are about to be formed, are in  the process of being formed, or have been newly formed.    In Bavaria, the purpose of RKW is to assist new,  medium-sized  businesses. There this activity is based on traditions of 40  years standing. As the managing director of RKW said at his news  conference yesterday, 90 percent of the businessmen in Bavaria  are satisfied with this service. However, German assistance can  be effective only if it is based on local experience. Therefore  RKW has concluded a cooperation agreement with IPOSZ (National  Federation of Trade Associations), an umbrella organization  whose associations have a combined total of 709,000 businessmen  members. When signing the agreement for the Hungarian side,  IPOSZ Chairman Gyorgy Szucs noted that the agreement was another  successful step toward the realization of the four-year-old  program that had set as its objective the development of a  system of consultancy services to ease the first steps of small  businesses, thereby making the about-to-be-formed or newly  formed businesses competitive and thus contributing to their  long-term survival.    German financing for the program will be arranged through  the  Ausgleichsbank. RKW is maintaining its Hungarian office in the  IPOSZ building on Imre Kalman Street. We learned from office  manager Andrea Glodi that a staff of 40 to 80 consultants will  be in place by the end of May or early June. The consultants are  being selected on the basis of personal interviews conducted by  RKW experts. RKW will provide further training for the  successful candidates. The first businesspeople will be able to  call at the office foreseeably by the middle of June. The  subsidies will be administered directly through the banks  participating in the Start loan program. Persons considering a  business career may seek consulting before the final decision to  start a business; persons establishing a business, before and  during its establishment; and the owners of start-up businesses,  during the first three years of operation. They may seek advice  about their business plans, their foreseeable market and  competitive situation; about the availability of financing and  the selection of location; as well as about questions arising in  conjunction with the elaboration of their business strategy,  operational plans, or marketing plans. A business may avail  itself of at most six subsidized personnel-days of consulting  time, with RKW footing half the consulting fee.    RKW will maintain its office in Hungary foreseeably for 18  months. The signatories of the cooperation agreement are  confident that the consulting system will be able to stand on  its own feet by that time, and to function without foreign  subsidies.    This hope is being nourished also by the agreement that  IPOSZ  signed today with Ernst &amp; Young. The gist of the agreement is  that henceforth this well-established accounting and consulting  firm will accept also small businesses as its clients. As Arpad  Tertak, the firm's general manager, put it, the firm will place  at the disposal of business representatives and members of the  trade associations belonging to IPOSZ the business experience  and knowledge it has accumulated over several decades. Through  IPOSZ, the firm will assist clients with consultancy services,  including the preparation of loan applications. It will also  undertake to find foreign sources of financing and professional  and institutional investors as potential partners.</p>

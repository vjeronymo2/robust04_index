			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Stability and Confidence" by President Itamar </F> Franco]    [Text] Brasilia, 31 May (AE) -- We are not far off from  creating a strong, stable, and new currency as a result of an  economic stabilization plan characterized by its scope and its  democratic nature because it involves Congress and society as a  whole in its formulation and its careful and gradual  implementation.    Inflation, which in the past was used by successive  Brazilian  Governments as an instrument for development, has surpassed any  type of control that can be applied and has turned into the main  factor strangling our economy, thus seriously and adversely  affecting productive investment and, consequently, the  generation of jobs. At the same time, inflation feeds financial  speculation that in turn generates unproductive profits and  concentrates, in an intolerable way, income, thus demoralizing  the traditional values of work, savings, planning for the  future, and social solidarity.    Today we are clearly aware that chronic inflation is the  major obstacle the country has to fight in order to return to  sustained growth and to correct the immense social distortions  we are suffering. We also are fully aware that inflation  seriously and inhumanely affects the poorest, the salary  earners, and those who have no protection against price runs and  the erosion of salaries. The results of years of chronic  inflation can be seen in the low efficiency of the state, in its  incapability of furnishing basic services, investing in  infrastructure, and helping to improve the country's social  indicators, especially in education, health, sanitation, and  housing.    Past governments tried shock treatments with measures that  surprised the people and even included the temporary  confiscation of savings. This shock treatment generated the  passing impression that inflation was under control, but in the  end it accelerated inflation even more, provoking new  distortions and a lack of confidence. Those plans contained  several fundamental factors for stability such as balancing the  budget and the adjusting of the country's external debts that  were not implemented, thus thwarting the illusory results that  were obtained.    We now are going to try a new and gradual formula, without  apprehension, without surprises. In the first place have  created the conditions to reach a fiscal balance. We then  implemented a formula to free the economy from indexation and at  the same time we re-established the comparability of prices; we  have created a single index that is being applied to all prices  -- rates, goods, and fiscal services. And it will not be until  July that we will issue the new currency, the real, which will  replace the cruzeiro real, and it will generate more rigorous  rules pertaining to monetary and exchange policies and to  guaranteeing stability.    The plan's gradualism will allow us to help its evolution by  making the necessary corrections and in helping the population  and economic agents adapt to the prospects of an economy with a  low inflation rate, in which production is given incentives,  salaries maintain their purchasing power, and with stable  prices. We are close to making the decisive step with the  creation of the new currency. Thus this government can pass on  to its successor, no matter whom, a country with a stabilized  economy. We also are prepared to implement some structural  reforms in order to guarantee this stability in the long term  and to ensure that the sustained economic growth is socially  efficient.    Thus, Brazil will consolidate as a great nation and as an  important international interlocutor. It is in our hands to  make this hope a long-term reality as of 1 July.</p>

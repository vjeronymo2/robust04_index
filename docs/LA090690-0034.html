			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> POINT LOMA'S REASON TO REJOICE  </P> <P> Next to efforts to move Lindbergh Field, the nasty controversy over the fate of  shuttered Dana Junior High School may be the longest- running public affairs  saga on Point Loma.  </P> <P> But that may soon change. Dana's fate appears almost settled -- to just about  everyone's satisfaction. That would be a coup for the school system and a  significant improvement for a community that has lived with this eyesore since  Dana closed in 1983.  </P> <P> Under a plan endorsed by San Diego city school trustees Tuesday, Dana will be  rehabilitated at a cost of $6 million and converted to offices for school  personnel scattered throughout the city. Dana's auditorium would be made  available to the community and its fields improved for use by Point Loma High  School.  </P> <P> The school system would float bonds to fund the project, paying them off by  leasing at least three other former school sites, probably to public or private  educational institutions in search of classroom space. Administrators now  working in those schools would be moved to Dana.  </P> <P> Needless to say, this idea is vastly preferable to the district's original plan  to lease the 13-acre Dana site to condominium developers for 99 years. This  way, Dana will remain a public facility, its ball fields doubling as play  areas. High-density housing will not be shoehorned in among single-family  homes.  </P> <P> Years of vandalism and the school district's own cannibalizing of the facility  are prime causes of the $6-million rehabilitation price tag. Hindsight is easy,  but if the district had moved more slowly with plans to demolish the school for  developers, more of the building might have been preserved. There's a lesson  here in the value of listening more closely to community members who, from the  beginning, opposed transfer of a school building out of public hands.  </P> <P> The Point Lomans who rallied to save the site can savor the fruits of their  activism. By 1993, they may have a refurbished public building that the  community can use -- not resent. These days, few development battles end that  way.  </P></p>

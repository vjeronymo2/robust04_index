			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Standstill on EU labour laws The European Commission drew back from recommending any new EU-wide labour laws in a white paper on social policy published yesterday. The paper, introduced by social affairs commissioner Padraig Flynn, contained no specific legislative proposals but will shape the EU social and employment policy debate until the year 2000. In trying to negotiate a path between enthusiasts for European-level social policy and sceptics, led by the UK government, the white paper will disappoint many on both left and right. The UK said the white paper did not put enough emphasis on labour market flexibility. Mr Michael Portillo, the new employment secretary, also stressed the UK would block any attempt to remove its 'opt-out' from some aspects of social legislation, as enshrined in the Maastricht treaty. The white paper noted the strong desire of all member states to proceed as 12 where possible and it hopes EU social policy action will 'be founded on a single legal framework'. Mr Flynn added yesterday that the EU inter-governmental conference in 1996 should consider ending the UK 'opt-out'.</p>

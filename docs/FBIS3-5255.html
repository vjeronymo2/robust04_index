The  Muslim students from various institutions stated in a mass  religious meeting here Saturday that they were ready to engage  in a holy war (jihad) as volunteers for Bosnia.    The young Muslims also urged the government and the  Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) to immediately prepare the  sending of volunteers to Bosnia, expressed their support for  Indonesia's effort to open diplomatic relations with the Bosnian  Government and to sever diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia.    "We also fully support Indonesia's active role as NAM  [Nonaligned Movement] chairman in urging the UN Security Council  to punish Zionist Israel and Serbs over the killing of Muslims  in Hebron and Bosnia, and call on Indonesian Muslims to give  more material assistance for the struggle of Bosnian Muslims,"  they said.    An executive of the North Sumatra chapter of the Indonesian  Islamic Propagation Council, Ilham, told ANTARA that his side  has distributed hundreds of registration forms for volunteers to  Bosnia.    "I am confident that the number of volunteers to Bosnia will  continue to increase," he said, adding that his side has managed  to raise funds totalling 155,000 rupiahs during the mass  meeting. At least 35 university students have registered  themselves to become volunteers to Bosnia.</p>

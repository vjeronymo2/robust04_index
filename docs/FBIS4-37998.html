			<p>BFN     [Text] Nabil Sha'th says that although the Palestinians  have always emphasized their conviction that Jerusalem is the  capital of the Palestinian state, the Jerusalem issue will be  discussed only at the permanent status negotiations. In this,  he was reacting to the Fatah-Tunis announcement that its  autonomy elections campaign will focus on the struggle to  preserve East Jerusalem's Arab character.    Minister Yosi Sarid noted that Jerusalem is not included in  the autonomy and, as agreed, the discussions on its status will  be conducted only during the permanent status talks.    Minister Sarid, Major General Dani Rothschild, and Nabil  Sha'th met this morning at the joint command near the Erez  checkpoint. Our correspondent Moti Amir adds that Minister  Nabil Sha'th is now in a meeting with Maj. Gen. Dani Rothschild.  The meeting marks the start of the negotiations on the second  stage of the autonomy agreements.    As for Yasir 'Arafat's visit to the self-rule territory,  Nabil Sha'th said the visit will take place after the  Palestinian Authority imposes its control on all spheres of  life. Minister Sarid added that the date of the visit will  apparently be coordinated at the Rabin-Peres-'Arafat meeting in  Paris.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Corrie S. Narisma] </F>   [Text] The Philippines and South Korea yesterday signed an  investment guarantee agreement aimed at bolstering the entry of  more Korean investors into the country.    The agreement, concluded after 13 years of negotiations,  seeks to address the concerns of Koreans investing for the first  time in the Philippines. It contains provisions on the settling  of commercial disputes, the right of investors to remit  investments or profits, and protection from expropriation.    Officials of the Board of Investments said the accord also  grants national treatment status to Korean investments, but  within the bounds of existing Philippine laws, such as, foreign  ownership restriction on land and exploitation of natural  resources.    The officials said that this status means that whatever laws  or policies on local investors will also be applicable to Korean  businessmen.    Although substantial investments from South Korea had been  coming in even without the investment agreement, Trade and  Industry Secretary Rizalino S. Navarro said the pact is still  important particularly for new Korean investors.    "Many brand-name Korean companies relocated their  export-oriented plants here without the agreement, but the small  and medium Korean companies who are investing overseas for the  first time need this because they are unfamiliar with operations  abroad," Navarro pointed out.    The Koreans are ranked sixth biggest foreign investors in  the  Philippines during the past five years, accounting for P4.34  billion [Philippine pesos] or 5 percent of the total foreign  equity of P94 billion infused during the period.    Among the biggest Korean companies already operating here  are  STC Corp., Amkor/Anam, Pohang Steel, Ssangyong Corp., Dong  Corp., Lucky- Goldstar, Samsung Corp., Kia Motor, Hyundai, and  Daewoo Corp.</p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Banking on Mr Kohl The clouds have started to lift over the German economy during the past six months, and Mr Helmut Kohl has been making the most of the sunshine. At the beginning of the year, the chancellor was trailing in the opinion polls. However, a more vigorous than expected economic recovery and mistakes by the Opposition have increased the chances that Mr Kohl and his centre-right coalition will retain power in the October 16 election. The government now predicts 2.5 per cent growth in Germany this year, a percentage point better than projected in January. Increased business optimism is the main reason why the coalition has forged nine percentage points ahead of the Social Democrats in latest opinion polls. Mindful that no postwar German chancellor has ever lost his job as the direct result of a general election, Mr Kohl is exploiting the authority of 12 years in office - but his party should avoid the temptation to campaign on personality cult rather than policy. He has reasserted his Christian Democratic Union's hold over the political centre and headed off the once-acute danger from the far right. Mr Kohl's SPD challenger Mr Rudolf Scharping is in a less comfortable position. Mr Scharping has lost credibility since his revelation in March of proposed tax increases on middle-income earners. Moreover, Mr Scharping has to contend with two parties to the SPD's left, the Greens and the Party of Democratic Socialism, the former East German Communist party. These groupings are not only rivals but also potential allies of the SPD. Mr Kohl has ruthlessly played on many voters' fears that a vote for the SPD could be a vote for the far left. East-west gulf In view of visceral anti-communism in west Germany, this is an effective tactic, but it also risks accentuating the gulf between west and east Germans. Across united Germany, the Christian Democrats' chief electoral weapon is Mr Kohl himself. As underlined by the party's manifesto and yesterday's rally in Dortmund the CDU's campaign will draw heavily on opportunities to portray the chancellor as a leading international statesman If re-elected, Mr Kohl will have to turn much attention to international affairs. A large part of his domestic popularity stems from his commitment simultaneously to widen and deepen the European Union. The next German government's main preoccupation will remain the economy. With real incomes squeezed by unification strains, the recent economic improvement is mainly due to sharply higher exports. German industry has regained competitiveness more quickly than expected through heavy cost-cutting. A negative side-effect is that large-scale structural unemployment is now starting to look durable. Tax burden On the fiscal side, overall taxes and levies in Germany account for about 47 per cent of gross domestic product, higher than any other big industrial country apart from France. Keeping German fiscal policy on track towards the Maastricht targets and diminishing the tax burden will be top policy priorities. Whichever government emerges after October will have to maintain rigorous public spending control for several years. These tasks at home and abroad represent an exacting agenda. The Christian Democrats' reliance on the man who steered through unification is understandable. But even more than a strong chancellor, Germany needs a well-balanced government. Furthering the impression of Mr Kohl's dominance could also detract from the electoral performance of the Christian Democrats' junior coalition partners, the Free Democrats. A poor score for the Free Democrats on October 16 could still force an outcome Mr Kohl and Mr Scharping have both said they wish to avoid - a grand coalition between the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, which probably would not be in a position to deliver decisive leadership. Mr Kohl has broad shoulders, but for the CDU to concentrate its campaign unduly on his personality would be a mistake. An election where the focus on a single personality obscures the search for the right policies is not what Germany needs.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Technology: Survival of the fittest traders Dealers and managers in financial markets are calling on a host of novel and sophisticated mathematical methods in their never-ending search for ways to improve trading performance. The new techniques have emerged from research into artificial intelligence; the way in which they work is reminiscent not only of the mechanisms of the mind but of natural inheritance. They include such esoteric developments as neural networks, rule induction and genetic algorithms. These are being applied to a range of market analyses including stock market prediction, currency rate prediction, portfolio management and credit evaluation. According to Philip Treleaven and Suran Goonatilake* of the Department of Computer Science at University College, London, the new methods are already showing an edge over traditional statistical methods. A technique based on chaos theory, for example, was found to be up to 50 times more effective than traditional modelling techniques at forecasting market movements such as the Dow Jones average or the price of IBM stock. They suggest that the next generation of intelligent financial technologies will involve a combination of two or more methods to create hybrid systems - one to analyse and predict market movements, for example, and one to execute trades according to predetermined rules. Inevitably, the growth of intelligent financial technologies will mean more automation in an area where human judgment and skill has been considered paramount. 'It may be possible that these technologies will lead to a situation where future investment houses have large numbers of extremely adaptive, intelligent machine traders to perform many of the more mundane trading tasks,' warn the authors. It is easy to get carried away, however, with the idea of the world's financial markets controlled by armies of robot traders. The only things the new techniques really do is to spot trends and recognise patterns - but rather more efficiently than the conventional mathematical methods of statistical clustering and regression analysis which have been the mainstays to date. These techniques are based on approaches which seem positively bizarre to those outside the rarefied atmosphere of advanced mathematics. Genetic algorithms, for example, have their origin in a species of Darwinism - a sort of survival of the fittest theory. They have been successfully used to solve problems in imaging, large-scale electronic circuit layout, gas pipeline control and job shop scheduling. The starting point is a pool of possible solutions to the problem, randomly chosen. These solutions are then coded in a form a computer can understand - as a set of binary digits or conventional numbers. The sets of digits are analo-gous to chromosomes, and the digits analogous to individual genes. A program simulating evolution in action  - genetic combination, mutation and so on - can be applied to the 'chromosomes'. The aim to is produce a 'better' solution, just as Darwinian evolution is reckoned to produce species better fitted to survive. Because there is no 'natural selection' of an improved solution from the genetic algorithm, at each turn of the cycle, the products must be evaluated to test how good they are at solving the problem. It seems hardly credible but, in practice, it seems to work. In an artificial stock market at the Santa Fe Institute, robot traders using genetic algorithm techniques generated rules about when to buy - such as 'when the price earnings multiple is low' - and price trend continuations. This after about a day's run on a workstation. Human traders need not fear for their jobs just yet; but they should be aware that survival of the fittest does not only apply to nature. *Parallel Problem Solving from Nature; Statistical Office of the European Communities, 1992</p>

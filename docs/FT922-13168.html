			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Hospitals face Pounds 1.6bn improvements bill THE NATIONAL Health Service and hospital trusts are to spend Pounds 1.6bn on building improvements as a consequence of the lifting of Crown immunity from hospital properties, a survey of health authorities says. Most of the work will be done to conform with fire regulations. Crown immunity for health service properties was lifted a year ago. Until then planning controls and other regulations did not apply to hospitals. One authority has been quoted Pounds 40m to upgrade its five hospitals. The Audit Commission yesterday described the findings of the survey as 'reasonable'. One fifth of regional health authorities and hospital trusts were asked by Building Intelligence Digest, a consultancy, how much they planned to spend to conform to regulations. Nearly two thirds had earmarked Pounds 2m with one in seven planning to spend more than Pounds 10m. 'There are an awful lot of buildings which will need a lot of cash to put them right,' said Mr David Hutchison, chairman of HLM Architects, which specialises in NHS work. He questioned whether it was worth updating buildings which could be past their useful lifespan. He singled out problems with building materials and with the location of fire escapes. Apart from the expense, conforming to fire regulations might interfere with efforts to involve hospitals in the private sector. They might have to apply for planning permission for changes of use for premises within hospitals, for example if ambulance workshops wanted to take on private repair work or if hospital incinerators or laundries took on private work. Hospitals have already faced legal action over emissions from incinerators. Some hospital pharmacies have stopped making their own treatments since they would have to apply for manufacturing licences. Mr John Greetham, chairman of Hospital Trust Federation, said yesterday: 'The speed of spending depends on local officials.' He said that the hospital trusts would be in a better position than the regional health authority hospitals to identify which buildings were worth repairing. He said that traditional funding methods meant that money went into short-term patient care rather than buildings. 'Not spending money on the buildings catches up with you in the end.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [NA news item under the rubric "Event": "The First An-70 </F> Exists!"]    [Text] The new An-70 transport aircraft could be considered  the latest achievement of the Ukrainian aircraft builders,  following the An-124 Ruslan and An-225 Mriya aircraft. President  of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev decided to become personally  acquainted with the first model of that aircraft, visiting the  Kiev Aviation Scientific and Technical Complex imeni Antonov  together with President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. The  leadership of the military departments of Russia, Ukraine and  Uzbekistan, meanwhile, have displayed an even greater interest  in the new aircraft. And that is not surprising. The chief  customers for the An-70 aircraft, after all, are the ministries  of defense of Russia and Ukraine, who are ready to put this  aircraft into service. All the more so as the development and  construction of the new transport aircraft is one of the few  examples of very close collaboration between Russia and Ukraine,  based on an international agreement. President of Ukraine Leonid  Kravchuk pointed out on that score that economic integration is  an objective necessity in the international relations of the CIS  countries.    It was pointed out that the An-70 transport aircraft has  capabilities surpassing those of all existing transport  aircraft. (The editors will talk about the An-70 in more detail  in an upcoming issue.) This aircraft is planned to be  manufactured at aviation enterprises in Ukraine, Russia and  Uzbekistan. The first series-produced An-70 aircraft, however,  will appear in the skies, at best, only in 1996.</p>

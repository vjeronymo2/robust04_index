			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Blind users of blank tapes object to levy Sir, I write to refute the point made by Wayne Bickerton of the Music Copyright Reform Group (Letters: August 24) that blind users of blank tapes would not be hit by the European Commission's proposals on the introduction of a blank tape levy. Access to information is one of the main problems facing the 1m blind and partially sighted people in the UK - tape often provides the solution. The importance of tape is increasingly acknowledged by information providers; and it is vital to encourage further use of tape as a communication medium. It is clear that the majority of visually impaired people do not infringe copyright in their use of tape. The MCRG claims that the proposal will allow member states to exempt or compensate blind users of tape. The Royal National Institute for the Blind has consistently opposed the introduction of a blank tape levy because we are unconvinced that it is possible to create a comprehensive and workable exemption scheme, due to cost and bureaucracy problems. RNIB therefore feels that the difficulties of developing an exemption scheme raise serious questions about the introduction of a blank tape levy. It believes there can be no justification for a levy when blind people use tape for the purposes of overcoming disability. Ian Bruce, director general, RNIB, 224 Great Portland Street, London W1N</p>

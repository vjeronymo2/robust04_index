After hearing Premier Li Peng's government work report at  the  current session of the National People's Congress, leaders of  three provinces and one autonomous region expressed their above  view.    In an interview with XINHUA, Ma Zhongchen, governor of Henan  Province in central China, said that rural enterprises are a  powerhouse for economic development in central and western  regions, a main channel for surplus rural labor and a driving  force for the development of rural towns.    He said Henan Province, the second largest agricultural  province in China, has achieved remarkable progress in  developing rural enterprises. In 1993 rural enterprises in the  province produced an output value of 195 billion yuan and a  gross profit of 24.18 billion yuan, up 62.5 percent and 76.5  percent over the previous year.    Rural enterprises in Gansu and Yunnan Provinces and Guangxi  Zhuang Autonomous Region also made breakthroughs and achieved  record economic returns in 1993. Local leaders said that the  output value of rural enterprises in the two provinces and  Guangxi registered 58.4, 41.5 and 71.6 percent of growth  respectively last year.    However, leaders of the three provinces and Guangxi clearly  understood the giant gap between coastal areas and the central  and western regions.    Zhang Wule, acting governor of Gansu Province, said the  central and western regions account for 80 percent of China's  land area and 65 percent of rural population. However, the  output value of their rural enterprises took up only 35 percent  of the national total in 1993.    "This gap will have an adverse impact on the economic  development of the whole county," Zhang said.    According to existing conditions, it is necessary to carry  out large-scale cooperation between coastal and central-western  regions in the development of rural industry, because the  eastern areas have technologies, financial resources and  management expertise while the central-western regions abound in  raw materials, natural resources and manpower, the acting  governor said.    Liu Mingzu, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous  Regional People's Congress, said the joint-stock cooperative  system arising from rural enterprises adapts to economic  conditions in central and western regions. It is necessary to  spread the system.    Leaders of the three provinces and Guangxi agreed that  shortage of fund is the key factor restraining the development  of rural enterprises in the central and western regions.    The State Council has decided that the central treasury will  earmark loans to support development of rural enterprises in  central and western regions from 1993 to 2000.    In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture is preparing a  pilot  program for east-west rural enterprise cooperation and plans to  set up 100 pilot zones for east-west rural enterprise  cooperation.    In accordance with state industrial policies, the ministry  will also select 1,000 pilot projects for developing and  upgrading rural industries in central and western regions.    At present, provinces and regions in eastern, central and  western China are interested in the pilot program. Ten  provinces and regions such as Sichuan, Hubei and Guangxi have  planned to set up 50 pilot cooperative zones.    Leaders of the three provinces and Guangxi region believe  that the central and western regions will usher in a new phase  of rural industry development thanks to east-west cooperation,  support from the central authorities plus local advantages.</p>

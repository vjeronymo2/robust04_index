			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TROUBLES WITHOUT THE IRISH -- OR THE BRITISH;  </P> <P> FATHER AND SON BY PETER MAAS (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER: $17.95; 316 PP.;  0-671-63172-1)  </P> <P> If writing can be described as exercise, then fiction and nonfiction use two  different sets of muscles. And while Peter Maas, author of "Serpico," "The  Valachi Papers" and "King of the Gypsies," clearly has the conditioning to  succeed in nonfiction, novels are something else again. "Father and Son" is  Maas' eighth book, but only his second work of fiction, and while it is far  from flabby, no one but his agent (to whom the book is dedicated) would  characterize it as being in terrific shape either.  </P> <P> "Father and Son" is a novel that in simpler times would have been described as  having been "ripped from today's headlines." It opens with an expertly planned  break-in at a National Guard Armory in the Boston area and the subsequent  pilfering of M16 rifles, grenade launchers, heavy machine guns and the like.  The grateful recipient of this largess is to be the Irish Republican Army,  which plans to use it to further its perennial struggle to free Northern  Ireland from British control.  </P> <P> Getting the weapons is one thing, getting them to Ireland something else again.  Here the IRA relies on what Maas portrays as a fairly extensive network of  American supporters, both inside the federal government and out. One of them  turns out to be a 19-year-old Harvard student and ace sailor named Jamie  McGuire who, having been fed tales of Irish resistance by his grandfather, is  recruited by an IRA lad who hears him sing teary songs of the rebellion like  "Back Home in Derry" and "Kevin Barry" at a Cambridge pub.  </P> <P> Well, before the IRA makes contact with Jamie, however, a good 10 years earlier  in fact, we meet him and his father, Michael McGuire, a New York advertising  man with little or no feeling for his Irish heritage. What Michael did care  about was his wife, Mary Alice, and a good part of this book is taken up with  her unexpected death when Jamie was 9. We get to see how both father and son  coped with the loss and how their relationship leads both to Jamie's  involvement with the IRA and his father's attempt to insure that that  attraction not be fatal.  </P> <P> As you would expect from a nonfiction writer of his caliber, Maas handles that  initial armory break-in scene quite nicely. In fact, all the situations  involving the logistics of IRA covert actions both in this country and on the  Emerald Isle, as well as the machinations of the British counterintelligence  operatives, are brisk and involving.  </P> <P> Maas has clearly done quite a bit of research in this area, and it pays off not  only in enticing tidbits like how IRA operatives are snuck past U.S. Customs  and exactly the way razor wire is used to protect British installations in  Belfast, but in a general air of authenticity that makes the plot of "Father  and Son" that much more believable.  </P> <P> Maas is also good at capturing the determination and resilient spirit of the  IRA, the timeless feeling that, as one of its leaders says, whatever he  accomplishes in getting the British out is "but a tick of the clock that's been  runnin' over eight hundred years." Maas manages to sympathize with the lads  without fawning over them, and though that may keep the book off of Margaret  Thatcher's bedside table, it is a virtue nevertheless.  </P> <P> But at home as he is in the tension and logistics of secret missions, that's  how off base Maas is in the delineation and development of character. It's not  just that his Britishers literally say things like "Chin up, old chap" and  "Cheerio," or that his IRA leaders are all noble and laconic: In the context of  a straight thriller, those lapses are acceptable, even to be expected. However,  Maas is attempting something different with "Father and Son" and that simply  does not come off.  </P> <P> What Maas is trying to do with Jamie and Michael McGuire is create realistic,  believable human beings, not only because the more we care about them the more  effective the jeopardy he puts them in will be but also because he knows that  character is the key fiction muscle that needs to be developed if a novel is to  rise above the level of the potboiler.  </P> <P> So we are forced to wade through what feels like endless scenes of father and  son, often fishing but always exchanging tiresome bromides about life. Though  he is deft when it comes to action, Maas has a hollow tin ear when it comes to  dialogue, and emotionally bankrupt lines like Michael's thought that "If a bad  thing happened to Jamie, he didn't think he could go on" lie listlessly on the  page like so many dead flounder.  </P> <P> Not only doesn't this attempted humanizing of Michael and Jamie add to the  book's considerable suspense, it almost diminishes it, because every time Maas  cuts away from action to character you want to get up and have a beer. The idea  of trying to escape from the cliches of genre is a good one, but Maas'  insufficient efforts have ended up only underlining them.  </P></p>

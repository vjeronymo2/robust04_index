			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SALES TAX HIKE'S BACKERS TO STRESS BENEFITS TO DRIVERS  </P> <P> Anaheim residents can expect letters in the next few weeks -- signed by some of  their neighbors or civic leaders -- describing plans to widen Katella Avenue  and Harbor Boulevard, repair Brookhurst Street and build a grade crossing where  Ball Road passes the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks.  </P> <P> In San Clemente, letters signed by that community's activists may highlight  plans to resurface Avenida Calafia, widen Avenida Pico and improve a freeway  on-ramp.  </P> <P> And in other communities throughout Orange County, voters will begin to receive  mailers this week describing how their neighborhoods may benefit if on Nov. 7  they approve Measure M, which would increase the county's sales tax from 6 to  6.5 cents in order to raise $3.1 billion specifically for transportation  improvements.  </P> <P> The mailers will mark the emergence of the million-dollar campaign for Measure  M. And the goal of what is expected to be a low-key campaign is to deliver a  personalized message, conveyed in a sort of neighbor-to-neighbor chitchat: how  the trip from your driveway to your job or grocery store can be made a little  easier. And how your everyday life might be different if this sales tax is  passed.  </P> <P> "The whole campaign is tied to three words: benefits, benefits and benefits,"  said Alan Hoffenblum, campaign manager for Measure M, which has been projected  to cost the average county consumer an extra $50 to $75 a year. "It is our  belief that people will not vote for a tax increase unless they can see what  they will get for themselves."  </P> <P> The strategy to pass a tax increase in fiscally conservative Orange County is a  lesson in the soft sell. It is tiptoeing to Election Day, hoping not to stir  the forces that overwhelmingly defeated the last attempt to raise the sales tax  in Orange County in 1984.  </P> <P> Campaign officials say that in the three weeks left before the election, they  do not plan to use any radio, television or billboard advertising. Rather, they  will concentrate on a sophisticated, state-of-the-art direct mail pitch.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the opponents of Measure M, who are expected to be vastly outspent,  are hoping to defeat the sales-tax increase with claims that developers will be  the beneficiaries, and citing as evidence the million-dollar-plus campaign  financed largely by developer contributions.  </P> <P> Many of the opponents -- still a small and relatively unorganized group -- are  slow-growth activists and environmentalists who were part of a coalition behind  last year's countywide slow-growth measure, which was defeated. They include  slow-growth activist Russ Burkett of San Juan Capistrano and council members  from Laguna Beach and Newport Beach.  </P> <P> But the slow-growth coalition is split on Measure M. Some of its leaders --  most notably Tom Rogers -- have endorsed Measure M, and some were even involved  in writing its language.  </P> <P> Measure M now includes a requirement that every city adopt a growth-management  plan to make future development contingent on adequate roads. And it would  create a citizens oversight committee that would monitor how the sales tax  revenue is spent.  </P> <P> As a result, the compromise measure has drawn a list of supporters that is most  unusual in Orange County politics.  </P> <P> It includes such slow-growth advocates as Rogers and Norm Grossman; development  company executives, such as the Irvine Co.'s Jack Flannagan; Bob Balgenorth, a  labor leader with the Building Trades Council; the Democratic Foundation,  chaired by Audrey Redfern, which is helping with a get-out-the-vote effort;  Bruce Nestande, a member of the state Transportation Commission, and John  Simon, chairman of Citizens for Traffic Solutions, which helped defeat the  slow-growth measure in June, 1988.  </P> <P> "I have not joined the other side," Rogers said recently of his support for  Measure M. "But I have to say, we got more than we thought (in  growth-management language in the measure). Every city would have to adopt a  growth-management plan. And we could never have done that by initiative."  </P> <P> Nestande, chairman of the Measure M campaign, added: "I think the fact the plan  has the support it has speaks for itself. If this plan had a flaw, a major  deficiency, you would not see this support. These are very independent people."  </P> <P> The campaign is largely underwritten by developers. The last finance disclosure  statement on Sept. 30 showed that the proponents had raised and spent almost  $800,000. That included individual contributions of more than $25,000 from such  development firms as Buie Corp., Fieldstone Co., J.M. Peters Co., Koll Co.,  Santa Margarita Co., Shea Homes, the William Lyon Co. and Woodcrest Development  Inc.  </P> <P> In 1984, the unsuccessful campaign for a 1-cent sales-tax increase -- which was  also intended for transportation improvements -- raised about $1.8 million,  largely from developers.  </P> <P> Proponents say the biggest mistake they made in 1984 was asking for a tax  increase without showing how it would be spent. This time, the $3.1 billion  that the tax is expected to generate over the next 20 years is detailed in an  inch-thick spending plan that includes road maintenance and the construction of  new roads, widening major roads as well as freeways, and planning for future  commuter trains.  </P> <P> With that in mind, the campaign's pitch will include the personalized message  about improvements in each voter's neighborhood as well as the protections  built into the measure for those who distrust government -- the citizen  oversight committee and the growth-management requirement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dislike for Politicians  </P> <P> Part of the campaign's strategy, in fact, is to exploit the public's basic  dislike for politicians by emphasizing in literature that the measure was  "written by Orange County citizens . . . not politicians."  </P> <P> Actually, the measure originally was drafted by the Orange County  Transportation Commission, negotiated with the county's League of Cities, then  modified by a citizens commission.  </P> <P> But elected officials who support the measure -- including all five Orange  County supervisors -- are keeping a relatively low profile in the campaign.  </P> <P> "They're not being played down, but they're not being played up," said campaign  manager Hoffenblum. "This is not a political plan; it is a citizens plan."  </P> <P> But some of the supervisors do not like the anti-politician pitch.  </P> <P> "I don't see why that has to be part of the issue," Board of Supervisors  Chairman Thomas F. Riley said. "If you keep telling a story long enough, it  becomes believable."  </P> <P> In addition to the campaign message, the key to the race may be how many voters  will turn out for an off-year election in which Measure M will be the only  entry on the ballot in many areas of the county. Turnout is expected to be low  -- 30% of the registered voters or less, which Measure M proponents fear  worsens their chances.  </P> <P> Polls done by the campaign for Measure M have shown that voters favor the tax,  62% to 29%. However, a Times Orange County Poll released in early July showed  that Measure M was favored by 48% of those surveyed and opposed by 46%, down  from 54% favorable rating in a 1988 poll. With a margin of error of 4%,  pollster Mark Baldassare, who conducted both polls for the Times Orange County  Edition, indicated that the measure's chance of passage was far from certain.  </P> <P> Measure M campaign officials are more optimistic -- provided the turnout is  good.  </P> <P> "If everybody turned out, we get 62% of the vote," Hoffenblum said. "My own  personal opinion is that if we get a very low turnout, we could do very  poorly."  </P> <P> The problem is exacerbated by the fact that only 900 polling places will be  open in this election, contrasted with 2,200 for a normal election-year ballot.  It means that many people will have to go farther out of their way if they want  to vote.  </P> <P> For that reason, Hoffenblum said, the campaign plans to emphasize absentee  voting so that voters can cast ballots by mail.  </P> <P> The prospect of a low turnout has given even greater significance to the  planned direct-mail campaign targeting those most likely to vote.  </P> <P> "If only 30% of the voters are going to participate, you don't want to waste  money talking to all of the voters," said Paul Ambrosino, a direct-mail  consultant in San Francisco. "It's better to communicate repeatedly with the  30%."  </P> <P> Ambrosino said computer lists can identify those most likely to vote by  searching the public records of an individual's voting pattern -- how often  they vote; do they vote only in a presidential year; a normal election year or  do they vote every time.  </P> <P> "It isn't difficult at all," he said. "Voter files available from different  vendors have all of this information, and it's simply a matter of researching,  then targeting and tailoring."  </P> <P> They can also tailor that direct mail to address the specific area concerns of  local voters.  </P> <P> Said Hoffenblum: "People want to know what specific benefit they are going to  receive, and you can't do that on a 60-second radio spot or on TV. We're trying  to do a neighbor-to-neighbor campaign. People will get letters from someone  they know, someone they trust."  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHAT MEASURE M WOULD PAY FOR  </P> <P> Measure M, the proposed half-cent sales tax for transportation projects, would  raise $3.1 billion over 20 years. Measure M designates which projects would be  undertaken with passage, including:  </P> <P> * Ten-year-earlier completion of Santa Ana Freeway widening from the San Diego  Freeway interchange in Irvine to the San Gabriel River Freeway in Los Angeles  County.  </P> <P> * Rebuilding the interchange of the Santa Ana and San Diego freeways, known as  the El Toro "Y."  </P> <P> * Adding lanes to Interstate 5 in South County, the Riverside Freeway  throughout the Orange County, the Orange Freeway from Diamond Bar to the Santa  Ana Freeway, and adding lanes to the Costa Mesa Freeway between the Riverside  and Santa Ana freeways.  </P> <P> * Building a 220-mile network of "super streets," using Orange County's 21  busiest streets.  </P> <P> * Expanding Los Angeles-to-San Diego rail service, planning commuter train  service between Riverside and Irvine and studying additional train service  elsewhere.  </P> <P> * Coordinating traffic signals throughout the county.  </P> <P> * Requiring every city and the county to adopt comprehensive growth management  plans to link traffic relief with future development.  </P> <P> * Creating a citizens' oversight committee to monitor agencies' compliance with  the ballot measure.  </P> <P> Most of the added freeway lanes would be reserved for buses and car pools.  Freeway projects would total $1.325 billion; street and road improvements would  be $650 million; transit projects -- including rail -- $775 million, and  regional projects such as "super streets" and signal coordination would get  $350 million. If Measure M passes with more than 50% of the vote, county  officials intend to use bonds to finance an early start of many projects.  </P></p>

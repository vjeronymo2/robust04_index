			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a. How many sensitivity to ``scope of injury'' tests are appropriate to require? Are restrictions on differences between scenarios appropriate or feasible?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b. Is it appropriate to allow the trustee(s) to conduct the scope test with the base survey instrument, by constructing a valuation function to examine whether variations in belief about injuries predict variations in WTP, controlling for demographic and attitudinal factors? Are there additional/alternative internal validity test(s) that NOAA should consider?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. 70% is the minimum allowable response rate contained in the proposed OPA rule. In order to minimize non-response bias, should a minimum response rate be specified? If so, is 70% the appropriate level? If 70% is not the appropriate rate, what rationale is there for a different rate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. In the proposed OPA rule, the trustee(s) is directed to use a choice mechanism that is credible and incentive-compatible, i.e., one that does not provide respondents with incentives to understate or overstate their true value. The reasons are outlined in the preamble for recommending the use of a referendum as the choice mechanism in a survey. Are these requirements appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Should respondents with no knowledge of the resources and/or injuries prior to survey be assigned a zero value? What is the appropriate use of data on respondents' prior information?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Should there be thresholds for damages, below which CV could not be used in a damage assessment, e.g., an expected $5/household times the number of households expected to hold passive values; and/or twice the cost of a contingent valuation survey following these regulations. What threshold, if any, is appropriate? How would the threshold be implemented (without performing a CV study?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. In the proposed rule, the trustee(s) has the option of choosing the mode of administration of a survey, but the choice must be justified. Is one mode, e.g., in-person, telephone, or mail, preferable to another? If so, or if not, what rationale supports it?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Should the rule or preamble provide guidance as to criteria to be employed in determining the extent of the market?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. What requirements, if any, should be imposed on CV studies for valuing direct use only?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. What requirements, if any, should be imposed on contingent behavior studies?  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 17, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Douglas K.

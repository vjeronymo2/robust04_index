			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Belgian premier emerges as favourite to succeed Delors Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, is emerging as favourite to succeed Mr Jacques Delors as the next president of the European Commission following tacit support from France and Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany is expected to raise the name of Mr Dehaene during talks with Mr John Major at Chequers tomorrow. The meeting is being billed in Brussels as crucial for the succession, and seen as a test of Britain's political clout inside the European Union after its recent retreat on voting rights. Mr Dehaene has won support from Germany and France at the expense of Mr Ruud Lubbers, the long-serving Dutch prime minister, senior EU diplomats said. The move towards Mr Dehaene, an avowed federalist, appears to sink the chances of Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator and senior British commissioner. It could also prove awkward for Mr Major as he struggles to avoid a split inside the Conservative party over Europe. 'If Kohl wants Dehaene, and the French are behind him, then Major has no choice but to accept,' said one senior Brussels official. Mr Kohl's enthusiasm for Mr Dehaene is said to have grown during the Belgian presidency of the EU which ended last December. Mr Dehaene helped to wrap up a deal on the location of a dozen Euro-institutions, including the siting of the European Monetary Institute, forerunner of the European Central Bank, to Frankfurt, a high German priority. President Francois Mitterrand and Mr Kohl are said to have cooled toward Mr Lubbers, partly because of the Dutch presidency's shaky performance in the run-up to the Maastricht treaty. However, his chances could revive once he breaks his self-imposed silence after the Dutch elections, to be held next month. By one account, Mr Dehaene's candidacy was floated as a Franco-German trial balloon to undermine the widely held assumption that there was no credible alternative to Mr Lubbers. The leak followed talks between Mr Kohl and Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, but did not come with Mr Dehaene's foreknowledge. He has since refused all comment on whether he is a candidate. The post of president of the Commission is decided by the 12 EU heads of government. They could select a successor at the European summit in Corfu in June, if they reach the required unanimity. The Commission presidency is the top prize in a complex division of Euro-spoils under negotiation. Germany is expected to win the key post of secretary-general of the European Council, with the appointment of Mr Jurgen Trumpf, a senior career diplomat. Britain could, however, win a consolation prize if Lord Lawson - the former chancellor of the exchequer - is offered German support for his effort to become the next secretary-general of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

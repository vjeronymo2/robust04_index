			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Defense Ministry on 30 April; place not </F> given]    [Text] A responsible source in the Defense Ministry has  renewed its appeal to the joint military commission and  fact-finding committee, set up by the House of Representatives,  to urgently mediate with the ruling military authority in Sanaa  so as to save the wounded members of the 3d Armored Brigade. The  source has also appealed for a guarantee that medical help and  food supplies reach units of the brigade and the tribes of  al-Sarih and al-Jabal, which have been subjected to continuous  artillery bombardment by Republican Guard forces, central  security forces, the military police, and tribes loyal to the  ruling family in Sanaa. This came after the Defense Ministry  received firm evidence showing that a number of wounded members  of the 3d Brigade had been captured or removed from hospitals,  shackled, and moved to national security centers and military  garrisons, while being treated in a most inhumane and immoral  way.    They were interrogated with the aim of extracting fantastic  confessions from them in front of television, for cheap  propaganda and political ends. Information has confirmed that  many of these wounded persons are in terribly bad shape, that  their lives are in danger as a result of torture (?in addition  to) their wounds. What confirms these inhuman actions on the  part of the military ruling authorities in Sanaa, which are  being committed without any moral, patriotic or religious  feelings, is the fact that on 30 April these authorities  arrested Lieutenant Colonel 'Abd-al-Nabi Hadi al-Mahdi, the  commander of the 14th Battalion of the 3d Armored Brigade. He  was lying in bed at Amran Hospital, having been wounded on 27  April in 'Imran by Sheikh Hamud Atif and his gang, on the orders  of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, who ordered the battalion  commander to be brought to his office dead or alive.    The Defense Ministry source appealed to all patriotic  forces,  social personalities, parties, institutions, and humanitarian  organizations -- particularly the Yemeni Red Crescent, Arab Red  Crescent, and the International Red Cross, to discharge their  humanitarian responsibilities toward our sons and brothers, who  are being subjected to the most revolting physical and mental  torture at the hands of the torturers and (?intelligence men) of  the ruling military family in Sanaa, by guaranteeing the  dispatch of medical and food aid to the 3d Armored Brigade and  the sons of the al-Sarih and al-Jabal.    Issued by the Defense Ministry    [Dated] 30 April [words indistinct].</p>

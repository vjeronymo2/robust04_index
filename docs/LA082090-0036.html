			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TROOPS KILLED JORDANIAN SOLDIER IN WEST BANK CLASH, ISRAEL SAYS  </P> <P> The Israeli army reported that its troops killed one Jordanian soldier and  wounded a second Sunday in a clash in the occupied West Bank. No Israelis were  hurt, the army said.  </P> <P> The skirmish occurred in the Jordan River Valley near the Damia Bridge (also  called the Adam Bridge), about 17 miles north of Jericho and less than a mile  inside Israeli-occupied territory.  </P> <P> The army said that an Israeli patrol noticed footmarks in an unpaved military  road that runs along the Jordanian border and sighted two men in Jordanian army  uniforms.  </P> <P> The men were ordered to halt, but instead they opened fire on the patrol, the  army said. The Israeli patrol returned the fire, killing one man and lightly  wounding the other, who was taken into custody and is being questioned.  </P> <P> Maj. Gen. Itzak Mordechai, chief of the Central Command, arrived at the scene  soon after the incident and commended the unit for its action.  </P> <P> The army said that there have been two other infiltration attempts from Jordan  this year and three incidents involving shots fired at Israeli soldiers from  across the border.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Israel Defense Forces weekly publication, Bamahane, quoted an  unidentified intelligence source as saying that current events in the Persian  Gulf are leading toward "an inevitable military clash."  </P> <P> The publication also asserted that Israeli intelligence had alerted the United  States beforehand to the likelihood of an Iraqi attack on Kuwait but that the  Americans "remained complacent."  </P></p>

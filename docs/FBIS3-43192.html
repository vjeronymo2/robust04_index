			<p>Serbs     Defy NATO Warning                          SUMMARY      Shrugging off threats of NATO airstrikes, Serb leaders in the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and  Bosnia-Herzegovina have denied responsibility for taking the  offensive in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Bosnian Serb leaders flatly  rejected NATO's call for the opening of Tuzla airport to  humanitarian aid flights.                          END  SUMMARY     Reacting to the 11 January communique issued following the NATO  summit in Brussels that warned of the possibility of air strikes  to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo and other threatened  areas, Serb leaders and media have denied that Serb armed forces  have gone on the offensive and complained that the international  community has unjustifiably singled out the Serbs for punishment.     Reaction in Belgrade     Slobodan Milosevic, President of the Republic of Serbia in the  FRY, described the "threats of bombing" Serbian positions as  incomprehensible" because he said Bosnian Serb forces have "not  waged war for more than seven months" and the "Muslim leadership"  is "undoubtedly" responsible for recent "armed provocations"  (Tanjug, 13 January).   Milosevic similarly denied Bosnian Serb  responsibility for recent armed conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina in  a speech to the Geneva peace conference on 29 November (Belgrade  radio, 29 November).  He gave no indication in his most recent  statements that he would attempt to persuade Bosnian Serb forces  to desist from their shelling of Sarajevo and their interference  with humanitarian shipments in Bosnia-Herzegovina.     Although the NATO communique issued a general warning to all  sides about the possibility of air strikes, the Yugoslav media  have asserted that the threat was part of a wider international  campaign of unjustified criticism of the Serbs.  A Tanjug  commentator asserted that, "although the word 'Serb' was not  explicitly mentioned," NATO had aimed its warning at the Bosnian  Serbs.  Echoing Milosevic's objections to the international  community's criticism of the Serbs, the commentator complained of  the unfair treatment of the Serbs.  He maintained that "only the  Serb side has so far fulfilled all it has been asked" at the  peace talks but the international community "continues to make  threats" to the Serbs alone "while looking with benevolence on  the bloody fighting" between Muslims and Croats (Tanjug, 13  January).     Bosnian Serb Defiance     The Bosnian Serb leadership was unanimous in its rejection of the  NATO communique's call for the opening of Tuzla airport to  flights carrying humanitarian aid.  The Serbs insisted that the  Muslims would use the airport to smuggle arms for their army  (Tanjug, 12 and 13 January).  Reinforcing this assertion, one  Tanjug report claimed that Tuzla airport was already being used  to receive flights carrying arms from Germany and Turkey (Tanjug,  13 January).     The reaction of Bosnian Serb leaders to the communique's warning  of airstrikes varied from outright defiance to dismissal of the  idea as militarily impracticable:     -- Bosnian Serb "President" Radovan Karadzic described the  threats of airstrikes as "counterproductive" to the peace  process, "to put it mildly," charging that the possibility of  NATO intervention encourages the "Muslim side to carry on with  the war."  He claimed that "even UNPROFOR reports clearly  indicate" that the "Muslims have been attacking" Serbian forces  in and around Sarajevo (Tanjug, 11 January).     -- Bosnian Serb "presidency" member Nikola Koljevic was openly  defiant in his reaction to the NATO communique.  He said that  "Serbs have had enough of threats" and warned that those who  issued them were "thinking incorrectly" because they "do not know  Serbs, their history, and aspirations" (Vecernje Novosti, 13  January).     -- Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the assembly of the self-  proclaimed Republic of Srpska in Bosnia-Herzegovina, criticized  the NATO communique's warning of air strikes and its demand that  Tuzla airport be opened but assessed positively what he  maintained was a "new approach" to the Bosnian crisis.  He  claimed that NATO had "abandoned" its "ultimatum-style tone" that  it had previously used in its statements on the crisis.  He  dismissed the warning to end the strangulation of Sarajevo as  "superfluous" for the Serbs since the Serbian side "is not the  one strangling Sarajevo" as outsiders "keep saying" (Tanjug, 12  January).     -- The chief of staff of the Bosnian Serb army, General Manojlo  Milovanovic, dismissed the possibility of air strikes as  impracticable.  Milovanovic claimed that air strikes on his  forces would "directly threaten" UNPROFOR units and Muslim and  Croat forces "that are deployed very close to Serbian forces on  all the fronts" in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  He further belittled the  communique's warning as a "scheme used too frequently" when a  "peace plan likely to be rejected by the Bosnian Serbs" is about  to be presented at the international peace negotiations  (Politika, 13 January).

Near the end of 1992, a reconnaissance plane from the UN's  Cambodia operation filmed from the air the Pailin area, which is  controlled by the Khmer Rouge. The film was so shocking that the  UN declared it secret.    The guerrillas had raped all of western Cambodia. Hills had  been turned into open mines, from where precious stones had been  taken to Thailand. The remaining trees had been felled and  dragged across the border, without any attempt to spare the  ground vegetation.    In Cambodia, peace and capitalism have been able to achieve,  in one and a half years what war and communism were unable to do  in two decades; the country's unique natural resources are  teetering on the brink of an ecological catastrophe.    The warring parties of the Cambodian civil war are the  people  behind the deforestation. In 1991, after peace had been reached,  they hurried to sell the natural resources of their lands to the  highest bidders.    Thailand and Vietnam, Cambodia's neighbors, were the  architects of this catastrophe. After they had put an end to  logging in their own countries, they needed the raw material for  their rich customer, Japan.    The UN development program, UNDP, is attempting to slow the  destruction through a project that is aiding the government in  creating a sensible environmental policy. After the UN, Finland  is the most significant supporter of the project, as it has  committed itself to a contribution of 340,000 dollars.    "Cambodia's problems are frightening," said Mbella Ngongi,  legal counsel for the project. "Environmental protection is  something new in this country. Even the cabinet ministers must  be educated," he added.    The task appears hopeless. Starting from scratch, seven  experts must, in less than a year, teach the Cambodians moral  values and help them enact laws that would prevent environmental  destruction.    The project's goals are awesome: the enactment of  environmental laws in a country with only five lawyers; even  many of the justices on the Supreme Court have no legal  training.    "It's no wonder that they give up their natural resources  without stopping to ponder the consequences of such insanity,"  said one UN official, who asked to remain anonymous.    In many areas, the destruction has been so reckless that  refugees, returning after 10 years from Thailand, have been  unable to recognize their native region.    During the 13-year-long civil war, the Phnom Penh  government,  which enjoyed the support of Vietnam, cut down forests in order  to chase the Khmer Rouge out in the open. The guerrillas escaped  and the timber was taken to Vietnam.    Logging operations accelerated in October 1991, when the  four  parties in the civil war signed a peace accord in Paris.    "In Cambodia, in a year and a half, all natural resources,  both used and unused, ended up being controlled by foreigners,"  as the newspaper, PHNOM PENH POST, stated last summer.    Cambodia's neighbors need lumber. Thailand put a stop to  logging in 1989. Laos put restraints on logging operations in  the summer of 1991. Vietnam outlawed lumber exports in the  spring of 1992.    "Cambodia was easy prey for its neighbors," said UNDP's  lawyer, Ngong. "A civil servant earned 10 dollars a months. He  could not believe his ears when he was offered millions just for  tree trunks," he added.    In 1992, 1.5 million cubic meters was exported from  Cambodia.  More than half of this was transported illegally to Thailand and  Vietnam.    Everyone sold logs: Khmer Rouge, the Cambodian Peoples'  Party, which formerly led the communists, and FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia], who was loyal to King Sihanouk.    "We have enough forests to use," said Deputy Finance  Minister  Mok Mareth. "All of Cambodian is green."    Mareth is currently under secretary in charge of  environmental affairs.    Log exports were temporarily stopped in January 1993.  According to the UN, during the first five months of the  moratorium, the prohibition was violated 103 times -- at a value  of 7.2 million dollars.    According to Ngong, the problem is that everyone wants to  get  rich fast, and they are all blinded by quick profits.    The government parties have not stated how they intend to  combat the ecological catastrophe. And that is not surprising,  as soldiers from Cambodia's new army stand guard in the log  yards of Thai companies, during forest auctions.</p>

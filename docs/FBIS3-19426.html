Membership would  include Finland in the EU's economic and social policy decisions  and would also have an effect on security policy issues.    "From a standpoint of military security, this change would  not appear to significantly affect Russia's position as  Finland's neighbor, nor does it effect Finland's position as  Russia's neighbor," said Klenberg, in a speech, last Monday [14  February] in Tampere.    According to Klenberg, a possible peace partnership with  NATO, NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], or serving as  an observer within the WEU [Western European Union], should not  change Finland's security situation. On the other hand, if  Finland chose to join NATO or the WEU, that would drastically  change Finland's military security status.    Klenberg feels that it is uncertain whether the CFE  [Conventional Armed Forces in Europe] agreement, concerning  limiting conventional weapons in Europe, will become effective  in the areas surrounding Finland.    In Klenberg's view, the CFE agreement has reached "an  interesting stage."    "At this stage, it appears that the implementation of  regulations regarding peripheral areas is in the danger zone,"  concluded Klenberg.</p>

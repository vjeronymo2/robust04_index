			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, June 8 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia's  purchase of MiG-29 jetfighters from Russia will provide the  impetus for broader long term cooperation between the two  countries, said Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg  Soskovets.    He said both countries felt their partnership should not be  limited to military and technological cooperation.    We have decided to set up a joint group of experts to study  proposals from both sides and identify areas for future  cooperation, he told a news conference Tuesday.    Malaysia Tuesday signed a US$550 million contract with  Russia  to buy 18 MiG-29 jetfighters, of which US$450 million will be  paid in cash and the balance in the form of Malaysian refined  palm oil over a five-year period.    Soskovets said he had a useful discussion with Prime  Minister  Dr. Mahathir Mohamed covering Malaysia's interest in Russia's  high technologies in satellite communication, telecommunication  and space studies.    On trade between the two countries, he said it was not  sufficiently developed.    Russia might consider granting certain tariffs and custom  duties to Malaysia in future trade, he added.    Soskovets also said the counter purchase of palm oil in the  MiG-29 deal was very profitable to his country.    Russia, he said, was also interested in selling its weapons  and military equipment to other countries in Southeast Asia.    The new Russian military doctrine emphasised the utilisation  of its advantages in military technologies and to put them to  commercial use.    Conversion is underway in the Russian defence industry...  Many items are now discontinued but at the same time we should  preserve the capacity in industrial and scientific potentials  and to do this we should seek new markets, he said.    He said Russia's sale of combat weaponry in the world market  had dropped tremendously compared to that of the former Soviet  Union.    According to statistics of an international peace research  institute, the former Soviet Union contributed some 38 per cent  of world weapons sales against 30 per cent by the United States,  he said.    Now Russian arms exports only comprised five per cent of the  total compared to 60 per cent by the United States, he added.</p>

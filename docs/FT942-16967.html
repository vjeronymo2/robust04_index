			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / International Company News: Irish Life shows 12% embedded value rise Irish Life, Ireland's largest fund manager in the life and pension market, reported a 11.9 per cent increase in embedded value from IPounds 494m to IPounds 553m (Pounds 531m) in 1993 - broadly in line with market expectations. In calculating the embedded value - the financial yardstick which measures the net present value of current and future surpluses expected to be generated from business currently on the company's books - the company has moved from a 15 per cent to a 12 per cent discount rate policy. This is in line with the fall in money market rates. Pre-tax profits edged ahead to IPounds 41.9m (IPounds 41.6m). Premium income increased by IPounds 99m - or 16.6 per cent - to IPounds 697m, with the strongest growth occurring in Interstate, the US subsidiary, where premium income grew by 48 per cent to IPounds 115m. Investment income rose by 26 per cent to IPounds 309m. In the group's core Irish market, individual single premium sales - which had dropped sharply in 1992 to only IPounds 55.7m - staged a recovery and rose 64 per cent to IPounds 91.3m, although this was still well down on the 1990 level of IPounds 141m. This sector has suffered through competition from low-tax savings products in the Irish market. Overall premium income in the Irish market grew by 11 per cent to IPounds 455.5m, but market share slipped by two percentage points to 25.7 per cent. The UK division saw premium income rise 21 per cent to IPounds 105.7m, but a fall in new business is anticipated in 1994, as the distribution network is overhauled and cost-cutting measures are implemented. The company also announced that it is to acquire another US subsidiary, the Boston-based First Variable Life, for between Dollars 50m and Dollars 55m (Pounds 37.6m). The company is licensed to sell unit-linked products throughout the US and has assets of Dollars 350m. Total funds under management at the year-end jumped 34 per cent to IPounds 6.45bn. Earnings per share rose from 10.54p to 10.88p. The final dividend is increased to 6.12p for a total up 8 per cent to 9.12p (8.44p). COMMENT With the aftershocks of the 1992 currency crisis now behind it, strong growth in the US and an overhaul of its operations under way in both the Irish and European markets, the group is beginning to deliver on the expectations that had been created at its flotation three years ago. An increase in embedded value of IPounds 70m looks possible this year, and if goodwill of IPounds 100m is added for the value of cost savings and new business anticipated, then the current share price of 207p looks cheap by UK standards.</p>

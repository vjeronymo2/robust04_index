			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> HEAD OF THE CLASS;  </P> <P> INFORMAL POLL OF RECRUITING SERVICES PRODUCES LIST OF TOP 22 FOOTBALL PROSPECTS  IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P> In discussing the high school football talent pool in Southern California this  year, scout Dick Lascola admits that it is not a bumper crop.  </P> <P> "It's not as bad as some (years) but not as good as others," says Lascola, who  operates the Fallbrook-based Scouting Evaluation Assn.  </P> <P> He says it doesn't match the talent supply of last season when seniors such as  running backs Russell White of Crespi, quarterback Curtis Conway of Hawthorne,  offensive lineman Bob Whitfield of Banning and defensive lineman Marcellous  Elder of Long Beach Poly were considered among the premier college prospects in  the nation.  </P> <P> But "there's still quality out there," Lascola said.  </P> <P> He sees quality at linebacker and quarterback while the ranks appear thin among  defensive backs and offensive linemen.  </P> <P> Possibly the best overall prospect is linebacker Bruce Walker of Compton  Dominguez. "There are some who think that Walker is the best player in the  state, and others say he's the best in the country," Lascola said.  </P> <P> Linebackers Willie McGinest of Long Beach Poly and Nkosi Littleton of Carson  and quarterback Charles Levy of Lynwood also have drawn attention from major  colleges.  </P> <P> In addition to Lascola, The Times turned to national recruiting services such  as G &amp; W Recruiting Report of Pennsylvania, Tom Lemming's Prep Football  Report of Illinois, Houston-based scout Max Emfinger, Super Prep magazine of  Costa Mesa and the Florida-based Steve Smith's Blue Chip Report to determine  which Greater Los Angeles and Orange County seniors are receiving national  attention.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat, Mater Dei and Long Beach Poly lead the way with two players apiece  on the list.  </P> <P> Here, in no particular order, are the Terrific 22:  </P> <P> * Michael Wynn (San Fernando, quarterback) -- San Fernando has been known more  for running backs over the years, but Wynn is in the spotlight this season.  Wynn passed for 1,614 yards last season. Emfinger ranked him No. 2 nationally  among quarterback prospects. Wynn (6-foot-3, 210 pounds) runs the 40-yard dash  in 4.6 seconds.  </P> <P> * Todd Gragnano (Los Alamitos, quarterback) -- Perhaps the most touted  quarterback in the Southland, Gragnano (6-1, 185) earned his reputation with an  impressive junior season in which he passed for 2,324 yards and 15 touchdowns.  He has a strong arm, a quick release and is mobile in the pocket. Super Prep  compares him with former Orange County standout Bret Johnson of UCLA. He also  plays baseball and is an excellent student.  </P> <P> * Dan O'Neil (Mater Dei, quarterback) -- Regarded as one of the top prospects  on the West Coast, O'Neil is certainly one of the most accurate passers. As a  junior he completed 58% of his attempts, passing for 2,100 yards and 18  touchdowns. He's 6-2, 185, reads defenses well and rushed for 350 yards last  season. An all-around athlete, O'Neil also placekicks and plays basketball and  volleyball.  </P> <P> * J.J. O'Laughlin (Glendora, quarterback) -- When scouts talk about O'Laughlin,  they usually speak of his potential. "He has all the tools to be a good one,"  Lascola says. Super Prep ranks him No. 6 among quarterbacks on its All-American  team. He is a pure dropback quarterback with outstanding arm strength and a  nice touch. O'Laughlin (6-3, 200) passed for 1,465 yards last season and has  nearly 3,000 in his career. He also plays baseball and basketball and has a 3.9  grade-point average.  </P> <P> * Charles Levy (Lynwood, quarterback) -- This year's version of Curtis Conway,  who starred for Hawthorne last season, Levy is a quarterback who plays like a  running back. An all-around athlete, he can pass but is regarded more for his  dangerous running. Levy (6-1, 180) has brilliant speed -- 4.5 seconds in the 40  -- and exceptional moves. He piled up 2,400 all-purpose yards last season.  Lascola projects him as an option quarterback in college and others project him  as a defensive back.  </P> <P> * Michael Jones (Montclair Prep, running back) -- In discussing Jones, scouts  use the words power and speed. Jones (6-2, 210) can bench press 315 pounds and  he runs the 40 in 4.5. He has great vision and knows how to sidestep a tackler.  He rushed for 1,514 yards and 17 touchdowns as a junior. While his future may  be at running back, scouts also think he could play safety or linebacker in  college.  </P> <P> * Marshawn Thompson (La Puente Bassett, running back) -- Bassett has never had  a reputation for producing major-college prospects and scouts had reservations  about Thompson. But he may have erased any doubt by rushing for 1,717 yards and  16 touchdowns in 301 carries last year. Thompson (6-1, 200) runs the 40 in 4.6  and, as Super Prep says, "He looks slower than he is."  </P> <P> * Chris Peery (Canyon, running back) -- For sheer power running, it would be  difficult to find a better back than Peery (6-1, 216). He takes full advantage  of his great leg strength and a solid upper body to punish opponents. He  bench-presses 315 pounds. But Peery also has speed -- 4.6 in the 40 -- to break  away from tacklers and displays good moves for his size. A starter since his  freshman year, he rushed for 1,418 yards and 22 touchdowns last season.  </P> <P> * Jerome Casey (Sylmar, running back) -- Speed makes Casey a prime attraction  among college scouts. Casey (6-0, 180) has above-average strength. It's just  that scouts tend to notice his breakaway speed first. He runs the 40 in a  blazing 4.4 and is effective both as an inside and outside runner. He is also  an outstanding long jumper.  </P> <P> * Jeremy Smith (Bishop Amat, wide receiver) -- Lemming labels Smith "a high  school superstar," and you will not find much disagreement among other scouts.  As a junior he caught 82 passes for 1,002 yards and nine touchdowns and  returned two punts for scores. Smith (5-11, 185) possesses 4.5 speed in the 40,  runs excellent pass patterns and has great hands.  </P> <P> * Kevin Copeland (Dorsey, wide receiver) -- If Smith is the best wide receiver  in the Southland, Copeland is not far behind. Said Lascola: "They don't get  much better. He's one of the tops around." He is definitely one of the fastest  with a best of 10.6 in the 100 meters. Copeland (6-0, 170) runs pinpoint  patterns and is a constant deep threat.  </P> <P> * Elic Mahone (Muir, tight end) -- Mahone is a physical specimen at 6-5, 220  pounds. He also possesses good hands and speed of 4.5 in the 40 -- outstanding  for a tight end. Mahone also plays defensive end, although he wants to play  offense in college. Mahone, a brilliant leaper, has cleared 6-5 in the high  jump. Off the field, he has a steady 3.3 grade-point average.  </P> <P> * Jason Green (Bishop Amat, tight end) -- Talk about double trouble. With Smith  and Green, Bishop Amat will pose a nightmare for secondaries. Green (6-3, 220)  presents match-up problems for defenses because of his size and 4.6 speed. He  has soft hands and is an exceptional leaper, which he demonstrated on the  basketball team last season. He caught 41 passes for 656 yards and eight  touchdowns.  </P> <P> * Chris Andresen (Warren, offensive lineman) -- Regarded as one of the top  offensive line prospects in the nation by most scouts, Andresen combines great  size and strength with above-average quickness. He is 6-4, 285 and bench  presses 400 pounds. Emfinger lists him as the nation's No. 1 prospect at  offensive guard.  </P> <P> * Ryan Motherway (Mater Dei, offensive lineman) -- Mater Dei has produced  several outstanding line prospects in the last two seasons, but scouts think  Motherway (6-4, 255) may be best. Lascola calls him the top offensive line  prospect in the area. He plays end on the defensive line and excels in  basketball.  </P> <P> * Justin Yarro (Loyola, offensive lineman) -- At a school that always seems to  produce an abundance of college prospects, At 6-4, 250, scouts say he has a  future as an offensive guard.  </P> <P> * Keith Navidi (Esperanza, defensive lineman) -- Navidi (6-6, 255) runs the 40  in 5.0. Regarded for his aggressiveness and pass rushing, Lascola calls him the  best defensive line prospect in the Southland.  </P> <P> * Bruce Walker (Dominguez, linebacker) -- In the eyes of scouts, Walker may be  the best prospect in the state at any position. Emfinger gives him the highest  rating of any player in the nation at 9.99 out of 10. Lemming calls him "a holy  terror on defense with great football instincts." Walker (6-4, 235) has 4.5  speed.  </P> <P> * Willie McGinest (Long Beach Poly, linebacker) -- Another formidable prospect  in a talent-laden position, McGinest (6-6, 220 pounds) has been viewed by some  scouts as the top senior linebacker in the state. With speed, McGinest has the  size, speed, aggressiveness and instincts to be an impact player in college. He  is a strong student with a 3.9 grade-point average.  </P> <P> * Nkosi Littleton (Carson, linebacker) -- He is not as physically imposing as  Walker or McGinest, but Littleton usually leaves an imprint on opponents. Super  Prep describes him as "this year's killer defender." Lemming calls him "a  hitter from the word go." At 6-2 and 210, he may need a little more bulk for  college.  </P> <P> * Jason Jones (Long Beach Poly, defensive back) -- At first glance, Jones may  appear small to be a major-college prospect. However, the 5-10 and 175  cornerback makes up for any size disadvantage with other attributes. He has  outstanding instincts and blazing 4.5 speed.  </P> <P> * Errol Small (Notre Dame, running back-defensive back) -- One of the better  all-around athletes on the squad, Small has stood out in basketball and  football. In football, his future is probably as a safety. Lascola thinks he is  one of the best defensive backs in the Southland. He is a hard hitter, tough  against the run and strong on pass coverage. Small (6-2, 210) has 4.6 speed and  the ability to excel at running back.  </P> <P> THE TERRIFIC 22  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:2.77IN:1.56IN:1.45IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Name  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> School  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Ht.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Wt.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Pos.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Michael Wynn  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> San Fernando  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6-3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 210  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> QB  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Todd Gragnano  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Los Alamitos  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6-1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 185  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> QB  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Dan O'Neil  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Mater Dei  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6-2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 185  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> QB  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> J.J.

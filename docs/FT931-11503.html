			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Halved interest charge helps Adscene rise by 31% to Pounds 946,000 THE HALVING of interest payable from Pounds 303,000 to Pounds 127,000 helped Adscene Group, the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, lift pre-tax profits by 31 per cent in the 26 weeks to November 28 1992. The rise to Pounds 946,000 (Pounds 720,000) was struck on turnover down by almost Pounds 1m at Pounds 7.11m. Operating profits edged ahead to Pounds 1.07m (Pounds 1.02m). Mr Harry Lambert, chairman, said that, over the half, group borrowings were reduced from Pounds 3m to Pounds 2m, accounting for the decline in the interest charge. Borrowings would fall further in the second half. The 12 per cent decline in group turnover was due to the 41 per cent downturn on the printing side, Mr Lambert said, because certain low margin contracts were deli-berately lost. The division's contribution rose 8 per cent. On the publishing side, total advertising revenue slipped 2 per cent - it was up 3 per cent in Kent, but fell 7 per cent in both London and Lincolnshire, the group's other regions. Operating profits in the division rose 4 per cent, largely because cover prices for the paid-for newspapers rose 10 per cent. In Kent, where all Adscene's newspapers are free, adver-tising rates were reduced, though market share was increased. The interim dividend is lifted to 1.8p (1.5p), payable from earnings of 4.54p (3.01p) per share.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch" by staff correspondent Lin Yu-tung (2651 </F> 5940 2767): "Centralized Operations by 20 Guangdong Cities in  Sweep Against Pirated Compact and Laser Discs"]    [Text] Shenzhen, 19 Apr -- To protect the legitimate  rights and interests of audio-visual publishers, the Guangdong  provincial authorities today planned a centralized operation in  which 20 cities were to act in coordination to rectify the  compact and laser disc markets, with the focus on a sweep  against illegal copying and selling of compact and laser discs.    Acting on the centralized plan, the Shenzhen City Culture  Bureau, Administration for Industry and Commerce, Public  Security Bureau, and news units deployed a large number of  personnel for a massive sweep.    At 1300, inspection teams made up of personnel from  cultural,  industry and commerce, public security, and news units were  divided into three contingents, one heading toward Renmin Road  South; one toward Tongjian Building; and one toward the railway  station. A small detachment which this correspondent followed  swooped down on the railway station and the Lianjian [Joint  Inspection] Building nearby. Within 100 steps of the exit of  the building were three kiosks selling illegal audio-visual  publications. The sudden raid by the law-enforcement agents  took the sellers completely by surprise; all illegal goods,  numbering at least some 6,000 boxes, were either seized or  confiscated.    Then the same detachment turned back to head toward the  railway station and ran up to the second floor. Around the  train waiting room on the second floor were five to six shops  selling illegal audio-visual publications, some of which, having  been tipped off, had moved part of the illegal goods somewhere  else. But for most of the shops, before they realized what was  happening, the law- enforcement agents had impounded or seized  all of their illegal goods. One small shop, called "Shop B2 of  the Commercial City on the second floor of the railway station,"  about three to four square meters in size, contained all kinds  of discs of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and mainland movie stars and  other items such as "Swimsuit Best," "Women and Their Bodies"  and "Sex and Happiness." There were all kinds of weird and  dazzling items. A rough estimation put the goods at over 10,000  boxes. It is understood that illegal audio-visual publications  seized by the other contingents numbered 10,000 to 20,000 boxes.    Wang Zengliang, Shenzhen City Culture Bureau Inspection  commander, who was present at the scene, told this correspondent  that there were about 1,000 shops which were issued licenses by  the city culture bureau and district authorities to sell  cultural items; and that most of the sales were legal. But  there were a considerable number of cultural item shops,  especially vendors without operating permits, which sold illegal  audio-visual publications. This situation became increasingly  worse and created a very bad influence. To crack down harshly  on this practice, the city had established an inspection command  center and staffed it with personnel drawn from the city  government, cultural, industry and commerce, and public security  departments. The city culture bureau has also set up full-time  and part-time inspection teams and planned to adopt methods such  as strengthening education, regular enforcement of laws and  inspections, and rewarding people reporting illegal selling to  ensure the healthy development of the cultural market.</p>

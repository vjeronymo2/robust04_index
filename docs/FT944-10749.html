			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / UK Company News: MAM to capitalise on German demand Mercury Asset Management, the UK's largest independent fund management company, is setting up an investment company in Germany to capitalise on the growing demand for international investment expertise. MAM is 75 per cent owned by SG Warburg, the investment bank. Mr Harald Schussler, joint managing director of SG Warburg Asset Management Frankfurt, said: 'The target client is the German institutional market - pension funds, insurance companies, corporates.' Recent European Union legislation on insurance funds which forced Germany to lift restrictions on investment outside the country had prompted increased interest in international bonds and equities. 'Our intention is to market our experience in the global equities market,' Mr Schussler added. The German institutional funds market has grown between 40 and 50 per cent in each of the last three years as corporations discovered that professional fund managers earned better returns than in-house investment managers, he said. MAM has obtained a licence to establish a Kapitalanlagegesellschaft, which will allow it to set up so-called 'spezialfonden' carrying special tax advantages. Mr Schussler said it had several potential clients already. Meanwhile, Mercury Asset Management reported a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 from Pounds 50.4m to Pounds 57m. The interim rises to 4.5p (4p). Assets under management rose from Pounds 55.5bn a year ago to Pounds 62.7bn. Some Pounds 1.3bn represented net new cash in both institutional and retail accounts, said Mr Hugh Stevenson, chairman. However, with the rise in profits and revenues came a significant increase in operating expenses. Operating costs rose from Pounds 56.8m to Pounds 82.2m but were only slightly ahead of spending in the second half of the last financial year. Mr Stevenson said almost all the increased expenses related to the hiring of additional back office support for MAM's global custody operations and its growing retail funds business. 'Spending has been frozen for three years and we had a lot of catching up to do,' he said.</p>

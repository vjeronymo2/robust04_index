Such is the opinion of RF  Deputy Minister of Health Aleksey Moskvichev, director of the  diphtheria control headquarters established under the Russian  Ministry of Health.    Microbiologists believe, he said, that a new strain of  disease has appeared, making the situation so acute: Just  between August and September the incidence of disease tripled.  Today the number of persons hospitalized is nearing 8,000, and  270 persons have died. In the opinion of specialists the serious  situation will last into January, and it will not be normalized  completely for another 2-4 years.    Aleksey Moskvichev communicated that anti-diphtheria serum  producers were given help in increasing their production of the  preparation back in August. But the preparation cycle lasts half  a year, and there's no time to wait. Consequently the Ministry  of Health opted for major purchases for hard currency: Thirty  thousand vials of serum were purchased abroad, and they will be  placed at the disposal of public health agencies within a week.  Doctors will receive a second such lot before 1 January 1994.</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN IS SAFE AFTER KIDNAPING ORDEAL, POLICE SAY  </P> <P> A Walnut Creek woman who disappeared almost four weeks ago on her way to see a  film in Berkeley was found safe Monday in Utah, the FBI said.  </P> <P> Donna Oh, 35, a nurse and mother of two daughters, was to return home by plane  Monday night, accompanied by FBI agents, after she was released from Latter Day  Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City, Berkeley Police Lt. William Pittman said.  </P> <P> "I couldn't be happier. This is going to be the best Christmas ever," said Lisa  Fernandes, Oh's 19-year-old daughter, who assisted in a search for her mother  after she disappeared Nov. 2. Police called the family at 4:30 p.m. Monday to  say that Oh had been rescued and was in good condition, Fernandes said.  </P> <P> Police told the family Oh was kidnaped, but they asked relatives not discuss  details, Fernandes said.  </P> <P> Oh disappeared shortly after calling Fernandes and her other daughter, Aimee  Okniewski, 12, to say that her car had stalled near the UC Berkeley campus.  Oh's keys were found in the ignition of her Volkswagen, parked near the Pacific  Film Archive, where the single mother was to attend a film as a junior college  class assignment.  </P></p>

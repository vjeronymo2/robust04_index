			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Zurich and Vienna both hit new lows for year As bourses waited apprehen-sively for the US Federal Reserve to act on interest rates, yesterday was agonising for those of them, such as Zurich and Vienna, which are deeply influenced by attitudes to defensive stocks, writes Our Markets Staff. Both Swiss and Austrian equities hit new lows. The Zurich market held out until early February against the prospect of lower US interest rates, said Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, and even enjoyed a 'bubble' in financial stocks early this year. Since then, Germany, strong in cyclicals, has taken over the running and the Swiss correction has been savage: 'from bubble to rubble in three months,' said Mr Bell. ZURICH saw heavy selling in Roche and growing worries about the weak dollar and the soft domestic bond market as the SMI index dropped 71.9, or 2.7 per cent, to 2,569.5, down 19.5 per cent from its January 31 closing high. Roche certificates fell SFr150 to SFr6,300, while the bearers dropped SFr500 to SFr12,100. Mr Frederick Hasslauer, at Bank Sal Oppenheim, said today's press conference and next week's analysts meeting would allow the company to justify the price it has paid for the Syntex acquisition in the US. Meanwhile, the takeover has been presented as defensive and this, in itself, has cast doubt on Roche's long term growth potential. Turnover was said to be high, close to Friday's near SFr2bn level. Representing dollar stocks, Nestle dropped SFr45, or 4 per cent, to SFr1,085; in financials, CS Holding finished SFr26, or 4.45 per cent, weaker at SFr558. VIENNA also saw heavy volume, and weakness in utilities, financials and construction stocks as the ATX index dropped 22.35 to 1,053.6. Mr Frank Jonuschat at James Capel noted pressure on EVN and Verbund in utilities, the former dropping Sch48, or 3.6 per cent, to Sch1,300; domestic brokers said that investors were making room for next week's VA Tech flo-tation. FRANKFURT lost a relatively modest 0.8 per cent, the Dax index closing 18.14 lower on the session at 2,218.88, holding its ground in the post bourse in spite of the morning decline on Wall Street. Turnover fell again, from DM7.1bn to DM6bn, and traders detected no great pressure to sell. Daimler consolidated Friday's post-bourse drop on DVFA losses of DM70 a share for 1993, losing DM12.50 at DM879; and profit-taking in the engineering sector saw Deutsche Babcock, amid a list of declines, DM3.20 lower at DM259.80. PARIS managed to pick up some of the ground lost early in the day, but the CAC-40 index still closed the session with a loss of 18.80 to 2,139.42. The market has continued to disappoint analysts, with a comment recently from Kleinwort Benson being typical. The investment bankers, recommending an underweight position within a European portfolio, noted that while the outlook for corporate earnings remained good and was improving, momentum had been stalled by the large number of rights issues and privatisations, both completed and forthcoming. Euro Disney featured among the active issues, hitting a 1994 low of FFr29.75 at one stage before closing off FFr1.65 at FFr30.00 as investors awaited details of the capital increase. AMSTERDAM weakened as the market kept its attention focused on a possible interest rate rise in the US. The AEX index shed 5.32 or 1.3 per cent to 406.03, slightly above the session low. Among the day's news items, Ahold put on 10 cents to Fl 47.00 as the retailer reported a rise in sales over the first four months of the year. KLM was another of the day's risers, improving by 50 cents to Fl 52.50 on reports, later denied, that co-operation talks with Swissair might be reopened. Unilever declined in line with the trend, finishing off Fl 4.50 at Fl 199.70: the multinational is due to report first quarter results later in the week. Profit-taking was also evident among some recent strong performers such as DSM, off Fl 4.80 at Fl 138.70. MILAN continued to wait for the formation of the new government and turnover was reported as moderate. The Comit index advanced 5.43 to 806.37. The insurance sector moved ahead with some investors seen switching out of recently strong areas, such as industrials and finance. Generali, for instance, added L1,850 to L47,950, following its announcement last Friday that it was to lift its ordinary dividend. Fondiaria put on L340 to L17,550 amid continued speculation that Generali might be planning to strengthen its ties. MADRID fell again but it was almost a relief, in the afternoon, for the market to be concerned as much with weakness on Wall Street as with Spain's political woes. The general index closed 3.81 lower at 314.41 in turnover of Pta15.1bn. Banks, utilities and communications all suffered with BBV down Pta80 at Pta3,110, Iberdrola Pta17 lower at Pta925 and Telefonica Pta50 lower at Pta1,725.  ----------------------------------------------------------------              FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------- May 9                                     THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open      10.30      11.00      12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1441.86    1439.44    1438.84    1440.66 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1455.41    1453.92    1453.59    1455.64  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly Changes           13.00      14.00      15.00      Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1441.43    1440.40    1438.77    1437.30 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1455.71    1454.73    1453.05    1452.04  ----------------------------------------------------------------                        May 6     May 5     May 4     May 3   Apr 29  ---------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100  1450.63   1449.10   1447.68   1466.35   1462.82 FT-SE Eurotrack 200  1465.18   1466.74   1458.96   1473.07   1476.09  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Base 1000 (26/10/90); High/day: 100-1442.93 ; 200-1456.08 Low/day: 100-1437.23  200-1450.12  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Written and edited by William Cochrane and John Pitt</p>

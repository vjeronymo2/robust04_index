			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Observer: By the book Fancy an overseas acquisition? Take note of the following cautionary tale from a seasoned non-executive director, who prefers to remain anonymous. Having bought a company in a fast-growing market in some sunny place, don't be surprised if the business soon develops teething troubles. First sign of trouble is when head office has to send someone from 'production' to see what's wrong in the newly acquired factory. The second sign all is not well is when young Jones, and a couple of his hot-shot MBAs from marketing, have to be seconded for a six-month stint to 'sort out sales' in the underperforming subsidiary. When the business still doesn't pick up, the internal auditors are sent for. Final step is to call in the liquidators and sue the original vendor. Sound familiar?</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Citrus Administrative Committee (committee) met November 16, 1993, and unanimously recommended this action. The committee meets prior to and during each season to review the rules and regulations effective on a continuous basis for citrus fruit regulated under the order. Committee meetings are open to the public, and interested persons may express their views at these meetings. The Department reviews committee recommendations and information, as well as information from other sources, and determines whether modification, suspension, or termination of the rules and regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 905.140 (7 CFR 905.140) provides the terms and conditions under which handlers can ship fruit in gift packages exempt from handling regulations in effect under &sect;&sect;905.52 and 905.53 of the order. Certain gift fruit packages are exempted from such regulations, since they contain fruit of mixed varieties and non-fruit items, and thus, would not meet the grade and size requirements of the handling regulations. Prior to the effective date of the interim rule (58 FR 65538, December 15, 1993), handlers could only ship one or two gift packages per day exempt from such regulations, depending on the circumstances, to individuals and distributors. The interim final rule increased the number of gift packages of fruit which handlers can ship under this exemption provision, enabling handlers to ship an unlimited number of packages of gift fruit to individuals and distributors, provided certain safeguards are met by the handler of the fruit. These safeguards specify that each gift package must be individually addressed to the person using the fruit, and that gift packages shipped to any gift fruit distributor must either be individually addressed or marked ``not for resale''.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The interim final rule was effective on December 9, 1993, and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 65538, December 15, 1993). The interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period ending January 14, 1994, and no comments were received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule reflects the committee's and the Department's appraisal of the need to relax the exemption provisions for gift fruit shipments as specified. Such relaxation will enable handlers to ship more packages of gift fruit to meet consumer needs, exempt from grade and size requirements issued under the order. This action is in the interest of producers, handlers, distributors, and consumers, and is expected to increase returns to Florida citrus fruit growers. The Department's view is that this action will have a beneficial impact on Florida citrus fruit producers and handlers, since it will permit the industry to make additional gift fruit available to meet consumer needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant matter presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committee, and other information, it is found that the relaxation as set forth below will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 905  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grapefruit, Marketing agreements, Oranges, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Tangelos, Tangerines. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR part 905 is amended as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 905_ORANGES, GRAPEFRUIT, TANGERINES, AND TANGELOS GROWN IN FLORIDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

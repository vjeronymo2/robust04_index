The unplanned Ukrainian electric energy imports, which  started in November after the energy supply situation within  Ukraine became critical, "caused economic damage to consumers  belonging to the system", Tombor told the VILAGGAZDASAG economic  daily.    Electricity suppliers in the Czech Republic, Slovakia,  Poland, Romania, Hungary and the eastern part of Germany set a  January 21 deadline for Ukraine to return the extra energy,  drawn after these states' grids were separated from the Russian  and Ukraine-Bulgarian electricity grids in November.    Hungary supplied a quarter of the extra energy to Ukraine  but  practically all other central European states were affected by  the unplanned draws, which caused "considerable frequency  fluctuation" in the Centrel system, Tombor said. He added  however that Hungary had not had to introduce any consumption  restrictions due to the extra Ukrainian consumption, but  electric appliances here slowed down and were overstrained.    Currently, only a 400- and a 200-kilovolt electric conductor  is in use between Hungary and Ukraine after the main  750-kilovolt line went out of use in November. The central grid  is to be reconnected with the Russian and Ukrainian electricity  grids after mid-May, he said.</p>

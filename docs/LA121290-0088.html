			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> PLANNERS TO WEIGH MOBILE HOME PLAN  </P> <P> The Laguna Beach Planning Commission will consider a proposed ordinance tonight  that would offer a broad protection package for mobile home owners forced to  move when a park closes.  </P> <P> The ordinance would require landowners who wish to convert a mobile park to  another use to either buy the mobile homes at fair market value or pay to  relocate homeowners to a comparable coastal park in Laguna Beach. Relocation  costs would include moving expenses, first and last months' rent at a new park  and the difference in rent between the two parks for a year, if the second park  is more expensive.  </P> <P> If ultimately approved by the City Council, the ordinance would be one of the  most comprehensive mobile home relocation plans in the state, said Kathryn  Lottes, Planning Department assistant director.  </P> <P> K.P. Rice, president of the homeowners association at the Treasure Island  mobile home park, said: "Fundamentally, what the relocation ordinance does for  us is it pays us if they take our homes away."  </P> <P> But an attorney for the owners of Treasure Island, the city's largest such  park, called the ordinance "absurd" and said it will "almost certainly lead to  litigation" if approved by the City Council.  </P> <P> In particular, Charles Black objected to a provision that says the price of a  mobile home would be based on its value in the current setting. Such a  provision can significantly boost the value of homes in oceanfront parks.  </P> <P> "The tenants don't own the property; they own the coach," Black said. "By  virtue of this ordinance, we think the city is attempting to transfer a  significant portion of the value of the property, which my clients purchased,  to the tenants."  </P> <P> Treasure Island residents have locked horns for more than a year with the park  owners, Merrill Lynch Hubbard, an investment unit, and Costa Mesa businessman  Richard Hall, who plan eventually to redevelop the land. The homeowners say  they hope someday to buy the property.  </P> <P> The park was purchased in August, 1989, for $43 million. Rice said residents  estimate that the total value of the homes at the current location would range  from $25 million to $50 million.  </P> <P> The ordinance also addresses the impact that park closures would have on the  community's stock of affordable housing. Depending on whether the park is  converted for residential or other use, the park owner would have to provide  some "affordable units" on or off the site.  </P> <P> Should the commission endorse the plan tonight, it will most likely be  presented to the City Council in January, Lottes said.

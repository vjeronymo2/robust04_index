This is the result of a  representative poll by the Allensbach Public Opinion Research  Institute. Nevertheless, given a choice between Chancellor  Helmut Kohl (Christian Democratic Union) and Rudolf Scharping,  his challengers from the Social Democratic Party of Germany, 63  percent would choose Kohl and only 23 percent Scharping.    More than two-thirds (68 percent) of those polled demand  from  the Federal Government "massive support" for German exports.  "Not as the chief seller. But we want more political support  as chief establisher of contacts," Tyll Necker, president of the  Federation of German Industry (BDI), said yesterday at the  presentation of the "elite panel" ordered by the economic  magazine CAPITAL.    "The government is to reestablish equal starting  opportunities in international competition," Necker said in an  interview with DIE WELT. An essential part of the economic  problems are homemade because of the cost crisis, the excessive  regulations, and the skepticism concerning technology: "The  others have become better and we have become more expensive."    Six of 10 of the 650 polled managers are, however, also of  the view that the Germans are "too naive and clumsy" in foreign  business. A total of 52 percent of the German managers think  that Germany has fallen back in technology.    Germany's economic prospects are assessed largely  positively:  42 percent (40 percent in September 1993) in the old laender  and 39 percent (30) in the new laender expect the economic  development to recover.    In the view of 66 percent of the managers, the FRG will play  a greater role in international politics in the future. A total  of 78 percent of those polled think that "fear of a stronger  Germany is unfounded." Good relations with the United States  (97 percent) and with France (95 percent) are cited as the two  most important foreign policy goals.    In an international comparison of salaries for 1993 the  German managers occupied first place with an average annual  gross income of 443,000 marks (including a percentage of annual  profits).</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                 In an effort to create a new legislature whose governing rules  work to President Boris Yeltsin's advantage, the Commission on  Legislative Proposals has been preparing draft rules of procedure  for the Federation Council and the State Duma.  One of the goals  of the rules for the Duma is to continue moving Russia toward a  multiparty system by strengthening the role of party factions and  improving party accountability.  In addition, the rules enhance  the role of legislative committees and seek to prevent the  emergence of a rival political figure like former Supreme Soviet  Chairman Ruslan .Khasbulatov by having a separate chairman with  limited functions for each chamber.  It is possible, however,  that the rules may work to the advantage of the factions that are  already more cohesive--particularly the Communist and Agrarian  Parties--rather than helping the more fractious reformers.                             END SUMMARY     Mikhail Mityukov, the Russia's Choice member heading the  Commission for Legislative Proposals established by presidential  edict on 26 September (ITAR-TASS), summed up the draft rules for  the State Duma with the formula: "a weak chairman and .  politically strong factions and professionally strong  parliamentary committees" (Izvestiya, 24 December 1993).  While  the draft rules for the Federation Council have already been  finalized, the rules for the Duma--the body most directly  responsible for drafting and adopting legislation--have  reportedly engendered more friction in discussions among legal  specialists, presidential administration and government  officials, and party representatives (ITAR-TASS, 15 December  1993).  Recognizing that the separate chambers will have to  approve the commission's drafts, Mityukov said that he expects  "fierce debates" because the rules are in effect a "small  constitution" governing the legislature (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18  December 1993).  He even predicted that the deputies will "do all  they can to overturn" many of the rules' provisions in an attempt  to "cast off their future fetters" (Izvestiya, 24 December 1993).     Strengthening Factions     In contrast to the rules for the old Supreme Soviet, which made  no mention of factions (Vedomosti Syezda Narodnykh Deputatov  RSFSR i Verkhovnogo Soveta RSFSR, No. 26, 29 November 1990), the  rules for the Duma prescribe an important role for them.  Factions are to have "precedence" in nominating candidates for  leadership positions, potentially giving factions strong  representation in committees and among the top three leadership  positions.  Through their representative on the Chamber  Conference--an executive body with functions similar to those of  the old Supreme Soviet Presidium (see note 1)--factions will have  a role in shaping the Duma's agenda (Segodnya, 17 December 1993;  Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 18 December 1993).  Factions are also to have  priority in introducing amendments to texts of laws and are  supposed to reach an agreed position on every issue before it  comes up for floor debate (Interfax, 15 November 1993),  potentially streamlining the amendment process that frequently  bogged down legislation in the Supreme Soviet.     (Note 1)  The Duma's Chamber Conference is to be composed of the  chairman, his two deputies, all committee chairmen, and the  leaders of the factions, though the latter are only to have a  "consultative vote."  Its functions include approving the agenda-  -with substantial input from the executive branch, according to  Mityukov (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 16 November 1993)--convening  extraordinary sessions of the Duma at the request of the  president, government, or individual faction, and directing draft  laws to the appropriate committees (Russian TV, 16 December 1993;  Izvestiya, 24 December 1993).     In addition, the rules uphold the notion of party accountability,  thus continuing the shift toward a strong multiparty system begun  with the proportional election of half the Duma deputies from  party lists.  According to media accounts of the rules, a deputy  elected from a party list must belong to the faction representing  that party and will be "committed to the faction's political  program and its decisions" (Segodnya, 17 December 1993).  In an  apparent effort to prevent deputies from changing their factional  allegiance, the draft rules reportedly give parties the right to  recall a party list deputy and replace him with another candidate  from the party's list, although these procedures may be  established in a separate, as yet incomplete, draft law on the  status of deputies (Segodnya, 7 December 1993; Izvestiya, 24  December 1993; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 28 December 1993).  The 225  deputies elected from territorial districts will apparently not  be subject to such party discipline and evidently can be recalled  only by a vote or petition from their local constituency  (Segodnya, 7 December 1993).     Indicating support from reformers for efforts to obligate  deputies to uphold their faction's position--and possibly to  impose discipline on disunited reformers--the pro-government  Russia's Choice faction is reportedly considering its own  proposals on voting by party faction that go even further than  the Commission's draft, though it is unclear whether these  proposals would apply to all deputies or only to those in  Russia's Choice.  The faction has reportedly set up its own  commission to work out rules of conduct for factions (Kommersant-  Daily, 25 December 1993) but, characteristically, is divided over  two competing drafts.  The more stringent one advocated by Boris  Zolotukhin--who was a deputy chairman of the Commission for  Legislative Proposals until his recent resignation (Nezavisimaya  Gazeta, 29 December 1993)--prescribes "unanimous voting by the  entire faction."  The alternative draft championed by bloc member  Vladimir Bokser would allow deputies to vote independently "on  routine matters" but would require a factional "solidarity vote"  on "especially important issues," though it is not clear how  "routine" and "important" issues would be defined.  According to  Kirill Ignatyev, a member of the Russia's Choice commission,  Zolotukhin's more restrictive document is the "main one"  (Kommersant-Daily, 25 December 1993).     Mixed Views of Rules on Factions     Reformers and traditionalists alike have praised the emphasis on  factions as a way of imposing discipline on the deputies:     --  Sergey Filatov, head of the Presidential Administration, has  said that the rules on factions will make factions more  "meaningful" and claimed that factional discipline will bring  about "predictability . . . so that we know exactly what to  expect when parliament convenes" (Russian TV, 23 December 1993).     --  Aleksey Surkov, secretary of the Presidential  Administration's Control and Oversight Council, has said that as  a result of factional discipline, a "larger number of deputies  will uphold not local but all-Russia interests" (Rossiyskiye  Vesti, 10 December 1993).     --  Viktor Zorkaltsev, deputy chairman of the Communist Party  Central Executive Committee, has said that the rules "contain  plenty of sensible, correct elements," though it is not clear  whether he was referring specifically to the rules on factions.  He indicated, however, that, whatever the rules, the Communist  faction will "submit to party discipline and will be strictly  controlled by the leadership" (Izvestiya, 18 December 1993).     Other specialists have evinced concern that the Duma's rules will  undermine the independence of deputies, an issue that could be of  special concern to unaffiliated deputies elected from single-seat  constituencies.  Experienced legislator Viktor Sheynis, a  reformist elected to the Duma from the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin  bloc who is also a deputy chairman of the Commission for  Legislative Proposals, has said that the rules' emphasis on  factions undermines the "rights of deputies" not in factions  (Segodnya, 17 December 1993).  He has stated that a deputy should  be "entitled" to switch factional allegiance, but he also  concedes the need for factions to be able to expel deputies,  though he argues that "this should not be done lightly"  (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 4 January).  Vladimir Tumanov, a specialist  at the Russian Academy of Sciences Institute of State and Law,  has expressed stronger objections to the proposed rule allowing  parties to expel faction members, saying this procedure violates  ''one of the basic principles of parliamentarianism--the deputy's  independence" (Izvestiya, 20 October 1993).  As if recognizing  the advantages of factional membership, even the "independent"  deputies elected from single-seat constituencies have formed  their own faction (Interfax, 26 December 1993), though it is  questionable how unified this group will be.     Limited Role for Chambers' Chairmen     One of the most obvious aims of the new rules for the Duma and  the Federation Council is to prevent the emergence of a strong  legislative rival to Yeltsin.   Each chamber is to have its own  chairman, and the two chambers have distinct functions that make  them largely "autonomous" (Izvestiya, 24 December 1993).  While  the old Supreme Soviet was formally divided into the Council of  the Republic and the Council of Nationalities, the two chambers  met jointly once a week and had essentially the same functions.  In an apparent effort by Yeltsin to keep the new assembly's  chambers divided, the Duma and the Federation Council are to  convene in different locations, as stipulated by Yeltsin's  controversial edict transferring the White House, location of the  former Supreme Soviet, to the Government and ordering the  Federation Council to meet in the Russian Press House and the  Duma to meet in the Moscow City Hall building (ITAR-TASS, 2  December 1993).  Although the eight party factions, including  Russia's Choice, have appealed this edict, First Deputy Premier  Vladimir Shumeyko indicated that Yeltsin does not intend to  reverse it, and on 3 January the Government began moving into its  new premises (RIA, 29 December 1993; ITAR-TASS, 3 January).     The rules for the Federation Council and the Duma establish  checks on any possible regional or political biases of the  chairman.  The chairman of the Federation Council must be  nominated by at least 15 members of the chamber, and he is to be  elected for only one year, thus reducing the possibility of the  chairman creating his own cabal.  To limit the chances that the  leadership of the Federation Council, which is composed of two  representatives from each of the Russian Federation components,  will represent parochial interests too strongly, the rules  stipulate that the chairman cannot be from the same region as any  of his deputies.  Finally, the three deputy chairman positions  are to be filled by one deputy to represent the ethnic republics,  one for the krays and oblasts, and one for the autonomous  entities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg (Segodnya, 7  December 1993).  In the Duma, the chairman and his two deputies  must belong to different factions (Izvestiya, 24 December 1993);  it is not clear whether there will be a term limit on the Duma  chairman.     Additional restrictions on the Federation Council and the Duma  chairmen indicate the administration's efforts to limit their  influence over the proceedings and the deputies personally--areas  where Khasbulatov wielded especially effective control.  The  finalized rules for the Federation Council stipulate that the  chairman is not to have any special role in determining the  agenda except on two issues:  elections to fill a vacant deputy  chairman position and to fill vacancies on the chamber's  committees (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 28 December 1993).  Moreover,  while the old rules gave the Supreme Soviet chairman--and all  members of the Presidium--the right to take the floor at any time  during debates (Vedomosti Syezda Narodnykh Deputatov RSFSR i  Verkhovnogo Soveta RSFSR, No. 26, 29 November 1990), the new  rules apparently remove this advantage.  According to Mityukov,  the Duma chairman's role "will be reduced only to the chairing of  sessions" (ITAR-TASS, 15 December 1993).  To prevent what  Izvestiya called Khasbulatov's "manipulation of the deputies" (24  December 1993), a special Committee for the Internal Organization  of the State Duma (the Federation Council is to have a parallel  committee), rather than the speaker, will be responsible for  choosing which deputies go abroad on parliamentary delegations  and for allocating material perks (Radio Rossii, 16 November  1993; Izvestiya, 24 December 1993).  Despite these apparent  restrictions, the factions represented in the Duma have been  jockeying intensely to fill the speaker position with one of  their own members or a member of a sympathetic faction (see box).     Increased Role for Committees     The rules aim to streamline the legislative committees and ensure  that their composition is politically balanced.  In contrast to  the old Supreme Soviet, which had 19 joint committees of the  Council of the Republic and the Council of Nationalities and an  additional nine separate commissions (Vladimir Pribylovskiy,  Politicheskiye Fraktsii i Deputatskiye Gruppy. Moscow, Panorama,  May 1992), the Federation Council is to have only eight  committees, and though the number of committees for the Duma is  to be somewhat flexible, Mityukov has said that he wants no more  than 14 committees with "no less" than 25 deputies in each (ITAR-  TASS, 1 December 1993; Izvestiya, 24 December 1993).  Moreover,  the chairman and deputy chairman of a committee must belong to  different factions, or, in the Federation Council, come from  different regions (ITAR-TASS, 1 December 1993; Segodnya, 7  December 1993).  In keeping with Yeltsin's efforts to keep the  two chambers separate, there will be no joint committees except  in specific cases where joint "conciliatory commissions" are  needed to resolve differences over legislation (ITAR-TASS, 1  December 1993).  Temporary commissions may apparently also be  established for special purposes, and the Communist Party has  already called for establishing parliamentary commissions to  investigate the October 3-4 violence as well as the December 1991  Belovezhskaya Pushcha agreement on the formation of the CIS  (Sovetskaya Rossiya, 28 December 1993).     Comments by Mityukov and Filatov indicate that they are  attempting to elevate the status of committees by shifting the  bulk of legislative work to them.  Although the Supreme Soviet  rules were amended to enhance committee functions (Rossiyskaya  Gazeta, 25 July 1992), the new rules apparently make committees  responsible not only for drafting legislation but also for  holding preliminary debate on bills (Izvestiya, 24 December  1993), making it likely that bills will stay in committee longer.  By shifting the focus of legislative work to the committees,  Mityukov expects to avoid turning "parliamentary sessions into an  endless discussion of numerous amendments," as happened in the  Supreme Soviet (ITAR-TASS, 16 December 1993).  In view of this  heightened role for committees, Filatov has predicted that  factions will fight for representation on committees more than  for the Duma chairman's post "because these are the key posts at  present" (Russian TV, 23 December 1993), although so far the  faction negotiations for nominating a chairman have been very  contentious.     Beyond the Rules     Besides trying to make the new Federal Assembly more manageable  than the old Supreme Soviet, the Yeltsin Administration may also  be attempting to gain permanent influence over the Assembly  through the structure of its apparatus.  In early October Yeltsin  appointed Vladimir Podoprigora--a reformist deputy from the old  Supreme Soviet who was originally a candidate to the Duma on the  Russia's Choice list but was elected to the Federation Council  from the Udmurt Republic (Rossiyskaya Gazeta, 12 November 1993,  28 December 1993)--as chief of staff for the Federal Assembly  (ITAR-TASS, 8 October 1993).  In this capacity, Podoprigora  oversees an array of functions, including registering  parliamentary documents, maintaining the electronic voting  systems, running a parliamentary library, a printing and  editorial department, and a press service (Rossiyskiye Vesti, 27  November 1993; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 31 December 1993).  According  to one critic, "independent expert" M. Speranskiy, the apparatus-  -which provides support for both chambers, despite their being  autonomous in almost every other respect--is woefully  understaffed (537 employees as opposed to the 1,350 employees of  the old Supreme Soviet, according to the 5 January Rossiyskaya  Gazeta) in a deliberate ploy to deny needed legal research  support to deputies.  Moreover, as Speranskiy noted, Podoprigora  oversees the staffs for the two chambers, but it is not clear "to  whom the chief of staff is subordinated" (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 31  December 1993), though for the moment that would appear to be  Yeltsin.  It is also unclear whether Podoprigora will retain this  post after the Federal Assembly convenes or if it will choose its  own chief of staff.     Outlook     The draft rules clearly represent an attempt to make a distinct  break with the old Supreme Soviet, particularly the effort to  reduce the influence of the chambers' chairmen.  However,  restricting the chairmen's functions may simply shift some  potential levers of influence to new bodies, such as the Chamber  Conference or the Committee for the Internal Organization of the  State Duma (or its Federation Council counterpart).  In addition,  the effort to strengthen parties by mandating party discipline  and giving party factions a prominent, formalized role in the  administration of the Duma and in the legislative process may  redound more to the benefit of those, usually traditionalist,  factions that are already relatively cohesive rather than having  the intended effect of strengthening the more fractious factions,  usually the more reform-oriented ones.  Whatever the final rules  are, the Federal Assembly is likely to pose a challenge to  Yeltsin's reform efforts.     (begin box)       Box:  Factions Battle It Out for Duma Chairmanship     In the first display of the important role factions will play in  the Duma's decisionmaking, the eight party factions have been  negotiating in earnest over the nomination of candidates for the  Duma chairman.  The process formally began on 24 December, when  Presidential Administration chief Sergey Filatov chaired an  organizing conference of representatives of all eight factions  for the first session of the Duma.  According to Nezavisimaya  Gazeta (28 December 1993), the conference was held in a  "constructive spirit" and reached an agreement "in principle"  that the candidate would not be from any of the four large  factions--Russia's Choice, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), and the  Agrarian Party.  The newspaper hinted that Women of Russia  chairman Alevtina Fedulova or Ambassador to the United States  Vladimir Lukin--elected to the Duma from the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-  Lukin bloc--were leading choices.  However, reports of Lukin's  candidacy appear contradicted by other reports that fellow bloc  member and First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoliy Adamishin may  be a compromise choice (Radio Rossii, 29 December 1993; Interfax,  30 December 1993).     Despite the reports of agreement at the opening negotiating  session, subsequent talks among the four largest factions appear  to have reduced the prospects for a consensus on a small party  candidate.  According to Russia's Choice member Arkadiy Murashev,  during talks among the "Big Four," Russia's Choice was "in a  minority" in advocating that the speaker should represent one of  the smaller factions.  He claimed that the LDP, CPRF, and the  Agrarian Party had agreed on the candidacy of Agrarian member  Ivan Rybkin--.apparently only after Russia's Choice had objected  to the nomination of Yeltsin foe Vladimir Isakov (Interfax, 28  December .1993; Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 30 December 1993).  Agrarian  leader Mikhail Lapshin confirmed that an agreement had been  reached to choose a speaker from one of the large factions,  although the factions are reportedly considering nominating  representatives of the smaller factions for the two deputy  positions (Nezavisimaya Gazeta, 30 December 1993; Moscow radio, 5  January).  Even so, subsequent meetings of the "Big Four" have  repeatedly failed to come up with a consensus candidate, although  Rybkin still appears to be a serious contender (Krasnaya Zvezda,  Segodnya, 5 January).     In response to the apparent backroom dealing of the "Big Four,"  Deputy Premier and Party of Russian Unity and Accord leader  Sergey Shakhray, who made no secret of his aspirations for the  chairman's post (Interfax, 17 December 1993), has angrily termed  their negotiations an "unprincipled deal."  He has argued that  the faction negotiations for speaker "infringe on the rights of  deputies who are not members of the four parties," further  pointing out that only half the deputies were elected on party  lists (Interfax, 31 December 1993).  With the apparent backing of  the group of unaffiliated deputies, Shakhray has proposed that  one of the deputy chairman positions be filled by a faction  representative and one by a deputy elected from a single-seat  constituency (ITAR-TASS, 5 January).     Faced with the prospect of losing the nomination of chairman to  the opposition, reformers are apparently hoping to minimize their  losses by.altering the election process itself.  While the draft  rules stipulate that the Duma chairman is to be elected by a  simple majority vote on a secret ballot (Russian TV, 16 December  1993), the fact that the draft has not yet been finalized--or  formally adopted--has apparently left Yeltsin sympathizers some  room for maneuver on the voting procedures through an "interim  version" of the rules, which is reportedly to be ready by the  Duma's opening session on 11 January (ITAR-TASS, 4 January).  Viktor Sheynis, who in addition to his work on the Commission for  Legislative Proposals also heads a commission responsible for  drawing up the Duma's agenda and forming its working bodies, has  outlined three alternative scenarios for voting on the Duma's  leadership positions.  The first, "traditional," variant provides  for separate votes on the chairman, the two deputy chairmen, and  the committee chairmen.  The second alternative, or "small  package," would require a simultaneous vote on the chairman and  his two deputies, possibly in the hope that this move would  prevent the LDP, CPRF, and Agrarian Party from holding the top  three positions.  Sheynis termed the final alternative, or "large  package," the "most difficult one," presumably because it would  call for a simultaneous vote on the chairman and his deputies as  well as all committee chairmen.  He argued that if this last  procedure is adopted, the Duma could "get down quickly to  legislative work" (ITAR-TASS, 4 January).     (end box)     AUTHOR: O'CONNELL.

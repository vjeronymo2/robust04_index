			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "responsible military source" at the Defense </F> Ministry and the General Staff Command on 8 May -- read by  announcer]    [Text] In the last moments of the defeat of the suicidal  forces of apostasy and secession and as a crazy expression of  the hysteria of death and annihilation, the criminal forces  fired a number of Scud missiles at Sanaa and areas of the Sanaa  Governorate at 2310 [2010 GMT] yesterday, Saturday, targeting  secure citizens and vital and strategic civilian installations.  However, thanks to God, this fierce offensive of more than five  missiles failed to inflict any losses; it only terrorized  citizens in the areas where they landed.    In a related development, the military source stressed that  the decision made by the dismissed Haytham Qasim Tahir in the  name of the defense minister declaring a general mobilization  and calling up the reserves is considered baseless and  illegitimate because it was issued by someone who has lost every  military and official authority. It is a decision that  expresses adherence to the delusion of survival. It has been  proven practically that his end as well as the end of all  secessionist forces rebelling against the Constitutional  legitimacy has approached and is, God willing, imminent. We are  confident that those who deceived the officers, noncommissioned  officers, and soldiers in our Armed Forces' units, over which  they hold sway and which they sent to death, will not be able to  mobilize civilians and those helped by circumstances to remain  outside the military service. They survived and were [word  indistinct] the savage plotting ordeal and were confident they  will be away from it.    O Sons of our Armed Forces -- officers, noncommissioned  officers, and soldiers of the military units under the pressure  of the rebelling elements in the secessionist leaderships of the  Socialist Party: We address this appeal to you and ask you not  to obey the orders of the rebelling gangs among the adventurous  and hegemonistic leaderships of the Socialist Party. We address  to you a sincere brotherly appeal to join the forces defending  unity and Constitutional legitimacy, which are the forces of all  the people, and not the forces of a gang or party. In the same  manner as they protected the people's gains and accomplishments,  these forces are today very heroically, efficiently, and capably  working to rid you of the domination and hegemony of the gangs  of apostasy, secession and adventurism among the secessionist  military gangs. We make the pledge of the free and loyal to you  that you will find every concern to secure your life, preserve  your dignity, and restore your military honor. The stand of the  legitimate and Constitutional leadership, which is defending  unity, along with the officers and soldiers of the 3d Brigade in  'Imran, is sufficient evidence and cogent proof of the integrity  and sincerity of the legitimate leadership in which we, as well  as all Yemeni people, confide and consider their legitimate  representative and the protector of all the Yemeni people's  interests.    O sons of the Armed forces -- soldiers, noncommissioned  officers, and officers of the units under the control of the  military gangs in the Socialist Party: We demand that you not  throw yourselves into the pit of an unfeasible bloody  confrontation or suffer by standing with those outlawed gangs  that broke away from law, Constitutional legitimacy, and unity.  Let us say enough of fighting, suicide, destruction, and  bloodshed. We call on you to join the ranks of Constitutional  legitimacy. You will receive all care and attention from a  loving and compassionate brother. This is a guarantee and a  free promise in the name of the people and before Arab and world  public.</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW HUNGARY REPUBLIC FULFILLS THE DREAM OF '56 FREEDOM FIGHTERS;  </P> <P> EAST EUROPE: HUNGARIANS WERE CLOSER THAN THEY REALIZED TO ATTAINING FREEDOM  FROM SOVIET RULE, WHEN EVENTS DOOMED THEM TO FAILURE IN 1956.  </P> <P> On Oct. 23, church bells rang throughout Hungary to commemorate the anniversary  of the 1956 uprising against Soviet rule, and tens of thousands of Hungarians  cheered as Matyas Szuros, the acting president, announced the nation would  henceforth be the Hungarian Republic, no longer the Socialist People's  Republic. Zuros said: "The Hungarian Republic is going to be an independent,  democratic and legal state." He said the new Hungary would reflect the spirit  of the 1956 "National Independence Movement."  </P> <P> This is thrilling news, but most especially for those who closely followed  Hungarian events in 1956 -- as I did, professionally. The Hungarian people are  now on the threshold of achieving peacefully what they almost achieved by that  rebellion. To better understand the astounding implication of these political  developments, it is worth looking at some details of the 1956 revolt not fully  reported at the time.  </P> <P> Nikita S. Khrushchev, after Josef Stalin's death, had become leader of the  Soviet Union. He proclaimed a relaxation of tensions and a thaw in police  control in Eastern Europe. Intellectuals, especially writers and students, were  the first to respond and, by late 1955, an influential anti-Stalinist movement  was at work -- most notably in Poland and Hungary.  </P> <P> Hungary's leader was Matyas Rakosi, the most brutal Stalinist tyrant in Eastern  Europe. He was famous for his "salami tactics" -- eliminating all dissenters  "slice by slice." At the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in  February, 1956, Khrushchev, in a secret speech, savagely exposed the crimes of  Stalin. The contents of the speech became known in the early summer, leading  Hungarian writers to attack Rakosi openly. He was soon removed and retired to  exile in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> His removal whetted the appetites of Hungarians, who increased their calls for  political and economic change. There was remarkable freedom in the press, with  articles exposing political corruption and harsh living conditions. But Rakosi  was replaced by Erno Gero, another Stalinist unresponsive to the intellectuals'  complaints. Gero's inaction inspired a growing demand for the return of Imre  Nagy, a popular communist reformer, who had once been premier.  </P> <P> On the morning of Oct. 23, 1956, university students put up posters throughout  Budapest, calling for Soviet troops to be withdrawn from Hungary, a new  government under Nagy, economic restructuring, freedom of speech and press and  restoration of the Hungarian Kossuth emblem (Louis Kossuth led the War of  Independence against the Austrian Hapsburgs in 1848-1849. The troops of Russian  Czar Nicholas I came to the rescue of the Austrians, and ultimately defeated  the Hungarians.)  </P> <P> At 3 p.m., a young student recited the national anthem to the cheering crowds.  The words came from a poem first read at the outbreak of the Revolution of  1848. At 8 o'clock that night, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered  at the Parliament to listen to a speech by Nagy, calling for a new government.  During the speech, shots were fired by police, loyal to Gero.  </P> <P> But the police could not disperse the crowds, some of whom marched to the huge  bronze statue of Stalin. With blow torches, they sent it crashing to the  ground. Sporadic fighting continued through the night. When Gero saw that the  police had lost control, he called for intervention by Soviet forces. Soon, the  students and writers were joined by armed factory workers, and then by units of  the Hungarian army.  </P> <P> Quickly, the news spread throughout Hungary. America's Radio Free Europe, based  in Munich, was broadcasting every scrap of news about the uprising. Manned by  Hungarian exiles who had current information about developments in Poland as  well as Hungary, the broadcasts, though heavily jammed, became the main source  of information for the Hungarian people. Partly because of the radio -- but  also because U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had proclaimed a goal  of liberation for Eastern Europe -- many Hungarians believed their rebellion  would be supported by the United States.  </P> <P> There was consternation in the Kremlin. The Soviet Politburo was called into  24-hour session. Although not reported at the time, Khrushchev was holding long  telephone conversations with Mao Tse-tung and Chou En-lai, the leaders of  China. In fact, a Chinese delegation, headed by Liu Shao-chi, was dispatched to  Moscow. After discussing the various possible courses of action, they agreed  not to use military force in Hungary. The Chinese went even further,  recommending the Soviet Union leave Hungary. Soviet Politburo members Anastas  Mikoyan and Mikhail A. Suslov were sent to Budapest with instructions to  negotiate an armistice with Nagy.  </P> <P> On Oct. 28, it was agreed that Soviet forces were to leave Hungary, and Nagy  would be recognized as prime minister, with Gen. Paul Maletar, commander of the  Hungarian armed forces, as defense minister. In the next 24 hours, Soviet  forces were withdrawn from Budapest, and one of the four Soviet divisions had  left Hungary. Nagy moved rapidly to form a multiparty government -- including  representatives of the old Democratic Socialist and Peasant parties. Nagy  proposed that Hungary be granted neutral status similar to Austria. He hoped  the Western powers would support this. Indeed, the U.S. government subsequently  learned that one reason the Soviets and Chinese considered it prudent for the  Red Army to withdraw from Hungary was because they expected the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization to support the freedom fighters.  </P> <P> During September, 1956, while our wives were vacationing, I shared a house with  two high ranking British diplomats, one the former senior aide to Prime  Minister Anthony Eden. Night after night, they talked with growing anger and  frustration about the intolerable behavior of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Egyptian  leader who had nationalized the Suez Canal. After all, the Suez Canal was more  important to Britain and other Europeans than the Panama Canal was to the  United States, but the United States, they felt, was showing insufficient  concern. Not until a month later did I understood the terrible implications of  this impasse.  </P> <P> For the Hungarian freedom fighters were struck down as a result of the actions  the British ultimately decided to take. On Oct. 30, using the Hungarian events  as cover, British, French and Israeli troops invaded Egypt in an attempt to  regain control of the Suez Canal. Eden had launched the invasion without  consulting the United States. Furthermore, the invasion came in the last days  of the U.S. election campaign between President Dwight D. Eisenhower and  </P> <P> Adlai E. Stevenson. Secretary of State Dulles was enraged at the allies'  deception -- especially because of the implications for Hungary.  </P> <P> The issue was immediately taken to the U.N. Security Council. Khrushchev had  announced that, unless the invading forces left Egypt, he was prepared to send  Soviet "volunteer" forces to assist Nasser. However, the Security Council  reached an unusual consensus: the United States and Canada, joined by the  Soviet Union and China, voted that the British, French and Israeli forces  should end the invasion at once. But the damage was done. While the world  spotlight was focused on the Middle East, Khrushchev ordered his troops back  into Hungary. On Nov. 4, massive Soviet tank units entered Budapest, and  crushed the rebellion, in a bloody battle.  </P> <P> The Hungarians fought fiercely, with more than 20,000 killed, and 150,000  wounded. Thousands of Soviets were killed as well, but they had broken the  resistance. During the next month, more than 200,000 Hungarians escaped to the  West. Nagy and Maletar were granted asylum in the Yugoslav Embassy, but were  later captured and executed. Last month, Nagy was reburied with honors as a  leader and patriot.  </P> <P> In 1956, the odds were probably against the Hungarians, even if there had not  been an invasion of Egypt. Khrushchev was an impulsive risk-taker, as revealed  by his confrontation with President John F. Kennedy over Berlin, and his  dispatch of medium-range nuclear missiles to Cuba. Yet if the United States,  Britain and France had been working together, instead of apart, in 1956, it is  possible to imagine a negotiated resolution, guaranteeing Hungarian neutrality  on the Austria model.  </P> <P> But that is not the way it was. In his book "Khrushchev Remembers" the Soviet  leader reports a conversation between some British and French diplomats with  their Soviet counterparts: "You seem to have some trouble on your hands in  Poland and Hungary. We're having some troubles of our own in Egypt. Let's have  a tacit understanding between us that you'll liquidate your difficulties by  whatever means you see fit, and you won't interfere while we do the same."  </P> <P> So the Hungarians' reach for freedom was snuffed out in both 1848 and 1956. Yet  now there is another surge of hope. The prospects are brighter than at any time  in Hungarian history. Last month, the Hungarian government and its Parliament  took action calculated to transform Hungarian society with a new constitution  that creates a multiparty system.  </P> <P> The people of Hungary will probably vote for a majority of independent  non-Communist representatives in the coming elections. There may be a coalition  government, with important representation from the new Socialist Party, and  Hungary probably will remain in the Warsaw Pact for a while -- but there will  be growing links to Western Europe, and, in time, Hungary will likely become  neutral between East and West, as Nagy proposed in 1956.  </P> <P> The dangers of 1956 no longer exist. In a speech in Helsinki, on Oct. 25,  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the Soviet Union has no moral or political  right to interfere in the affairs of its East European neighbors. He praised  neutral Finland, as a model of stability. The future of Eastern Europe is  inevitably linked with Gorbachev and his new thinkers. Thus, it is clearly in  U.S., Hungarian and Polish interests that they not fail.  </P></p>

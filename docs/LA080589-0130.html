			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MOCKETT LOSES BIG LEAD, MATCH IN U.S. AMATEUR  </P> <P> Teen-ager Brandie Burton rallied from four holes down on the front nine to win  1-up over Cathy Mockett, 21, of Newport Beach in a semifinal match of the U.S.  Women's Amateur golf championship Friday.  </P> <P> Burton, 17, of Rialto, will meet Vicki Goetze, 16, of Hull, Ga., in today's  final.  </P> <P> Goetze rolled in four birdies on her way to a 5-and-3 victory over former U.S.  Amateur champion Carol Semple Thompson, of Sewickley, Pa, who did not win a  hole.  </P> <P> The 36-hole final is a rematch of last week's U.S. Girls' Junior semifinal in  which Burton beat Goetze, 1-up, by making par on the last three holes.  </P> <P> Burton went on to win the championship, setting up a chance to become the first  player to win both events in the same year.  </P> <P> JoAnne Gunderson Carner came the closest to winning both titles. In 1956 she  won the Girls' Junior and finished second in the Women's Amateur.  </P> <P> Burton started the day by losing four of the first seven holes to Mockett  before knocking a three-iron within three feet and sinking the putt for an  eagle 3 on the eighth hole.  </P> <P> Burton pulled even with a birdie on the 15th and won with a 12-foot birdie putt  on the par-3 17th.  </P> <P> Ed Fiori shot a four-under-par 67 to take a two-stroke lead in the second round  of the Federal Express St. Jude golf tournament at Memphis, Tenn.  </P> <P> Fiori, who shot an opening-round 65, was at 10-under-par 132, two strokes in  front of Jim Gallagher, Bob Gilder and Billy Ray Brown.  </P> <P> Doug Tewell, who shot a course-record 63 Thursday, soared to a 75 and was six  shots behind Fiori.  </P> <P> Beth Daniel made long birdie putts on the final two holes for a 66 and a  one-stroke lead over Rosie Jones in the first round of the LPGA Greater  Washington Open at Bethesda, Md.  </P> <P> Daniel, winless on the LPGA tour since 1985, had five birdies, including a  45-foot putt on No. 17 and a 25-footer from off the fringe on the final hole.  </P> <P> Jones also had a bogey-free round over the 6,250-yard Bethesda Country Club  course.  </P> <P> Missy McGeorge was third after shooting a 68. Therese Hession birdied two of  the last three holes for a 69. Leading money-winner Betsy King shot a 70.  </P> <P> Despite a bogey on the 18th hole, Gene Littler shot a five-under-par 67 for the  first-round lead in the U.S. West Showdown Senior PGA Tour event at Jeremy  Ranch, Utah.  </P> <P> Dale Douglass and Lou Graham were tied for second place at 68.  </P></p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Arts: Lost demons of Mexico - Gerald Cadogan bemoans a missed opportunity MEXICO and Tibet, at the Hayward Gallery and the Royal Academy, are a startling contrast. Both are superb displays, and both set out to reveal art most of us know nothing of. But The Ancient Art of Mexico is a huge disappointment. I left angry and sad. The dramatically lit sculptures, with tongue-twister names and a powerful sense of forces ruling human lives that humans cannot control, are exciting works of art. And it was fun - if hardly news - to see them influencing Henry Moore. It was also interesting to learn that early this century in the Mexican Revolution people turned to these native demons when they rejected Spain and Christianity, settling the score with the conquistadors who had destroyed hundreds of pagan, temples and thousands of statues in 1521. This is the background to Graham Greene's The Power and the Glory. But at the Hayward these demons are completely without context. It is a long time since I have seen a show of works that really mattered for another country made to look so trivial by western dilettante complacency. The plaques and labels say almost nothing about the societies that made this art, and what it meant to them - which leaves it meaning nothing to us. Perhaps it is all in the catalogue, but that is expensive. It is in the exhibition we want to learn about the harsh regimes behind the art. How does the sculpture tie in with the ritual ball games played in 'ballcourts' when the fate of sacrifice awaited the losers? What did people eat? How advanced was their technology? What were ordinary houses like? And, most importantly for this show, what are the places that have produced these pieces? The result is inadequate. A dozen slides at the end, of stunning views admittedly, seem an afterthought. There should be lots of them at the beginning so that we see at once where we are and start to relate the art of Mexico to the land and people. The out of date, cavalier attitude behind this exhibition passed its Sell By date years ago, as a quick visit to the Museum of Mankind could have shown. Nowadays we cannot divorce art from country and society. If I were Mexican, I should be sorry to think how little of Mexico this show puts over, marvellous though the pieces are. But if I were Tibetan, I should be delighted. Wisdom and Compassion - The Sacred Art of Tibet starts straight off with the geography, and the people and their Buddhism. A film fills the gaps in the picture. The labels are packed with information, telling us what the hand gestures of Buddha mean, and about the different beings in the holy world of this quietist religion. All the Tibetan materials are identified. (I learnt that many of the statues are of gilt brass.) In Mexico, unless it is semi-precious stone for small objects, the labels just say 'stone' and not which stone. If they told us that, we could learn how the tribes favoured different stones, and traded in them, and the magical powers they had. In the most literal way that would tell us how the early Mexicans coped with their environment and made holy art from it.</p>

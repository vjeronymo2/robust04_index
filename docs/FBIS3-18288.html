			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikael Holmstrom: "EU Study Shows Unambiguous </F> Picture"]    [Text] Rejection of the European Union [EU] will lead to  less international influence for Sweden, a worsened security  situation, fewer opportunities for action in the Baltic Sea  region, increased vulnerability in times of unrest, and larger  defense burdens. Approval will bring almost nothing but  advantages.    That unambiguous picture is presented in the study entitled  "Historic Choice," which was submitted to Minister of Foreign  Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas on Thursday [28 January]. The study  is supposed to show the effect on foreign and security policy of  a decision to join or stay out of the EU.    The study's authors are Sverker Astrom and Leif Leifland  (cabinet secretaries in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from  1972 to 1977 and from 1977 to 1982 respectively).    "We have tried to write as objectively as possible," said  Leifland at the news conference. When questioned about the  unambiguous picture presented in the report, he answered that  "being unambiguous does not rule out objectivity."  <H5>  Fateful Choice Ahead </H5>   According to the study's authors, Sweden's 5 million  eligible  voters are facing a fateful choice. Looming up before the reader  are two choices: a secure Union offering opportunities or an  uncertain separateness offering difficulties.    The referendum will take place in an international  environment that has moved quickly from stable security-policy  tension to "unstable detente." Developments in and around Russia  are said to be the most important and most difficult-to-assess  factor affecting Sweden's situation.    "Sweden's entry into the EU and its participation in the  common foreign and security policy represents a historic choice  that will affect Sweden's position in Europe and the world  beyond the foreseeable future."    At the same time, it is emphasized that this does not mean  that Sweden will be relinquishing control of its own policies.  Astrom and Leifland said that the EU's foreign policy rides "the  same old hobbyhorses" as Sweden, making it both natural and  urgent to join. Membership in the EU will give Sweden more  opportunities for directly influencing matters in its immediate  vicinity, including relations with Russia.    "If the Nordic states express their opinion on the Baltic  states and the Baltic Sea, that will have a powerful effect  within the EU," Astrom pointed out.  <H5>  Changed World </H5>   He and Leifland said that the EU's plans for a future common  defense policy did not conflict with Sweden's current policy of  freedom from military alliances. The EU's cooperation on defense  policy is expected to cover the form and policy of the military  forces, defense doctrines, intelligence services,  communications, and equipment.    Sweden has spent billions of kronor in several of those  defense policy areas to produce a "Swedish profile," but now  international cooperation is consistent with freedom from  military alliances.    "The world around us has changed," Leifland explained.    On the other hand, the EU's ambition to establish a future  common defense force through which the countries will guarantee  each other's security within the Western European Union (WEU) --  and NATO -- is not consistent with today's freedom from  alliances. But Sweden can join the WEU as an observer.    But the Maastricht treaty does not prevent a state from  remaining free of military alliances (Ireland is an example),  although Sweden can also decide "freely and independently" at a  later stage whether it wants to join a common defense force.    According to the Maastricht treaty, states shall "actively  and unconditionally" support the common foreign and security  policy "in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity." But  Astrom and Leifland see no problems here in practice. Unanimous  decisions are required, and if there are to be joint operations,  the decisionmaking process guarantees the countries a double  veto.  <H5>  Less Distinct Profile in United Nations </H5>   "This means, then, that no member country can be forced  against its will to participate in a regional operation,  militarily or otherwise, in a foreign country. Obviously, it is  also true that no country can be forced to accept foreign troops  on its territory."    If Sweden is a member of the EU, its profile in the United  Nations will become less distinct. But Denmark's experience was  said to show that a medium-sized country that joins the EU does  not lose its old relations but gains a considerably larger  international hearing.    And most important of all: in times of unrest, Sweden can be  confident that its peacetime cooperation has established a  network of solidarity within the EU -- a kind of insurance  premium. This may mean that we will have to take a stand on  "risky situations," but the advantages outweigh the  disadvantages: It is a question of uniting states with common  interests and values.    "Even without formal defense obligations, membership in the  EU will be a net advantage for us -- a plus from the standpoint  of security policy."    On the other hand, rejection of the EU by the Swedish people  is seen as resulting in existence under the opposite sign:    "As an actor on the international stage, Sweden will be less  interesting and less important. Sweden's marginalization or  isolation will be almost unavoidable," said Astrom. Outside the  EU, Sweden will be unable to influence West Europe's decisions  affecting our own immediate vicinity and will miss out on the  "security policy plus" represented by membership in the EU.    Remaining outside the EU will also make our economy weaker  --  and at the same time we will have to maintain our defense  capability. The authors of the study discussed the question of  how Sweden's position outside the EU would be affected if  Finland joined the EU and the WEU and NATO as well.    All other alternatives to the EU (United Nations, CSCE, WEU,  NATO and its new cooperative organizations, the Council of  Europe, or Nordic cooperation) either provide no true security  or are politically impossible. The Riksdag's objective -- a "new  European security order" -- is nothing more than a dream for the  future.  <H5>  Arguing in a Circle </H5>   Nor is it possible to go back to our all-embracing  neutrality  policy, because the world has changed. Astrom, once the foremost  advocate of the neutrality policy, said that it "has a touch of  unreality."    In what was almost a circular argument, it was noted that  the  Riksdag and the government have been committed to EU membership  since 1991. If the people now say no, the result will be "a  degree of uncertainty regarding Sweden's position," since other  solutions have not been considered, and there is no agreement on  alternatives.    Lastly, a no vote will mean losing this historic chance to  get a reserved seat on the EU train. Meanwhile, the EU's foreign  and security policy will be further developed without Swedish  influence. If we change our minds later, the adjustment will be  harder, because then we will be fighting for space and influence  with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia,  Latvia, and Lithuania.    "It would be a little ironic if Sweden were to join the EU  under Albania's chairmanship," Astrom joked.  <H5>  Picture in Black and White </H5>   This study of the effects that joining or staying out of the  EU would have on foreign and security policy is one of six such  studies in preparation for the referendum.    The pluses if Sweden joins the EU:    1. Greater international influence.    2. Benefits from the standpoint of security policy.    3. We would retain control over our own foreign policy.    4. More opportunities to influence relations with the East.    The negatives if Sweden stays out of the EU:    1. Reduced international influence.    2. Security policy will have to be redefined: Freedom from  alliances will no longer suffice.    3. Less possibility of being active in the Baltic Sea area.    4. Increased defense burdens.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Help for elderly averts rebellion - Pensioners' aid The chancellor appeared to have averted the possibility of a backbench rebellion over VAT on fuel with the announcement of his compensation package for all pensioners irrespective of whether they are on income support. It was warmly welcomed by backbenchers concerned about the government's decision to press ahead with its plan to impose VAT on domestic fuel at 8 per cent in April and 17.5 per cent the following year. Sir John Hannam, secretary of the powerful 1922 backbench committee, expressed his relief that the chancellor had widened the compensation package to all pensioners. 'That was what people were really concerned about,' he said. His prediction there would be little trouble from backbenchers over the package was underlined by comments from some of the more independently minded Tory MPs with trenchant views on the subject. Mr Nicholas Winterton, (Macclesfield), said that while he would have preferred the government to have changed its decision to impose VAT on domestic fuel, he was nonetheless pleased with the compensation. 'It is rather better than expected since the chancellor has agreed to give assistance to pensioners who are not on income support,' he said. Mr Winston Churchill, (Davyhulme), said: 'The key thing is that the people who have saved over the years are going to get help with their fuel bills.' Ms Edwina Currie, (Derbyshire South), commended the chancellor for 'political astuteness' in widening the compensation to include all pensioners. Conservative backbenchers also welcomed the further special increases for poorer pensioners and the disabled. Criticism of the package was left to Mr John Smith, Labour leader, who said the compensation was 'not adequate' since pensioners would get only half the extra cost.</p>

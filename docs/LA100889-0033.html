			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABOUT THAT WORD  </P> <P> Would someone care to explain to the foreigners east of California Movieland's  eternal love affair with the F-word? We who have grown tired and bored with "F"  wonder why Hollywood is still so titillated by "F."  </P> <P> Recently, I overheard a man who was renting a movie video ask the clerk what  the "F" rating was. He claimed he found "F" annoying and that it destroyed his  enjoyment of a movie when he had to continually wade mentally though the "F's"  to catch the rest of the dialogue.  </P> <P> Add a rating . . . G, PG, PG-13, R, X, and "F" (thank you very much). Join the  real world and get bored with "F."  </P> <P> RON and VERA MARTINOFF  </P> <P> Kerville, Tex.  </P></p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Company News (This Week): Investors worry over high price of issue - Japan Telecom Japan's third largest telecommunications operator will be listed tomorrow on the second sections of the Tokyo and Osaka stock exchanges. The issue's high public offering price of Y4.7m (Pounds 30,616) per share is causing some anxiety among investors. Along with the other telecom operators, the company's earnings have been squeezed by rising price competition. Aggressive price-cutting in long distance rates has hurt JT's earnings as well as its competitors, DDI, listed last year, and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the former monopoly. Although sales were up last business year, pre-tax profits fell 18 per cent from a year earlier to Y16.2bn. Earnings before taxes for the current year are projected at Y16bn. DDI's listing last September attracted a large number of investors, boosting the stock price, but some analysts fear that may not be the case for JT. Unlike DDI, the company lacks money-making subsidiaries, and Tokyo Digital Phone, its affiliated cellular phone company, only began its operations earlier this year. The troubled Swiss telecoms equipment maker Ascom appears to be making a rapid recovery towards profitability after two years of hefty losses. A new management team will set out the group's prospects on Thursday.</p>

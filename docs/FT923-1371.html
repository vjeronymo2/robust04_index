			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / International Company News: SEB set to gain control of Gota SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading private commercial bank, is set to become owner of the Gota group, a holding company that owns the country's fourth-largest bank, Gota, and two smaller banks. Five years ago, SEB lent Skr1.1bn to Gota AB, the holding company, and in return acquired 100 per cent of the shares in Gota Bank as a security. On September 9, Gota Bank announced credit losses for this year would reach SKr8bn, double its previous estimate, adding that operating loss for 1992 would be SKr3bn to SKr4bn. Last week, Gota group suspended all payments to creditors because of funding problems after revealing liabilities of SKr3.5bn. In response, the Swedish government promised to guarantee Gota Bank's commitments to private individuals, companies and other creditors. But it added it would not guarantee the obligations of Gota, the holding company. It is now probable that SEB will seek the SKr1.1bn in loans made to Gota from the state. Mr Bjorn Svedberg, chief executive of SEB, said last night that the most important consideration for the bank was to secure the return of the Skr1.1bn it lent to Gota. Gota Bank is owned 100 per cent by Gota, the holding company, which is owned by the large Swedish insurance conglomerate Trygg-Hansa SPP.</p>

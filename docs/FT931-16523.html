			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Disappointing start to Bibby's first quarter Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, chairman of J Bibby, said that the first quarter of the present year was disappointing but the group as a whole was trading profitably. Most divisions had experienced more difficult trading than in the comparable period, particularly in the UK and Spain. The capital equipment division was trading at a loss as the benefit of the actions taken had yet to flow through. The materials handling division had shown better results helped by a strong performance from North America. In the year to September 30 pre-tax profits fell 9 per cent to Pounds 32.2m on turnover up 14 per cent at Pounds 625.2m.</p>

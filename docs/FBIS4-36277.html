			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hasan Zaytuni from Sanaa] </F>   [Text] Hours after a cease-fire was declared, Sanaa accused  southern forces of violating it and attacking government forces  in Aden's al-'Arish District. The southern Air Force raided oil  installations in the northern Ma'rib and al-'Abr areas to the  northwest of Hadramaut.    Yemeni Foreign Minister Muhammad Salim Basindwah confirmed  this information during a news conference he held at the Yemeni  Foreign Ministry today. On the sidelines of the news  conference, Basindwah spoke to the MBC, declaring that his  country wishes to strengthen its relations with fraternal  countries, particularly Saudi Arabia.    [Begin recording] [Basindwah] As an Arab citizen, not Yemeni  foreign minister, I would like all the brothers to understand  that their current position might not serve their future  interests.    [Zaytuni] Minister, a UN envoy will shortly arrive in Sanaa.  Does Sanaa have conditions to present to him? How will Sanaa  deal with the UN envoy in light of current domestic and  international developments connected with the Yemeni crisis?    [Basindwah] We welcome his excellency brother Lakhdar  Ibrahimi as an envoy of the UN secretary general. We are  confident of his competence, ability, wisdom, and long  experience. I believe that any mediation effort must respect  the need to preserve Yemeni unity. [end recording]    The Yemeni Foreign Ministry declared its willingness to work  with the UN envoy without setting any conditions that might  hinder his peace mission. The Ministry insisted, however, that  the two principles of Yemeni unity and constitutional legality  be maintained.</p>

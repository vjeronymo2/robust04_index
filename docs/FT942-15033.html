			<p>940418 FT  18 APR 94 / International Press Review: The view from Judea and Samaria  -Israel No Israeli newspaper can fuel public fears quite like the Jerusalem Post, the English-language daily broadsheet which acts as a mouthpiece for the country's right and ultra-right wing. The events of the past 10 days - three attacks by extremist Islamic guerrillas which left 13 Israelis dead - have given the Post the opportunity to indulge in the sport of thumping the Palestine Liberation Organisation, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. 'Like the dictatorial regimes which support them, the terrorists believe that negotiations should be accompanied by shooting,' the Post said last week. 'Those who say, as the government has done, that the right response to terrorism is to accelerate the negotiations and withdrawal process. . . are doing precisely what the terrorists want them to do.' Editorials like this led the Post's owner, Mr Conrad Black, to publish a centre-page opinion piece last September making it clear that he disagreed with his newspaper's editorial policy. The Post has its own politicised language - all Arab guerrillas are 'terrorists'; the Israeli-occupied West Bank is known by the biblical name 'Judea and Samaria'; the territories are 'administered', not 'occupied'. It also gives regular platforms to right-wing politicians such as Mr Ariel Sharon, Israel's leading hawk. In an opinion article last week Mr Sharon described the incoming Palestinian police force as 'murderers' and said the government was 'perpetrating an immense security crime against Jews in the State of Israel' by allowing the policemen into the territories. Another favourite pastime of the Post is thumping foreign correspondents reporting Israel in a weekly column called 'Eye of the Media' usually written by Mr David Bar-Illan, the newspaper's executive editor. The column takes the view that Israel gets an unrelenting negative press abroad and is at war with hostile international media, including The New York Times. 'No paper in the democratic world, except one owned and run by Jews, would dare be as snidely anti-Semitic as the Times of that day,' Mr Bar-Illan wrote, referring to the coverage of the funeral of the Jewish settler responsible for the Hebron mosque massacre in February. But Israel is a deeply democratic and pluralistic society with at least nine daily newspapers, including two business tabloids, for a population of 5m. With the exception of the religious Hatsofeh newspaper, Israel's Hebrew press is centrist to left-wing. Despite the recent attacks they support a continuation of the peace process as the only realistic option. 'It is hard to understand why the opposition wants the government to suspend the talks after every attack,' the respected liberal Ha'aretz newspaper said last Friday. 'The strength of a people is measured not only by the number of tanks it possesses, but also by its capacity to live with casualties and loss of life.' The 1.9m Palestinians who live in the territories are less well provided for by media and much news and views are disseminated by leaflets, underground pamphlets and by a graffiti war between the factions. Two Arabic daily newspapers, however, are published in the West Bank under careful monitoring and censorship by Israel and both newspapers are pro-PLO and pro-Arafat, although they reflect the concerns in the occupied territories about what is seen as Mr Arafat's lack of democracy. After the second suicide attack by an Islamic extremist last week both Al-Quds and An-Nahar took similar editorial lines avoiding condemnation of the Palestinian attacks, while stressing that violence occurs against both Arab and Jew and can only be solved by swift implementation of the peace process. 'Crying and condemning is not the answer,' said An-Nahar. 'The answer is Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinians have sacrificed much blood and have made many concessions to regain their rights but Israel continues to get around international law.' In a series of editorials last week Al-Quds compared the closure to a 'siege' which had caused a near collapse in the education and health services of Arab East Jerusalem. 'Someone should stop Israel from imposing these wanton measures that only complicate and intensify the situation, making peace more difficult,' the paper said.</p>

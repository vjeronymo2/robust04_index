			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Third installment of the "basic contents" of the Hanoi 20 </F> to 25 January Midterm National Party Conference Resolution]    [Text] To gradually shift to a new stage of development  full of opportunities as well as of dangers and challenges and  continue to realize the general objectives set by the seventh  party congress, the conference defined the tasks to be completed  during the remaining part of the seventh CPV [Communist Party of  Vietnam] Central Committee's term as follows: It is necessary  to motivate the entire party, people, and Army to display  single-mindedness; make outstanding efforts; uphold the spirit  of independence, self- sufficiency, and self-reliance; broaden  international cooperation; respond to the movement for thrift,  impartiality, and righteousness; make use of all advantages and  opportunities; repel dangers; overcome challenges; and step up  efforts to achieve the objectives of the economic stabilization  and development strategy for the period until the year 2000,  thereby realizing the goals of making the people rich and the  nation powerful and of bringing about justice and civilization  in society.    There are eight key tasks to carry out as follows:    1. Effecting changes in the economic structure based on the  need for industrialization and modernization.    -- It is necessary to combine industrialization with  modernization because we must carry out not only the  industrialization program, but we must also change the  structures of all sectors, areas of activities, and the national  economy as a whole based on the need for the acquisition of  modern technologies. It is important not only to go through the  stages of mechanization, automation, and computerization, but  also to apply scientific- technological innovations to different  areas of activities and make efforts to seize opportunities to  shorten our process and to form spearheads of development to  catch up with scientific and technological progress in the  world. It is necessary not only to apply modern technologies,  but also to make full use of and modernize traditional  technologies.    -- Do we have enough money to carry out the  industrialization and modernization program?    The important premises rest with the fact that the  renovation  undertaking has recorded many achievements and the socioeconomic  situation in our country has been stabilized to an important  extent. The practical results are as follows:    The grain problem has been resolved in a relatively  comprehensive manner.    There has been an increase in the supply of agricultural,  forestry, and sea products to support processing industries.    The domestic market has been broadened a step further.    The national economy has begun to achieve some capital  accumulation.    The export index has increased considerably and provided  enough foreign currency to import materials and staples.    Diplomatic relations have been broadened, thereby enabling  us  to have access to many sources of capital from foreign countries  and international organizations.    The period from now until the year 2000 is not yet a stage  of  far-reaching and large-scale developments, but only a step  forward in which efforts will be concentrated on projects that  are necessary and that can yield effective results and create  momentum for fast economic growth in the next decade.    What is the significance of our efforts to accelerate the  industrialization and modernization program a step further?    -- Effecting changes in the economic structure based on the  need for industrialization and modernization constitutes a key  task of primary importance in the days ahead. This move helps  create more jobs, quickly increase the economic growth rate,  improve the material and spiritual life of the people, firmly  maintain political stability and social order, safeguard  independence and sovereignty as well as socialist orientations,  and eliminate the danger of being left farther behind compared  with neighboring countries.    Based on past experiences, what are the concepts that we  must  firmly grasp to enable the industrialization and modernization  program yield effective results?    The political report clearly puts forth a number of concepts  on industrialization and modernization as follows:    -- The firm maintenance of independence and sovereignty  must go along with the broadening of international cooperation,  building an open-door economic development policy both at home  and abroad, multilateralizing and diversifying relations with  other countries, combining economic activities with national  defense and security, and linking economic growth with the  achievement of social progress and social justice as well as  with cultural development and environmental protection.    -- Persisting on the strategy of directing vigorous efforts  at exports while at the same time replacing imports that can be  produced locally. It is necessary to take socioeconomic results  as a fundamental standard for determining the course of  development and for selecting investment projects and  technologies.    -- Appropriately gathering resources for the various fields  of activities and various key areas to promptly produce high  results while paying attention to meeting the essential  requirements of localities which have difficulties.    -- Attention must be paid to small- and medium-size  projects that require small investment capital or capital that  can be recovered quickly. It is necessary to build a number of  necessary, large-scale projects that can yield effective results.    -- Making intensive capital investments to exploit to the  fullest our productivity and our existing technologies with an  emphasis on projects that affect product competitiveness. From  now until the end of this decade, great attention must be paid  to agricultural industrialization and to the rural economy. We  must carry out comprehensive agricultural, forestry, and fishery  development in conjunction with efforts to develop processing  industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine products and  for consumer goods manufacturing and exports.    Is it true that if we regard industrialization and  modernization as a key task of primary importance in the days  ahead, we will belittle the role of agriculture?    This concept is not at variance with the strategy of  directing vigorous efforts at agricultural development.  Agricultural production still remains one of the decisive  factors for stabilizing the socioeconomic situation and for  creating the groundwork for industrial development.  Nonetheless, agricultural development should be understood in a  broad sense, not as development that is based solely on  agriculture or worse still, on backward agriculture. The party  Central Committee Fifth Plenum has pointed out: It is necessary  to take comprehensive measures to promote agricultural  development and rural socioeconomic development, regarding this  move as a very urgent task. To this end, we must necessarily  accelerate agricultural industrialization and modernization;  develop the rural economy; and boost agricultural, forestry, and  fishery development in conjunction with efforts to promote  processing industries and other industrial and service sectors  in the countryside itself, bearing in mind the need to  coordinate action and achieve cooperation with other sectors and  areas.</p>

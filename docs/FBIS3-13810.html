Minister Shim'on Shetrit  complained that Israel's position on the status of Jerusalem is  unclear. Mr. Rabin replied that Jerusalem is not an issue for  negotiations at this time, adding that Israel has made no  concessions whatsoever on this matter. Rabin noted that he had  underestimated the extent of the widespread support among  settler circles for the Hebron massacre. The prime minister  said that the deliberations of the Shamgar Commission, which is  investigating the Hebron massacre, undermine the IDF's [Israel  Defense Forces] credibility in the eyes of the public.    Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports that the  cabinet also discussed the continuation of the closure on the  territories. One of the possibilities discussed was extending  the closure on the territories until after the holidays. Police  Minister Moshe Shahal supports this proposal.</p>

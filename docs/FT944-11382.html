			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Cabinet set to endorse Pounds 4bn spending curbs The cabinet will tomorrow seek to head off rightwing anger about the Post Office debacle by endorsing deep cuts in public spending at a special meeting. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, is expected to put forward plans for a reduction of between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 5bn in the government's control total for 1995-96. A second cabinet meeting has been scheduled for Thursday in case agreement proves difficult. Senior ministers believe that the cuts will go some way to mollifying rightwing backbenchers who were angered by the cabinet's decision to postpone Post Office privatisation because of opposition from a group of mainly leftwing rebels. Rightwing backbenchers have demanded cuts of as much as Pounds 7bn to pave the way for tax cuts next year, which many believe are essential if the Conservatives are to win the next general election. The case for deep cuts in nominal spending has also been strengthened by an unexpectedly rapid fall in underlying inflation, excluding mortgage interest payments, since Mr Clarke's last Budget in November last year. That Budget forecast underlying inflation of 3.25 per cent in the current quarter. Instead, it fell to a 27-year low of 2 per cent in September and has been below 3 per cent for 12 months. As a result Mr Clarke will be able to tell the cabinet that deep cuts in nominal spending are essential to maintain the confidence of the financial markets in the government's continuing commitment to sound public finances. Goldman Sachs, the US-owned merchant bank, has calculated that the chancellor must cut the 1995-96 control total, which excludes some recession-related social security spending, by Pounds 5bn to Pounds 258bn merely to prevent spending rising in real terms. General government spending, which includes unemployment and other social security benefits, will also fall sharply because of the decline in unemployment caused by the stronger-than-expected economic recovery. Mr Jonathan Aitken, the Treasury chief secretary, is believed to have encountered fewer difficulties than usual in the annual round of public spending negotiations with ministers. However Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has resisted pressure for big cuts in the Pounds 8.8bn housing benefit budget, which he believes would have to be restructured to yield significant savings. Some senior Conservatives are pressing the chancellor to cut taxes on the poor, especially pensioners, to offset the impact of Pounds 5bn in fresh taxes on fuel and services announced last year to take effect in April. Others are pressing the chancellor to announce tax cuts in a special mini-Budget next spring rather than waiting until November. Mr Clarke has said he will not cut taxes until it is prudent to do so.</p>

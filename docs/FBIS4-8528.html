			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency adviser Kemal </F> Muftic in Sarajevo on 12 April -- recorded]    [Text] The statement by General Rose has caused justified  dilemmas among our (population). According to his statement,  which carries critical undertones, the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army  shelled the forces of the Serb aggressor near Gorazde.  Unfortunately, and as you will see from this statement, we have  many reasons to doubt the reliability of the sources of  information used by General Rose. General Rose also failed to  explain whether our forces merely responded to an attack, that  is, fired in self-defense, or in order to defend civilians as  they have a duty to.    The UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] have obviously still not  undertaken adequate measures to prevent the advances of  Karadzic's forces in Gorazde, and effectively to protect the  lives of innocent people. Some 20 days ago we warned of the  grouping of the aggressor's forces [words indistinct]. The safe  haven of Gorazde was soon afterward attacked with enormous  forces [words indistinct] of Karadzic's Serbs. Every day we  reported on the heavy shelling of the town and the aggressor's  advances into the safe haven. UNPROFOR consistently denied our  reports. Finally when the situation really got out of hand, the  UNPROFOR Command decided to launch air strikes of limited  intensity against the forces of the attacker. However, the mere  selectiveness and limits of the strikes seemed to encourage the  enemy. The invasion of Gorazde has continued. Yesterday alone  the aggressor's shells killed at least 23 civilians and wounded  many others.    We are ready for a cease-fire, and not only around Gorazde  but on the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, on condition  that it is followed by the withdrawal of the Serbian invasion  forces from the protected area of Gorazde, and that it does not  predispose the final political solution. In no event will we  agree to the current situation being frozen, which would  perpetuate the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Because of the great differences between the information  provided by UNPROFOR officials and our own reports, that is,  reports by doctors and others who are in Gorazde at the moment,  we believe that it is necessary for General Rose and a team of  reporters to go to Gorazde as soon as possible in order to  dispel any dilemmas when it comes to obvious things. We are  ready to join General Rose on that trip. We also believe that  UNPROFOR [word indistinct] and in accordance with the UN  resolutions is obliged to provide the delivery of humanitarian  aid to the many civilians in Gorazde, as the reserves of  medicine and food in the town are depleted.</p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Kenya eager to trumpet its economic reforms: Nairobi wants to start a much-needed dialogue with private enterprise After a year of dismantling state controls and untangling red tape, the government of Kenya is hosting an investment conference in Nairobi today to trumpet its economic reforms. Mr Musalia Mudavadi, finance minister, does not anticipate a stampede of foreign investors, but the conference might accomplish something more useful: the start of a much-needed dialogue between businessmen and government mandarins. 'We want to project Kenya's new image, but we also want to listen to the needs of investors and their suggestions for further reforms,' Mr Mudavadi says. The liberalisation measures of the past year have radically changed the operating environment for private enterprise. Import licences have been scrapped. Almost all government controls on foreign exchange transactions are gone. Exporters can keep their dollars and multinationals can repatriate profits without restrictions. All price controls, except those on petroleum products, have been dismantled. As a result, business confidence in Kenya is returning. A majority of multinationals polled by the East Africa Association say they have significant investment plans. Exporters and bankers are thriving in the newly deregulated environment, while local manufacturers have also taken advantage of the devaluation of the shilling to export to neighbouring countries. Kenya's exports rose by 15 per cent last year to Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 733m). After two years in the doldrums, the Kenyan economy may show some stirrings of growth in 1994. With Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya adopting converging economic policies, central bankers are now discussing the convertibility of their currencies to boost regional trade. Mr Mudavadi is guaranteed an enthusiastic reception at the investors' conference, if only because local businessmen know he needs all the support he can get. Inside government, the 33-year-old finance minister is fighting a formidable coalition of anti-reformers who resent the loss of patronage and opportunities for corruption his market-based reforms will fight. 'My fear is that the anti-reformers have so much to lose that they may go to any lengths to sabotage Mudavadi and his plans,' says a foreign executive in Nairobi. Having survived 18 difficult months in office, the young minister faces challenges far greater than economic deregulation. He must impose financial discipline on free-spending government ministries and a bankrupt parastatal sector which are fuelling inflation and creating a mountain of public debt. Kenya's annual inflation rate has risen above 50 per cent, while debt-servicing consumes 42 per cent of government expenditures. This leaves little room for paying salaries, let alone investing in Kenya's dilapidated infrastructure and social services. Politically unpalatable choices lie ahead, including the firing of thousands of civil servants in cities where one in three adults does not have a job. Mr Mudavadi plans to raise government revenues by improving the collection of import duties in the customs department. He is also trying to impose 'performance targets' on state corporations. But across the state sector, managerial skills are in short supply. Businessmen are advising Mr Mudavadi to tread cautiously: the scales are still too finely balanced between progress and a political backlash against reform. Mr Mudavadi, conscious of the fragility of his achievements, is not crying victory yet.</p>

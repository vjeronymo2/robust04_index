			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Dockers opt for payoff, not pay cut MORE THAN 250 dock workers at Sheerness in Kent have taken redundancy this week rather than accept new contracts of employment, Lisa Wood writes. The dock workers voted on Monday to strike in protest at the contracts, which cut pay by up to 10 per cent and introduced new working patterns. Mr Peter Vincent, chief executive of Medway Ports, said that contract labour was being used temporarily and every ship was being serviced normally.</p>

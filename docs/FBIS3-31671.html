A  Yugoslav memorandum handed over to the council on February 12  said Yugoslav border guards had seized large quantities of arms  and ammunition carried by Albanian nationals as they tried  illegally to cross the border.    Twenty-one Albanians have died in the incidents since the  start of last year, according to the ministry here.    The memorandum was "an anti-Albanian document, provocative  and full of slander," the ministry said, adding: "The border  provocations are part of (Serbian President Slobodan)  Milosevic's strategy to create tension and trigger war, and its  consequences will be unpredictable."    In its memorandum Belgrade also accused Tirana of supporting  secessionist forces in Serbia's southern Kosovo province which  is 90 percent ethnic Albanian. But the foreign ministry said  Albanians living in Kosovo were "no minority but an entire  people living on its own land."</p>

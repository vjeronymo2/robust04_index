			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / International Company News: Nissan straightens out its Spanish unit's battered balance sheet - The Japanese carmaker's plan to inject Ptas15bn in new capital NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is to inject up to Ptas15bn (Dollars 130m) in new equity capital into Nissan Motor Iberica as part of a financial restructuring of its loss-making Spanish sub-sidiary. The injection of an initial Ptas5bn will be announced this week, and the provision of a further Ptas5bn is expected by the end of the year. According to Mr Kiyoshi Sekiguchi, Nissan Motor Iberica managing director, a third tranche of Ptas5bn may have to be injected by Nissan in 1994 to repair its majority-owned subsidiary's battered balance sheet, if the losses cannot be staunched this year. Nissan Motor Iberica lost Ptas 14.4bn (Dollars 125m) last year, and it is understood the losses have deepened in the first quarter of this year. Mr Juan Echevarria, Nissan Motor Iberica executive chairman, warned that the company did not expect to return to profit before 1995. It has plunged into loss in the midst of an ambitious five-year, Ptas150bn investment programme aimed at doubling its capacity to around 165,000 vehicles a year by 1996. The financial problems of Nissan Motor Iberica, two-thirds owned by Nissan Motor, could hardly have come at a worse time for the Japanese carmaker, whose finances are under heavy pressure because of falling sales in Japan. In Europe, Nissan's operations in Spain have tended to be overshadowed by its activities in the UK, where it has invested more than Pounds 900m to establish its first European car plant - now able to produce around 300,000 cars a year. The investment in Spain is beginning to rival the spending in the UK, however, and the Nissan group workforce of around 8,000 in Spain, including 7,200 in the Nissan Motor Iberica parent company, exceeds Nissan's UK workforce of about 5,500, including 4,600 at the Sunderland plant. Having completed the bulk of its investment in the UK car plant, Nissan is attempting to transform the Spanish operations from a maker of outdated commercial vehicles largely for the Spanish domestic market into a producer of niche passenger vehicles to be sold across Europe. Since last year, it has launched two new ranges from its main Spanish plant in Barcelona, both aimed at the fastest-growing segments of the west European car market. Last autumn it unveiled the Spanish-built Nissan Serena, a 7-8 seat multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) or 'people carrier', targeted to challenge vehicles such as the pioneering Renault Espace. Now it is launching the Terrano II, a four-wheel drive leisure/utility vehicle to compete across Europe with the Land Rover Discovery, Mitsubishi Shogun/Pajero and Opel/Vauxhall Frontera. The Terrano II marks an important step in the development of Nissan's European operations and its integration into Europe's motor industry. For the first time, a vehicle engineered by a Japanese carmaker and produced in Europe will also be supplied to a long-established vehicle maker in Europe, namely Ford, for sale through Ford's network. Ford has made repeated public attacks on the build-up of the Japanese vehicle manufacturing presence in Europe, but it was prepared to turn to Nissan to buy in a vehicle for sale under the Ford badge to cover a gap in its product range. The Nissan Terrano II will be marketed as the Ford Maverick with only minor cosmetic differences. Nissan Motor Iberica is planning to build up to 60,000 a year of the four-wheel drive vehicle by 1995, of which 22,000 will be sold to Ford. An important part of the design and development work on the Nissan Terrano II/Ford Maverick has been carried out by Nissan in Europe rather than in Japan. Nissan's operations in Spain include not only vehicle assembly but metal-stamping and foundry, machining and assembly operations for engines, transmissions and axles. Diesel engines and transmissions for both Serena and Terrano II are to be built in Spain, while the petrol engines for the Serena are supplied from Nissan's Sunderland plant. Nissan Motor Iberica is planning to produce around 50,000 Serena vehicles by 1995, including a light commercial van variant to be launched next year. It is aiming to raise vehicle output to 135,000 in 1995, of which around 80 per cent would be accounted for by the two new vehicle ranges. This compares with output last year of 76,895. Of this number, only 11 per cent was accounted for by the new vehicles - in the form of initial production of the Serena. With output of both new vehicle ranges located in Europe, Nissan has stolen a march on most of its volume-car rivals both from Europe and from Japan. In the market for MPVs, only the Renault Espace and the Chrysler Voyager have hitherto been produced in Europe. The range of European offerings is set to expand quickly by the mid-1990s, however, with new models promised by two joint ventures - Fiat with Peugeot and Volkswagen with Ford. Mercedes-Benz is also developing an MPV for production in Spain. In the fast-growing four-wheel drive leisure/utility segment, four of the 'big six' volume carmakers in Europe - Volkswagen, Fiat, Renault and Peugeot  -are still missing from the market. While Nissan Motor Iberica has invested ambitiously in developing new models, in modernisation of its plants and in reorganisation of its manufacturing operations and sales network, its profitability has come under heavy pressure. The losses have been caused in particular by the rapid deterioration in the Spanish domestic market. Sales of both cars and commercial vehicles has fallen sharply and Nissan Motor Iberica's profitability in a previously protected home market is being undermined. While the commercial vehicle market has contracted sharply, Nissan's own share of the market has fallen at an even faster rate. Its presence in the Spanish car market is growing strongly, albeit from a small base. But the market is shrinking alarmingly, with new car registrations in the first four months this year a third down on last year. 'Our main objective is to expand into Europe. We cannot just concentrate on the Spanish market; we must live off a bigger volume base,' says Mr Sekiguchi. 'But our export markets are very tough at the moment because of falling demand and, in the short-term, our exports do not compensate for the very sharp decline in the domestic market.' While the restructuring to be launched this week is aimed at shoring up the balance sheet in the short term, Nissan Motor Iberica is seeking a dramatic improvement in productivity in the medium-term. By 1995-96, it aims to have doubled its unit output per employee. It plans to cut around 600 salaried staff in the next three years from its 7,200-strong workforce. At the same time, the number of production workers is supposed to remain unchanged, while vehicle output is planned to increase from 77,000 last year to 100,000 this year, to 120,000 in 1994 and 135,000 in 1995. 'We are planning to increase production with no increase in the workforce but only with productivity gains,' insists Mr Sekiguchi.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Lines in the Gulf's shifting sands: UN grapples with border demarcation between Iraq and Kuwait BORDER demarcation in the Middle East, and particularly in the often featureless desert topography of the Gulf states, is a notoriously rough and ready business. Pity, then, the United Nations Commission trying to reach a definitive demarcation for the line between Iraq and Kuwait, historically among the most bitterly contested - and among the most clumsily defined. Roughly speaking, the border was agreed to lie just south of the Iraqi town of Safwan and reach the coast where the channels Khor Zubair and Khor Abdullah meet to the north of Kuwait's Bubyan and Warba islands. A working acceptance of this border was in place up to August 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait. After the Gulf war ceasefire, however, the US-led anti-Iraq coalition, backed strongly by Kuwait, sought to define once and for all the precise meeting point of Kuwait and Iraq and set up the special UN Commission accordingly. It is expected to reveal its final decision at its fifth post-war meeting in April. The trouble is that the official correspondences and maps, mostly penned by British officials in the first third of the 1900s, originally defining the border are full of such phrases as 'south of . . .' and 'just south of . . .' - wholly inadequate for such hotly-disputed territory. In translating lines on the map into lines on the generally featureless ground, the commission has then had to contend with references to such things as the most southerly date palms from Safwan and the site of a border post, hammered in placed by a British political agent in 1923 - for years the only border post along the entire boundary. These might be features enough in the scrubby wastes south of Safwan, were it not for the fact that the Iraqis early in the 1920s cannily planted new sets of southerly date palms and in 1939 stole the original border post. Deciding on exactly where the border reaches the coast - it is agreed to run in a straight line from the position of the original Safwan border post - has also been complicated by the fact that many of the original British maps were not drawn to scale. It now appears that the Commission, which has completed most of its field work, has decided that the border should lie somewhat to the north of its presently accepted line - a fact which this month prompted Mr Tareq Rzouqi, Kuwait's representative on the Commission, to declare that the new border will entrench the emirate's historical rights. But more pertinently to the question of future political peace in the region, it will also deny Iraqi claims. Three times this century, in 1938, 1961 and of course 1990, Iraq has belligerently pushed an historic claim to the whole of Kuwait. Its argument ran that Iraq was constituted out of the three Ottoman wilayets of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra, and that Kuwait was part of the latter under Turkish Ottoman rule. Historians generally agree that this claim is weakly based. Kuwait held an ambiguous, and highly autonomous, place in the Ottoman empire and, anyway, signed a secret protocol with Britain in 1899 turning the country into a virtual protectorate well before the final dissolution of Turkish influence in the region. Indeed, Iraq itself has on numerous occasions acknowledged Kuwait's independence: formally so in 1963 through a treaty accepting Britain's 1923 boundary demarcation Nevertheless, Baghdad will protest strongly at a line which looks certain to deny it several oil wells in the disputed Rumalia field and the best part of its Umm Qasr naval base. The latter point in particular will inflame Iraq, highlighting as it does the limited sea access available to a large country of more than 17m people heavily dependent, the present embargo notwithstanding, on oil-based foreign trade. For years before the 1990 invasion, Iraq had sought some form of leasing agreement over the Warba and Bubyan islands to guarantee it security over sea passage into Umm Qasr and Basra, further north up the Shatt al Arab. This, while President Saddam Hussein remains in power at least, will be out of the question. 'Whether Iraq's historical claims on Kuwait are correct or not, Iraq will never drop its claim on the country,' remarks one western diplomat in Kuwait. The Kuwait government knows this and is already inviting tenders from foreign companies to build a security fence along the entire 200km border with Iraq. Work is due to begin as soon as the UN commission formally unveils its final decision.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Letter: When traders become 'speculators' - and who are they anyway? (2) Sir, Who are these 'speculators' that everyone has started whingeing about? Are they the young men in shirt-sleeves doing a job of work for the leading banks, to provide the markets without which British industry would suffocate? Or are they the Treasury officials spending vast sums in an attempt to force those markets to move against their natural tendency - an outrageous gamble against the odds?

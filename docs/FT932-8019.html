			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Review cuts cost estimate for Papua New Guinea mine project AN URGENT review of the capital costs needed to bring the Lihir Island gold project in Papua New Guinea into production has resulted in 'a sizeable reduction' from the USDollars 767m previously expected and improved the economics, said Mr Geoff Loudon, chairman of Niugini Mining, one of the partners in the project, yesterday. However, Mr Loudon said he had no idea whether the improvement would encourage RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining group, which has a majority stake in Lihir, to go ahead. All RTZ would say is: 'We are continuing studies to improve the economics'. Lihir, in the crater of a dead volcano nearly full of very hot water, is the world's biggest undeveloped gold deposit with resources of about 42m troy ounces of gold. It is expected that it will produce 628,000 ounces annually in its first 13 years. The PNG government, which will take 30 per cent of the project, reducing RTZ's stake to 56 per cent and Niugini's to 14 per cent, is keen for mining to go ahead quickly and has been putting pressure on RTZ for a decision. RTZ wants to reduce its exposure to the project on which USDollars 135m has been spent so far - Mr Loudon described that group's attitude as 'somewhat lacking in enthusiasm' - and has been seeking another partner to take a 20 per cent stake. The PNG government has given RTZ until today to complete the search or it will temporarily take 50 per cent of the project so as to speed up the funding process. Mr Loudon, in London yesterday, pointed out that the PNG government had no intention of keeping the extra 20 per cent because the country would find it difficult to finance half the project. Its ultimatum to RTZ should be seen as part of a broader negotiating process. He admitted it was a matter of concern to him than some big gold groups had apparently looked at the project 'and not grabbed the 20 per cent'. He was personally in favour of Niugini Mining taking the extra 20 per cent offered by RTZ but had not been able to persuade his board to take the opportunity. Niugini is 55 per cent owned by Battle Mountain Gold of the US. A 1990 study put the capital cost of the Lihir project at USDollars 1.1bn but in 1991 this was revised in a way that not only cut capital costs but also increased cash flow in the early years of production. However, gold output would be cut considerably in later years. Mr Loudon yesterday would not give precise details but said the latest cost review, which would be completed within a week, looked at the possibility of employing a mining contractor and saving the USDollars 60m in the Lihir budget for mining equipment. At present the cost of hiring contractors was very low. Also the Dollars 68m 'cost escalation' figure in the budget gave room for manoeuvre as it originally assumed annual inflation of 4 per cent over the 33 months to bring the mine into production. Inflation was now expected to be below that level and much of the equipment was to be acquired in Australia, so the fall of the Australian dollar against the US currency was also cutting projected costs. Mr Loudon revealed that the PNG government had agreed that the Lihir project would pay no duty on fuel while the gold price was below USDollars 380 a troy ounce (a level that was exceeded yesterday for the first time in two years). The partners were also asking for concessions on import duties on equipment but the government was insisting it could not afford to lose the revenue.</p>

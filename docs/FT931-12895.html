			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Defence agency to be trading fund THE DEFENCE Research Agency, which runs the four armed forces research establishments, is to become a trading concern from April 1. The DRA is the ninth government executive agency to become a trading fund, required to manage its finances much more like a commercial company. It will face increasing competition for the research work it carries out for the Defence Ministry. An order laid before parliament last week by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, capitalises the agency at Pounds 328m. It will have turnover of more than Pounds 800m.</p>

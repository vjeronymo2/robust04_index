			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. COVERT OPERATIONS  </P> <P> I am amazed and appalled by the U.S. government's claim of worldwide FBI  jurisdiction. Knowing that there can be no legal basis for such claim in light  of other nations' sovereignties, our government has refused to reveal the basis  of its claim. Any self-respecting sovereign state can be expected to oppose  what any civilized system of law defines as kidnaping within its borders. If  there can be any doubt about this, imagine what the reaction of the Bush  government would be were the Soviets to make such a claim for the KGB, their  equivalent agency.  </P> <P> Along similar lines, efforts to constitutionally repeal First Amendment rights,  such as the move to amend the Constitution to provide for lese-majeste laws in  the guise of protecting the honor of the flag, impugn and threaten our  constitutional framework of liberty. Supporters of such proposals should be  recognized as enemies of liberty. Those who have collaborated with such enemies  by enacting obviously unconstitutional statutes of a similar nature have shown  a profound contempt for our rights and have betrayed their oaths to uphold the  Constitution.  </P> <P> JOHN P. TESCHKE  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

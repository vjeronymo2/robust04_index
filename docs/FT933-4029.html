			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Bundesbank Since the Bundesbank has acquired a reputation for only cutting interest rates when the market does not expect it, yesterday's cut should perhaps have been expected after all. The background has barely changed since its last meeting, so yesterday's move appears basically technical. It has restored a more normal relationship between money market rates and the discount rate, which in turn gives Mr Hans Tietmeyer greater operational flexibility during his first weeks in office as president. The meagre 10 basis point cut in the repurchase rate must disappoint France. Its dilemma over when and whether to move below German rates is all the more awkward as its foreign exchange reserves remain negative.</p>

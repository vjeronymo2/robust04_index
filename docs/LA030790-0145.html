			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 OF 5 DIRECTORS RESIGN IN EMULEX CORP. SHAKE-UP;  </P> <P> PERSONNEL: THE COMPUTER PRODUCTS FIRM'S SAGGING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DID NOT  INFLUENCE THE CHANGES, AN OUTGOING BOARD MEMBER SAYS.  </P> <P> In a boardroom shake-up, Emulex Corp. said Tuesday that three of its five  directors have resigned voluntarily. The computer products company named  replacements for two of the positions, with a third director to be named later.  </P> <P> Marshall A. Petersen, senior vice president for finance and administration,  said Emulex wants "to get a very active board that participates in our industry  and to get a board that has a totally outside membership." Petersen is one of  the three resigning directors, though he will remain as senior vice president.  </P> <P> Also leaving the board are Graham Tyson, a retired Agoura Hills computer  company executive, and James W. Storey, a New England-based consultant.  </P> <P> The changes come as Emulex's revenue and profits have seriously eroded in the  past year as part of the general decline in the computer industry. The  850-employee manufacturer of computer storage devices and data communications  equipment posted net income of $208,000 for the first six months of its fiscal  year ending Dec. 31, contrasted with earnings of $7.3 million for the same  period a year earlier.  </P> <P> "It's been a tough six months," Petersen said. But he said the firm's sagging  financial performance "did not have any influence" on the directors'  resignations.  </P> <P> Two of the slots will be filled by David Hanna, a longtime IBM Corp. executive  who heads a Silicon Valley consulting firm, and P. Andrews McLane, a general  partner in a Boston venture capital firm, Emulex said.  </P> <P> Emulex Chairman Fred B. Cox will continue as a director, along with Robert H.  Goon. Cox was unavailable for comment, but in a statement he praised Tyson and  Storey as "able businessmen" who have "contributed significantly to the company  during the past two years."  </P> <P> He said Hanna has 14 years of experience with IBM and was chief executive  officer at Grid Systems, Altos Computer Systems, NetFRAME, State of the Art  Inc., the Versatec division of Xerox Corp. and Xerox Desktop Software.  </P> <P> "Hanna is a respected and accomplished member of our industry, and his in-depth  understanding of our markets and business activities will be of great  assistance," Cox said.  </P> <P> McLane is a general partner of TA Associates, a venture capital firm that has  been involved in financing high-technology companies for 17 years, Cox said.  </P> <P> In an interview, Tyson said he resigned voluntarily and agreed with the  decision to change the board's makeup.  </P> <P> "The computer business as a whole has been well below expectations throughout  the country," Tyson said. "It's a different environment. Everybody is going to  have to rethink their programs."  </P> <P> EMULEX CORP.

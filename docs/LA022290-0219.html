			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> QUAYLE, KENNEDY BECOME UNLIKELY FELLOW TRAVELERS  </P> <P> Lest anyone doubt that politics makes strange bedfellows, Vice President Dan  Quayle announced today that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) will accompany him  to the March 11 presidential inauguration in Chile.  </P> <P> Quayle, champion of the Republican right, held a photo session with Kennedy,  symbol of the Democratic left, to announce that Kennedy will be in the official  U.S. delegation to the inauguration of Patricio Aylwin.  </P> <P> "It shows the bipartisan commitment to the advancement of democracy in Chile  and the Western Hemisphere," he told reporters.  </P> <P> Aylwin was elected Dec. 14 as an opposition candidate after 16 years of  military rule under Augusto Pinochet, the army general who came to power in a  1973 coup that ousted the elected government of Marxist Salvador Allende.  </P> <P> The inauguration will take place in Valparaiso, a port city 75 miles west of  Santiago, where Pinochet is building a new capital.  </P> <P> Kennedy, who co-sponsored the Job Training Partnership Act with Quayle when the  latter was a senator from Indiana, said he was "delighted" to be chosen for the  delegation, which by tradition would have bipartisan representation.  </P> <P> "The restoration of democracy in Chile has been something which the American  people have felt extremely deeply about over a long time," Kennedy said. "This  has been an extremely painful process, and I think it's another indication of  the winds of change that are taking place in the world."  </P> <P> Quayle used the photo session in the Old Executive Office Building next door to  the White House to present his "longtime friend" Kennedy with a candle-lit  pastry to mark his 58th birthday, 258 years to the day after the birth of  George Washington.  </P></p>

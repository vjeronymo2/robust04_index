			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Optimism over rail sell-off TRANSPORT Minister Mr Roger Freeman last night forecast an 'outstanding success' for the government's rail privatisation plans. He spelt out new arrangements for train operators to seek options for later extensions of their services in deals with the Railtrack authority. Mr Freeman was speaking during the line-by-line Commons Standing Committee debate on the Railways Bill providing for private companies to seek franchises to run trains. He introduced a new clause to let operators agree options on access with the Railtrack authority to extend services at a later date.</p>

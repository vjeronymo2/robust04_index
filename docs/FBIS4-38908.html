			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 02, BNS -- Estonian lawmakers today  took up the issue of the deadlocked Estonian-Russian relations  and possible compromises with Moscow, but postponed the  discussion until September on a proposal made by the Pro Patria  faction in parliament.    A bill of the parliamentary foreign affairs commission  recommended that Estonia seek compromises with Russia in border,  economic and humanitarian issues.    Vello Saatpalu, the chairman of the foreign affairs  commission and a member of the Social Democratic Party,  suggested on behalf of the commission that an Estonian-Russian  top level meeting be arranged with the help of mediators, if  necessary, to resolve the problems concerning the border and the  Tartu Peace Treaty. In his words, Estonia should also consider  placing the Estonian-Russian border issue under a moratorium.    Foreign Minister Juri Luik in his report assured that  Estonia  stands firm that Russian troops must be unconditionally  withdrawn from Estonia by Aug. 31, 1994.    Russia has so far refused to set the final pullout deadline  and keeps linking it to the demand that more than 10,000 retired  military be allowed to remain in Estonia.    Luik maintained that the Russian military retirees' issue  can  be solved only in accordance with Estonian legislation. What  makes finding a solution more difficult is that Russia hasn't  presented a list of its military pensioners in Estonia, striving  to solve the problem by the "pig-in-a-poke" method, the foreign  minister noted. He said the Russian Embassy claims there are  10,500 Russian military pensioners in Estonia, while Tallinn has  information their number amounts to 11,500.    Commenting on the dismantling of the nuclear reactors in  Paldiski, Luik said the operation lags behind the planned  schedule. He said an international monitoring group of  representatives from the Council of the Baltic Sea States and  the United States was set up in May, and that the group insists  on prompt removal of the nuclear fuel rods from Estonia.    Luik said the linkage of nuclear reactor removal to other  issues is internationally totally unacceptable.    Touching on the Estonian-Russian border dispute, the foreign  minister said the key issue is Russia's unwillingness to  recognize the 1920 Tarty Peace Treaty. It is extremely  regrettable that Russia didn't agree to discuss the issue in the  context of the European Stability Pact, known as the Balladur  Plan, Luik said.    Estonian Ambassador to Russia Juri Kahn noted that the  situation in Russia is at present considerably more stable than  over the last few years. In his words, the power in Russia is  more or less centered in President Boris Yeltsin's hands and the  Western states have less leverage in influencing Russia's  decisions.    The Estonian ambassador, however, predicted trouble for the  autumn in Russia. He said the problems still on the agenda in  Estonian-Russian relations should be resolved within the next  two or three months.    The legislature suspended the discussion of Estonian-Russian  relations until September. Tiit Sinissaar, the chairman of the  Pro Patria faction in parliament, said the faction moved to  postpone the discussion because the purpose of the bill was  putting Estonian-Russian relations on the parliament's agenda  and now the discussion can be resumed after the summer recess.    Endel Lippmaa, a member of the Assembly Party council, told  reporters today that his party was against a provision of the  bill stipulating that "solutions to problems of Estonian-Russian  relations should be sought in compromises in border, economic  and humanitarian issues." In Lippmaa's words, "it sounded as if  Estonia were willing to make any concessions (to Russia)."  Assembly Party members didn't support adoption of the bill.</p>

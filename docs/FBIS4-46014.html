			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] London ITV Television Network in English  at 1830 GMT on 19 May in its "3-D" program carries at 15-minute  report entitled "Saddam's Secret Bomb," showing exclusive video  footage of Iraq's bomb factories -- revealing the whole truth  about Iraq's nuclear program, raising questions about the role  of the British Government, and international monitoring agencies.    The program opens with shots of a Scud missile landing on an  allied base during the Gulf war and a parade of Iraqi weaponry,  followed by comments from David Kay, the UN investigator who  uncovered Iraq'secret weapons program after the Gulf war. Kay  says: "They were probably 36-months away from having deliverable  type of weapons that would have fit either their own Scud  missiles or extended range Scuds, or in their high performance  aircraft in small numbers. If the war had not intervened -- as  we sit here today in mid-1994, they would have at least have had  crude nuclear devices, and probably their first deliverable  packages would have coming on line."    Over extensive shots of Iraqi nuclear sites scattered  throughout Iraq, and shots of various items of equipment Kay  then says: "The major building where they were going to  manufacture nuclear weapons, actually cast the uranium metal,  cut it into shapes, put the high explosive around it, is one  that could well have produced twenty nuclear weapons a year no  problem. It was quite frankly better than most of the American  facilities that do the same thing. A lot of the equipment was  still there in crates, and it was really something that any lab  in the West would be happy to have."    The report then shows exclusive video taken by the Iraqi's  prior to the Gulf war, showing extensive shots of its  (?Calutron) plant which used huge magnetic coils to extract the  nuclear material, followed by comments from U.S Senate  investigator Ken Timmerman who says: "We were on the verge of a  nuclear catastrophe in Iraq and nobody was really aware of what  was going on. One of the problems with nuclear proliferation is  that you can never know with certainty exactly how far away a  country such as Iraq is from the bomb. Our intelligence  community does not know and they cannot know. The Iraqi's had a  fantastic international procurement network. They were buying  companies all over the world, but the very heart of it was in  London, they would set up dummy companies to purchase on the  open market high technology, machine-tools, nuclear materials,  everything that they needed for their nuclear weapons program."    The report goes on to show footage of Iraqi factories at al-  Tuwaitha, al-Atheer, and Badr, a list of British companies who  unwittingly supplied equipment to Iraq, unaware it would be  diverted to its secret bomb program, and a MI6 document warning  of Iraq's nuclear capability. John Gordon, former head of the  British Foreign Office Nuclear Department, then says: "I think  Britain broke her obligations as a nuclear weapons state under  the Non-Proliferation Treaty, because under Article One we are  enjoined and we agree in no way directly or indirectly to help  other countries acquire nuclear weapons, and in selling  machine-tool equipment which we knew might well be used for  making centrifuges for the illicit nuclear weapon enrichment  program, it seemed to me we were quite clearly in breach of this  obligation."    Over footage of UN inspections of the Iraqi bomb sites,  Kimmerman concludes by saying: "A nuclear India, a nuclear  Pakistan, a potentially nuclear Iran, potentially nuclear Iraq,  a nuclear North Korea, perhaps South Korea, perhaps Japan as  well armed with nuclear weapons. What is going to keep them  from using those weapons? There are no security arrangements  that could prevent the next war from being nuclear. There are  other countries that are seeking nuclear weapons and they are  doing the same things that the Iraqi's did, the same type of  procurement, and we in our greed are making the same mistakes."</p>

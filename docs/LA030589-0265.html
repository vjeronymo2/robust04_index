			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'IT'S RIDICULOUS'  </P> <P> After the Times Orange County Edition editorial "It's Ridiculous" (Feb. 12),  covering a Costa Mesa tax surplus that cannot be spent, a reader from Fountain  Valley wrote (Feb. 19) that "taxes . . . will seldom be enough to satisfy the  appetites of government bureaucracies," that "government bureaucracies . . .  are monopolies (with) no competition to keep them honest or frugal," and that  "taxes have to be taken away from citizens before they can be given back."  </P> <P> If our leaders are less than honest and frugal, or if they in turn appoint  people who are less than honest and frugal, why do we keep voting them into  office? Are we, as voters, not doing our jobs? Are we failing to take personal  responsibility for our own governance?  </P> <P> Should we replace our government's civil service personnel system with the  nepotism and cronyism found in other countries? Or should we simply slash  government services with a balanced budget amendment coupled with more tax cuts  and be damned with the transportation, overcrowding, crime, health, education,  housing and environmental problems facing us today? One thing is certain, there  are many people who would just like to avoid paying taxes.  </P> <P> I have lived in Southern California for 30 years and have witnessed a steady  increase in the transportation, overcrowding, crime, health, education, housing  and environmental problems facing us, an increase that has only been  accelerated since the passage of Proposition 13 and the Gann Initiative.  </P> <P> I think that we can do better than this, that we can improve our society and  clean up our environment and be reasonably proud to pass them on to future  generations, but not until we're all willing to ante up our share of the cost.  </P> <P> RIC HEARD  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

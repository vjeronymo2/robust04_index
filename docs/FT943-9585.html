			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Property side spurs recovery at Howard Howard Holdings, the property development and plant hire group, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 405,115 for the 12 months to April 30 - the south London-based group's first year in the black since 1990. Mr John Howard, chairman, attributed the recovery to property development activities. 'Prospects continue to look good and we have now made land purchases to sustain our level of trading,' he said. The recession in construction and housebuilding has gone on for a long time, said Mr Howard, but he believes the better times expected are finally becoming a reality. The outcome, which compared with losses of Pounds 204,749, was struck after interest charges of Pounds 265,227 (Pounds 395,618), and reflected turnover more than doubled to Pounds 6.38m (Pounds 3.07m). Although plant hire had 'another difficult year' there were 'firm indications' of a return to profits by 1995. The dividend is 0.8p (0.5p), payable from earnings of 1.07p (0.56p losses) per share. The shares rose 3p to 28p.</p>

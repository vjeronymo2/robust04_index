			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Anatoliy Chubays, deputy prime minister </F> and chairman of the State Committee for Management of State  Property, on results of the voucher privatization in Moscow on  23 March -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [Chubays] As of today, under the privatization  program, 15,000 large and very large industrial enterprises in  Russia and more than 80,000 small enterprises comprising 70  percent of the total number of small enterprises in Russia have  been turned into joint-stock companies.    I can say that at present, more than half of the gross  national product in Russia is produced outside the state sector.  In the remaining 100 days, we will implement the unprecedented  efforts that are already under way to put up into auction in the  final stage of the voucher privatization of super-efficient and  super-profitable Russian enterprises. According to our plan,  the 12 million people in Russia who have not yet used their  privatization vouchers will receive new opportunities to do this  in the period before 30 June.    We plan to hold more than 4,500 regional voucher auctions in  all Russian regions, with no exception. More than 200  enterprises will be put into all-Russian voucher auctions before  the end of June this year.    Moreover, and this is particularly important for us, we are  talking here about unique enterprises well-known not only in  Russia but also around the world. Among them are unique  enterprises of the fuel and energy complex -- for example, a  large program for privatization of oil enterprises. Whole  groups of Lukoil enterprises will be put into voucher auctions  in the next few months. And Lukoil is the largest oil producer  in Russia, the fourth largest enterprise in Russia. [Word  indistinct] Neftegaz, the Gazprom association, and the Berezka  association will be put into voucher auctions before the end of  the year. Large and efficient motor vehicle works, as well as  many enterprises of the military-industrial complex, will be put  into voucher auctions.    All this has become a reality today. And all this has been  reflected in official documents, inter alia in documents,  according to which, as many as 50 efficient enterprises will be  put into voucher auctions in Moscow alone in the next one and a  half or two months. I have signed an instruction that approves  the schedule for holding these voucher auctions in the very near  future.    There is yet another enterprise that will be sold at voucher  auctions and that I simply must mention here. This is the  largest Russian enterprise, the Norilsk Nickel concern. We have  reached an understanding with the concern management that in the  framework of the voucher privatization the major block of shares  of Norilsk Nickel will be for sale in the open market for all  citizens. I think there is no need to elaborate on Norilsk  Nickel. Suffice it to say that in 1993 the volume of hard  currency proceeds of this enterprise alone amounted to $1  billion. Until very recently there has been nothing of the kind  in the framework of the Russian privatization program. All this  gives us grounds to say unequivocally and confidently that  privatization has entered the home stretch and will be fully  completed before 30 June. [passage omitted]</p>

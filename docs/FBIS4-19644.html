			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- In the view of the German  Government, the economic situation in Germany has "brightened up  again." In western Germany, current data indicates that the  economic recovery is strengthening, says the monthly report of  the Economics Ministry for April, published in Bonn today.  Furthermore, the upturn in the east German economy "broadened  and strengthened considerably."    The labor market, however, is still suffering from the after  effects of the recession and the consequences of substantial  rationalization efforts by companies. The seasonal reduction in  the unemployment figure for March, which fell below 4 million  for the first time in months, was therefore smaller than usual.  In western Germany the March unemployment rate stood at 8.5  percent and in eastern Germany at 16.8 percent. At the same  time, the ministry points out that unemployment is far from  being exclusively a German problem. In all other European Union  countries the unemployment rate is higher than in Germany, it  notes.    The Economics Ministry bases its optimism about the economy  on a survey carried out by the Munich-based Ifo Institute for  Economic Research among 350 mainly large companies, which expect  an average increase in production of 1.25 percent in 1994.  Moreover, new orders in industry and in the construction sector  increased noticeably at the beginning of the year. The retail  trade sector also registered a slight increase in turnover.  Production in eastern Germany will even "expand strongly," the  ministry said. At the start of the year orders in east  Germany's industrial sector were almost 15 percent up on the  previous year's level. Production was 16 percent higher than  the previous year's level. Orders in the construction industry  were up 29 percent.    According to the figures, inflation continues to ease. In  western Germany the annual rate in March was 3.2 percent and in  eastern Germany it was 3.5 percent.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Survey of Tunisia (2): The gods are still smiling - Francis Ghiles looks at the country's economic performance Despite a severe drought during the past 12 months, which will shave an estimated 1-1.5 per cent off the growth rate of Tunisia's gross domestic product this year, the gods are still smiling on its economic performance. Eight years into the structural adjustment backed by the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Tunisia's economy is expected to chalk up a growth rate of 5 per cent, more than twice the rate of increase of its population (1.85 per cent). This should allow the creation of virtually all the 62,000 jobs needed annually to avoid a rise in unemployment, which affects just under 16 per cent of the workforce. The budget deficit as a percentage of GDP has been cut from 5.2 per cent on average in the mid-1980s to 3.3 per cent in 1993 and is expected to fall to 1.9 per cent this year. Government expenditure will decline from 37.1 to 35.6 per cent of GDP in 1994. Meanwhile, the tax take continues to rise. Direct taxes account for TD700m, a quarter of the total, and income from this source grows by 25 per cent every year. Overall, the introduction of VAT and the lowering of tax thresholds are yielding handsome dividends. Exports rose by 26.5 per cent in the first half of this year to TD2bn, fuelled by a better performance of the manufacturing sector where many firms in the textile and electronics sectors have become more competitive, and benefiting from a better economic climate in the European Union, which accounts for 77 per cent of all Tunisian exports. The state monopoly on olive oil sales was abolished last year. Private entrepreneurs have actively marketed existing stocks which were exceptionally large because of last year's bumper crop. Receipts from tourism are expected to rise by a fifth this year to TD1.34bn while remittances from Tunisians working abroad should increase to TD680m. While such figures may lack the glamour offered by the performance of south-east Asian economies, steady growth provides a key to Tunisia's economic and social stability. A recent IMF study on Tunisia's experience of reform, 'The path to convertibility and growth', suggests other key factors are at play. Three, in particular, are worth noting. The thorough preparation of reforms has made for relatively smooth implementation. This, in turn, requires a strong civil service. Tunisia's investment in education after independence has paid off. Furthermore, although real salaries in the civil service were eroded after 1986, the government-brokered wage pacts prevented a major brain drain from the public to the private sector which would have reduced the government's implementation capacity. Finally, adequate social security systems and safety nets have played a key role in avoiding an erosion in public support for the process of economic adjustment. Foreign investment has grown, though much of it is accounted for by projects in the energy sector. Last year's slowdown is, in the view of senior ministers, a reflection of the restructuring and recapitalisation currently under way in Tunisian private firms. They believe it is now starting to pick up. Prudent external debt policies have improved Tunisia's debt service ratio and reduced debt service payments, as a percentage of exports of goods and services, from 28 per cent in 1986 to below 20 per cent today. Two years ago, Tunisia re-entered the international financial markets by securing a Dollars 100m syndicated loan; earlier this year, it raised its first Samurai bond, for Y30bn, and now it is preparing the ground for a credit rating with Standard and Poor's and Moody's which will allow it to raise a US domestic bond or a eurobond. Privatisation is proceeding, albeit in the eyes of some observers, at a slow pace. Forty-three companies have been privatised so far for TD176m. Sales of hotels account for half this figure, followed by mechanical industries, food processing and textiles. Ministers insist that receipts from privatisation are not earmarked to cover the budget deficit; hence they see no need for what they consider as 'grand gestures' such as the public announcement of long lists of companies up for sale. Most of the companies so far privatised are said to be no longer losing money and have shed little labour. Selling stakes in companies such as Tunis Air and the cement plants is expected to be the next step. Tunisian caution on this front is also dictated by the fact that most of the leading businessmen in Tunis know what their peers are up to, because of extensive family links. This makes the government wary about the risk of turning a public monopoly into an unofficial private cartel. The president is, according to senior economic advisers, determined to stay the course of economic reform, albeit at a pace he feels he can politically afford. It is not only the economic and trade figures that are changing. A new generation of younger, better educated entrepreneurs is taking over, many of whom speak English. They are exploring markets beyond the traditional EU ones, most notably in south-east Asia and northern Europe. A large delegation of businessmen has just come back from South Africa. Some Tunisians wish that Utica, the employers' federation, was less beholden to companies which grew up behind tariff barriers and more supportive of those which are battling to sell Tunisian products abroad. Nonetheless, a quiet revolution is afoot, which has not only witnessed the rise of younger, better-educated men to senior cabinet posts, but also the drawing of talent for government service from all the regions of the country. The Sahel region, from which former President Habib Bourguiba came, is no longer over-represented, and the south and west of Tunisia have powerful voices in the senior echelons. These changes also reflect the head of state's concern to see that the poorer regions do not feel left out of the general slow rise in prosperity. Helping these regions may not be strictly 'economical' but, in the eyes of senior Tunisians, redressing the balance which has so longer favoured the coastal regions is essential to the country's longer-term prosperity. Senior ministers feel they have laid the groundwork to steady growth. Tariff barriers have come down, and the bulk of imports has been freed, as shops in the major cities bear witness. Such displays may excite the envy of some, but they provide a vital element which is prodding domestic producers into improving the quality of what they sell and learning the commercial ways of the modern world. Nothing better illustrates the new climate than the decision by the private Loukil Group to offer 10 per cent of its shares through a public offering on the stock exchange earlier this month. Private companies have traditionally been based on family networks. Increasing the capital of such groups and opening them up to a broader range of shareholders are essential if Tunisia's private sector is to meet the challenge of world markets. Some seasoned observers of the Tunisian scene believe the next step the country's leader should take is to encourage the larger private Tunisian groups to play a more visible and active role in economic relations with foreign partners. They complain that fear of what is going on in neighbouring Algeria, as much as any other consideration, is making the government too cautious. That caution may frustrate the rising breed of bolder, modern Tunisian entrepreneurs but, when the economic achievements of the past eight years are taken into account, it could well turn out not to have been a bad thing.</p>

			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Financial Times Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): The high-growth tax saver that turned to catastrophe - Hindsight / Brenda Vernelle wanted to top up her savings as she approached retirement, so she bought a maximum investment plan. However, the advantages that she had been led to expect quickly evaporated ABOUT THIS time every year, financial salesmen unleash their most effective weapon - the 'buy now while stocks last' argument. The end of the tax year is helpful to them; but also, every budget is preceded by speculation that some tax loophole or by speculation thatn some tax loophole or by speculation than some tax loophole or another is about to be closed. In the haste that surrounds these occasions, many investors find themselves with inappropriate products. This is not surprising - if the tax loophole was worth exploiting in the first place, investors would have considered it already. But it can be worse. Sometimes, in haste, the client does not even get the tax advantages. This was the story for Brenda Vernelle, a polytechnic lecturer from Huddersfield, Yorkshire, who was sold a Save &amp; Prosper maximum investment plan (Mip) in the spring of 1984. A Mip is a life assurance plan, which lasts a minimum of 10 years. The amount of life cover bought with premiums is kept to a minimum, while the maximum allowable goes towards investment. Thus it is effectively just a savings plan, which brings limited life cover tagging along. The spring of 1984 was when life assurance premium relief was removed in the budget. Until then, tax relief was available on premiums paid into the plan, which then went on to produce tax-free pay-outs from a relatively tax-efficient fund. That tax relief was stopped, except for policies already in force. There had been much speculation that such a move was in the pipeline, and so Ms Vernelle, who wanted to step up her savings as she approached retirement, was persuaded to open a Mip. She submitted her forms, and paid her first premiums, in April 1984, before the tax changes came into effect. But there was a problem. She said: 'There was a muddle over getting the doctor's report on it initially, and by the time this came, even though I had already paid three months on it, new legislation had been implemented, and I lost tax relief on it anyway.' This more or less destroyed the point of taking out the plan. However, Ms Vernelle decided to carry on, under pressure from her salesman, who left the company shortly afterwards. Before taking it out, she had also asked for confirmation that the 10-year limit was not binding. At that point, she wanted to retire at the age of 62, an age she attained this year, which meant that she would ideally need to surrender it after 7 1/2 years. She was assured that she could do this without tax penalty, and that any penalty for early encashment would be trivial. In the event, she wanted to cash it in after seven years, in April 1991. By this time she had paid in total premiums of Pounds 8,400. The total she received as a pay-out was Pounds 8,725.81. As she wryly pointed out, there was no problem with paying tax on this sum] Total charges for early discontinuance of the policy had taken a bite of Pounds 459.24 - rather more than her salesman had led her to believe. For what was supposed to be a tax-efficient high-growth investment to boost her retirement savings, the investment had proved to be 'catastrophic'. Base rates stood at 14 per cent at the time she took the cash, and building societies had consistently offered basic-rate taxpayers returns above the rate of inflation throughout the period of her investment. The Mip had not even come close to beating inflation. With hindsight, it is easy to see how it happened. Mips rely on unit-linked investments, and can switch between a variety of funds. This is an attractive feature, particularly when the provider has as large a range of funds as Save &amp; Prosper, because it allows investors to 'play the market' and catch the areas of best growth at any time. But it also makes mistakes easy. And after four years of mediocre performance - in the wake of the Black Monday crash in October 1987 - April 1991 was not a good time to take the profits from a unit-linked investment. On the advice of various different salesmen, Ms Vernelle's Mip switched from the Global Equity fund, which had been doing well, to the Special Situations fund in April 1988. This was a bad time to move into a speculative fund, and it lost money. There was a later switch into European Growth, which also lost money. Other choices of fund could have delivered a better pay-out, but the advice was not there. Eventually, having taken retirement earlier than she had planned, she was advised to cut her losses and encash the policy - another move which hindsight suggests would have been a mistake, as the market has picked up in the past 18 months. Ms Vernelle reported the case to the Consumers' Association, for its Worst Buys of the Year study. Somewhat alarmingly, it was not the worst. This is because this kind of case is all too common - many other people close to retirement have been rushed into investments for tax reasons, and done badly. Jean Eaglesham, of the Consumers' Association, draws several conclusions from the affair: 'One lesson is to try always to get the salesman's recommendation in writing, and push them as hard as you can for the conditions of their recommendations. If there's a good reason to go into it, get that in writing if at all possible. Get any recommendation to be as detailed as possible, and don't be frightened to go back to them.' Such a 'reason why' letter from an adviser will become a legal requirement if the new rules on disclosure advocated by the Securities and Investments Board are adopted. The requirement seems to be overdue, as the CA has had many cases of people who had relied on verbal recommendations, and could not pin the company down for compensation when the advice turned out to be wrong. Fortunately, in this case there was a happy ending. After being contacted by the FT, Mr Colin Rye, of Save &amp; Prosper's insurance division, said the circumstances made it sufficiently clear that Ms Vernelle was planning to surrender early that he was prepared to make an ex gratia refund of her discontinuance charges, even though there was nothing in writing to prove what she had been told. Ms Vernelle was very pleased about this, as it belatedly makes up for one of her greatest problems with the product. Ms Eaglesham adds: 'Don't assume that the salesmen are acting in your best interest. It is worth going to them on the assumption that they are working for themselves.' Ms Vernelle's ultimate complaint, as she contemplates retirement on these low savings, is that the full risks were never made clear. She says: 'I do think that something which is as chancy as that is not a marvellous way of saving for your future. Ten years ahead, it's a terrible gamble if your savings depend on the value of the market on one particular day.'</p>

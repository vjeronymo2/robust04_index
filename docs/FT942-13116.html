			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Indian dam suicide threat A group of Indian environmentalists has threatened mass suicide by drowning unless the government abandons construction of a dam they say will displace thousands of tribal people in three central states, Reuter reports from New Delhi. The environmentalists say nearly 170,000 people, most of them tribespeople in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, would be displaced if the Sardar Sarovar Project on the river Narmada were completed. They say that with seasonal monsoon rains set to break over the three states next month, 1,500 tribal families face an immediate threat of flooding unless the government opens up sluice gates which have already been built for the dam.</p>

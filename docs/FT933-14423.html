			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / International Company News: GE ahead at Dollars 1.3bn for quarter - Strong performances from financial services and power systems GENERAL Electric, the diversified US manufacturing and services group, yesterday reported a 10 per cent increase in net earnings for the second quarter. The group benefited from strong operating performances at its financial services and power systems businesses. The company reported earnings of Dollars 1.33bn, or Dollars 1.56 a share, compared with Dollars 1.21bn, or Dollars 1.42, in the same period of last year. Revenues rose by 4 per cent to Dollars 14.8bn. The figures were slightly ahead of the Wall Street consensus and GE shares closed Dollars  5/8 higher at Dollars 98 on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. The quarter's results were distorted by the company's disposal of its aerospace business in April to Martin Marietta, also of the US. It recorded a Dollars 678m, or 79 cents a share, after-tax gain on the sale which Mr Jack Welch, the chairman, said had been used to fund restructuring operations to enhance operations. The one-time restructuring charge of 79 cents a share was classified as a reduction of continuing operations and the gain on the sale was classified as an increase in discontinued operations. This meant that net earnings from continuing operations totalled Dollars 656m, or 77 cents a share, down 42 per cent, in spite of the 10 per cent gain at the net level. Mr Welch said that the operating margin for the quarter was a record 14.2 per cent, compared with 12.8 per cent a year ago. Earnings at GE Capital Services, the financial services group, were 19 per cent ahead of 1992, with 16 of its 23 subsidiaries having record first-half earnings, including Kidder Peabody, its once-troubled securities house. Power systems recorded 'much higher' on-going operating profit on higher revenues, due to a strong performance by the power generation business. Aircraft engines had flat operating profits on a considerable drop in revenues. However, the company said that lower shipments of engines and spare parts were somewhat mitigated by revenues associated with the consolidation of a recently-acquired engine maintenance and management services business in Wales.</p>

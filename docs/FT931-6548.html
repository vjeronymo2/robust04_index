			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / A rich new seam: The UK's latest source of energy Natural gas trapped in coal seams could give Britain a vast new source of usable energy. Geologists say UK reserves of coalbed methane, as the gas is called, may exceed 1,000bn cubic metres - comparable with the total volume in conventional North Sea gas fields. The oil industry is starting to drill wells to extract the methane, which Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, believes 'could represent a very valuable addition to our future energy supplies'. Yet it has hardly been mentioned in the debate currently raging about coal and gas in the UK. 'There seems to be a conspiracy of silence,' says one operator. 'No one wants to talk about a new huge source of gas at a time when many people think we already have more than we need.' Several technical, fiscal and regulatory obstacles will have to be overcome before Britain can exploit coalbed methane on the same scale as the US, where gas is now flowing at a rate of 30m cu m a day. But it could offer a vital supplement to UK gas supplies early in the next century, when the main offshore reserves are likely to have been used up. The Department of Trade and Industry awarded the first eight exploration licences for coalbed methane in 1991; 27 more followed last year. They cover coalfields in England, Wales and Scotland. UK exploration for methane is led by companies with US experience. Evergreen Resources, based in Colorado, is now testing the first well, Sealand-1 just west of Chester in north-west England, and is drilling a second well south of Rhyl on the north Wales coast. 'We believe Sealand is capable of production but we are still evaluating its commercial possibilities,' says Mr Ian Thompson, Evergreen's UK managing director. A dozen other companies are involved in UK coalbed methane exploration. They include Eastern Electricity, Kirkland Resources, Hillfarm Coal, Puffin Oil, Babcock Energy, Powergen and Conoco. All are drilling well away from collieries which could interfere with gas production. Any well is bound to find some methane because all coal seams contain the gas, adsorbed chemically on the surface of coal particles and filling the tiny spaces between them. The question is whether it can be extracted in commercial quantities. The methane is traditionally regarded as a safety hazard in coalmines. It has to be drained from the seams to prevent explosive quantities building up underground. Although small amounts of gas are sometimes used locally, for example to fire colliery boilers, it is normally vented into the atmosphere  -a waste of energy similar to the flaring of natural gas in an oilfield. From the environmental point of view it is better to extract methane for use as a fuel, because it is a powerful 'greenhouse gas'. Each molecule contributes 50 times more to global warming than a molecule of carbon dioxide. Commercial exploitation of coalbed methane started in the US during the 1970s, stimulated by new federal tax credits for unconventional gas production. Six thousand wells have been drilled in three main areas in Colorado/New Mexico, Alabama and Pennsylvania. The technology developed for extracting methane depends first on creating long fractures in the coal seam to enable the gas to flow more easily. The simplest technique, hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water at high pressure. Then the pressure is reduced at the surface - for example, by pumping water out of the well - to stimulate the flow of gas. Mr Eric Allen, an engineer with LAS Energy, a Canadian methane company, says the technology has improved significantly over the past 10 years. 'With recent advances in completion techniques, many new wells produce at levels which are spectacular by any conventional comparison.' Gas does not flow through coal seams as readily as through conventional sandstone reservoirs, so coalbed extraction generally requires more wells for a given area. But methane enthusiasts say the latest wellhead equipment does not make an obtrusive impact on the landscape. 'Drilling costs are higher in the UK than in the US but all other factors appear to compare favourably with the most productive areas in the US,' says Mr John Garratt, managing director of Puffin Oil, an independent energy company with methane interests in both countries. One attraction of the UK market is that gas prices 'are among the highest in the world'. But Mr Henry Boyd, secretary of the UK Onshore Operators Group, says: 'Coalbed methane will not be a bonanza for anyone. The returns will at best be moderate.' Mr Boyd points out that the outlook for coalbed methane in the UK is overshadowed by uncertainties about the fiscal and regulatory regimes. These are spelt out in a memorandum on coalbed methane prepared by Oil Management Services (OMS), a London consultancy which provides the group's administration. The main fiscal uncertainty concerns the point at which petroleum revenue tax would apply to a coalbed methane field. OMS says the reaction of some US companies is: 'Let us know when the UK works out its tax regime; meanwhile we will go to third-world countries which do know what their tax regime is.' A more fundamental legal question is: who owns coalbed methane? British Coal maintains that its property includes not only all coal in the UK but also the gas trapped within it. The onshore operators, on the other hand, insist that the methane belongs to the crown, although most agree that British Coal's permission is required to drill into its seams. 'Licensees have been outraged at the claims being made by British Coal,' says OMS. 'They did not expect to be required to make substantial additional payments to British Coal as a condition for exercising their petroleum licences.' The operators are lobbying the DTI hard to resolve the uncertainties and encourage methane production. The incentive is not only to provide a new indigenous energy source for the next century; it is also to lay the foundations for a UK industry which could export services and equipment to other European countries seeking to exploit their coalbed methane resources, just as the North Sea fields provided the basis for Britain's offshore oil and gas industry.</p>

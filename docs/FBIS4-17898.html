			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Golovnin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, April 27 (TASS) -- The Japanese Ministry for  Foreign Trade and Industry has asked Russia to send its special  representative to North Korea in order to personally control the  scrapping of Russian submarines sold to the Korean People's  Democratic Republic, which will rule out their use for military  purposes. Otherwise, Tokyo theatens to block the deal, which is  being effected with Japanese mediation.    ITAR-TASS was informed about this action by a representative  of the "Toen Shioji" firm, which had organised the contract to  deliver decommissioned Russian submarines to North Korea. He  confirmed that, in accordance with the Japanese legislation, the  government had the right to licence deals connected with  potential armaments and that local firms were prohibited effect  such transactions abroad. According to available information,  the Russian side has still not replied to the demand to send a  special representative to North Korea.    A senior official of the Japanese Ministry for Foreign Trade  and Industry refused to comment on this information. However,  he said that the Russian side had informed Tokyo through the  Japanese Embassy in Moscow that the decommissioned submarines  were being sold to North Korea as scrap metal and could not be  regarded as military hardware.    A representative of the "Toen Shioji" firm said that only  one  decommissioned and disarmed submarine was so far delivered to  North Korea where it was already scrapped. Under the  above-mentioned contract, twelve Russian submarines, which are  now being kept in half-sunken condition and are heavily  rust-eaten, are to be delivered to North Korea. However, at  present the "Toen Shioji" will have to get a separate permission  from Japanese authorities to deliver each of them to North Korea.    The hullabaloo around this deal was raised in January, when  the American press reported that Moscow, with Japanese  mediation, had allegedly sold to North Korea a whole fleet of 40  decommissioned diesel submarines, capable of carrying 20  torpedoes each and laying sea mines. U.S. special services, the  newspaper "ASAHI" wrote, had expressed apprehensions to Tokyo  that those submarines could be used for military purposes.</p>

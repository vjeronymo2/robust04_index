			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin conferred in Moscow  with President Yeltsin for one hour, and Israeli sources said it  was a warm and good meeting. President Yeltsin and his foreign  minister told Rabin that Russia's deputy prime minister is now  visiting Damascus and will take up the issue of Israeli POW's  and MIA's. He was also instructed to promote the negotiations  between Israel and Syria.    President Yeltsin stressed to the prime minister that Russia  will not provide Syria with new military equipment, only spare  parts. Our correspondent Shlomo Raz adds that both men mentioned  the danger of Islamic extremism. President Yeltsin said that  this extremist movement is a danger to Russia and that his  government is trying to build a belt to keep Islamic extremism  away from the republics bordering on Iran.    Our correspondent notes that the Russians are pressing the  Israeli delegation to sign a trade agreement. Israel has  several reservations about clauses in the proposals, but the  agreement might still be signed.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1000 GMT on 26 April, in a  similar report by Qobi Meydan, adds the following recorded  remarks by Rabin following his meeting with Yeltsin: "I  understood from the meeting with the president, the prime  minister, and the foreign minister that Russia, unlike in the  past, is interested in assuring progress in peace, security, and  stability in the Middle East, and perhaps not only in the Middle  East. From my viewpoint as an Israeli, however, that was the  main issue I wanted to understand about the Russian position.  Russia, together with the United States, will continue to act  as cosponsor of the peace negotiations with our three  neighboring Arab states and with the Palestinians."]</p>

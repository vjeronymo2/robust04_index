			<p>BFN     [Text] Xining, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Seven consecutive years  of bumper grain harvests have been achieved in northwest China's  Qinghai Province due to years of hard efforts in building water  control facilities.    The province has limited precipitation and water resources.  While ensuring a proper use of the existing water conservancy  facilities, the province each year uses 80 percent of its  development fund for building a group of water control works  capable of storing water, preventing floods, irrigating farmland  and generating electricity.    In the past four years, the province has constructed 800  water control projects, including more than 2,000 km of  irrigation channels.    Farming conditions have also been improved. For instance,  the province has in the past four years created 124,000 hectares  of terraced fields, reclaimed 26,664 hectares of farmland,  enlarged the province's total irrigated area by 21,332 hectares,  carried out comprehensive treatment of over 100 small river  valleys, and planted 5,333 hectares of trees.    The efforts have not only guaranteed plenty of water for  agricultural production, but also helped solve drinking water  shortages for farmers, herdsmen and livestock in poverty-hit  areas in eastern Qinghai and in areas around Qinghai Lake.    Small hydro-electric stations built in valleys of the Yellow  River, Golmud River and Datong River have helped alleviate the  shortage of electricity in nearby rural areas.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (13): Institute means business - The Tec IF MONTERREY'S big companies are still for the most part owned by its old families, they are to a large extent run by the product of one institution: the Monterrey Institute for Technical and Higher Studies, known as the 'Tec'. The institute was created 50 years ago to provide engineers for city industry and its approach today remains business-oriented. Now the Tec has 62,000 students on 26 campuses throughout Mexico, 14,000 of them in Monterrey. It has a Dollars 200m a year budget, 30-40 per cent of which comes from companies and the rest from tuition. The Tec's alumni are to be found all over Latin America. But important though training of engineers is for Mexico, the work of the Tec does not end there. It sees its business as preparing Mexican business for the challenges it faces, in the area of management, of technology and the environment. The Tec's Competitiveness Centres have been established to look at productivity issues; its research, usually sponsored by Mexican companies, aims to keep abreast of new manufacturing technology. A recent visit to Monterrey showed researchers studying the use of robots in flexible manufacturing processes and the manufacture of plastic products - such as chain links and artificial hip joints - in a single process without the necessity to make joins. Mr Rafael Rangel, the Tec's president, expresses a concern increasingly heard in Mexico: the ability of small- and medium-sized companies to survive in an open economy. These companies' access is limited to reasonably-priced credit, management techniques and to new technology. 'We have a problem with productivity and we have a long way to go. Some people blame only the exchange rate, but there is more to it than that. It's not just a matter of labour; the owners have to be convinced that they can improve productivity by training and through new production systems. 'Medium-sized and small industry is most affected. Large industry is going to survive very well.'</p>

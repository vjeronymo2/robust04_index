			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Public Participation and Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency is publishing this action as a direct final rule because it views the changes contained within as non-controversial and anticipates no adverse or critical comments. This action will be effective September 19, 1994 unless the Agency receives notice by August 19, 1994 that adverse or critical comments will be submitted, or that a party requests the opportunity to submit such oral comments pursuant to section 307(d)(5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended. If such notice is received regarding a change to a particular regulatory provision, the provision in question will be withdrawn before the effective date by publishing a subsequent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice withdrawing the direct final rule for the identified provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parties that submit adverse or critical comments, notify EPA of intentions to submit such comments, or request a public hearing within the allotted time period should identify the specific provision(s) at issue by specifying the preamble section numbers that discuss the provision(s). For instance, comments on the change to the oxygen valid range limits should include a reference to Section (Item Number) II.A.1 of the preamble. Comments on any of the insubstantial errors in Section I of the preamble should include a reference to the identification code associated with each change in that section. For instance, adverse comments on the paragraph reference change in &sect;80.41(h)(2)(iii) should include a reference to Item Number I&hyph;A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA will withdraw from final action only those specific provision(s) identified by the commenters or persons who notify EPA of their intent to comment or who request an opportunity to submit oral comments. All provisions in today's action that are not commented upon or for which EPA does not receive notice as described above will become effective September 19, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Statutory Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statutory authority for the actions finalized today is granted to EPA by Sections 114, 211 (c) and (k) and 301 of the Clean Air Act, as amended; 42 U.S.C. 7414, 7545 (c) and (k), and 7601.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Administrative Designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to Executive Order 12866, (58 FR 51735 (October 4, 1993)) the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to OMB review and the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines ``significant regulatory action'' as one that is likely to result in a rule that may:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this direct rule is not a ``significant regulatory action''. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> X. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires federal agencies to examine the effects of the renewable oxygenate regulation and to identify significant adverse impacts of federal regulations on a substantial number of small entities. Because the RFA does not provide concrete definitions of ``small entity,'' ``significant impact,'' or ``substantial number,'' EPA has established guidelines setting the standards to be used in evaluating impacts on small businesses. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  For purposes of the renewable oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline, a small entity is any business which is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field as defined by SBA regulations under section 3 of the Small Business Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Memorandum to Assistant Administrators, ``Compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act,'' EPA Office of Policy, Planning, and Evaluation, 1984. In addition, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Memorandum to Assistant Administrators, ``Agency's Revised Guidelines for Implementing the Regulatory Flexibility Act,'' Office of Policy, Planning, and Evaluation, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes that the interpretations, clarifications, and corrections published in today's final action are unlikely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. In fact, the revisions contained herein are designed to promote successful implementation of the reformulated gasoline program for all regulated parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 80  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Fuel additives, Gasoline, and Motor vehicle pollution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 27, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol M.

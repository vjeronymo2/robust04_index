			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Books: Doorman to the modern world GALILEO: A LIFE by James Reston Jnr Cassell Pounds 18.99, 319 pages We read for many reasons, most of them not very lofty. Among the more significant are these two: that we need to understand ourselves, and to know our world. With the exception of Barbara Cartland-style pulp, most books do something for us in one or other direction. Great literature is great because it does much in both. But great literature does not come off the presses every day. We could survive on a diet of mere competence - novels a shade thin; poetry a touch too strained - but our usual resource is to return to the classics, which have that status because they satisfy us richly. There is however another resource, and it constitutes the most rapidly growing literary genre of the 20th century: biography. Biography fully meets the two needs noted, satisfying them through our curiosity about the lives, times and circumstances of our fellows. It is an essential human trait to gossip, to eavesdrop, spy and pry; and it is essential because without it none of us could be fully human or social. The only way we have of interpreting ourselves and others, and therefore of finding our way through the vast fabric of relationships that constitutes the social world, is to be primed with insight into human nature and its variety. Gossip is vital; literature, biography and history are gossip writ large; we therefore cannot live without them. Anyone's life is interesting, even that of a village Hampden in a sequestered vale. But to read about great lives, lives which change the world, is to get not just biography but history. Galileo Galilei's life is historic in just this way. If any one man acted as doorman to the modern world, he has an excellent claim to the title. In this readable, characteristic example of the American style in popular biography, James Reston takes us through Galileo's tale, hooking it firmly to events in the contemporary world: the flight of the spacecraft Galileo to Jupiter, still taking place as this is written, and the decision of the Vatican in 1992 to acknowledge its fault in ill-treating Galileo three and a half centuries ago, by dragging him before the Inquisition, humiliating and imprisoning him. Indeed Galileo's story is a microcosm of the epic struggle between science and religion. Galileo was inquisitive, inventive, mathematically adept. He was fascinated by the view above him in the clear Italian night sky. He perfected the telescope, and terrified the church by revealing more stars than had been guessed before, hitherto unseen satellites orbiting other planets, valleys and mountains on the surface of our moon. Because scripture taught that the earth sits immovably in the centre of the universe, whose celestial spheres are driven round by angels, the church could not tolerate this new vertiginous cosmology. It threatened their authority. By threats and intimidation, Pope Urban VIII forced Galileo to recant his espousal of the Copernican system. That the church should only come to its own recantation in 1992 speaks volumes about the conflict of faith and reason. Galileo was the son of a court musician who made some of the earliest experiments in opera. Galilei pere had his son educated at the famous abbey of Vallombrosa, and then rescued him from a desire to remain there as a monk. As ever with fathers, he wished Galileo to follow a profession, and enrolled him at Pisa University to study medicine. But Galileo's heart lay in mathematics. By persistence and chutzpah he secured a lectureship first at Pisa and then at the more prestigious Padua University, and launched himself on his razor-edge dance of danger with the Inquisition. Galileo not only made discoveries of the first importance in astronomy and physics - especially in the laws of motion, thus breaking the stranglehold of Aristotelian ideas - but he was also an inventive genius. He devised pendulums for clocks, ways of improving telescopes, instruments for measuring pulse-rate and temperature. His telescopic discoveries made him an international star; despite disgrace by the Inquisition he had correspondents and visitors from all over Europe, including among the latter Thomas Hobbes and John Milton - who set the fallen Lucifer's realm in a Tuscan landscape. All this is told in easy style by Reston, who is a novelist as well as a biographer, and uses those techniques to recreate mood and circumstance. Most of the many books about Galileo are not quite so pool-side as this, being more scholarly and philosophical; which is a reason for welcoming Reston's offering, as a pleasant introduction to an important life.</p>

The Japanese Have Learned This From a Secret Report by  the Russian General Staff"]    [Text] Tokyo -- The Japanese weekly SHUKAN BUNSHUN carries  a detailed account of a secret report on North Korean nuclear  affairs prepared by the Russian General Staff and an interview  with an unnamed official involved in compiling that report,  referred to in a note as "a leader." The report is entitled  "The Russian Federation's Military Policy in the Asia and  Pacific Region Under the New Military-Political Conditions."    It seems that more can be seen from the top of our General  Staff building than from the U.S., Japanese, or NATO  counterparts. At any rate, Russian specialists and analysts are  more candid on the problem of the North Korean nuclear program  and stricter in their judgments than their Western colleagues,  who recently have repeatedly shared information with journalists  -- true, their own journalists, not foreigners. It follows from  the report, prepared for Grachev and then forwarded to Yeltsin  (according to the Japanese magazine, which was told all this by  our talkative secret agents in Moscow), that Pyongyang has  scored major achievements in implementing a missile program and  a nuclear program. The DPRK already has its own nuclear  warheads and several hundred delivery vehicles capable of  delivering the payload.    It is clear from the Russian report and from the mysterious  "leader's" comments on it that Pyongyang embarked with  particular zeal on its nuclear missile program in the second  half of the eighties, with active Russian participation. Almost  160 Russian nuclear scientists and missilemen have passed  through North Korean laboratories and specialized centers since  then. At present nine Russian nuclear scientists and 17 highly  qualified missile specialists are working in North Korea. This  is outside the framework of bilateral cooperation and is  unofficial, as it were -- according to the "leader's" comments,  many of our scientists have changed their names, and some have  taken DPRK citizenship. Only it is not this that is important  but the fact that the project to create the Korean Nodong-1  intermediate-range missile was successfully completed with the  assistance of Russian brains, and North Korea has accumulated a  sufficient stock of enriched nuclear raw materials with the help  of Russian scientists and technologies and now possesses  approximately 10-12 kg of uranium-235 and 20 kg of  plutonium-239. Citing the testimonies of four Russian  specialists who recently returned from the DPRK after working in  Korean nuclear complexes, the report maintains that Pyongyang  already possesses one or two nuclear warheads and by the end of  this year will roll several more off the conveyor belt. The  DPRK is now engaged in creating a new generation of Nodong-2  solid-fuel missiles with an increased hit range. According to  Russian estimates, in the very near future our fuel technologies  and know-how and our missile scientists and solid-fuel  specialists will be objects of special attention for Pyongyang's  agents.    In this connection the report proposes revising all existing  technological agreements between Russia and the DPRK, stopping  the leak of cadres, and devoting special attention to  bridge-building with the United States, South Korea, and Japan  for extensive coordination of actions. It is even proposed that  we think about the prospect of creating some kind of regional  ABM system involving Russia, Japan, and the United States. At  the same time it is pointed out that not only Russia but also  China has been involved in the DPRK's nuclear affairs, and the  Chinese factor is now becoming the key one.    The document cited at length by the Japanese magazine is  stamped "top secret" and was prepared by the Russian Defense  Ministry General Staff Military-Strategic Analysis Center.  After being read by Grachev and Yeltsin, extracts from the  report were forwarded on the president's instructions to the  U.S. Defense Department (within the framework of an information  exchange). A facsimile of a Russian Defense Ministry form with  the issue number 001 SM-137 and date of publication 22 October  1993 is even given as an illustration. In short, there are no  doubts about the authenticity of the document itself, but some  questions do arise, and it makes sense to ask them. The first  and most important question: On what unspecified grounds does  Russian General Staff information get into Japanese hands,  accompanied, moreover, by detailed comments and explanations by  a "leader" working, to judge from the wording employed by the  weekly, in the structure of the General Staff itself? Maybe no  major secrets have been divulged, but the question needs to be  answered if only for one reason -- a Japanese audience is the  first to learn about the Russian military department's  assessments, while the Russian audience, as is already the  custom, is considered "second class."    Second question: On what terms and in what circumstances did  the Japanese weekly obtain exclusive material from the Russian  Defense Ministry? If it was on instructions from chiefs  conducting an intricate publicity operation, I would like to  have an idea of that intention. If it was without the chiefs'  knowledge, it would be even better to know the whereabouts of  the secret key which opens Russian General Staff safes for  Japanese guests.    Finally, a third question, again one of considerable  importance: Who in Japan (or some other country) will be the  next happy possessor of Russian secret documents? If the  Russian mass media are not old enough to have the honor of being  the first to learn the Russian military department's viewpoint,  they must at least get their bearings in the information area  and know in which foreign journal or newspaper it will be  possible to familiarize themselves with the views of their own  Defense Ministry.</p>

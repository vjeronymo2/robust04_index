			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BLOCKED SHOT SAVES USD IN 85-84 VICTORY OVER AIA  </P> <P> The University of San Diego won its exhibition basketball game over Athletes in  Action Thursday, but it didn't come easy.  </P> <P> USD center Dondi Bell blocked Rod Foster's driving layup attempt with 13  seconds remaining to preserve an 85-84 victory in front of 1,179 in the USD  Sports Center.  </P> <P> It was USD's second exhibition victory of the season. AIA, which was playing in  San Diego for the first time since moving to Cincinnati from Rancho Bernardo,  fell to 2-9.  </P> <P> Using a 28-10 run to begin the second half, USD built a 15-point lead with 8:35  left. The Toreros were playing very good basketball, and AIA was showing signs  of having played 11 games in 13 days.  </P> <P> USD was leading by eight with 2:46 left, but AIA scored the next seven points  to cut it to 82-81 with 1:05 left. After a Wayman Strickland free throw, Foster  drove the lane attempting to tie the game, but Bell swatted his shot off the  backboard. The Toreros rebounded and held on.  </P> <P> AIA scored the first five points, led, 13-4, after six minutes and never  trailed in the first half. USD forced four ties, but each time AIA regained the  lead immediately.  </P> <P> AIA's Howard Wright, a former standout at Patrick Henry High and Stanford, led  all scorers with 30 points but fouled out with 51 seconds left. Lorenzo Romar  added 18 and Foster 16. AIA was without leading scorer Zack Jones (formerly of  San Diego State), who strained his knee against UCLA Wednesday.  </P> <P> USD had five players in double figures and 10 who scored. Craig Cottrell led  with 14 points. Bell had 13. Kelvin Woods had eight of his 12 points in the  second half, most of which came at crucial times.  </P> <P> USD begins its regular season a week from today at 7:30 p.m. at home against  Cal Lutheran. AIA, which plays 21 games in 25 days in November, plays at  Nebraska tonight.  </P></p>

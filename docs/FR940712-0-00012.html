			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nevertheless, consistent with API's comment and RSPA's statutory authority, we will consider requests for waiver of particular requirements. Any request should be based on evidence of significantly adverse economic impact, low risk, and adequate operation and maintenance practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Compliance Time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Amount of Time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;195.1(d) would have allowed operators of existing low-stress pipelines 1 year after publication of the final rule to comply with parts 195 and 199. However, the NPRM requested comment on whether 1 year would be enough time to prepare existing pipelines for compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An operator said 1 year would not be enough unless RSPA excludes certain economically marginal gathering lines and accepts previous hydrostatic testing. Otherwise the operator said 2 years would be needed to establish an adequate compliance program. One operator said 1 year would be all right for HVL and trunk lines, but 3 years would be needed for other lines. Another operator recommended 3 to 5 years for low-stress pipelines that present a low risk because they carry crude oil with a high flash point. Still another operator said that because many distinct pipelines would be brought under the regulations (possibly 3,000), the minimum compliance period should be 5 years. API and an operator argued that 3, 4, or 5 years would be needed to carry out all the requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NTSB argued that 1 year would be sufficient because many operators of low-stress pipelines have other pipelines that are subject to parts 195 and 199. Also, NTSB said compliance would mostly involve procedural changes. It further said written procedures and documentation are readily available for operators not already involved with parts 195 and 199. A state agency also said 1 year would be sufficient for operators to prepare for compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In view of the diversity of conditions and importance of plans, procedures, and testing, RSPA agrees that many operators will need more than 1 year to complete the steps necessary for existing pipelines to meet parts 195 and 199. Of particular concern is the time needed to craft plans and procedures that address the individual conditions of the many distinct pipelines to which the final rule applies. However, operators should not need more than 90 days to learn about the new requirements and begin reporting accidents that might occur on low-stress pipelines. Also, within 90 days operators should be able to meet part 195 design, construction, and hydrostatic testing requirements on portions of existing pipelines that they replace, relocate, or otherwise change after the effective date of the final rule. Therefore, final &sect;195.1(c) allows existing low-stress pipelines 2 years from today to comply with parts 195 and 199. However, accident reporting under subpart B of part 195 begins 90 days from today. Also, replacements, relocations, and other changes made to existing pipelines on or after 90 days from today must meet the design, construction, and hydrostatic testing requirements of part 195 before operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Note that the allowable compliance time for existing low-stress pipelines is stated in final &sect;195.1(c), instead of &sect;195.1(d) as proposed. We made this change because under existing &sect;195.1(c), the deadline has passed for carbon dioxide pipelines to comply with part 195 (July 12, 1992). Accordingly, the compliance time for carbon dioxide pipelines is being removed from &sect;195.1(c). This change makes &sect;195.1(c) available to state the compliance time for low-stress pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Populated Area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RSPA proposed to define ``populated area'' as ``any onshore area other than a rural area.'' Section 195.2 defines ``rural area'' as ``outside the limits of any incorporated or unincorporated city, town, village, or any other designated residential or commercial area such as a subdivision, a business or shopping center, or community development.'' So a populated area would be an onshore area inside such political, residential, or commercial area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One operator suggested we exclude industrial areas from the definition of populated area. Because of the lack of residential housing and associated small businesses and shopping centers in these areas, the operator said regulation would not increase safety. RSPA strongly disagrees, however, because the rules in parts 195 and 199 protect people at large, not just people in residential communities. Plant personnel and the environment in industrial areas are at risk from low-stress pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An operator asked if part 195 would apply to an entire line section between block valves if only part of the line section crosses a populated area. As previously explained, the pipeline segment inside the populated area and any equipment and controls located elsewhere that are necessary for operation of the segment would have to meet part 195.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 195 currently uses the term ``populated area'' in &sect;&sect;195.234(e)(5), 195.260(c), and 195.306 (b)(1) and (c)(1). We did not intend that the definition of ``populated area'' proposed in the NPRM affect these rules. We proposed the definition merely to clarify the proposed applicability of part 195 to low-stress pipelines. Therefore, the final rule does not contain a definition of populated area. Instead, final &sect;195.1(b)(3), which defines the applicability of part 195 to low-stress pipelines, incorporates the substance of the proposed definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

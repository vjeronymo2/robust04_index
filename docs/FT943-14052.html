			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / VAT on domestic fuel supported The government's controversial imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel and power was yesterday given the full backing of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In a generally upbeat review of the UK economy the organisation, which is owned by 25 industrialised countries, says levying VAT on fuel and power is desirable for reasons other than safeguarding the environment. The organisation applauds the tax because it broadens the VAT-base. It suggests that the VAT rates on fuel, currently 8 per cent and due to rise to 17.5 per cent next April, might be too low. It says: 'Allowing for the environmental costs of energy consumption, an indirect tax rate even higher than the standard VAT rate could be justified on efficiency grounds.' Other UK tax changes of recent years gain less wholehearted support. The organisation notes that more taxpayers have been shifted into higher marginal tax brackets. In addition, the interaction of national insurance contributions and income tax has resulted in an unfair fall in marginal income tax rates for people earning about Pounds 25,000. But in general the organisation praises the supply-side reforms introduced since the 1980s to improve Britain's economic structure, although it warns that 'the process is by no means finished'. The UK, it says, 'now has one of the least regulated labour markets in the OECD'. But as elsewhere, 'much remains to be done to reduce poverty traps, notably for low-skilled unemployed with dependents and those receiving housing benefit'. The report fleshes out the analysis and forecast of the UK economy provided in last month's OECD Economic Outlook. It says Britain has made 'major strides' in restructuring its economy and should experience steady growth with falling unemployment and a manageable current account deficit in the next 18 months. Inflation should not be a problem in the next two years but the Treasury and the Bank of England are urged to remain vigilant and take pre-emptive action to keep inflation low when the economy returns to its long-term trend rate of growth. The OECD warns, however, that unemployment will still be unacceptably high and above its natural rate in late 1995. It says Britain must continue to upgrade the skill level of its labour force in the medium term. OECD Economic Surveys 1993-1994: United Kingdom.

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / SAS increasesits British Midland stake SCANDINAVIAN Airlines System (SAS) is strengthening its ties with British Midland by increasing its stake in the UK carrier's parent company, Airlines of Britain Holding, from 24.9 per cent to 40 per cent for Pounds 25m. The deal follows recent approaches by other airlines interested in acquiring a stake in the UK carrier because of its strong position at London's Heathrow airport. Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of the UK group which owns Manx Airlines and Loganair as well as British Midland, said yesterday he had been approached by several airlines since the UK government abolished the Heathrow traffic distribution rules last year and opened up the airport to new entrants. British Midland controls about 15 per cent of the take-off and landing times, or 'slots', at Heathrow, the world's biggest international passenger airport but also one of the most congested. International airlines, which had been barred from using Heathrow under the old traffic rules, have been anxious to expand their operations at the airport by securing slots. But Sir Michael said his company was keen to strengthen its links with SAS because of successful co-operation between the two airlines during the last three years. 'We reported to SAS the interest other companies were expressing but we also made it clear we wanted to maintain a long-term relationship with SAS,' he said. British Midland has recently negotiated ticketing and co-operation agreements with other carriers including United Airlines, South African Airways, Qantas and Air Canada. The Scandinavian airline acquired its initial 24.9 per cent stake in the UK group for Pounds 25m in 1988. The Civil Aviation Authority is not expected to object to the increased SAS shareholding because control of British Midland remains with UK nationals. Mr Jan Carlzon, chief executive of SAS, said the latest Pounds 25m investment strengthened his airline's strategic position in the UK, the most important market outside Scandinavia for SAS. Sir Michael said British Midland, which started a Heathrow to Brussels service this week, would continue to expand its European network. European services were expected to account for more than 50 per cent of revenues next year rising to around 80 per cent in five years. After losing Pounds 11.9m in 1990, British Midland made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.56m last year, he said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [``deu''-signed report: ``Union Bundestag Group Wants To </F> Facilitate Arms Exports'']    [Text] Bonn -- The dispute dividing government and  opposition on the subject of arms export controls is  intensifying. Pressured by the arms industry, the coalition  Bundestag groups and the Economics Ministry are trying to relax  the German guidelines for arms export, which are stricter than  those of most other countries. One of the reasons for this is  job security. The foreign policy spokesman of the Christian  Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU] Bundestag  Group, Karl Lamers, told a newspaper that the German arms export  guidelines put German companies at a disadvantage: ``Thousands  of jobs and high-tech know-how that are of enormous importance  for the civilian industry threaten to be lost.''    Lamers demands a uniform European Union [EU] policy on arms  exports. This is also mentioned as an objective in the section  on joint foreign and security policy of the Maastricht treaty.  Lamers said that, due to the resistance of other European  states, however, the high German standards cannot be maintained  in Brussels.    Bonn's attempts to facilitate the exporting of arms via  Brussels meet with strong resistance from the Social Democratic  Party of Germany [SPD]. SPD Bundestag Group manager Peter  Struck said the constitution demands that the Bundestag has to  be consulted by the Federal Government first. The  constitutional amendment passed when the Maastricht treaty was  ratified says: ``The Federal Government, before agreeing to an  introduction of new laws by the EU, gives the Bundestag the  opportunity to comment. The Federal Government bases its  negotiations on these comments.''    The deputy SPD chairwoman and European affairs expert,  Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, accused the government of negotiating  a softening-up of the arms export guidelines in the European  Council of Ministers, ``behind the Bundestag's back, ignoring  the constitution, and excluding the public.'' The government is  ``by no means entitled to do this.''    The Economics Ministry denies negotiating uniform export  guidelines for traditional armament products within the EU.  These negotiations only refer to dual-use products. This means  products that can be used for both civilian and military  purposes, such as machinery, special steels, and pesticides.  The government coordinator for aerospace and space technology,  Reinhard Goehner, has repeatedly said that it will not be  possible to maintain the strict German export regulations.  Negotiations on dual-use products have reached the final stage.    The German guidelines for traditional arms and dual-use  products were tightened after the Second Gulf War in early 1991.  United Nations inspectors had discovered that a large share of  Iraqi dictator Saddam Husayn's arms supply came from German  companies. Since then, the German arms industry constantly  complained about disadvantages as compared to other countries,  especially France and Great Britain.    Arms producers from these countries have blamed the Germans  for being unreliable, the German arms industry said. Over the  past four years, 280,000 jobs were lost in the armament  industry. Yet, according to the Stockholm-based SIPRI  Institute, with a 3.1 billion German marks turnover, Germany was  still the world's third-largest arms exporter in 1992.</p>

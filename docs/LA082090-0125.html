			<p><P> August 20, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> TAMMY BAKKER OPENS MINISTRY  </P> <P> Tammy Bakker hopes visitors to Disney World will join her new flock at an  industrial complex nearby after going on the rides at the theme park.  </P> <P> The wife of imprisoned TV preacher Jim Bakker held her first service at the  industrial site Sunday after winning a zoning battle with the help of the  American Civil Liberties Union.  </P> <P> The Bakkers' fall from grace and her husband's fraud conviction for bilking  followers of his PTL ministry made Mrs. Bakker pessimistic about the zoning  fight.  </P> <P> "I was in shock when we finally won it," she told about 60 worshipers Sunday.  "I guess I've kind of gotten used to accepting defeat."  </P> <P> The Orange County Commission had banned religious services at the industrial  park where her ministry has its TV recording studios. ACLU attorneys argued  that the ban was unconstitutional.  </P> <P> Mrs. Bakker said she may hold services on Friday evenings to attract visitors  leaving Disney World.  </P> <P> Her husband is serving a 45-year term in federal prison.  </P> <P> The Bakkers set up an Orlando-based cable TV ministry before his conviction  last year.  </P></p>

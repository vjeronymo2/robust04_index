Local sources said the average income of farmers in 14  villages within the zone increased by 142 yuan to reach 1,092  yuan in 1993.    In some villages, the income of each farmer exceeded 4,000  yuan, the sources said.    A total 17.51 million yuan was put into the zone in 1993 to  finance 12 agricultural high-tech projects.    Model farms of fruit, vegetables, aquatic products and  edible  fungus have been set up under these projects. They involve more  than 100 new farm species and 18 new processing technologies.    A technological service network covering the whole zone and  100 professional societies have been established. They provide  farmers with technological services as well as market  information, the sources said.    Based on detailed investigations, the zone has chosen to  develop grass-eating cows, sheep and geese instead of  grain-consuming pigs, and rare fruit with better market  prospects.</p>

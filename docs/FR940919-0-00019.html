This action provides the option of incorporating a certain wing spar upper cap service kit as either terminating action or as an extension to the repetitive inspections currently required. Wing front spar upper cap cracks at the main landing gear actuating cylinder attachment fitting on three of the affected airplanes prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent wing failure caused by excessive wing spar cracking. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective November 4, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 4, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from the Cessna Aircraft Company, Customer Services, P.O. Box 1521, Wichita, Kansas 67201. This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mr. Larry Abbott, Aerospace Engineer, FAA, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4123; facsimile (316) 946&hyph;4407. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an AD that would apply to certain Cessna Models 421C and 425 airplanes was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 20, 1994 (59 FR 18768). The action proposed to revise AD 91&hyph;25&hyph;08 by maintaining the wing front spar upper cap repetitive inspection and possible crack repair requirement, and adding the option of incorporating the applicable Cessna service kits to either eliminate or extend the inspection time interval (depending on whether cracks are found) of the repetitive inspections. The proposed inspections would be accomplished in accordance with the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of ATTACHMENT TO SERVICE BULLETIN (SB) to Cessna SB CQB91&hyph;8R1, or the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS attachment to Cessna SB MEB91&hyph;7R1, as applicable. The proposed inspection-extending or inspection-terminating modifications (optional) would be accomplished in accordance with the instructions to the applicable service kits that are included as an attachment to the above-referenced service bulletins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the one comment received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter states that, although the proposal does not apply to the serial number airplanes that the commenter owns, all 16 hi-lock pins of each aft main landing gear support (part number 5122724&hyph;1 and 5122724&hyph;2) were found loose during an annual inspection. The commenter believes that the above-referenced main landing gear supports are located in the same general area as the area referenced in the proposal, and that these areas share the same structural loads. For these reasons, the commenter proposes expanding the rule to include an inspection of these main landing gear supports as well as the wing front spar upper caps. The FAA concurs that the referenced main landing gear supports are in the same general area as the wing front spar upper caps (between the main landing gear actuating cylinder attachment and the front spar wing attach fittings); however, the two do not share the same structural loads. The main landing gear supports incur loads from the landing gear while the upper spar caps incur loads from the gear retraction cylinder. This AD is written only to detect and correct wing front spar upper cap cracking because the FAA identified this as an unsafe condition that needed AD corrective action. The FAA will evaluate service difficulty reports on the main landing gear supports, and, if found necessary, will initiate applicable rulemaking at that time. The AD is unchanged as a result of this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

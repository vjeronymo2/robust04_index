			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORYTELLERS: NEW IN APRIL  </P> <P> Never mind what a young man's fancy lightly turns to as the spring flowers  nudge to the surface, the bumper crop this spring is not so much in affairs of  the heart but in the many faces of the evil that surrounds them.  </P> <P> Catherine Gaskin's brooding The Charmed Circle centers on the handsomely  endowed Seymour sisters -- Julia, Constance and Alex -- the beautiful, talented  offspring of renowned actor Sir Michael and concert pianist Ginette Maslova.  The setting: wartime England and Scotland and the immediate postwar years.  While this is overwhelmingly Julia's story and a traditional one of her romance  with -- and marriage to -- James Sinclair, a young flight lieutenant in the  RAF, there is a sense of foreboding from the first moment the young lovers  enter the gloomy, down-at-the-heels Scottish castle to which James is the heir.  </P> <P> In their disparate ways, however, the three Seymour sisters thrive -- Julia  following in her famous actor-father's footsteps and progressing to Hollywood  as a young widow, Alex cutting a journalistic swath in Washington, and  Constance finding contentment closer to home with a somewhat lackluster, but  loving, English civil servant with a bright future.  </P> <P> But the haunting and magnetic pull of the brooding Sinclair Castle that she and  her young, now-fatherless, son have inherited is the albatross around Julia's  neck. Salvation in restoring the crumbling-apart castle seems to come in the  unlikely form of Rod McCallum, the swashbuckling, popular Hollywood movie star  who not only sweeps Julia off her feet but seems equally as dedicated as she in  restoring the place.  </P> <P> By the time the roots of McCallum's twisted fascination with the restoration  become apparent, though, any evil that the castle itself may have radiated has  been dwarfed by his own. And the nightmare for Julia begins.  </P> <P> "The Charmed Circle" is peopled by characters directed by forces beyond their  own control who are being drawn down a path of Stygian darkness. This novel by  the best-selling author of "The Ambassador's Women" is spellbinding, but it's  also as heavy as a double serving of haggis. "The Charmed Circle" is a  Doubleday Book Club selection.  </P> <P> Considerably more upbeat is Coral Lansbury's The Grotto, a sprawling novel that  flits from Sicily to Australia and chronicles the adventures of Gwen Harcourt  de Marineo in the years immediately preceding World War II. But, even though  Gwen's early indiscretions -- including an unwanted pregnancy and being married  off, by proxy, to a drunken lout in Australia (to save the honor of her  Sicilian family) -- end well when her natural talents bring her success down  under, there's an evil shadow hanging over this heroine as well. Much of it is  in the centuries-old Sicilian obsession with honor and grim retribution, as  personified by the grotto of the novel's title -- the dark place at the edge of  the sea where Sicilian mothers took daughters who had dishonored them and  quietly drowned them. Evil, too, in the form of a paternal grandfather with  sinister Mafia connections and in the form of a fleeting fascination on Gwen's  part with Dolfi, the amoral "child of the devil," who resurfaces in her life in  Australia. Suddenly, World War II erupts and Gwen's new, better life is on the  line.  </P> <P> Lansbury, graduate dean at Rutgers who has published, in addition to three  previous novels, a book on Victorian literature and history, has an imagination  equipped with after-burners. This thoroughly engrossing and entertaining story  should never have worked -- the plot is too multilayered and involved. Instead,  it works like a beautifully crafted watch, and Gwen Harcourt de Marineo emerges  as the definitive "Unsinkable Molly Brown."  </P> <P> But are you ready for this? Not only does it work for a novel about UFOs  staffed by funny-looking little people, but by funny-looking little people who  realize that their own genetic makeup needs a bit of patchwork and, as a  result, are engaged in the wholesale abduction of earthlings!  </P> <P> In Nighteyes, author Garfield Reeves-Stevens (he of "Children of the Shroud,"  "Dreamland" and "Bloodshift") advances the thesis that, for decades, UFOs have  been quietly snatching innocent humans off the streets of the United States,  running genetic experiments on them to iron out bugs in their own progeny and  then -- just as quietly -- depositing their guinea pigs back on Earth. The few  who recall, even vaguely, that they have been snatched are a figure of fun at  the periodical rack of the supermarket check-out line. Until, of course, our  friends from Outer Space get sloppy and stage one of their abductions right in  the middle of an FBI surveillance of a Malibu fellow-agent suspected of a  tie-in with Russian agents and which -- on top of everything else -- is also  being photographed by an enterprising journalist. From superior intellects, we  somehow expect tactics a little less reminiscent of a bunch of Army trainees  staging their first night maneuver.  </P> <P> But the evil in "Nighteyes" is not so much with our visitors from space -- who,  actually, are pretty likable -- but with the FBI and the CIA, both of whom see  the Malibu fiasco as an interdepartmental double-cross. And the ensuing body  count (awesome) is racked up not by the space visitor but by the two agencies,  both trying to protect their respective turf.  </P> <P> It's a credit to novelist Reeves-Stevens' craftsmanship that all of this  skulking about -- this flitting back and forth from FBI "safe" houses in places  such as Burbank to dreamlike sequences aboard the UFO -- comes off quite  plausibly and that we really care that the lovers, Beth and Merril, find the  contentment for which they hunger, and that teen-ager Wendy Gilmour's unborn  baby isn't really as unplanned as we had thought.  </P> <P> It's the old power-struggle-among-the-rich-and-pretty that captivates British  novelist Jilly Cooper in Players as a covey of television personalities jockey  for dominance in a battle to strip a prosperous British television company of  its franchise with the Independent Broadcasting Authority. Prosperous or not,  Corinium Television is on shaky ground with the IBA, so management, in the form  of ruthless Tony Bullingham, throws everything but the kitchen sink into the  battle to retain the franchise -- up to, and including, the recruitment of a  beautiful, and equally ruthless, American network executive, Cameron Cook. It's  difficult to envision anyone in his right mind inviting any of the central  characters in "Players" into his home if a minor child is within gunshot of the  place because the name of the game here is s-e-x and the concern is not, as in  "Nighteyes," with body-count but with bed-count. Who's doing what with whom for  the glory of, or the destruction of, good old Corinium Television? Cooper, who  hit the best-seller list with her previous "Riders," has a deft touch with the  heavy panting and artfully shedded negligee routine that is essential to this  sort of plotting, and "Players" will undoubtedly do extremely well in the  predictable libidinous circles. On a likability scale, however, the television  types in this bodice-ripper fall somewhere between Gen. Grant in "Gone With the  Wind" and the seed pods inhabiting "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE CHARMED CIRCLE  </P> <P> by Catherine Gaskin  </P> <P> (Charles Scribner's Sons:  </P> <P> $19.95; 656 pp.)  </P> <P> THE GROTTO  </P> <P> by Coral Lansbury  </P> <P> (Alfred A.

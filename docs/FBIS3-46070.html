Provincial leaders, including [Party Secretary] Li  Changchun, Song Zhaosu, Zheng Zengmao, Song Guochen, and Hu  Shujian, frankly exchanged views at the forum with individuals  in charge of the provincial branches of various democratic  parties, persons in charge of the provincial industry and  commerce federation, and a number of well-known individuals  without any party affiliation and discussed with them various  issues, such as opposing corruption and building a clean  government.    Provincial Party Committee Secretary Li Changchun presided  over the forum. Song Guochen, provincial party committee  standing committee member and provincial discipline inspection  commission secretary, briefed the participants on Henan's  on-going anticorruption struggle and future anticorruption plan.    Song Guochen said: Since 1993 -- especially since the Second  Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Committee  -- Henan has achieved initial successes in the anticorruption  struggle under the unified leadership of the Henan Provincial  CPC Committee.    Song Guochen also called for heightening understanding of  the  significance of Henan's ongoing anticorruption struggle,  unswervingly continuing the anticorruption struggle for a long  time to come, stepping up anticorruption supervision and  examination work, strictly rooting out the malpractices of  holding banquets and distributing gifts at public expense during  the Lunar New Year Festival period, eliminating extravagance and  waste, reinforcing a restriction mechanism and a supervision  mechanism, and gradually systematizing anticorruption work and  placing the work within the orbit of a legal system. [passage  omitted]    Also speaking at the forum were: Ma Ximin, provincial China  Democratic League committee vice chairman; Wang Liurong and  Zhang Tao, provincial Jiusan Society committee vice chairmen; Li  Xuerang, provincial China Democratic National Construction  Association committee vice chairman; Shao Lingfang and Huang He,  provincial Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party  committee chairman and vice chairman; Hu Jiaji, a well-known  individual without party affiliation; Lei Yangzhen and Nie Gang,  Provincial Revolution Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang  committee chairman and vice chairman; Yuan Zhuliang, Provincial  China Association for Promoting Democracy committee chairman;  and Fan Lian, Provincial China Democratic League committee  chairman. [passage omitted]    After conscientiously listening to the views expressed by  the  non-CPC personages, Li Changchun, Song Zhaosu, and other  provincial leaders spoke one after another at the forum.    Comrade Li Changchun said: We should fully understand the  importance of Henan's ongoing anticorruption struggle, adopt a  highly responsible attitude to the CPC, never set opposing  corruption against economic construction, take the ongoing  anticorruption struggle as a protracted and onerous task,  unswervingly continue the ongoing anticorruption struggle in an  in- depth manner for a long time to come, educate cadres to  enhance their own immunity, build an anticorruption system,  perfect an anticorruption supervision system, and remove the  soil on which and the conditions under which corruption takes  place.    Comrade Li Changchun stressed: We sincerely hope that the  persons in charge of the provincial branches of various  democratic parties and the provincial industry and commerce  federation as well as well-known individuals without party  affiliation will display a spirit of showing utter devotion and  sharing honor and disgrace, actively put forth constructive  views on the question of opposing corruption, supervise our  behavior, and reflect views and demands of the broad masses of  the people.</p>

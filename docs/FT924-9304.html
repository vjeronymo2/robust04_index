			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / China pledges co-operation CHINA yesterday congratulated Governor Bill Clinton on winning the US presidency, while Vietnam expressed the hope that he would continue the normalisation of relations between Washington and Hanoi. The world's two largest remaining communist nations have reason to be concerned about Mr Clinton's election, chiefly because of his promise to take a tougher line on human rights abuses. His election platform linked maintenance of China's most-favoured nation (MFN) status for trade to improvements in human rights. Vietnam may fear that, after progress made with President George Bush towards ending a US embargo on business with Hanoi, the sensitive issue may be given a lower priority in Washington. China's President Yang Shangkun, Vice-President Wang Zhen and Premier Li Peng each sent messages of congratulations to Mr Clinton yesterday. Wu Jianmin, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said: 'The Chinese government always attaches importance to Sino-US relations and is ready to work with the new US administration for improvement and development of bilateral relations.' Though he acknowledged that China and the US did not agree on human rights, he said: 'We can exchange views, enhance mutual understanding and seek common ground while setting aside differences.' However, Wu added that attaching conditions to MFN status was 'unacceptable to China'. Mr Bush, following a policy of constructive engagement, has maintained China's MFN status, though relations deteriorated when he sanctioned the sale of US fighter aircraft to Taiwan. In Hanoi, Mr Phan Van Khai, deputy prime minister, said he believed Mr Clinton would continue US co-operation with Vietnam on the accounting for missing servicemen. Mr Khai said: 'We believe he will also proceed with the normalisation process with Vietnam, proceeding from the common interest of the two peoples in this regard and for the sake of peace, stability and co-operation in the region as well as the whole world.'</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Mirror Group Mirror Group's re-emergence this morning as a quoted company will take careful watching. On the one hand, there will doubtless be something of a scramble as trapped punters head for the exit. On the other, it should be recalled that the Mirror is worth a good deal less to the portfolio investor than it would be to an industrial owner. For the investor, the prospect is of zero income for at least two more years and an uncertain dividend stream thereafter. For the owner, the promise is of direct access to a torrent of cash flow by the mid-decade. Much depends, of course, on interested parties having a clear picture by now of the Mirror's liabilities, or convincing their bankers they have. But anyone aiming to bid the administrator for his 54 per cent controlling stake will already have a price ready on the back of an envelope. If the shares drop well below that in early dealings, what could be more sensible than to pick up a few? Certainly, if Mirror shareholders had to fall back on conventional yardsticks such as earnings multiples and yield they would have little to hope for. Current year earnings per share might be 4p at best. Even a price of 50p would thus represent a multiple of 12.5 times, which in combination with a prospective yield of zero is scarcely compelling. The Telegraph, for instance, was trading yesterday on a historic multiple of 11.6 times and a historic yield of 4.1 per cent. But the alternative view is neatly illustrated by a sum from the Mirror's new broker, Warburg. At 50p, the Mirror would be selling on a multiple of last year's net cash flow - adjusted for extra pension costs - of 1.8 times. The corresponding figure for The Telegraph is 10.8 times. For an industrial buyer, the appeal is obvious. For the Mirror shareholder, the implication is obvious as well: if the shares fall to 50p, do not sell.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / International Company News: SKF rebounds to first-half profit The recovering European automotive industry provided the impetus for a strong first-half performance at SKF, enabling the world's leading maker of roller bearings to rebound to a SKr817m (Dollars 105.1m) profit from a SKr469m loss. The result, at the top end of expectations, was driven by a 13 per cent increase in volumes which pushed sales up 14 per cent to SKr16.6bn. But it was accompanied by warnings that demand was unlikely to continue to rise as fast in the second half as in the first. Mr Mauritz Sahlin, managing director, said: 'There are now signs that inventory build-ups are beginning to occur. Eventually such build-ups usually lead to a levelling off in demand.' The warning did nothing to disturb the group's forecast of full-year profits of SKr1.5bn. However, general turbulence on the Swedish stock market caused by higher interest rates saw SKF's B shares fall SKr6 to SKr148. In the second quarter, profits amounted to SKr511m, swinging from a SKr114m loss, as sales rose 17 per cent to SKr8.57bn from SKr7.32bn. The group's revival has been driven by rising demand from European car and truck producers and double-digit productivity gains. SKF is a significant supplier to most of Europe's largest vehicle manufacturers, except Renault, making the automotive sector its largest single customer. Mr Sahlin said: 'New car sales began to recover in Germany and after six months matched the level achieved during the preceding year. France and Great Britain showed improvements in sales, each with second quarters that were stronger than the first.' The company said it was continuing to win market share, with supplies to customers increasing faster than production. It also benefited from a rising sales trend in the US market and from better figures from its two other segments, machinery and after-market. The group's main unit, bearings and seals, swung to a first-half profit of SKr749m from a SKr251m loss as sales increased to SKr15.4bn from SKr13.5bn. Ovako Steel also returned to the black, posting a SKr74m profit on sales of SKr1.92bn. The turnround from a SKr224m loss was helped by restructuring, a better product mix, higher demand and rising prices, SKF said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Pan Ying-chen and Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 23 (CNA) -- Both Taiwan and  Mainland China will contribute U.S.$35,000 to the Pacific Basin  Economic Council (PBEC) annually to help finance the  non-governmental organization's day-to-day operations.    The Hawaii-based organization needs about U.S.$400,000  annually to cover its expenses. The United States and Japan  have annually contributed U.S.$42,000 each to finance PBEC  operations.    Mainland China was just admitted to the PBEC while Taiwan  joined the organization in 1983 under the name of "Chinese  Member Committee of PBEC in Taipei."    The PBEC decided to accept the mainland, Russia and Colombia  as its new members during a board meeting held here Sunday [22  May].    The mainland was admitted under the name of "PRC (People's  Republic of China) Member Committee of the PBEC" instead of  "China member committee" as was used in its original application.    Meanwhile, Taiwan's designation in the organization was also  changed to "Chinese Taipei member committee of the PBEC" in line  with its membership title in the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) Forum.    Three other PBEC members -- the United States, South Korea  and the Philippines -- have also been renamed after their APEC  membership titles.    Jeffrey Koo, president of the Taipei PBEC Committee, said  the  re-designation was aimed at facilitating the PBEC's bid to join  APEC as an observer.    The PBEC, which is holding its annual conference here, will  apply for APEC observer status in October, Koo noted. APEC is a  17-member governmental-level forum founded in 1989 to promote  economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.    Koo said Beijing once unsuccessfully tried to press a change  in Taipei's designation as a prerequisite for its entry into the  PBEC. Koo warned if the PBEC bowed to Beijing's pressure, Taiwan  would withdraw from the organization and the PBEC would very  likely be disbanded as a result. The PBEC smoothly settled the  name issue by simultaneously asking several members to change  their designation in line with their APEC membership titles.    The PBEC, which was founded in 1968 by a group of business  leaders from the United States, Japan, Canada, New Zealand and  Australia, provides a forum for bankers and business executives  in Pacific Basin countries to exchange views and forge  cooperative ties.    PBEC authorities have named R.H. Fynmore, chairman of  Australia's ADI group, as the organization's new head for a  one-year tenure, and Gary Tooker, chairman of Motorola Co. of  the United States, as his deputy.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar capped The politically sensitive relationship between the dollar and yen was highlighted yesterday after Mr Robert Rubin, assistant to the US president for economic policy, denied that the US government had any firm policy on the dollar against the yen, write Gillian Tett and Philip Gawith. Elsewhere in Europe, however, trading was fairly quiet as sterling consolidated some of the past week's gains and the dollar slid back from earlier highs in spite of more strong US economic data. Mr Rubin's comment revived the market's interest in the dollar-yen, after a week dominated by the dollar's rally against the D-Mark. In morning trading the dollar drifted down against the yen on the back of growing pessimism about prospects for US-Japanese trade talks where the US hopes to get a commitment from Japan to act to curb the size of its trade surplus. However, Mr Rubin's comments prompted a brief rally against the yen, moving the dollar up from the Y110.80 level it had slid to in the early afternoon to above Y111.50. The dollar finally closed at Y111.215 in London, down almost Y1 from the previous day's close of Y112.165. Analysts felt that the behaviour of the dollar yesterday showed it had run out of steam. Despite stronger-than-expected US industrial production data, the dollar also softened slightly against the D-Mark, briefly dipping down to touch the 1993 high of DM1.7480, which it dramatically breached on Thursday. It later recovered to end at DM1.7505 against DM1.752 the previous day. Dealers said one reason for the fall may have been concerns that the the wave of optimism on Thursday, following the release of bullish economic data, had led them to price too rapid a US recovery into the dollar. Although US December industrial production rose by 0.7 per cent, and capacity use climbed to 83.5 per cent, both above market expectations, the rise in output was lower than November's increase and not as dramatic as the rise in retail sales on Thursday. A second factor was that many traders were taking profits before the weekend, scaling back positions ahead of America's Monday holiday. A further factor was uncertainty about the the Bundesbank's stance towards the dollar's rise. Rumours continued to circulate yesterday that the Bundesbank had been in discussion with the US Federal Reserve about stalling the dollar's advance. Although most dealers believe the Bundesbank is merely trying to slow the rise, rather than reverse it, the rumours were sufficient to cap the dollar. Sterling also remained range bound yesterday, trading around the DM2.6120 levels, some three pfennigs higher than its position at the start of the week. It closed at DM2.6118, slightly down on the previous day's DM2.6209. Against the dollar it closed at Dollars 1.4921, slightly down from Dollars 1.496 the previous day. The lira fluctuated narrowly against the D-Mark yesterday on expectations that Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Italian president, will set an election date this weekend, possibly ending the political instability that has plagued the country over the past two years. Although it staged a late rally, it closed in London somewhat weaker against the D-Mark at L975.5 compared with a previous close of L971. The Bank of England yesterday forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.75bn in its UK money market operations, later revised down to Pounds 1.3bn. It removed all of this in late morning trading.</p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Norway to resume scientific whaling NORWAY said yesterday it would resume scientific whaling in April and begin commercial whaling by the end of May, or in June. At the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission last year in June, Norway announced that it would resume commercial whaling in 1993 after a break of five years. Mr Jan Henry T. Olsen, Norway's minister of fisheries, said quotas for commercial whaling would be set after the next IWC meeting which is scheduled to be held in May in Kyoto, Japan. He said the quota was likely to be in the range of a 'few hundred' north-east Atlantic minke whales. Mr Olsen expressed optimism that the IWC would lift its whaling moratorium, but warned that Norway would be forced to reconsider its status as an IWC member if the ban was to prevail. In 1992, the IWC's scientific committee unanimously agreed that the best estimate of the north-east Atlantic stock of minke whales was 86,700, and that this stock is no longer in danger of depletion. Professor Lars Walloe, head of Norway's scientific whale research programme, explained yesterday that last year 95 whales were caught as part of a three-phase programme under which a quota of 400 minke whales will be killed for scientific reasons during 1992-1994. This year, under the the second phase of the programme 136 minke whales would be killed in mid-April and later in the autumn. The remaining scientific quota would be fulfilled next year. Professor Walloe said the purpose of this year's catch would be to study the eating habits of the minke whale during the spring and autumn. In sub-arctic north Norway, where about 400,000 people, or one-tenth of the population live, most communities depend on fishing for their livelihood.</p>

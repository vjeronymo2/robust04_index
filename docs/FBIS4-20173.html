			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Thomas Michelsen: "Johansson Said Yes to the EU"] </F>   [Text] The Center Party leadership has finally said yes to  the EU [European Union]. With voting figures of 16 for and 2  against, the party executive yesterday decided to urge the  party's extraordinary congress to say yes.    At the same time Center Party leader Olof Johansson wants  nothing to do with party whips. Everyone must be able to vote  in line with the conclusions they have reached.    Olof Johansson has also backed away from his earlier  position: that he, as party leader, should lead the campaign to  promote the line adopted by the party congress. He is now  unwilling to answer the question of what he will do if the  Center Party's extraordinary congress says no to the EU.    "I do not want to speculate about what will happen if the  congress says no. The power lies with the congress," Olof  Johansson said.    He reiterated what he has been saying recently: He believes  that things are inclining toward a yes at the Center Party  extraordinary congress.    Why then has he avoided making his position clear for so  long?    "This is a process. I did not want to give any indications  until the Center Party's district meetings had reached their  decisions. Now they have done so. I am part of a popular  movement and reach my decisions as part of a popular movement,"  Olof Johansson said.    Once upon a time Olof Johansson said no to the EEC, as the  EU  was once called, because it was not pan-European enough.    "But I have undergone a change over the last 30 years, and  Europe has too," Olof Johansson said yesterday.    The reason why the party executive is now saying yes is  because it wants to be involved in influencing policy in Europe.  But the Center Party does not agree with everything which is  being planned in the EU.    "I do not believe in a common currency and central bank,"  Olof Johansson said. He does not want monetary union. And  Sweden must not give up more self-determination than necessary.    Center Party deputy chairman Andreas Carlgren said that the  Center Party is a broad church. "We are able to show that we  have divergent views of the question," said Carlgren, who thinks  that the Center Party has handled the EU question more  democratically than other parties.</p>

The goal is to set up bigger cable TV networks and produce  more programmes made in China, said Zhou Caifu of the Ministry  of Radio Film and Television.    More than 30 million city residents in the country receive  cable TV.    While the figure is high, it is not very impressive compared  with China's 800 million TV viewers who own 230 million TV sets.    Nevertheless, the popular television service is heading for  "healthy development," said Zhou, who is head of the ministry's  cable TV division.    Cable TV viewers pay about 300 yuan ($34.50) for equipment  and a 5 yuan ($0.60) monthly fee for a wider selection of TV  programmes.    The ministry's priority is to expand big cable networks like  those in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin citywide and to rural  areas.    Zhou said there should be little problem in achieving this  goal.    In the 1980's, cable TV stations and small networks that  covered factories and districts mushroomed when the new  entertainment was first introduced into China.    In 1991 there were over 1,300 cable TV stations and 10,000  community cable services.    But the development of cable TV was "out of control" before  1991, Zhou said.    Moreover, many stations broadcast smuggled video tapes that  featured violence or pornography.    In 1992, the ministry began to put the cable TV market in  order.    Last year, it inspected cable TV services and approved 744  stations including 307 city or provincial stations and 437 run  by large and medium sized enterprises.    All provincial capitals and cities under direct central  planning were required to submit a comprehensive cable TV  development agenda. To date, the ministry has received 18  proposals.    The other 18 cities are expected to complete their schemes  this year.    Each proposal, Zhou said, contains four parts that deal with  management, technology, finances, and programmes.    Most cable TV stations are unable to produce their own TV  series. Many have news programmes and sometimes record song and  dance parties.    But most replay programmes from the major networks. And a  third of the shows come from abroad. Zhou said efforts to  produce more domestic shows should remedy this problem.    Shanghai Cable TV, one of the country's top networks with an  audience of 700,000, is beginning to experiment with shooting TV  series.    And to produce more high-quality programmes, Zhou said, the  ministry plans to set up a programme exchange centre.    Although cable TV remains in its infancy, the ministry also  has plans to tap cable's other functions, from communications to  multimedia information services.    It plans trial projects that use cable to transmit telephone  calls.</p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / People: Touch of the Maestro Alex 'Pete' Hart, the President of MasterCard International, has been elected vice-chairman of Maestro International, the company set up as an international debit and point of sale system with its own branding. It is an open secret that Hart has been the driving force behind the moves to set up Maestro, which MasterCard, long the underdog in the credit card market, believes steals a march on Visa's efforts so far in the debit card market. The new company's chairman will be Bernard Van Eldjik, the chairman of Eurocard and eurocheque International, the two powerful European affiliates of MasterCard which recently combined to set up Europay, the new pan-European debit card scheme. The other directors of Maestro International are Stan Paur, chairman of Maestro USA, and chief executive officer of PULSE EFT Association, the US cash machine network; Hans Jurgen Sengera, main board director of West Deutsche Landesbank; John O Smith, executive vice-president of MasterCard International; Ron Williams, director of Business Operations at National Westminster and chief executive-designate of Europay. Licences for Maestro have already been granted to leading banks in the CIS, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, and the UK, which together co-ordinate about 60m debit cards. ***** Philip Clein and Charles Humphry have been appointed the directors of Sector Management, a new lease and asset finance broker specialising in the local authority market. Clein and Humphry, old Mercantile House hands before it was bought by the ill-fated British &amp; Commonwealth in 1987, then led a management buy-out in the same year of a vehicle called Saturn Leasing. This was bought by Baltic shortly afterwards, where Clein and Humphrey stayed until the end of 1990 and May 1991 respectively. While the market has been tricky for principals such as Baltic, Humphry says it is a good time for a broker, with low overheads, 'to poke its head above the parapet. For one thing, people almost give you office space'.</p>

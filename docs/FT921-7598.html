			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on hopes of early cut in discount rate HOPES OF an imminent cut in the discount rate following news that money supply growth had fallen to its lowest level ever prompted small-lot buying by institutions, and the Nikkei average rose for the first time in three trading days, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average, which fell to a 16-month low on Wednesday, closed 153.62 up at 20,771.92 after a day's high of 20,837.36 and low of 20,621.00. Traders were relieved by the absence of selling, as most market participants previously feared that the index would drop below the critical 20,000 level. Volume dipped to 190m shares from 200m. Most investors remained on the sidelines, anticipating price fluctuations caused by options execution. Advances led declines by 499 to 394, with 213 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks, which fell to a five-year low on Wednesday, rallied 2.79 to 1,523.41. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved 2.08 to 1,165.61. Expectations of a cut in the discount rate emerged after money supply growth for January was announced at 1.8 per cent, a record low. News that more companies were reducing their earnings forecasts also highlighted the continued weakness of the economy. Mr Peter Johnson at Baring Securities said: 'The market needs an overt declaration from financial authorities that economic conditions are worse than they expected.' He added that concrete measures such as lower interest rates and a fiscal spending programme would provide support for the market. Futures and bond prices were buoyed by the Bank of Japan's intervention in the foreign exchange market to support the yen against the dollar. Although the US unit closed higher against the yen, market participants were encouraged by the central bank's action. Toshiba weakened Y27 to Y596 after the company said it expected a 60 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits for the current year to March. The announcement dragged NEC down Y20 to Y1,030 and Hitachi Y3 easier to Y845. Banking stocks continued to lose ground on corporate selling. Industrial Bank of Japan declined Y90 to Y2,410 and Fuji Bank Y30 to Y1,960. Speculative issues advanced on short-term buying. Japan Storage Battery rose Y40 to Y1,030 and Tamura Electric Works added Y210 at Y1,880. Japan Securities Finance, a private company with close ties to the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the only company which can lend stock for margin trading, said yesterday that it had put Clarion on its watch list due to the large outstanding balance on margin trading. It will also limit stock lending on Tamura Electric Works due to concern about speculative trading. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 105.87 to 22,460.97 in volume of 155.8m shares. Dai-Dan, the air conditioning systems manufacturer, put on Y100 to Y3,400 on projections of a double-digit rise in pre-tax profits for the current year. Roundup THE REGION provided some winners yesterday, although Kuala Lumpur found it hard to improve on its recent gains. NEW ZEALAND finished broadly higher after private clients bought smaller companies, especially export-related issues likely to benefit from the relatively weak New Zealand dollar and the expected recovery in commodity prices. The NZSE-40 index moved ahead 17.23 or 1.1 per cent to 1,490.88. Turnover was steady at NZDollars 27.3m. TAIWAN rallied in brisk trading on a government move to delay a decision on the dissolution of the largest local opposition party. The weighted index appreciated 155.90 or 3.2 per cent to 4,995.32 as turnover expanded to TDollars 40.85bn from TDollars 24.78bn. MANILA steadied after Wednesday's drop, the composite index ending only 1.65 easier at 1,139.36. Turnover rose to 48m pesos from 41m. The public offering of International Container Terminal Services (ICTSI) has caused funds to be withdrawn from the market. ICTSI is offering 71.64m shares worth 480m pesos at 6.70 pesos per share. The offering started on February 17 and will end on February 28. HONG KONG eased back in thin trading. The Hang Seng index dipped 9.70 to 4,716.00 in turnover of HKDollars 1.87bn, against Wednesday's HKDollars 1.90bn. Profit-taking hit utilities hardest, with China Light losing 20 cents to HKDollars 26.80 and Hong Kong Electric giving up 50 cents to HKDollars 15.70. SEOUL was depressed by reports of a tax probe into all subsidiaries of the Hyundai Group. The composite index fell 15.47 to 632.66 as turnover dropped to Won221.2bn from Won259.3bn. KUALA LUMPUR was restrained by profit-taking in the wake of the strong recent rally. The composite index was up just 0.34 at 619.06 in turnover of MDollars 261m, after MDollars 285m. BOMBAY rose to a record high on hopes of freer rupee conversion. The BSE index jumped 66.99 to 2,449.06.</p>

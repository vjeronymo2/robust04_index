			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Bottomley reviews mental care orders MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, said yesterday talks would be held at the Department of Health this week amid concern about the number of mentally ill people living in the community without treatment. She said she was looking at community supervision orders as used in New Zealand and the US. They would make clear to those who left an institution 'that if they fail to co-operate with treatment plans for a limited time, then they could come back into that institution'.</p>

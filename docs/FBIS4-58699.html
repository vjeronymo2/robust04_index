			<p>CSO     [Text] Cairo--The Arab League has received official  memoranda from the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation  Council related to their view of the way to deal with the  subject of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East  region. AL-HAYAH has been informed about the Saudi, Qatari, and  Omani memoranda.    The Saudi memorandum emphasized the [necessity of]  subjecting  the Israeli nuclear facilities to international inspection,  while Qatar demanded a "quantitative and qualitative equality in  the military capabilities of the region's states," and the Omani  memorandum called for eliminating weapons of mass destruction  within a framework of achieving peace. It also proposed  confidence-building measures and decreased military spending.  The Saudi memorandum included the following:    1. The Kingdom supports making the Middle East region free  of  weapons of mass destruction.    2. It is important and necessary for Israel to join the  nuclear weapons proliferation ban agreement, for it to subject  all of its nuclear facilities to international inspection, and  for the intensification of efforts and prompting by the  international community to induce Israel to join the agreement.    3. Signing of a chemical weapons ban agreement is not  incompatible with efforts to induce Israel to sign the nuclear  weapons proliferation ban. In fact, it is in the interest of  such an effort.    4. It is important to bring up in the multilateral talks the  subject of Israel's signing of the nuclear weapons proliferation  ban and to make the Middle East a zone free of weapons of mass  destruction, within the context of the arms limitation committee.    Three points were brought up in the memorandum submitted by  Qatar, which hosted the arms limitation committee:    1. It is necessary that arms limitation arrangements mirror  the determination of the states concerned with living in peace,  in the light of the new circumstances and relationships  prevailing in the Middle East in order to achieve stability and  security, while taking into consideration the difficulty of  achieving any substantial decrease in armaments levels in the  region in the absence of peace and stability.    2. The degree of progress in the bilateral negotiations  between Israel and the Arab sides must influence the degree of  progress in the field of arms limitation. The achievement of  progress in the field of arms limitation and security  arrangements may have a positive effect on the bilateral  negotiations as well, and the achievement of peace is the only  guarantee of security for all the parties.    3. Basic considerations and principles that should be the  basis for the arms limitation regime are:    A. It is necessary to provide a quantitative and  qualitative equality in the military capabilities of the  region's states, because the current inequality cannot continue.    B. It is necessary to achieve security through discussion  and political arrangements, and eliminating policies of military  superiority.    C. These principles should be applied to all the states of  the area without exception or preference in an equal, balanced  form at similar levels, applied according to a single  measurement.    D. It is necessary to continue the dialogue about arms  limitation questions by gradual stages leading to putting in  place a mechanism and regional measures for arms limitation.    [Qatar] proposed realizing the nature of the problems and  determining them according priorities, agreeing on confidence  building measures before the sides announce their intention to  take steps in fields which are agreed must have priority. It is  necessary that all the concerned sides in the region agree to be  bound legally by contractual obligations before joining into the  nuclear weapons proliferation ban agreement, and that they  concur in the application of international means of verifying  their adherance to the agreement.    The Omani memorandum included seven points:    1. Dealing with the problem of weapons of mass destruction  in  the region. They should be eliminated within the context of  achieving peace, and the area is still in a situation of doubt  and distrust over the renunciation of its destructive weapons  stores. The tremendous assets that are being spent on these  weapons should be used in development programs.    2. The dialogue about armaments should continue in gradual  stages, each of which leads to the next, with a time schedule or  program to achieve effective steps toward peace which is  parallel to steps toward eliminating these armaments.    3. The memorandum refers to the Sultanate's signing of a  chemical weapons ban and requests that all the countries of the  region sign it.    4. It is up to Israel and the Arabs to announce their  intention to eliminate destructive weapons stores and to accept  international inspection of the manufacture and development of  these arms at the appropriate time.    5. Conventional weapons in the region should be drawn down,  with a view to the long-range national security of each side in  the area. The goal is to increase this security so that no side  achieves a greater security, military, or strategic advantage at  the expense of another.    6. The Sultanate of Oman believes that the principal threat  comes from unlimited proliferation of these weapons, and that it  is up to every country in the world to work toward a world free  of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction, safeguarding  world peace and security.    7. It is necessary to take measures to build confidence, and  the Sultanate proposes:    A. Issuing a statement about the danger of not controlling  the arms race.    B. It is necessary to limit expenses in defense-related  fields.    C. It is necessary to prevent the accumulation of weapons  of mass destruction.    D. Settlement of disputes by peaceful means.    E. Nonaggression and nonintervention in internal affairs.</p>

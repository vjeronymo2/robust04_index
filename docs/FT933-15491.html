			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Hollas moves ahead to Pounds 647,000 Hollas, the Cheshire-based textile, garment distributor and mail order group, raised profits from Pounds 223,000 to Pounds 647,000 pre-tax for the year to end-March. Turnover, however, declined 23 per cent to Pounds 28.5m. Mr Tony Lawson, chairman, said the trading performance had been badly affected throughout the year by recession and that efforts had been directed on conserving resources. As a result year-end gearing was reduced from 21 per cent to 2 per cent. Earnings rose to 0.6p (0.2p) and the total dividend is maintained at 1.2p via a final of 0.6p.</p>

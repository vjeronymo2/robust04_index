			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> O'CONNOR PUTS ON WIG TO OBSERVE PROTESTERS  </P> <P> Irish singer Sinead O'Connor disguised herself with a brown wig and baseball  cap Wednesday night as she watched demonstrators protesting her refusal to  allow the American national anthem to be played before a concert.  </P> <P> The cropped-haired 23-year-old singer went nearly unrecognized for a time  outside the Saratoga Performing Arts Center but walked away when some fans and  television reporters caught on.  </P> <P> Later, during her concert, she thanked her fans for their support.  </P> <P> "I never said I had disrespect for the American people," O'Connor said. "I have  nothing but respect for people of any country."  </P> <P> O'Connor drew the ire of protesters for her refusal to perform at the Garden  State Arts Center in New Jersey last Friday unless the arena dispensed with its  usual practice of playing "The Star-Spangled Banner" before concerts. Arena  officials complied but later banned O'Connor from appearing there again.  </P> <P> Several radio stations in New York and New Jersey have banned her songs. They  were joined Wednesday by KGGI-FM in San Bernardino.  </P> <P> About 10 demonstrators sang the national anthem outside the Saratoga Performing  Arts Center gates Wednesday evening and urged fans not to enter.  </P> <P> O'Connor, whose hits include "No One Compares 2 U" and "Mandinka," watched for  more than half an hour without talking to the demonstrators or her fans, said  Donna Eichmeyer, an arts center spokeswoman.  </P> <P> "She was concerned," Eichmeyer said. "She wanted to hear what they had to say."  </P> <P> Four songs into her show, O'Connor stopped to tell the fans she was touched by  their show of support. She also said she was gratified that the fans let the  protest continue without incident, because the demonstrators "had a right to be  there as well."  </P> <P> Elaine Schock, a spokeswoman for O'Connor, called the decision by some radio  stations to stop playing O'Connor songs "absurd."  </P></p>

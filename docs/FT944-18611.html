			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Capital gains proposal would encourage retention of shares Sir, The Confederation of British Industry's proposal for the coming Budget that long-term shareholdings should be free of capital gains tax is welcome ('CBI calls for Pounds 1bn support in Budget', September 28). One effect would be to encourage senior executives who receive shares through executive options or other incentives to hold on to them. The CBI, in its May 1994 paper on long-term remuneration for senior executives, wishes directors to be 'encouraged' to retain their shareholdings, but there is no effective way in which this can be done. Companies cannot force executives to retain their shares if they have been obtained through a tax approved option scheme as the Inland Revenue regards this restriction as contrary to the Taxes Act. But a long-term CGT-free opportunity of, say, 10 years, would be exactly what is required to promote share retention by executives. H M F Simpson, Buck Consultants, 11 York Place, Leeds LS1 2DS</p>

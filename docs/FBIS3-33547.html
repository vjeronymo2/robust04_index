			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The Movement for the Organization of the Country  [MOP] has come out against the accusations of intransigence and  bad faith brought against the Haitian head of state. President  Aristide cannot be held responsible for the failures already  recorded. [passage omitted]    The party is convinced that one cannot support the return of  President Aristide while seeking the best way to implement  Article 148 of the Constitution [which provides for assumption  of power by the prime minister in the event the president of the  Republic is unavailable]. Likewise, one cannot be opposed to the  bloody 30 September coup d'etat and at the same time support the  clean-sweep policy or reactivation of Article 149 [which  provides for the Court of Cassation president to act as  provisional president of the country pending new presidential  elections within 45 to 90 days]. [passage omitted]    The MOP, which is not promoting any candidacy for the post  of  prime minister at this time, urges the entire diplomatic sector  to unite in demanding respect for the Constitution, the  commitments made at Governors Island, the end of repression,  full enjoyment of public liberties, safety guarantees for all,  the normalization of institutions, and the return of President  Aristide on 29 March so he can complete his constitutional  mandate. This is not a difficult solution to enact.    The year 2004 [marking the bicentennial of Haiti's  independence] will soon be here. So let us make this 29 March  the starting point for preparation of a grand celebration of the  bicentennial of national independence.    MOP leader Gesner Comeau supports the counterproposal sent  to  UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali by President Aristide.  This new plan worked out by the head of state provides for his  return to Haiti during the 10 days that follow the appointment  of the new prime minister. Let us listen to Gesner Comeau.    [Begin recording, in Creole] I think that if such a plan is  applied, it would be perfect and in the interest of the waiting  Haitian people. [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

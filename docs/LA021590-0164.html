			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: FIRST HOUSE DEMOLITION SINCE MORATORIUM OKD  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday authorized the bulldozing of an  abandoned home in South-Central Los Angeles in its first review of a proposed  demolition since a 60-day moratorium was imposed on "Operation Knockdown."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores' emergency motion, requested by police and  Building and Safety Department officials, was approved unanimously and will  lead to the bulldozing Thursday morning of a vandalized home at 11560 S. Link  St.  </P> <P> Under Operation Knockdown, unsafe buildings that have become hangouts for drug  dealers and gang members can be demolished. But in the wake of reports that the  city has been overly aggressive and bulldozed more than 200 homes, the council  on Jan. 30 ordered the moratorium to allow a review of the program.  </P></p>

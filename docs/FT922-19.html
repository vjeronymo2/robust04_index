			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Company News: Tabacalera lifts pay-out as profits rise 16% TABACALERA, Spain's government-controlled tobacco manufacturer and distributor, has raised its dividend by 20 per cent to Pta180 a share following a 16 per cent rise in net profits to Pta14.2bn (Dollars 147m) in 1991. Tabacalera, which is 52 per cent state-owned and whose non-Spanish shareholders represent 27 per cent of the total equity, has already paid a Pta80 interim dividend. Mr German Calvillo, chairman, expects the company to raise net profits this year to Pta15.4bn and to repeat a 20 per cent increase in its 1993 pay-out to shareholders. In the latest of its diversification ventures, Tabacalera is to become a leading shareholder in Elosua, Spain's second-biggest edible oils company. Mr Calvillo plans for Tabacalera to assume management responsibilities in Elosua in partnership with Ebro, a big Spanish food company controlled by the Kuwait Investment Office.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Triton Europe losses at Pounds 50m TRITON Europe, the UK arm of the US independent oil and gas company, incurred a loss of Pounds 50m for the year to May 31, following a Pounds 41m write-down of the value of its oil and gas properties. There was a comparable loss for the previous year of Pounds 700,000. The company has changed the status of reserves held on its books after an annual evaluation. All oil and gas prospects classified previously as 'proved, undeveloped', are now cited as 'probable', making them less valuable. Mr David Jones, company secretary, said the change was the result of current economic conditions, which made it less likely the oil would be exploited. It mainly concerns the Paris basin holdings, which have seen Pounds 37m knocked off their value since Total, the French oil group that operates the fields, decided it did not want to spend any more money to develop the reserves in the current climate. Triton has restructured its exploration and production activities over the past year, cutting its staff by 75 per cent from about 60 in January to 15. Restructuring costs reached Pounds 990,000 and were included in the total write-down figure. The company said, however, that its cash position remained strong with a balance of Pounds 6m and credit facilities of Pounds 30m. After-tax losses reached Pounds 34.4m, against profits of Pounds 3.9m, for losses of 41.7p per share (earnings of 4.7p). Mr Jones said Triton was restructuring its exploration programme to go for higher risk-higher reward prospects such as its US parent had found in Colombia where it was involved with British Petroleum in the Cusiana development, which was believed to contain more than 1bn barrels of oil. The company said its move to exploration in Italy should provide a solid base for further expansion. It drilled its first well this year in the southern Apennines.</p>

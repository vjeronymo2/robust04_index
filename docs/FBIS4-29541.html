			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Problems in Consciousness of Present Situation"] </F>   [Text] People's consciousness of the present situation  must start from the fact that it is peculiar and delicate. Most  people are stunned by the recent moves of some students and  people from dissident groups and the working-class domain. They  think that awareness of the current situation by some students  and dissidents is quite different from that of the ordinary  people. For example, at a time when the civil defense drill was  being staged on 15 June, some college students staged a  demonstration opposing the drill. Seeing this, the ordinary  people silently asked them, "which nation are you the people  of?" From this, we can note that there is no common factor  whatsoever in the awareness of the situation between the  ordinary people and some students and dissidents.    The differences in the awareness of the situation are  prompted by differences of opinion regarding how one should  accept the situation taking place recently within and around us.  There is a great possibility that acts carried out on the basis  of such biased viewpoints may spoil the way along which the  nation's destiny should advance, thus creating a serious problem.    A democratic society is a many-sided society which is not  absolutely dominated by one particular allegation or a certain  sense of values. In a democratic society, various different  allegations and different ways of thinking are respected by each  other, and are coexisting. This being the case, many allegations  and assertions are put forward over a certain issue and  situation, and heated debates are to take place. This is  precisely a characteristic and merit of a democratic society.    In view of this, one should not merely totally blame the act  of opposing sanctions against North Korea and calling for a  solution to the problem through dialogue by so-called dissident  groups; the act of some college students who staged  demonstrations opposing the civil defense drill; and the act of  voting to strike in an attempt to solve the worker-management  problem by the National Alliance of Subway Workers Trade Union.    However, the present situation is remarkably different from  any other one. We would like to advise them to act by taking  this fact into consideration. Today, in the face of a  possibility of North Korea's nuclear armament, we are discussing  whether we should leave this as it is or not. Whether North  Korea comes to have nuclear arms or uses the nuclear issue  merely as a diplomatic card, we will face the danger of war  because of unexpected events that may break out in the course of  pushing and pulling the nuclear problem. Therefore, we should  refrain from acting to cause such a crisis.    We have often witnessed from past history that optimism and  an appeasement policy in time of a crisis rather deepened and  expanded such a crisis. We should not forget that allegations  and acts recently taking place within ourselves may cause and  fan the misjudgment of the North Korean authorities, and even  the issue of labor-management dispute, which is not directly  related to the nuclear problem, cannot be the exception.    At present we are discussing the nation's fate, and are  facing a possibility of war, though it is not great. Concurrence  in an awareness of the present situation is needed more urgently  than ever before, and the sense of responsibility for the result  of one's act and an awareness of the reality are required more  keenly than ever before.</p>

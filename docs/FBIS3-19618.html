He also supports the proposal that 27 votes in the Council  of  Ministers should be needed to block decisions. This is  something that the government has so far been careful not to  have any views about.    The Swedish negotiators do not want to interfere in  something  that they consider to be an internal EU affair.    The present rules state that 29 percent of votes are needed  to block a decision in the Council of Ministers. This will mean  27 votes if the total number of votes in the Council of  Ministers is increased to 90 after the admission of the new  members.    "I support the idea that it should be 27 votes. This would  give a stronger EU," Ingvar Carlsson said.    Last Tuesday [15 March] the negotiations among the EU's  foreign ministers reached deadlock, and it will be a week before  they are resumed.    Ingvar Carlsson pointed out that we are now almost three  weeks after the deadline of 1 March -- a deadline that the  European Parliament set so that its deputies would have a  reasonable amount of time to scrutinize the agreements with  candidates Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Austria.    In mid-April the parliament will complete its examination of  the membership agreements.    Ingvar Carlsson does not think that there is any point in  discussions among the party leaders tomorrow, Friday [18 March],  if the other party leaders do not realize that a referendum in  June is too early bearing in mind the fact that the question of  the EU's voting rules has still not been resolved.    "One more meeting ought to be enough, and then we will reach  a decision. I am prepared to reach a decision on Friday,"  Ingvar Carlsson said.    For Carlsson, November is the only realistic alternative on  which to reach agreement. Nor does he see any reason for  concern if Sweden were to become an EU member on 1 February or 1  March 1995 instead of 1 January 1995. [passage omitted]</p>

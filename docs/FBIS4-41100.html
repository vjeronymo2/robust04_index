			<p>BFN     [Text] The first large Russian industrial enterprises have  been entered on the state register of insolvency. The list of  enterprises was drawn up by the Russian Committee on  Machine-Building. About 40 plants were registered. These  crisis-ridden plants are unable to pay taxes, settle up with  suppliers of raw materials, or pay wages. These enterprises  will now have to change the way they run their business or else  acknowledge their insolvency and go into voluntary  self-liquidation.</p>

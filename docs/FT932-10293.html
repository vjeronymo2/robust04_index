			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Lloyd's faces call for meeting LLOYD's of London is likely to be forced to call an extraordinary general meeting next month to consider whether members should vote before corporate capital can be introduced into the insurance market. The meeting has been demanded by Mr Claud Gurney, a disaffected member of the market, who is collecting 100 signatures, enough under the market's rules to force it to call an extraordinary general meeting. He expects to deliver the signatures to Lloyd's today. The main resolution to be put at the meeting would force Lloyd's to hold a vote before allowing the introduction of newcomers with limited liability. This move was a centrepiece of the restructuring plan to rebuild Lloyd's capital base that it unveiled 11 days ago. Mr Gurney said he believed that Lloyd's should have to win the agreement of two-thirds of its existing Names, who have unlimited personal liability, before making the change. He believed that in order to win the agreement of the Names, Lloyd's would have to put together a package in which future Names would help existing Names. He said: 'We want an agreement whereby 25 per cent of future profits be paid to past Names.' Mr Gurney's move was criticised by Mr Val Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which represents more than 9,000 Names.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Reaffirmation of the Jordanian Stand"] </F>   [Text] Jordan's clear and brave stand on the Gulf of Aqaba  siege issue, expressed by His Majesty King Husayn to the  ambassadors of the five permanent Security Council states,  continues to echo in the Jordanian arena and in the Arab and  international arenas, as well. His majesty the leader linked  the resumption of Jordan's role in the peace process to ending  search operations and harassment by warships in the Red Sea.    Jordan's concern about its independence and dignity and  about  exercising its full sovereignty is not any less than its concern  about achieving a just and comprehensive peace in the region --  a peace that provides stability and is conducive to growth,  progress, and development for all the people in the region.    Yesterday, King Husayn reiterated the historic role Jordan  has been playing during the past decades in terms of defending  the Palestinian Arab people's rights to restoring their  territories and to wrenching their right to self-determination.  During his meeting with the Palestinian president's envoy, his  majesty expressed Jordan's adherence to the Arab right to  protect the holy places and to Arab sovereignty over Jerusalem.    The Palestinian president's envoy hailed His Majesty King  Husayn's role in maintaining the Arabism of Jerusalem and its  holy places. He appreciated Jordan's stand toward the  Palestinian cause, people, and their fate. This blocks the road  of anyone trying to cast doubts on the Arabism of the holy city  and the right to sovereignty over it and on Jordan's decisive  and clear stand on the religious, historic, geographic, and  physical aspects of Jerusalem. One is wrong to think that Jordan  will allow a claim of sovereignty over Jerusalem by anyone other  than almighty God. The fact that Jordan and its Hashemite  leadership have adopted the caring, protection, and maintenance  of the holy places throughout all these decades does not leave  room for anyone to harbor bad or good intentions.    In any case, Jordan will continue to shoulder the Arab and  Palestinian concern. Despite the difficulties and challenges it  faced, Jordan will continue to be the Hashemite Arab fortress  that does not relinquish a single right or give up any of its  principled national and pan-Arab stands on the issue of  Palestine; on issues of harassment, siege, and inspection; and  on various pressures exerted on it. Jordan is a free and  independent homeland with its own mission. Its sons have their  own ambitions and hopes of keeping their homeland impregnable  and their people free and lofty.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / LDDS buys long-distance unit Williams Companies, the Oklahoma-based gas pipeline operator, has agreed to sell its WilTel long-distance telephone business for Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) to LDDS, the acquisitive US telecommunications group. Three months ago Williams rejected LDDS's initial bid of Dollars 2bn but yesterday Mr Keith Bailey, the company's chairman, said the revised offer from LDDS represented a 'full and fair value' for WilTel. The takeover, subject to regulatory approval, will create a long-distance carrier in the US with the size to compete with AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint, the three dominant operators in the industry. On completion, LDDS will control about 4 per cent of the Dollars 65bn US long-distance market, compared with a 10 per cent share for Sprint, 20 per cent for MCI, and 60 per cent for AT&amp;T. The deal is part of a gradual consolidation of the US telecommunications industry, which has seen the blurring of boundaries between long-distance and local carriers, and between the sector and the cable television and computer industries. LDDS said it had secured Dollars 3.25bn in bank loans from a syndicate, led by NationsBank of North Carolina, to pay for the all-cash acquisition of WilTel, and to refinance some existing debt. The purchase is its second big deal this month. Three weeks ago it agreed to buy IDB Communications, a national satellite-based phone carrier, for Dollars 895m. Based in Mississippi, LDDS buys access to long-distance lines in bulk and resells the access at a profit. With revenues of Dollars 1.14bn last year, it has the fourth largest long-distance customer base in the US, and specialises in serving small to medium-sized businesses, mainly in the south-east, south-west and Midwest. WilTel, which provides companies and other phone carriers with voice and data transmission services via its 11,000-mile advanced national fibre optic network, reported an operating profit last year of Dollars 89.7m on revenues of Dollars 958m.</p>

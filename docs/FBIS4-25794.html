			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, June 15 (XINHUA) -- The round table  talks of the working group on peace and national reconciliation  in Cambodia opened here this morning, without being able to make  any progress.    Representatives from the Democratic Kampuchea Party (DKP)  and  the government discussed only the cease-fire issue at today's  meeting, a spokesman of the royal government said.    The government side suggested a cease fire date on June 30,  15 days later.    But the DKP side did not say yes or no.    DKP spokesman Tap Kunnal said that today's meeting was going  well. But the representatives failed to reach any agreement.  All agreed to continue the meeting tomorrow morning.    The working group was set up according to a decision made by  the round table talks on Cambodia held in Pyongyang on May 27-28.</p>

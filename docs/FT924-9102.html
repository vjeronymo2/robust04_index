			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Korea car market 'impenetrable' European car makers have called on the European Commission to reconsider South Korea's trading terms with the Community, complaining that protectionism makes the Korean market 'impenetrable', writes John Griffiths. In a report released before trade talks next week between the EC and Korea in Brussels, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) said Korea's high duties and taxes on imported cars hampered entry to the country's car market. It said cars imported into Korea cost up to 41 per cent more than locally-produced cars. The Korean barriers are not confined to tariffs, the report protests. It cites paperwork delays of up to five months, lengthy and obstructive vehicle emissions and noise testing and lengthy customs delays as being among other obstacles.</p>

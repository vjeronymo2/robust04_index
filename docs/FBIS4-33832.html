Stop  [preceding word in English] and end of message.    From the mountains of southeastern Mexico    Rebel Subcommander Marcos    Mexico, June 1994    P.S. of imprudence:    We were advised to be prudent and to sign the peace  agreement; we are told that if we do not sign the peace  agreement, the government could finish us off in a matter of  hours or days if it is delayed. We are advised to settle for the  promises offered to us and to wait. We are told to have the  prudence to surrender and live.... Who could live with that  embarrassment? Who could trade life for dignity? Such sensible  advice was useless because imprudence.... and dignity have  reigned in these lands for many years.    P.S.: We were holding discussions in the committee all  afternoon. We looked up the word for "surrender" in the Indian  language, and we could not find it. There is no translation for  it in Tzotzil or Tzetal. No one remembers seeing that word in  Tojolabal or in Chol. They have been looking for hours for an  equivalent word. It is raining outside, and a friendly cloud  comes to lie down with us. Old Antonio is waiting for everyone  to shut up until only the beating of the rain on the roof is  heard. Old Antonio silently comes to me, coughing from his  tuberculosis, and tells me in my ear: "That word does not exist  in real language. That is why our people never surrender and  prefer to die because our dead people believe that words that do  not move should not be lived [nuestros muertos mandan que las  palabras que no andan no se vivan]." Later, he walks toward the  fireplace to scare off his fear and the early morning cold. I  tell it to Ana Maria; she looks at me with tenderness and  reminds me that old Antonio is already dead....    The uncertainty of the last few hours in December 1993  repeats itself. It is cold; the guards relieve one other with a  whispering countersign. Rain and mud turn everything off.  Humans whisper, and water shouts. Someone asks for a cigarette,  and a lit match illuminates the face of the female fighter that  is on duty.... It is only a slight instant.... but it is enough  to see that she is smiling.... Someone arrives wearing a cap and  carrying a rifle dripping with water. "There is some coffee,"  he says. The committee, as is the custom in these lands,  decides to vote on whether to drink coffee or to continue  looking for an equivalent of the word "surrender" in real  language. Coffee wins unanimously. No one surrenders.    Are we going to be left alone?</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Travellers may face tougher laws STRONGER controls on those who park illegally or without permission are being considered by the government because of concern at the behaviour of groups such as travellers, Sir George Young, housing and planning minister, said yesterday. The proposals include making it a criminal offence to park a caravan on any land without the landowner's consent, and giving local authorities powers to tow away illegally parked caravans and seize caravans as an alternative to fines in the last resort. Local authorities would no longer be obliged to provide caravan sites for gypsies. Travellers in England and Wales would have to acquire land for sites and apply for planning permission in the normal way.</p>

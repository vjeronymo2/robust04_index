			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Cut-price car dealers survive Peugeot's court challenge The right of independent traders to sell cut-price new cars to customers across EU borders in competition with franchised dealer networks was upheld by the European Court of Justice yesterday. The court rejected an appeal by the PSA Peugeot Citroen group of France against an earlier European Commission ruling, which stated that new car sales by independent traders across national borders to specified customers were legal. The ruling is likely to pave the way for an increase in the number and activities of such independent traders. The court verdict follows a previous Commission order that Peugeot lift its ban on dealers in Belgium and Luxembourg selling to Ecosystem, a Rouen-based intermediary that resells in France cars bought at lower prices in Belgium and Luxembourg. Under EU rules, it is legal for intermediaries to import cars on behalf of individual customers. In 1991, Sir Leon Brittan, then competition commissioner, warned Peugeot that its Belgian and Luxembourg dealers would forfeit protection from normal competition rules if the ban was not lifted. The verdict coincided with an attack by the European motor industry on changes proposed by the Commission's competition directorate to the so-called 'block exemption', which allows carmakers to contravene EU competition regulations by restricting new car sales to franchised dealer networks. The carmakers have been thrown on to the defensive by the court verdict and the proposed rule changes, which would give more power to dealers and would provide more grounds on which the exemption could be withdrawn from a manufacturer. The exemption expires in June 1995, and a battle is being waged in the Commission between the competition and industry directorates on the terms under which it should be renewed. Consumer groups want it scrapped, claiming that it restricts competition and leads to unjustifiably high car prices. The Peugeot-Ecosystem case has provided one of the key areas of debate about whether the block exemption should be renewed. Rover to axe dealers, Page 10</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bankers urge risk disclosure Banks and brokers should publish the findings of internal studies into their exposures to swings in financial markets, according to a paper from a group of central bankers released yesterday. The report, from the so-called Group of 10 leading central banks, argues that the gap between the banks' and brokers' understanding of the risks they are running, and that of the market, has grown in recent years as complex derivative markets have expanded and risk management practices have moved on. The call from the central bankers, though couched in the form of a 'discussion paper', will add to pressure on financial firms in the leading financial centres to increase disclosure about their risk profiles. At present, securities and accounting regulators in a number of countries are developing rules which would call for greater disclosure in this area. But the G10 paper argues that financial intermediaries should not wait for specific regulations but should act immediately to disclose more information. 'During episodes of market stress, (the current) lack of transparency can contribute to an environment in which rumours alone can cause a firm's market access and funding to be impaired,' the paper warns. The central bankers appear to have been prompted in part by the sort of instability that threatened the financial markets earlier this year, when institutions like Bankers Trust were forced to issue public denials as rumours spread that they were facing bankruptcy. The discussion paper, Public Disclosure of Market and Credit Risks by Financial Intermediaries, could also be used as a basis for disclosure by other companies which have active treasury departments, the G10 group adds. The paper calls for disclosure, in summary form, of the market risks in an institution's portfolio of securities and its success in managing these risks. It also recommends disclosure of the scale of counterparty credit risk arising from trading and risk management activities.</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Halifax to set new charges HALIFAX, Britain's largest building society with 3.6m savers, is to charge some customers for each withdrawal from their savings accounts, including instant access, if they have a low balance. The move comes as banks and building societies have acted to impose charges on millions of their personal customers to offset the squeeze on their profitability caused by the recession. National Westminster Bank wrote to its 3.5m Access and Visa credit card customers this week informing them that from April 1 they will have to pay for several services which until now they have probably taken for granted. Halifax, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 593m last year, said it would send letters to individual customers 'where appropriate' to inform them of the change on February 1. It was not clear if the move would apply to children's accounts. Halifax staff were informed of the policy on Thursday. One customer with a low balance in an Instant Extra Account was told she would be allowed two free withdrawals from her instant access account every month - subsequent withdrawals would incur a 60p charge. There would be a fee levied on customers with a balance of less than Pounds 50. The customer was told that the move was designed to encourage people to save and that other building societies would follow. This was strongly denied by the other four of the UK's top five building societies. Leeds said it had 'absolutely no plans to do such a thing'. Nationwide, Woolwich and Alliance and Leicester said it was not their policy to impose charges on customers wishing to make withdrawals from instant access savings accounts. Last year the Halifax withdrew interest on accounts with a balance of less than Pounds 50, unless the account holder was under 21 years of age. Another of the top 10 building societies, Cheltenham and Gloucester, decided in October 1990 to impose a Pounds 100 minimum on its Gold account in October 1990. 'It was not worth maintaining these accounts,' it said. 'C&amp;G has gone for larger investors.' Abbey National, the former building society and Halifax's main rival in the savings market, said: 'We would never penalise a customer for just having a pound in their balance.' The Building Societies Commission, the industry's regulatory body, said it was up to individual building societies to set the terms and conditions for operating their accounts. NatWest will be charging for services such as re-advising a customer of his personal identification number for cash machines at a cost of Pounds 5. Customers will pay Pounds 5 for duplicate monthly statements and Pounds 10 to change their statement date. Acknowledgement of a postal payment will cost Pounds 2. Copies of paper vouchers on disputed transactions will cost Pounds 5 for UK and Pounds 10 for international transactions. NatWest is also quietly changing the date from which it charges interest on monthly credit card balances not paid off in full. By charging interest from the date an item was charged to the account, rather than from the statement date, the bank will substantially increase the interest it earns on credit cards. Barclaycard, the largest UK credit card issuer, adopted this method two years ago when it introduced annual card fees.</p>

			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Eurocamp down 33% as bookings fall Eurocamp, the tour operator specialising in self-drive camping holidays, suffered a one-third fall to Pounds 6.25m in pre-tax profits for the year to October, as bookings fell and market share was lost. The result was in line with a warning at the interim stage that profits would fall 30 to 35 per cent from last year's Pounds 9.4m. However, a more optimistic statement on the current year's outlook, with bookings up in all markets, and the maintenance of the final 6.3p dividend, to give an unchanged total of 9.75p, pushed the shares up 22p to 285p. Eurocamp estimated that the market for inclusive summer holidays from the UK to France - the biggest part of its operation - fell 10 per cent in 1993, with its business hit harder than some competitors. Mr Tom Neville, chairman, said the group had reappraised product and marketing strategies in the light of changes in the trading environment and competitive pressures. Mr Richard Atkinson, managing director, said margins should recover in 1994 but not to 1992 levels. The group has adjusted 1994 brochure prices to tackle last year's poor bookings in the June and early July period. Lower prices in these weeks have been partly offset by higher prices in late July and August, although average prices are lower than in the 1993 brochures. Mr Atkinson said the group was expecting some recovery in occupancy rates - from last summer's 96 nights out of a possible 115 to about 100 nights - and it aimed to reduce marketing and administration costs while holding costs incurred overseas. Sales in the year fell 7.5 per cent to Pounds 56.7m, and operating profits dropped 32 per cent to Pounds 6.54m (Pounds 9.63m). Interest payable was Pounds 584,000 (Pounds 606,000), while investment income amounted to Pounds 296,000 against Pounds 381,000. Earnings per share dropped from 24.2p to 16.2p. Capital expenditure was cut, with the amount on fixed assets down from Pounds 11.2m to Pounds 6.28m, sufficient to maintain assets but with no expansion. At the year-end the group had net cash of Pounds 2.1m, compared with net debt of Pounds 124,000. COMMENT After the disappointments of last year, of which only a part can be blamed on the market, Eurocamp has to regain credibility in the City. Incorrect pricing appeared to be the management's greatest mistake in the 1993 brochure, which has been addressed this year. It is early days to say whether sufficient adjustment has been made although early bookings are encouraging. More will be known by the annual meeting in March. Making a firm forecast is thus a bit dangerous yet, though a range of Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 8.5m seems plausible. That suggests a p/e in the 13 to 14.5 range. A maintained dividend would give an above average yield. After the shares' run yesterday more evidence of the new strategy's success is needed to push them much higher.</p>

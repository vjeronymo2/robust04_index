			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / India rejects rapid tariff cuts NEW DELHI has ruled out drastic import tariff cuts as part of its programme of economic reform. Mr Ashok Desai, the finance ministry's chief economic adviser, said tariffs had been cut by 10 per cent since the reforms started last year and would continue to come down at about the same rate. 'The average tariff can't fall at more than a certain rate which is fairly slow,' Mr Desai told a businessmen's conference. India's import duties are among the world's highest, and constitute a key barrier protecting Indian industry from external competition. Mr Desai's comments will dash the hopes of foreign companies which believed the reform programme would rapidly open Indian markets to foreign products. But they will reassure many Indian industrialists who have expressed concern that they have been given insufficient time to prepare for the rigours of international competition. Mr Desai's remarks come amid a stream of signals from the government that the pace of economic deregulation will be slower than expected when Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, embarked on liberalisation in July 1991.

The International Monetary Fund and World Bank have so far expressed satisfaction with India's progress. Mr Lewis Preston, World Bank president, has praised the reforms. But he and other senior officials have also urged India to press ahead rapidly with further deregulation. Mr Preston, who flew to Calcutta yesterday on the final leg of his Indian visit, said maintaining the momentum of the reforms was essential. But a safety net was important to ease the shock of moving to a more market-oriented economy. 'No shortage of requests' for new borrowings had come from the federal and state governments during his visit, Mr Preston said. But India must contribute by funding basic infrastructure and raising the prices of commodities, such as electric power. 'The government, at federal and state levels, has an essential role to play in developing India's infrastructure and investing in its people.'</p>

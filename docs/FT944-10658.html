			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (9): Minerals have always been a mainstay  -The mining industry is undergoing a series of profound changes Bolivian mining is undergoing a series of profound changes - in the types of minerals extracted, in production techniques and in patterns of ownership. Minerals have always been a mainstay of the Bolivian economy, but successive price collapses affecting silver, tin and antimony drove minerals exports down to less than one third of Bolivian foreign exchange earnings in 1986. Today, with zinc and gold output increasing rapidly, minerals again account for almost half of export revenue: some Dollars 380m last year. An estimated 80,000 Bolivians still depend on mining for their livelihoods, some of them literally scratching ore from narrow veins in underground shafts with long, primitive nails. But the open-cast mines and heap-leaching techniques being introduced by foreign concerns in joint ventures with Bolivians point to a different mining future. 'Eight years ago, no one would touch Bolivia,' says Mr Charles Bruce, chief executive officer of local mining consultancy Mintec. 'Even in 1991, there were only four foreign companies operating here: now there are 40.' Simultaneously, the state is rapidly withdrawing from productive mining activities. While mining giant Comibol was responsible in its 1980-85 heyday for about two-thirds of all Bolivia's tin and zinc output, by last year its share had fallen to 35 and 20 per cent respectively. Comibol's smelters and refineries are on the capitalisation list. Mines, deposits and exploration areas, meanwhile, are being made available to private investors either via leasing contracts or joint ventures with Comibol to get round constitutional restraints on ownership transfer of nationalised assets. Only three of Comibol's mines are operational: Huanuni, Colquiri and Caracoles. Continuing losses obliged the remainder to be closed down. Comibol's workforce, which peaked at almost 30,000 in 1984, has been cut back severely - mainly in the second half of the 1980s - to some 2,500, of whom more than 1,000 are employed at the Vinto smelter complex. Cash flow is now positive. Comibol's most attractive opportunities are in the department of Oruro, on the altiplano south of La Paz. Largest is the Huanuni tin deposit near the town of Oruro, originally owned by Bolivian tin magnate Simon Patino. Despite its already-long life, Huanuni has some 8m tonnes of proven and inferred reserves and mining experts consider prospects for further finds bright. Colquiri has good unexploited zinc reserves along with its tin. And the polymetallic San Jose mine, non-operational since mid-1992, could also prove an interesting prospect for zinc and gold; its traditional lead-silver concentrates will acquire new worth if and when the Karachipampa smelter is finally started up. Comsur (Bolivia's largest mining concern, owned by the Sanchez de Lozada family and now in association with Rio Tinto Zinc) will be the first private company to commence joint production with Comibol. Comsur-RTZ has put up Dollars 15.8m for a lead-zinc concentrator at Comibol's under-exploited Bolivar deposit. Profits from the 15,000 tonnes of concentrate, the projected output from next year onwards, will be split 50-50. 'We've found Comibol to be very good partners,' says Comsur's CEO Mr John MacLean. 'Reserves are better than expected; we're on budget and on time.' Part of the attraction for foreign companies is the modern 1991 mining code which guarantees equal treatment for foreign and national companies and free remittances of profits abroad. Foreigners may now also - in joint ventures with Bolivians - explore and develop the previously prohibited but potentially rich zones within 50km of Bolivia's borders. The code is being further modified to improve the present chaotic claims procedures and to clarify certain elements of tax law. Mr Gonzalo Barrientos, under-secretary of mining, is confident that these provisions and promotion of joint ventures with Comibol will boost minerals exports earnings to Dollars 800m within five years - 'and that's without factoring in new exploration,' he says. In the brave new world of Bolivian mining, traditional tin and tungsten have a declining role: tin earned just Dollars 83m last year, down from the 1981 peak of Dollars 266m (even though gross production is little changed). Zinc, however, is on an upward path: last year's sales of Dollars 120m represented 16 per cent of total Bolivian export earnings. And revenue from gold should outstrip zinc by next year. To date, exploration has been restricted to the so-called 'Cordillera Real', the traditional silver and tin-mining zone. But new companies, in search of precious metals, are concentrating on the western Cordillera and the pre-Cambrian and greenstone belts east towards the Brazilian borders. Among other diversification possibilities, Bolivian miners are once again talking seriously about developing their iron reserves. 'El Mutun' is a 40,000m tonne deposit - one of the world's largest - with between 30 and 50 per cent iron. It is located in Bolivia's Busch province, some 600km east of Santa Cruz on the border with Brazil. El Mutun's potential has been known for decades but development has been limited to small-scale open-pit exploitation due to local power and transport problems. All operations are presently suspended. A Brazilian-Japanese consortium, however, is reviving a large-scale exploitation project. And the Latin American Integration Association (Aladi) has recently proposed construction of iron and steel plants nearby to serve Bolivia and export to Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.</p>

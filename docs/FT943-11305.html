			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Glenturret's variety - Whisky On the Scottish mainland few whisky distilleries are good to look at. The need to increase capacity during the boom years in the 1960s and 1970s transformed most of the primitive industrial sites into complexes of buildings looking more like factories. The pagoda roofs on the maltings were levelled when the decision was made to bring in malt from elsewhere. In other cases, old warehouses were cleared when companies elected to age their stocks centrally, rather than at the distillery itself. If you do not want to take my word for it, go to the Glenlivet: you will soon see that the best view is from the inside, looking out. Yet there are a few notable exceptions. One of these is Strathisla in Keith. Then there are the two smallest distilleries in the Highlands, in many ways two working museums: Edradour, in Pitlochry, and Glenturret, just outside Crieff. Glenturret lays some claim to being the oldest distillery in Scotland. The River Turret was particularly favoured by illicit distillers in the 18th century and it is believed that whisky was being made on the site of the present buildings as early as 1717. The shell of the distillery dates back to 1775, half a century before the relaxation of the duties on distilled spirits which created so many of the larger operations on the mainland. Glenturret continued to produce whisky until the 1920s. In 1927 the stills fell silent and remained so for 30 years. During this time the distillery was stripped of its equipment. Then, in 1957, the buildings were acquired by a Glasgow whisky broker called James Fairlie. Fairlie was bored by his work, and was looking for a more interesting line of business. He did not have a lot of money but he managed to get the place up and running by signing a number of hire-purchase deals. In that way he was able to acquire a functioning Porteous grist mill and a couple of secondhand stills. Fairlie kept Glenturret going until 1981 by selling his whisky to big companies for use in blended whisky. In that year Cointreau bought him out. Ten years later, Glenturret reverted to Scottish ownership when Cointreau's masters, Remy-Martin, did a share deal with the Highland Group. James Fairlie stayed on until 1990. Since then his son, Peter, has been in charge. Glenturret still fills casks for other companies, but its strong point is how much it uses its own resources to good effect. Its Highland position, just below the Turret Loch, attracts around 200,000 tourists every year. For a small fee they are able to pop into the distillery and watch whisky production in miniature. The mash tun, for example, is so small there that it is stirred manually by a man with a paddle. The wash still, the most important of the two stills so far as quality is concerned, was replaced by a rather more sophisticated machine in the mid-1970s, but the old spirit still continues to be used. Outside in the yard lie the casks in which the whisky spends its long years of maturation. Most of them are American wood 'hoggies', constructed in Scotland from imported barrel staves. Old sherry butts from Spain are also in evidence. Scotland's smallest distillery, Edradour, pours all its production into one malt. Glenturret takes another path altogether. It bottles seven or eight different whiskies as well as a painfully sweet liqueur. Glenturret is a heavy whisky and this is already noticeable on the basic eight-year-old with its honey and butter aromas. Outside the distillery it is the 12-year-old which one sees on sale most often. This is a mite peatier with a certain smokiness on the nose. My favourite of the younger whiskies is the 15-year-old, with hints of honeycomb and preserved fruits. This also comes in a high-strength version - 50 per cent alcohol by volume - with fruity, heathery notes. Then come a series of weird bottlings. A 'copperlustre flagon' revealed a 21-year-old whisky smelling of varnish. The varnish aroma was probably caused by sherry, but it was far from being my favourite in the range. Another 21-year-old came in an expensive-looking cut-glass decanter. Again, this had matured in sherry wood. A third 21-year-old had been bottled at 43 per cent. This was a better balanced whisky with some attractive floral notes. Finally, there were three older whiskies from the golden age: the 1960s. This was the time when the whisky business was getting the best casks - before demand outstripped the supply of decent wood. The 25-year-old at 43 per cent was clearly from a bourbon cask. It smelled of sugar and butter being creamed together. A 1966 (27 years in cask) at 45.7 per cent was fruitier with a slight touch of that enchanting apricot and ginger character which is called rancio in Cognac. The 1966 Classic Vintage at 40 per cent had even more rancio character. Information: Glenturret is open to the public all year round but opening times are restricted in January and February.

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / New blow to Merrett as Archer talks fail CONCERN is growing at Lloyd's about the broader implications for the insurance market of problems at the troubled Merrett Group, after news yesterday that a rival agency had withdrawn from rescue talks. In a terse statement Archer Holdings, one of the largest agencies at Lloyd's, said: 'Senior executives of the Merrett Group approached Archer with a proposal that the management of the Merrett on-going syndicates should be assumed by Archer group companies.' However, after 'brief discussions the chief executive of the Merrett Group was told on Tuesday that Archer was not interested in taking the discussion further'. It emerged earlier this week that Travelers, the US insurance company, had withdrawn a plan designed to provide backing for Merrett syndicates. These have been hit hard by a fall in support from Names - the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the market. Travelers would have underwritten business alongside the Merrett syndicates on a so-called 'consortium' basis and also intended to take a stake in the underwriting agency. At Lloyd's particular concern centres on one of the largest syndicates, number 418, which may have insufficient backing to continue underwriting next year and other syndicates could also be forced to close, putting the future of the Merrett Group's underwriting agency at risk. 'It would leave a big hole in the market,' said a spokesman for Lloyd's. The Merrett syndicates led some of the most important international business at Lloyd's, especially in areas such as US liability, war risks and aviation, he said. There are also worries about the cost to Names of the 'run off' (paying claims on existing policies) of Merrett syndicates if these were forced to leave their accounts for the 1991, 1992 and 1993 years open. Members' agents  -which handle the affairs of Names - have channelled only about Pounds 60m of capacity (capital supporting insurance underwriting) to 418, an amount equal to about a third in 1993 of this year's level and well short of the minimum needed to continue. Other Merrett syndicates have also suffered a sharp fall in capacity. Merrett had sought a deal with Archer in order to persuade members' agents to offer more backing.</p>

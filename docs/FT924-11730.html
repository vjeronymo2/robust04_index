			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Dangers of Iliescu's victory: Why ethnic divisions are growing PRESIDENT Ion Iliescu secured a sizeable majority in this month's Romanian election, but doubts remain whether he will be able to unite the country and transform it into a modern European state. He was re-elected with 61 per cent of the vote in the October 11presidential run-off, more than 20 points clear of his opponent, Mr Emil Constantinescu after his party, the Democratic National Salvation Front, (DNSF) came out top of the parliamentary poll two weeks earlier. But the 62-year-old former Communist received a striking vote of no confidence from the country's 1.7m ethnic Hungarian minority. In Covasna and Harghita, two Transylvanian countries where ethnic Hungarians form the majority, Mr Iliescu and the DNSF received less than 15 per cent of the vote. Mr Iliescu and his party, won comparatively little support throughout Transylvania, Romania's ethnically mixed western province which was part of Hungary until 1918. In Transylvania, an unprecedented 42 per cent of the electorate voted along ethnic lines for either Romanian or ethnic Hungarian nationalist parties. In particular, the polls revealed a surge in support for Romanian nationalist parties who trebled their share of the country-wide vote to nearly 12 per cent since February's local elections. Romanian nationalists were boosted by the strong campaign of their presidential candidate, Mr Gheorghe Funar, the mayor of Cluj, an elegant Hasburg town, once capital of Hungarian-ruled Transylvania. Even before the elections, Mr Funar who characterises Hungarians as 'barbaric, migratory people' had achieved national notoriety for his anti-Hungarian stand. Since becoming mayor in February, Mr Funar has attempted to ban public signs in Hungarian and to close down Hungarian schools with little censure from central government even though ethnic Hungarians make up a quarter of the city's population. Ethnic Hungarians and Transylvania's gipsy and fast diminishing German minorities say Mr Funar's behaviour shows that, despite the overthrow of the tyrannical Ceausescu regime in 1989, they still do not have sufficient rights. Together with other supporters of the Democratic Convention the coalition of reform minded opposition parties which lost out narrowly to the DNSF in the parliamentary polls, they believe the election results will lead to increased tension in the region, especially among ethnic minorities. In March 1990 rioting between ethnic Romanians and ethnic Hungarians in Tirgu Mures, a town east of Cluj, claimed three lives. One immediate concern is that Mr Funar or other leading members of his party, be given cabinet posts in return for their support of a DNSF-led minority government. But Transylvanians, most of whom voted for the DC or other parties favouring a fast transition to a market economy, also fear a DNSF government will slow down reform, alienate foreign investors and prolong the country's severe recession raising fears of more ethnic violence. Many Transylvanians with their strong European traditions, fear Mr Iliescu's re-election will mean continued isolation from the west. 'Europe is dividing once again. Countries like Hungary have shown they can break with the communist past. These elections mean Romania will be left behind once more: Iliescu pushes us back towards the CIS,' one young doctor, an ethnic Romanian, said. Like many other young people, she believes the only solution for Transylvania's ethnic tensions is a better dialogue with Hungary and stronger links with the west. As for rapprochement with Budapest which has repeatedly aired its concern over Romania's treatment of its ethnic Hungarian minority, Mr Iliescu's second term has not got off to a good start. In the past few weeks Romania has blamed the virulence of the Hungarian lobby in Washington for Congress's decision not to grant the country most favoured nation status. By externalising Romania's problems, Mr Iliescu and nationalist groups may achieve popularity in a country struggling with the bitter legacy of the Ceaucescu regime and a a severely under-performing economy. But such statements are also likely to fuel nationalists in Hungary and further radicalise ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania, deepening rifts within Romanian society and destabilising a region already threatened by the Yugoslav crisis.</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Travel: Signs of hope under the wall - War and Peace (Travelling in Troublespots) / Jimmy Burns visits the Belfast front line It was at the far end of Cupar Street, West Belfast, in 1990 that I had first set eyes on Europe's last remaining political wall: a 20ft barrier of concrete and reinforced steel, zig-zagging through housing estates, churches, and factories, separating communities from each other on account of religion. The 'peace line' was erected 25 years ago by the security forces, with the support of both Protestant and Catholic residents. It still stands, a poignant symbol of political failure. The peace line cuts across the back garden of Colette Mcferran's small terraced house in Cupar Street and still blocks out the light from her sitting room. And yet, when I visited her, she sat talking of hope, a Catholic living in protestant-dominated Belfast. 'You know it's really strange but I'm not afraid to go out at night any more,' she said. 'You have to give it time, but the mood is changing. People are talking about the houses they would like to live in, and the schools they would like their children to go to, and the lottery.' Mcferran plays both the Irish and the British lotteries. It is this war-weariness, this desire to experience the ordinariness of life without bombs and bullets, that is making life difficult for the men of arms. For as the ceasefire continues, the collective sense of fear is gradually lifting. When I last visited Mcferran four years ago, she described at length how she and her Catholic neighbours felt harassed by the British army. She told me about the day three drunken soldiers had ripped the flowers from her garden and called her an Irish slut. Now she had a different story to tell, more in keeping with changing political realities. She described how her house had been taken over by the IRA. 'My daughter Sinead, who was then three, was sitting on my knee in the sitting room when these three IRA men kicked in my door and ran up the steps. They then started shooting from my upstairs window at the protestants across the wall.' Sinead was traumatised by the experience and had to undergo psychiatric treatment. Even now, at the age of seven, she still suffers from recurring nightmares and wets her bed. Whenever news about Northern Ireland comes on the TV she goes up and switches it off. The IRA has fewer friends than it once did in Catholic West Belfast. One of the greatest challenges facing the peacemakers of Northern Ireland is to change the attitudes of the children and young people, who have never known any other life than that dictated by political violence and sectarian hate. No one knows this better than Mina Wardle, a stress counsellor, who lives on the Protestant side of the peace line, a few blocks away from Mcferran, off the Shankhill Road. Wardle's life reflects the Troubles in microcosm. During the last 20 years, she has been the victim of armed robbery and death threats; she has tended to the mutilated victims of bombs, and seen a taxi driver shot dead outside her front door. Her first husband, an alcoholic, unable to cope with it all, beat and abused her until she had no option but to call in a friend in the Royal Ulster Constabulary. When I met Wardle in 1990, she was pessimistic about the future of Northern Ireland. As many local residents were being killed by paramilitaries as she was recruiting to her community workshop. She admits that such pessimism takes time and effort to erode, but she too feels a psychological change is taking place. 'After the IRA ceasefire, my son rang and asked what I thought about it. I told him I didn't think it was going to last. He said 'mum, don't be so cynical, you've got to give peace a chance. I just want to savour it. I want it to happen in my lifetime.' Then he broke down crying. That really touched me.' Wardle believes something fundamental was changing in Northern Irish society well before the ceasefire: the demoralising effect of so much of the violence and the sense of impotence that this generated among ordinary people, was giving way to a conscious effort to end tribal warfare. It was the IRA bomb attack on a political meeting above a fish shop in Shankhill Road in October last year (it left nine bystanders as well as the bomber dead and led to the inevitable retaliatory killings of another group of innocent Catholics in a pub near Derry) that cut through sectarian bigotry and provoked a catharsis. Neither the IRA nor their loyalist counterparts had any option but to consider suspending their military operations. 'Everyone involved in those killings felt they were in some way responsible and it generated a new way of thinking. All of a sudden people were united in wanting to claw back the value of life,' Wardle said. But wasn't the situation still fragile with both sides still holding back from handing in all their armoury, I asked? 'We have to believe that this is the end of it and that we cannot go back to a situation where people are prepared to kill themselves over a wee bit of land. You have to believe that tomorrow is going to be better than yesterday, otherwise you're never going to wake up,' she answered. Faith in a better, less violent future, the tentative thought - unimaginable a few weeks ago - that 1995 could be the year of peace in Northern Ireland has yet to break down the peace wall. But it is beginning to be shared by those whose minds were once set on protecting their kind by killing others. Twenty-one years ago Paddy Wilson and a woman friend were victims of a killing quite appalling even by Northern Ireland standards. Wilson, the then agent of the Catholic Gerry (now Lord) Fitt, and the woman were stabbed to death and mutilated. John White, the man charged with their murder and recently released after serving part of a life sentence, now sits in a recently furnished office off the protestant Shankhill Road, on the other side of the peace line from Cupar Street. He is a spokesman for the loyalist paramilitaries who have declared a ceasefire. The man responsible for what Lord Fitt describes as 'one of the most vicious murders in Northern Ireland history' looks fit and healthy, with his paramilitary tattoo on his right arm, and little repentance for past actions. White wants to talk only about the future. 'If I've changed my mind about violence, its not because of my prison experience but because of my analysis of the changing political situation - I realised that killing people was getting neither side anywhere and that it was futile. It was only alienating us from the community.' Yet change still has its parameters. Ask White about taking a bulldozer to the peace line and he will reject such an option, at least for now. He remembered the day it was put up. People were throwing petrol bombs at each other. He would be in favour of cutting a small door in the wall to allow people to move in and out during the day. It would close at nightfall. For he believes there remains a chilling threat of a return to violence. 'If rioting did break out again, it would degenerate into full-scale warfare. Stones would turn into guns, and violence would begin all over again. There needs to be compromise, but we have to move gradually,' he said. That night, I drove to Bombay Street, another Catholic ghetto which backs on to the peace line. I knocked without warning on the door of a local resident, who I knew was a political activist. Through a window I saw a youngish man, who had been sitting with his children, rise quickly and hide in the background. Only later, after extensive introductions through a family member, did he come forward. Martin McIlwee is leading a campaign to stop the peace line being taken down. His language remains unchanged as if the events of recent months were simply a cosmetic interlude in an ongoing process of ethnic cleansing. 'The day that wall gets taken down, the prods will be across, shouting 'Let's get those Fenian bastards'. If London is gearing up for another onslaught when the ceasefire breaks down, why shouldn't we.' So the collective catharsis has touched White, but not McIlwee. Quite how many fall into one camp or the other is impossible to say. Yet when I left Belfast this time it was neither White nor McIlwee that stuck in my thoughts, but Mcferran and her daughter Sinead. I remembered what parent and daughter had said about some British soldiers they had seen. Clutching her school books, Sinead butted in on our conversation and said: 'You know the soldiers make me laugh. They have pom poms on their hats which go round and round.' Her mother had a more ordinary explanation. 'It's very strange, you know, seeing soldiers without helmets. They look human.'</p>

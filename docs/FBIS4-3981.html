			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 27 (XINHUA) -- Peter Sutherland,  director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), will visit China early next month at the invitation of  Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi.    An official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation (MOFTEC) said here today that during Sutherland's  stay in China, the GATT chief will exchange views with top  Chinese leaders on China's resumption of its GATT membership.    This will be his first visit to China since last June, when  Sutherland succeeded former GATT chief Arthur Dunkel, who had  visited China twice during his term.    China was a GATT founding member in the 1940s, but applied  for the restoration of its contracting status in GATT in 1986.  The end of the Uruguay Round of talks last November has brought  China's restoration of its GATT membership to a critical stage  and the re- entry negotiations are being accelerated.    China is making strenuous efforts to become an original  member of the World Trade Organization, which is to take the  place of GATT.    Observers here said that therefore Sutherland's coming visit  will be helpful to push forward the process of negotiations on  China's re-entry to GATT.    Sources said that Sutherland, together with former U.S.  Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, will attend a May 11-15  international seminar on the development strategies of China's  foreign trade in the 1990s, which is to be sponsored by MOFTEC.    Some 300 experts, trade officials and entrepreneurs from  both  home and abroad are expected to attend the seminar and discuss a  wide range of issues concerning China's foreign trade  development in the 1990s, including the international trade  environment, strategic choices and administrative measures.</p>

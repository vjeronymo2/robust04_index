			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Excerpts of speech by Eddie George, governor of the Bank of </F> England, at Mansion House in London on 15 June]    [Text] The British economy is in its third year of  expansion. But not only that, over the past year, the rate of  growth has exceeded the rate of inflation. There have been only  12 years since the war in which the rate of growth has exceeded  the rate of inflation in this way and only four years since 1970.    Of course it is not enough. We can't be satisfied with this  achievement in a single year. The challenge is to improve on  this performance and sustain it year after year.    And, if you won't find this shocking coming from a central  banker, I believe the prospects are encouraging. First, there  is the improvement in the world economy, including the recovery  now clearly visible in our major markets on the Continent.    Second there is the improved supply-side flexibility of our  own economy, in both the goods and services and the labour  markets, following the deregulation and liberalisation that has  characterised the last decade and more. Compared with many  countries, in continental Europe certainly, this means that we  are relatively well placed.    Third there is our prospective fiscal position. The action  taken by the Government, and indeed by our present Chancellor,  last year, progressively to reduce the PSBR [Public Sector  Borrowing Requirement] was never going to be popular whatever  form it took.    But such action was crucially necessary. It was necessary to  achieve a proper balance between domestic and external demand.  It was necessary to make room for private-sector expenditure  and for a shift in the balance of private spending from  consumption to investment, without which the expansion could not  be sustained.    Finally, there is the monetary policy framework, which I  believe gives us a better chance of moving towards our goal of  price stability in the medium term than at any stage in my  professional lifetime. Since we came out of the ERM [Exchange  Rate Mechanism], a series of steps have been taken to make our  objective unequivocally clear and the policy process almost  totally transparent. The latest step, the Chancellor's recent  decision to publish the minutes of our monthly monetary policy  meetings will, in time, do a great deal to improve public  understanding of our shared commitment to continuing low  inflation. It may, though, spoil the fun for some of the  pundits who will no longer need to speculate about possible  disagreements.    The testing time will come, as it must inevitably come  sooner  or later, when we need to raise interest rates in order to  moderate the pace of expansion and pre-empt the emergence of  associated cost and price pressures. With the economy still  operating below capacity, though no-one can know just how far  below, it may be that this point is still some way off.    But whenever it comes, I hope that it will be regarded  positively, as a considered response to the underlying strength  of the economy and to the prospect for inflation in the medium  term, and not as evidence of weakness, in simple knee-jerk  reaction to the latest set of erratic monetary or economic data.    Our purpose will be to maintain the expansion at a  sustainable pace, and not to leave the tightening of policy so  late that the economy is brought to a juddering halt by a much  larger interest- rate rise than would otherwise be needed.    It is a realistic hope that next year I will be able to  report on a second consecutive year of growth above the rate of  inflation and I even venture to look forward to the year after  next.</p>

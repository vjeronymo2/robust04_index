			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, April 5 (OANA-BERNAMA) -- Malaysia  hopes that Swedish participation in the European Union (EU) will  lead to a more liberal economic approach internationally, Prime  Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said Monday night.    He said as a trading nation, Malaysia's future well-being  depended very much on open and unmanaged international trade.    Malaysia had noted with interest the recent completion of  the  negotiation process in the application of Sweden, as well as  Austria, Finland and Norway, to join the EU.    An enlarged EU, stretching into the Arctic Circle and the  borders of Russia, with a single market of over 370 million  people presents us with an enormous challenge and opportunity of  increased trade and cooperation, he said at a dinner for Swedish  Prime Minister Carl Bildt here.    He said as Malaysia welcomed the recent agreement on the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations and  the proposal for a world trading organisation, it hoped that  everyone would abide by the terms of the agreement.    Dr. Mahathir said it would be disastrous if some were to  renege or take unilateral action.    A developing country like Malaysia, he said, had very few  comparative advantages.    When we industrialise we have to pay interest on foreign  capital, royalty on foreign technology, access to penetrate the  markets or the rich and considerable amounts on consultancy.    Our sole advantage is our lower cost of labour, made  possible  by our low cost of living. We have to forgo many luxuries, and  even some necessities, he said.    The prime minister said if this sole advantage was taken  away, the country would not be able to develop, much less catch  up with the developed countries, and yet there had been talks of  levelling the playing field by removing the labour cost  advantage.    Bildt, in his speech, said he was impressed with Malaysia's  economy and social development.    He said Malaysia's racial cooperation was a good example to  the world.    He was convinced of the need for closer cooperation between  the two countries, especially in trade.</p>

			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Rise in digger sales expected THE MARKET for hydraulic excavators, one of the most volatile sectors in construction equipment, should experience a slow increase in demand in the next five years after a difficult 18 months. According to a report by Corporate Intelligence Group, the London-based analysts, a neutral Budget in March, followed by the Conservatives' general election victory, increased customer and supplier optimism. It says: 'The outlook for the economy would appear to be for slow, but gradual growth over the next two to three years, and this should lead to general demand in growth for new excavators.' The report adds: 'There is still the belief that when growth in the economy is assured, probably in 1993, the UK will be in for another boom period, because in the previous three years demand was low.' The hydraulic excavator market fell from a record 3,815 units in 1988 to 1,460 last year, with factors such as the Gulf war and political uncertainty reducing customer confidence. The group says demand might edge up slightly this year to 1,540 units, but this would not be enough to restore the majority of equipment suppliers to economic health. On a brighter note, it forecasts the market could expand to 2,450 units by 1995. The report says Komatsu of Japan took over market leadership from Fiat-Hitachi in 1990. Komatsu has been the biggest beneficiary of the decline in JCB's hydraulic-excavator sales since 1989, it says, but will face greater competition this year from JCB's crawler-excavator joint venture with Sumitomo Construction Machinery.</p>

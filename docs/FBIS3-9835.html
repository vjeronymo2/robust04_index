The agreement was signed early  this morning after 18 hours of talks by, on behalf of the  Croatian delegation, Hrvoje Sarinic, and, on behalf of the  representatives of the Serbs, Dusan Rakic. The agreement was  also signed by the representatives of the international  conference on the former Yugoslavia, who also chaired the  negotiations -- ambassadors Geert Ahrens and Kai Eide, as well  as UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] commander General Bertrand de  Lapresle. The agreement envisages the immediate cessation of  hostilities between the two sides and that the cease-fire along  the front lines will begin on 4 April.    Thirty-five individual maps on the separation of the warring  sides were signed, and it was also agreed that by 8 April at the  latest they would withdraw one km from the front lines.  UNPROFOR units will then be deployed between the warring sides.  Hrvoje Sarinic assessed the talks as very successful and  stressed that the agreement is not an end in itself but only the  first step toward the normalization of relations throughout the  territory of Croatia, which will follow the resolution of  economic problems and also a final political solution.</p>

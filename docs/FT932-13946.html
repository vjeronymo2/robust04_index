			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Clashes erupt ahead of Russia's referendum: Vice-president Rutskoi states presidential ambitions THE CAMPAIGN ahead of Russia's referendum on Sunday grew more bitter yesterday as the parliamentary speaker claimed President Boris Yeltsin would win only by cheating and vice-president Alexander Rutskoi declared his willingness to take on the presidency. Mr Yeltsin's supporters countered that 'aggressive opposition', amounting at times to physical intimidation, had been reported in some regions, while the pro-Yeltsin head of the Penza region had been falsely arrested and his family terrorised by police. Charges and counter charges of corruption and skulduggery are flying between the two camps. The charge by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, that the president would trick his way to victory was coupled with the accusation that the president was 'under the control of criminal elements'. However, according to the news agency Interfax, Mr Khasbulatov appeared to concede victory to Mr Yeltsin - though it was unclear on what terms. Mr Sergei Filatov, Mr Yeltsin's chief of staff, was also cautiously optimistic that Mr Yeltsin would win popular support for a key question of the referendum - that of trust in himself. However, Mr Filatov complained that 64 per cent of the local councils involved in organising the referendum had a 'hostile position' to the president. Mr Filatov also noted that even if as many as 70 per cent of voters turned out - a figure which government polls suggest might be possible  - it would be highly unlikely that a majority of the total electorate would vote for the president, as parliament has demanded. The four questions on the referendum paper are: Trust in the president. Support for his economic and social policies. Early elections to a restructured parliament. Early presidential elections. Mr Yeltsin has said he would define losing in the referendum as a No vote on trust and on early parliamentary elections. Meanwhile, General Rutskoi said he would put himself forward as a presidential candidate if Mr Yeltsin was forced to resign through losing the referendum. He said: 'I want only one thing - to stop this corrupt and criminal chaos which is called reform.' Avoiding direct criticism of Mr Yeltsin, he said: 'I have one complaint about the president - he has fallen under the influence of his entourage (which) . . . is immoral and remote from the problems of our society.' Gen Rutskoi would automatically take over the presidency if Mr Yeltsin resigned - as he has said he will if the referendum is not in his favour - but this represents the first time he has stated his presidential ambitions. Mr Yeltsin, meanwhile, vigorously defended his policy of using foreign assistance to help economic reforms by attacking those who said he should be ashamed to be begging. 'Those who say we have become a beggar do not know our own strength and the power of our people. Russia is a rich society - we are really rich but in our history we have not been able to handle our richness in a civilised way,' he said.

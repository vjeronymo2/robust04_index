			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Depressed seaside resorts in rush to seek regional aid THE DECLINING fortunes of traditional British seaside resorts have led to a rush of applications to the government for regional aid that is more usually reserved for depressed industrial regions. Several coastal towns have applied for assisted area status in the hope of winning regional grants, the Department of Trade and Industry has confirmed. 'It would be fair to call it a flood,' said Mr Dennis Artess, undersecretary for leisure and tourism policy at the Association of District Councils. The DTI will announce early next year the results of the review - the first shake up of the assisted area map since 1984. Among councils applying because of economic circumstances - in other industries as well as tourism - are the resorts of Blackpool, Brighton, Clacton, Great Yarmouth, Ilfracombe, Skegness, Torquay and Thanet. Tourist areas have suffered from changing holiday patterns, with more long-stay holiday-makers going overseas, while other parts of the UK, including urban areas, are becoming increasingly successful in attracting day trippers. The conference market is highly competitive while the recession has also hit other industries, such as financial services in the south, on which economic growth in resorts has depended. Unemployment rates in some tourist areas are on a par with existing assisted areas. The resorts could become knock-on casualties of the controversy over coal pit closures. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has said assisted area status will be used to help distressed mining regions. That will almost certainly restrict the number of new areas which will benefit when the final list is approved by the European Commission. 'If will be a breakthrough to get a coastal area designated assisted area status,' Mr Artess said. Assisted area status gives access to the government's regional grants for job creation and small business promotion. Criteria used in choosing regions include unemployment levels and measures of social deprivation. In its submission, Blackpool Borough Council said: 'Blackpool's image as a holiday resort diverts attention from the assesment of its real economic problems and the underlying weakness of its local economy and industrial profile. Blackpool is a serious unemployment blackspot which remains disadvantaged by the existing assisted area map.' Brighton Borough Council says local manufacturing industry has been 'decimated', the area's role as an office centre has been hit by oversupply in London and restructuring in financial services will hit 'a mainstay' of the local economy.</p>

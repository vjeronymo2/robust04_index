			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Li Bengui (2621 2609 6311), Taxation Research </F> Office, State Administration of Taxation: "This Year's  Large-Scale Reform of the Tax System--Promoting Comprehensive  Implementation of Value-Added Tax"]    [Text] Comprehensive implementation of the value-added tax  [VAT] will not only overcome the various deficiencies of the  product tax, but will also have all enterprises operate in  equitable competition, and thus also be more easily supported by  the taxpayers.    Reform of the turnover tax system is this year's major item  in financial and tax reform. Success or failure of this reform  depends directly on the success or failure of the reform of the  entire taxation system, and depends also directly on whether it  will be possible to fully develop the very function of taxation.  As we look at the objective demands with regard to taxation  posed by China's socialist market economy, and as we look at the  experiences and lessons gained in China and abroad in matters of  reforming the turnover tax, China's thorough reform of the  turnover tax system will have to be a matter of implementing the  VAT.  <H5>  Specific Ideas for Comprehensive Implementation of the VAT </H5>   Comprehensive implementation of the VAT means its fullest  implementation in all areas of commodity production and  circulation --excepting agriculture-- with due regard for the  principles of fairness, neutrality, translucency, and  universality, also having China's VAT conform to the standards  of international practices. Specifically, it should comprise the  following:    1. Abolishing the present product tax and business tax,  combining the internal and external turnover taxes, abolishing  the unified industrial and commercial tax, standardizing the  current VAT, and having the VAT cover all the processes of  commodity production and commodity circulation (excepting  agriculture).    2. Thorough simplification of the VAT tariff, establishing a  main tariff with no more than two brackets and a sundries tariff  of one bracket. Once the comprehensive adjustment of the VAT  will have been accomplished, it may be in order to levy a  consumption tax, with different tax rates and within a suitable  parameter, for commodities which require particular adjustments.    3. Implementing tax-excluded pricing, recording the amount  of  tax due on the invoices, and adopting the method of deducting  tax according to the tax deduction law.    4. Demanding that all taxpayers separately report VAT due,  and establishing a special VAT administrative organ, with modern  facilities, for the collection and administration of VAT.    After complete implementation of VAT, China's turnover tax  system will have only two types of taxes, the VAT and the  consumption tax. As soon as comprehensive adjustment of the VAT  will have been completed, and as soon as the tax base and tax  tariff will have been determined, it will then be possible to  maintain a state of relative stability. The consumption tax  shall undergo a special readjustment, the adjustment of its tax  base and tax tariff may consider the economic circumstances. It  is crucial for the comprehensive implementation of VAT that it  cover the areas of commodity production and commodity  circulation, and that there be an extensive simplification of  the tax tariff, and also that effectiveness of tax collection  and tax administration be ensured.  <H5>  The Necessity for Comprehensive Implementation of VAT </H5>   In China's present turnover tax system there are three types  of taxes: product tax, VAT, and business tax. The two kinds of  turnover tax systems, the internal and the external one, and the  current VAT have also been instituted on the understanding that  the tax burden of the original product tax would be maintained.  Therefore, no matter whether these taxes are named differently,  all turnover taxes, including the VAT, show evident traces of  the product tax; namely, they still levy taxes on the full  amount from the taxpayers, without consideration for the  taxpayers' costs. Although this will ensure revenue for public  finance, there is here a serious problem of duplication of  taxation, and this is detrimental to a fair equilibrium of tax  burdens as between import commodities and domestic commodities.    China's present turnover tax system is excessively complex,  and there are too many tax brackets. The present system of  unified industrial and commercial tax collected from foreign  firms is excessively complex, and there are too many tax  brackets. In the present unified industrial and commercial tax  collected from foreign firms, there are 108 taxable items and 40  tax brackets, the highest 69 percent and the lowest 1.5 percent.  The product tax has 96 taxable items and 21 tax brackets with  different rates, and one fixed tax rate, the highest rate being  60 percent and the lowest 3 percent. The VAT has a tariff of 31  taxable items and 12 brackets, the highest being 45 percent and  the lowest 8 percent. The business tax has a tariff with 14  items and 4 brackets, the highest 15 percent and the lowest 3  percent, while it is also prescribed that the temporary business  tax may be adjusted to within a range of from 5 to 10 percent.  This state of having too many tax brackets and a great disparity  between high and low rates is causing an inconsistency between  the nominal tariff and the real taxable tariff, imbalances of  tax burdens as between enterprises, and impedes fair competition  under the conditions of socialist market economy. It is also  detrimental to tax collection and administration, as it results  in serious losses of turnover tax revenue.    The standardized VAT is a kind of turnover tax which takes  as  tax object the added-value components in the various links of  commodity production, commodity circulation, and labor services.  It has therefore very obvious advantages over China's current  turnover tax: It makes it possible to thoroughly overcome the  deficiencies of the product tax with its double taxation; it  will benefit development of social production in its move toward  specialization; it will benefit the improvement of productivity  of social labor and the improvement of product quality; and it  will benefit stability in the tax burden and in the economy.    Under China's present conditions, comprehensive  implementation of VAT will not only be able to overcome all  deficiencies of the product tax, but will also have the  following advantages: It will enable equitable competition among  all types of enterprises; it will extensively simplify the tax  tariff; it will benefit the strengthening of tax collection and  administration and prevent loss of turnover tax revenue; it will  benefit efforts to overcome the present state of too high a  nominal tax tariff and a low real taxable tariff, and it will  more easily gain the support of the taxpayers.  <H5>  Let Us Seize the Opportunity for Comprehensive </H5> Implementation of VAT    Since the turnover tax accounts for over 60 percent of the  revenue from the industrial and commercial tax, it makes up 50  percent of the central authority's fiscal income. In the  interest of stabilizing its fiscal income and of stabilizing the  commodity price system, the state has all along, since the  beginning of reform and opening up, maintained a cautious  attitude toward reform of the turnover tax.    Repeated tax reforms of the past have been conducted, as far  as the turnover tax burden was concerned, on the principle of  always maintaining the preceding tax burden. This had been  completely necessary during the transitional period when China's  state-owned enterprises changed from turning over profits to  paying taxes and when the pricing system had not yet been  straightened out.    Following the deepening of the reform and of opening up,  especially since China has now for over 10 years experimented  with the VAT and accumulated relevant experiences, also done  very thoroughgoing studies on the theory and practice of VAT as  practiced in China and abroad, the possibilities of this tax  ever leading to a reduction in fiscal income, leading to harmful  fluctuations in commodity prices, and to unfair tax burdens on  the enterprises, will have been greatly reduced. Moreover, since  the central authorities are now determined on a thorough reform  of the public finance and tax system, the opportunity has  therefore definitely arrived for a thorough reform of the  turnover taxation system.</p>

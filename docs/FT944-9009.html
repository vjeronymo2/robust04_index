			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Packaging corporate presents - Christmas is coming and the gift budget is fattening up after some lean years The padded envelopes and strangely-shaped packages are starting to arrive: it is the time of year when diaries, pens, calendars, bottles and even hampers are beginning their ritual circulation between companies. Christmas provides the perfect excuse for buttering up clients in the hope that their custom will continue and augment over the coming year. Companies' gift budgets were tight during the recession, but those involved in manufacturing and supplying the gifts now report that business is brisk. There is concern from some in the industry that recent allegations in the British press of 'sleaze' in public life have put a last-minute dampener on enthusiasm for gift giving and receiving this Christmas; others report no discernible damage has been done. Alyson Cook, editor of the trade journal Promotions and Incentives, says that gifts have been in the spotlight more over the last few weeks than ever before. 'A certain amount of suspicion has been generated among general consumers as well as employees about receiving corporate gifts. It is a great shame because corporate gifts are all about the feel-good factor - enhancing your company's image with regular or potential customers,' she says. But Peter Austin, managing partner of Clearwater Hampers, which has seen sales 80 per cent up on this time last year, says there has been no sign of post-sleaze puritanism. 'Not a sausage,' he says emphatically, although he reports losing two or three companies which have their headquarters in Italy, which has had its own sleaze to contend with. Even where companies do object to their employees receiving gifts, it seems that some gift-givers may be finding their way round a ban. Says Alan McCleave, business development manager with Bordeaux Direct, the wine gift service: 'We are just given home addresses half the time. I would imagine that is one way of getting round it.' Austin is sceptical that mailings to home addresses show the rules are being bent. An external gift-giver would be unlikely to have an employee's home address and it would look a bit odd suddenly to ask for it, he says. Austin's hamper company also sends many gifts to home addresses, but it is employers themselves who are sending them as Christmas bonuses, he says. A home delivery saves having to lug a hamper home on the bus, and it stops envious glances at other employees' presents. Even at Christmas, hierarchy intervenes. Austin explains: 'If you have staff of different seniority, you do not want one person who has got a small hamper looking at the chap over the desk who has got one twice the size.' Apart from hampers and wine, Cook reports that gift vouchers, particularly those redeemable at large retailers such as Marks and Spencer, J. Sainsbury and Argos, have been a growth market in recent years. Goods bought with gift vouchers are unlikely to be a year-round reminder of the giver's munificence, or sit around on a desk like a pen or a diary, adorned with the donor company's logo and telephone number. Nevertheless, says Cook, vouchers are popular with recipients' families  - a warm glow at home is bound to enhance the feel-good factor. For some companies, giving gifts is all about attracting attention with freebies that are often in dubious taste. Says Cook: 'You can get your own branded condoms. They can be luminous, shaped to any size and posted under plain cover.' One of this year's particular hits has been dolls featuring the chart-topping pop band Take That, she reports. In the experience of Jill Wilkin, marketing manager of software company BMC, even the hardest-bitten manager will have a soft spot for a silly gift. Key-rings may be a cliche, but a train-shaped key-ring, which emits train-like sounds when a button is pressed, is apparently irresistible. Present one 'to a grown man who runs a company and he will fall about in hysterical laughter,' she says. While companies may toy for a time with something different for their corporate gifts, they will usually revert to the top five safe bets, according to Andrew Bourne, who heads the largest UK gift business, Bourne Publicity. These hardy perennials are pens, diaries, calendars, mugs and desk pads, replete with company logo. The logos have become more discreet, says Bourne, and quality of gifts has improved vastly. 'It used to be a high volume of low-priced items which fell apart, doing more harm than good,' he says. He finds that companies are now giving fewer gifts, spending more on them and targeting them more closely. Clients include Sony, Royal Mail and IBM, for which Bourne has assembled a brochure of Pink Panther-themed promotional gifts. Wilkin agrees that the emphasis is now on quality and targeting. Her main aim is to get desk space: 'We go for items which are useful, go on the desk and don't take up too much space. A lot of people now work in open-plan offices. You can't give them calendars because they don't necessarily have their own wall to put them on.' Gifts such as computer-mouse mats have been particularly popular, she says. Every item will have her company's name and telephone number. 'If they hit a problem, they don't even have to think who to talk to - our name is there,' says Wilkin. Like many other companies, BMC uses promotional gifts around the year, at exhibitions, seminars and as incentives, for example, for customers to fill in questionnaires. 'There is less of a push now at Christmas than there used to be.' For most companies the issue of whether or not to send corporate gifts this year will have been decided months before the current bout of sleaze allegations set in. According to Cook, 'the sensible promotional manager will have organised his gifts way back in the summer, buying in bulk to get a good price'. Even those who have hesitated at the last minute may reconsider their decision in the cold light of the new year, in the experience of McCleave. Last Christmas some customers said they were calling a halt to gift-giving. 'Then they all panicked in January when they found their rival companies were doing it and getting the business,' he says.</p>

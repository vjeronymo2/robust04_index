			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Jun 27, BNS -- Lithuania's leftist daily  TIESA (Truth) will change its name to DIENA (Day) July 1.    The newspaper's editor in chief, Domas Sniukas, said the  decision to change the name was made by the board of the closed  joint-stock company Tiesa. "Some supported and some were against  the decision," Sniukas said.    TIESA was founded in 1917 as a communist paper. During  post-war years it was the official newspaper of the Lithuanian  Communist Party and was "reorganized" in 1990.    The newspaper represents the interests of the ruling  Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party. TIESA, with its daily  circulation of 30,000, is the fourth biggest newspaper in  Lithuania. It will have 24 pages starting July 1.    Sniukas said the paper will become livelier and popular with  "more non-politics and non-economics." Professional skills of  the 30-member staff is still the newspaper's main problem, he  said.    In Sniukas' words, the daily will now pay more attention to  sale but not subscription.</p>

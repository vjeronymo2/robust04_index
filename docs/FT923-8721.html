			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Construction Contracts: Museum's storage plan The Science Museum has awarded TILBURY DOUGLAS CONSTRUCTION a Pounds 2.6m contract to design and build what is believed to be one of Europe's most advanced museum storage facilities at Wroughton airfield in Wiltshire. The project is part of a Science Museum initiative to improve the conservation and accessibility of its collections and the building's complex technical specifications will ensure that its contents are kept in the best possible condition, whilst a high-technology racking system will make it easy to locate and access individual objects. The building will be divided into two separate stores by a central access, goods receipt and service area. It will comprise a single span, steel portal frame covered with a composite wall cladding system and metal deck roof. Completion of the project is scheduled for the summer of 1993.</p>

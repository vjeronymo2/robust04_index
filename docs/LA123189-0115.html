			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WON'T HELP NORIEGA EVADE JUSTICE, VATICAN SAYS;  </P> <P> DIPLOMACY: IT IS THE FIRST PUBLIC COMMENT FROM THE CHURCH SECRETARIAT.  COMMUNIQUE IS SEEN AS A WAY TO SOFT-PEDAL ITS DIFFERENCES WITH THE U.S.  </P> <P> Soft-pedaling its diplomatic differences with the United States, the Vatican  said Saturday that it does not intend to help deposed dictator Manuel A.  Noriega evade justice by granting him refuge in its embassy in Panama City.  </P> <P> A communique from the Vatican's Secretariat of State one day after the Vatican  criticized harassment by U.S. troops surrounding the embassy was a clear  peace-seeking gesture, in the judgment of Vatican observers.  </P> <P> In the first public comment from the Vatican secretariat overseeing  negotiations, Saturday's statement said that "close contacts" continue with the  United States "in a spirit of serene collaboration" to find a "just and  mutually acceptable solution" to what it called a complex case.  </P> <P> On Friday, the Vatican, sensitive to complaints from Roman Catholics for having  sheltered Noriega in the first place, warned the United States against  "interference" with its diplomatic rights.  </P> <P> By the standards of a traditional, close-mouthed foreign ministry which  observes strict protocol and measures policy by decades, badgering an embassy  with loud music and frisking its personnel, as U.S. troops have done, is  boorish and counterproductive, one Vatican analyst said Saturday.  </P> <P> At the same time, the apparent lack of movement reflected in Saturday's  statement suggested to observers that the Vatican foresees no end to the  impasse before the New Year.  </P> <P> Noriega, whose military government was toppled by a Dec. 20 American invasion,  entered the Vatican nunciature one week ago today in flight from U.S. troops  seeking to arrest him to face drug trafficking charges in Florida.  </P> <P> "The apostolic nuncio had no intention of obstructing the course of justice  regarding a person who is accused of grave crimes," the secretariat's statement  said.  </P> <P> Admitted to the embassy in what the Vatican calls a correct decision of the  papal nuncio, Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, Noriega has remained  incommunicado there while the diplomatic tempest rages around him.  </P> <P> International conventions subscribed to by Latin American republics as well as  the United States and the Vatican provide the right of political asylum but  offer no protection to common criminals.  </P> <P> The Vatican said Friday that no decision had been taken on Noriega's request  for political asylum. Instead, he has "temporary political refuge" at the  nunciature but is being encouraged to leave.  </P> <P> The former strongman will not be forced to go, however, the Vatican says.  Neither, Vatican diplomats insist, is there any legal way that a diplomatic  mission accredited to Panama can turn him over directly to the United States,  which the Vatican regards juridically as "an occupying power."  </P> <P> Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro would not elaborate on the brief secretariat  statement Saturday but indicated that the Vatican had still not received a  letter written earlier this week in which Guillermo Endara, Panama's new  president, asked that Noriega be expelled from his sanctuary.  </P> <P> Throughout a tense week of negotiations, the Vatican has hinted repeatedly that  it would look favorably on a formal request from Panama for Noriega to face  criminal charges there.  </P> <P> Analysts here conclude that Endara sees nothing to gain for Panama by relieving  the Vatican of a hot potato.  </P> <P> The United States, for its part, says that Panamanian stability cannot be  assured while Noriega remains in the country. There has been no attempt by the  Holy See to locate a third country willing to accept Noriega, the Vatican has  said repeatedly.  </P> <P> Once again Saturday the Vatican defended Laboa's acceptance of Noriega's  request for shelter, saying he acted "to help end a conflict which in the  previous days had provoked great destruction and many victims."  </P> <P> L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, made no mention  Saturday of the diplomatic standoff with the United States. Instead, it  published statements from three Panamanian bishops, and from Cardinal John J.  O'Connor of New York, hailing Laboa's action in what O'Connor called  "effectively neutralizing Noriega and his violent stand."  </P></p>

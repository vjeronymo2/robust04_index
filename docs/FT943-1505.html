			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / International Company News: Olivetti's first-half loss deepens after shake-up Investment losses and restructuring costs drove Olivetti, the Italian computer group, into a loss of L280.7bn (Dollars 180m) before tax in the first half of 1994, more than L100bn higher than in the equivalent period last year. However, the group, headed by Mr Carlo De Benedetti, yesterday tried to rally jaded investors by confirming its earlier forecasts that it was on target to break even at operating level for the full year, after three years of losses. In the first half, Olivetti recorded an operating loss of only L6.2bn in the six months to June 30, against a loss of L119.4bn in the first half of last year. Olivetti shares have come under intense pressure recently because of concerns about investment losses and global personal computer price wars. As expected, Olivetti had to take a L103bn extraordinary loss in the first half on its investment portfolio, which the group maintains in reserve for unexpected restructuring and acquisitions. Olivetti will also have to record a L30bn extraordinary loss in the second half to cover hedging operations carried out to prevent further investment losses. 'We have been unfortunate, like 95 per cent of the money managers in the world,' the group said yesterday. Total extraordinary charges amounted to L231bn against only L5bn in the first half of 1993, when the group's pre-tax loss was L168.1bn. Restructuring at Olivetti, which has cut its workforce from 59,000 to 35,000 in the last five years, cost a further L100bn or so in the first half of 1994, and is likely to continue into the first half of next year. But sales, general and administrative costs are now equivalent to only 20.6 per cent of first-half turnover, against 28 per cent in 1992. Olivetti expects costs to come down to as little as 18 per cent of sales by the middle of 1995. Olivetti's consolidated turnover in the first half rose to L4,146bn, up 7.8 per cent on the equivalent period if adjusted for divestments. The group said yesterday that it had anticipated about 90 per cent of the recent price cuts in the international personal computer market, and pointed out that its products division had lifted turnover by 9.7 per cent, helped by a 34.5 per cent rise in personal computer sales. Sales of the systems and services divisions - which account for about 60 per cent of annual turnover - grew by 6.3 per cent and 7.8 per cent respectively. The shares closed yesterday at L2,008, before the results were known, down L30 on the day.</p>

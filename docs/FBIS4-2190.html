			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, April 6 (CNS) -- Illegal futures broking,  speculation on foreign exchange and fund-raising have become  rampant in Shenzhen in recent times, seriously disrupting  economic order there and arousing great concern.    Information released by the Shenzhen Industrial and  Commercial Administration shows that some unscrupulous elements  from outside the country collaborated with others to engage in  illegal futures broking, speculation on foreign exchange and  fund-raising without prior authorization. The administration  had on several occasions investigated some 230 cases of illegal  futures broking during 1992 and 1993 alone with the seizure of a  lot of computers and facsimile machines. Some of the suspects  rounded up were dealt with by the judicial department.    An official from the administration said that it would soon  launch a rectification of the futures market here in a bid to  crack down on illegal futures broking and speculation in foreign  exchange with the eventual aim of protecting the interests of  investors, purifying the market there and safeguarding normal  economic order. The official stressed that entities and  individuals were not allowed to carry out futures broking  without prior consent from the State Securities Commission and  registration with the State Administration for Industry and  Commerce. He added that neither were they allowed to engage in  financial futures business or foreign exchange trading as well  as fund-raising without the approval of the People's Bank of  China and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control.  People found in violation of these stipulations will be  seriously dealt with in accordance with the law while those  found breaching them repeatedly will be harshly punished and  even will be sent to the judicial department for legal action.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with the Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation, President Glavkos Kliridhis said that Turkey wants  to appear before the international community as having a calm  "profile" and that it is allowing Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf  Denktas to play hard. Actually, a game is being played that  seems to be misleading the United States. He added: "We are  telling everyone that what is happening is a game. We have told  the United Nations that this cannot continue because the Turkish  side has no political will. If there is no political will,  there can be no results on the substance of the Cyprus issue or  the confidence-building measures."    Asked whether the Cyprus issue is being turned into the  Famagusta issue, Kliridhis said that some have a strange view:  "For example, they believe that if they give us Kyrenia, the  Cyprus issue will become a Kyrenia issue, and if they give us  Karpasi, the Cyprus issue will become a Karpasi issue, and if  they give us Famagusta, the Cyprus issue will become the  Famagusta issue.    ``Just think what the situation in Cyprus would have been if  we had made the correct steps and gotten Karpasi then. We would  have secured one area. Today, everyone wants the decision of  the Third Vienna Treaty on Famagusta to be implemented. But,  when it was adopted everyone condemned it.    ``If the Turkish side believed that the Cyprus issue would  be  resolved by reaching an agreement on Famagusta, it would have  been happy because it would not be pressed to return Morphou or  other territorial percentages. However, it knows that Famagusta  is not the solution to the Cyprus problem and also knows that if  this measure works Greeks and Turks will socialize and cooperate  in Famagusta. If this happens, Denktas's main argument, that  the Turkish Cypriots do not trust the Greek Cypriots to live  with them, will collapse. The opening of Famagusta will  demonstrate that they can live together. So, Denktas will be  unable to maintain a dividing line and say that they can live  together in Famagusta but they cannot anywhere else.''  <H5>  Disagreements </H5>   President Kliridhis added that access to Famagusta is not  the  only point of disagreement. He said: "It is being said that the  Turks want separate customs offices. The Turks disagree. They  do not want customs offices. The thought was that products for  the occupied areas would be `bonded' and taxed there according  to the common market tax. The Turks do not accept this. They  are saying that each side can do anything it wants in its part  and charge any tax it wants. They do not accept taxes for  Famagusta or the airport.    ``They do not accept UN administration, either. They are  saying that there are `de facto' administrations, the Greek and  Turkish Cypriot, and do not accept the establishment of a UN  administration. They want a joint `de facto' rule with the UN  Administration.    ``We have started with the disagreements. Access to  Famagusta was the first one, and it continues to be. We  disagreed on the size of Famagusta's fenced-off area but it  seems that on this point they have accepted the municipal  limits. We also disagreed and continue to disagree on the  timetable. There are also other points of disagreement.''    Asked about Europe's role, Kliridhis said: "Turkey knows  that  it cannot be accepted in Europe now because of its financial  situation. So it is trying to utilize the financial protocols to  restructure its economy and prepare for the accession. Greece  has veto power and is using it. When U.S. President Bill  Clinton urges helping Turkey to join the European Union [EU], he  is doing it because Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller asked  him to.    ``I believe that things will change greatly when we join the  EU. This is why I believe that the stance we maintain until  January, when the issue will be reexamined, is very significant.  We have been told clearly that accession negotiations will  begin if there is progress in the Cyprus talks. Negotiations  will also begin if there is no progress, but not because of us.    ``When negotiations begin, Turkey will have to do some  serious thinking. Cyprus will obviously join the EU in two to  three years. So, Turkey will have to abandon any expansionist  designs or plans because it would be inconceivable to attack a  European country.    ``Then it must weigh the benefits of holding 37 percent of  Cypriot territory and maintaining occupation troops against the  price of being prevented from joining Europe. At that point,  Turkey will become more reasonable about a Cyprus solution.  This is why our efforts focus on keeping the talks open so it  does not appear that we would have been unjustifiably negative  on anything.''    Asked what he would have wanted for his birthday, Kliridhis  joked that he wants to be 30 years younger. He added: The best  gift for my birthday would be to see the Cyprus issue resolved.</p>

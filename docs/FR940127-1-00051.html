EPA and the Service are working closely together and with the National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to develop a comprehensive, habitat-oriented approach to water and fish and wildlife resource management issues in California. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Critical habitat designation for the federally listed threatened delta smelt would provide additional protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require Federal agency action. As required by section 4 of the Act, the Service will consider economic and other relevant impacts prior to making a final decision on the size and configuration of critical habitat. <!-- PJG 0101 clearpage -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento splittail occur in Suisun Bay and the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary in California. The Sacramento splittail has declined by 62 percent over the last 15 years. This species is primarily threatened by large freshwater exports from Sacramento and San Joaquin River diversions, prolonged drought, loss of shallow water habitat, introduced aquatic species, and agricultural and industrial chemicals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has proposed a rule to establish three sets of Federal criteria to protect the designated uses of the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta Estuary. The three sets include: (1) Salinity criteria protecting the estuarine habitat and other designated fish and wildlife uses; (2) salinity criteria (measured in electrical conductivity) to protect the fish spawning (striped bass) designated use in the lower San Joaquin River; and (3) salmon smolt survival index criteria to protect the fish migration and cold freshwater habitat designated uses in the estuary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hearings and the extension of the comment periods will allow all interested parties to submit oral or written comments on the three related proposals. The three proposed rules were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 6, 1994 (delta smelt (59 FR 852), Sacramento splittail (59 FR 862), and EPA water quality standards (59 FR 810)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

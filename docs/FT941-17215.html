			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Late rally reduces losses in nervous session - Market Report The first trading session of 1994 saw a highly volatile performance from UK equities, with an equally erratic trend in stock index futures calling the tune for the stock market. The FT-SE 100 Index was down 38 points at the day's low but rallied strongly, reducing its fall by two-thirds before the close. At its final reading of 3,408.5, the index was 9.9 off on the day, having touched extremes of 3,427.9 and 3,380.4 earlier. Traders agreed that yesterday's session had been difficult to measure since both market indices and volume statistics had been distorted by special factors. Senior executives at many market firms, and institutions, had returned from the Christmas break to face unexpectedly high trading levels in the marketplace. Morning meetings were often extended and there were lengthy telephone conferences with fund management clients. 'A slightly unreal day,' cautioned one leading dealer. Equities opened higher on the back of the further strength shown by continental European markets while London was closed on Monday. But, after climbing 9.5 in Footsie terms, the market was hit hard when the March contract on the Footsie opened sharply down and fell to a small discount against cash. US selling was blamed for the fall in futures contracts in both gilts and equities. Worries that interest rates may be about to turn higher in the US were balanced against hopes that the Bundesbank will this week lead rates lower in Europe. Pressure on equities was increased by hints that a UK institution with heavy pension fund exposure wanted to put Pounds 400m into the new index-linked tap stocks, and was funding the move by selling shares. But selling of both futures and shares dried up at midsession and a cautious rally turned distinctly better towards the close when London was taking heed of firmness on Wall Street and in some European markets. The Footsie regained the 3,400 mark towards the end of a session which had seen the index move through a range of nearly 48 points. However, traders were far from convinced that the rally was genuine. Seaq volume totalled 1.0664bn shares, well at the higher end of daily averages. But around 48 per cent of this total came from the placing of the rump of a rights issue from Wakebourne, one of the stock market's 'penny stocks'. Buttressed by the Wakebourne placing, trading in non-Footsie stocks made up an astonishing 75 per cent or so of the day's Seaq total, which was substantially above average. In addition, basket trading from the futures market indicated an even lower proportion of genuine investment activity in the blue chip Footsie stocks. The high level of interest among the second line issues, however, enabled the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to move against the trend of the blue chips, adding 8.1 at 3,799.4. Against this slightly surrealistic backcloth, the stock market made little significant response to the 1 per cent rise in domestic M0 money supply in December. Renewed vigour in gold bullion prices was reflected in demand for RTZ shares. There was the expected crop of shares moving higher in response to the round of broker recommendations for the new year. But across the wider range of market forecasts, there was some caution over the timing for the general advance in equities predicted for 1994.</p>

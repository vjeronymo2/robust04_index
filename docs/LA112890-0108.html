			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BICKNELL FIRED BY BOSTON COLLEGE  </P> <P> Jack Bicknell, who coached Boston College to four bowl games in his first six  seasons but had losing records in his last four, was fired Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bicknell departs after a 4-7 season in which the Eagles lost their last four  games.  </P> <P> His 10-year record was 59-55-1.  </P> <P> "I have no bitterness," Bicknell said after a meeting with Boston College  President J. Donald Monan. "I think they made a mistake. I think they got rid  of a good coach."  </P> <P> The Eagles went 5-6 in 1981, Bicknell's first season as football coach, but a  freshman named Doug Flutie emerged as the quarterback.  </P> <P> Boston College went 8-3-1, 9-3 and 10-2 the next three seasons. The Eagles lost  the Tangerine Bowl to Auburn, 33-26, in 1982 and the Liberty Bowl to Notre  Dame, 19-18, in 1983. In 1984, Flutie's senior season, they beat Houston,  45-28, in the Cotton Bowl.  </P></p>

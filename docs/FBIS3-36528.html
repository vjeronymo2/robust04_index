Latvia lacks money to build and arm its company in the  projected Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion and begin a higher-level  cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance.    Currently, it is important to clear out which countries  would  like to cooperate with Latvia to tackle the mentioned problems,  Miodle said. This work could be done by a Latvian permanent  envoy to NATO.    Real cooperation is even more important than simply  assistance, Miodle noted. The cooperation should be oriented  toward Latvia's eventual NATO membership.    Commenting on the Brussels visit, Miodle said NATO officers  primarily wanted to know what Latvia concretely expected from  Partnership for Peace and how realistic were declarations by  Latvian leaders on their country's intention to join the program.    The Latvian Defense Ministry delegation toured Brussels Feb.  2-3 at an invitation by NATO. During the trip, the group  visited NATO, NATO Supreme Headquarters of Allied Powers in  Europe and the North Atlantic Assembly.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Patchy signs of recovery in Midlands PATCHY signs of recovery have appeared in the regional economy of the West Midlands, traditionally the heart of British manufacturing industry. Meanwhile, the immediate prospects for growth in employment remain dismal and the rate at which companies are introducing new products has dropped sharply. Those points emerge today from a survey of more than 1,400 companies across the region, carried out in May when there was high corporate optimism after the general election result. Of the companies surveyed, 66 per cent expect the business climate to improve over the next six months. Such optimism is offset, however, by the fact that nearly half the companies are still reporting falls in profits and sales. The element of recovery is contained in the fact that this is a lower proportion than at any time since winter 1990. Analysis of the survey shows that improved profitability and sales have occurred most strikingly in the services sector. In manufacturing, capacity utilisation remains, as it has done for the past year, at under 90 per cent for more than three quarters of companies, and the volume of export sales has remained unchanged for the past six months. The recovery of the services sector sets the West Midlands apart from south England, where the sector has borne the brunt of the recession. Nevertheless, doubts remain about whether the West Midlands services recovery can be sustained without a concomitant improvement in manufacturing. Although only 13 per cent of companies expect to shed labour, while 33 per cent expect to take on people, the survey concludes: 'There is little prospect of overall employment increasing over the next six months.' Previous surveys have shown that companies have tended to underestimate the scale of future redundancies. Longer-term development of the West Midlands economy might be held back by a fall over the past six months in investment on new technology and by slippage in the rate at which new products are being introduced. In summer 1990, 45 per cent of companies had introduced a new product within the previous six months but now the proportion has slipped to 25 per cent. Moreover, 28 per cent of companies have either cut their training budget or have spent nothing on training over the past six months.

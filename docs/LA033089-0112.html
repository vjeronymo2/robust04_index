			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANKE'S BIG BOUT;  </P> <P> AZUSA BOXER TRIES TO STAY OFF DRUGS, WIN A WBC TITLE  </P> <P> Attention screenwriters: Check out Bob Richardson and Paul Banke. As boxing's  odd couple, it works.  </P> <P> Richardson, 40, is a prosperous roofing contractor (200 employees) but is  hooked on boxing. He runs an old-fashioned stable of fighters in the bouldered  hills of western Riverside County.  </P> <P> Banke, 25, is a promising bantamweight, a little slugger who is a headliner at  the Forum. He also admits he has a drug problem, and Richardson requires him to  live on-site at the training camp and undergo unannounced, weekly drug tests.  </P> <P> Theme:  </P> <P> These guys love and hate each other. They have been seen embracing each other,  and screaming at each other. Richardson: "I've threatened a dozen times to give  him the heave-ho, but I don't think I could do it, and he knows I couldn't do  it."  </P> <P> Plot point:  </P> <P> Up for grabs right now.  </P> <P> Richardson sat inside his motor home at his Quail Valley boxing compound and  watched a landscaper with a tape measure take notes while studying the bare  ground at his boxing compound.  </P> <P> "They're coming in with rolls of grass in a couple of days, we'll finally have  something green to look at here," he said. Then he shook his head at the  thought of the bills.  </P> <P> "My wife keeps asking me why I keep putting money into this operation. I've  sunk about $350,000 in this operation, and I don't know if I'll ever break  even."  </P> <P> Richardson calls his boxing business All-Heart Boxing. He manages, trains,  feeds, houses and generally nursemaids boxers. It all started when he was just  a fan.  </P> <P> "I used to go to the fight shows in Riverside with my employees," he said. "I'd  buy 30 and 40 tickets per show. I met a few fighters, and got to know Al Long,  my welterweight. He wasn't happy with his manager, so I offered to take him  over, not really knowing what a boxing manager was supposed to do."  </P> <P> Long, 26, is one of four All-Heart boxers. He's the No. 1-ranked International  Boxing Federation welterweight and meets champion Simon Brown April 27 at  London.  </P> <P> Heavyweight Levi Billups, 27, cast adrift when the United States Football  League folded five years ago (he was a Los Angeles Express linebacker), is a  former California heavyweight champion and may be George Foreman's next  opponent.  </P> <P> Russell Mitchell, 31, is a Richardson junior-middleweight.  </P> <P> Then there's Banke.  </P> <P> In the early 1980s, he was a successful amateur flyweight in Azusa. He was  thought to be a candidate for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team but lost to eventual  gold medalist Steve McCrory in the Olympic trials. Being a slugger more than a  boxer, Banke all along looked like a better pro prospect than an Olympic  candidate.  </P> <P> "Paul was 12-3 when I bought his contract for $1,000," Richardson said.  </P> <P> "I knew he had a drug history, I went in with my eyes open. But I also thought  he had a lot of talent, that he could go places if he was guided right. And I  knew that deep down he wanted to put his drug problem behind him.  </P> <P> "Right away, we got into some big arguments. I told him when he started with me  that I didn't think he was in good boxing shape, that he would kick . . . for  three or four rounds, then run out of gas.  </P> <P> "We argued about that at first, but I convinced him I was right.  </P> <P> "We also got into some big arguments over drugs. In the beginning, before I  invested a whole lot of time in Paul, I gave him every opportunity to tell me  to . . . and leave. But he never did. We yell at each other for a few minutes,  and that's the end of it.  </P> <P> "Now, anyone who sees him at the Forum will tell you he's as well-conditioned  as anyone who regularly fights there."  </P> <P> All-Heart boxers run every morning along a hilly 6.2-mile course near Canyon  Lake. Richardson calls it quality running, not road work.  </P> <P> "They don't just put in time, they train to beat their best times on the  course," Richardson said.  </P> <P> "Paul's best time now for the course is 36 minutes 18 seconds, which is a  little better than a six-minutes-per-mile pace."  </P> <P> Banke is a month away from his dream: A world title fight. On April 25, at the  Forum, he meets Mexico's Daniel Zaragoza, the World Boxing Council's  super-bantamweight champion. The WBC ranks Banke eighth.  </P> <P> Banke has become a Forum headliner. He won $100,000 for winning the Forum's  super-bantamweight tournament championship a year ago, and is a favorite of  Forum owner Jerry Buss.  </P> <P> Richardson keeps his fingers crossed, knocks on wood and isn't taking bets yet  . . . but he thinks Banke may have turned his back on the drug scene.  </P> <P> Banke lives in his own trailer, with his girlfriend, at Richardson's compound.  And he's confined to quarters.  </P> <P> Banke banks most of his boxing income; Richardson pays him a $100 weekly  salary.  </P> <P> "He's been clean for over 60 days, and for him that's great," Richardson said.  </P> <P> "I require him to live here, and that if he leaves he must let me know where  he's going and exactly when he's coming back. I (drug) test him every week, and  he goes to weekly meetings in Redlands."  </P> <P> Richardson's boxing compound is on 2 1/2 acres of a hillside, a few miles west  of Interstate 15. In what was once a print shop building, Richardson has built  a kitchen, small dormitory and gym.  </P> <P> He walks around the compound, carrying a cellular telephone, attending to the  details of running a boxing stable -- from ordering jumbo jars of peanut butter  to negotiating for future fight dates.  </P> <P> "My wife and I were married four years ago and in that time, we've probably  spent a total of six months together," he said.  </P> <P> "I even wind up spending a lot of weekends out here, just cleaning up the  place. My wife actually runs my roofing business."  </P> <P> Even in Banke's amateur days, coaches gave up trying to turn him into a boxer.  He's a slugger, a pure, flatfooted, leads-with-his-face puncher.  </P> <P> He sets up like a boxer, though, hands held high, against the cheekbones. Guys  such as Banke used to be introduced by ring announcers as " . . . and in the  red corner, never in a dull fight . . . "  </P> <P> In his last appearance, a Jan. 9 brawl against Ramiro Adames in the Forum,  Banke left them standing and cheering for more after an exciting sixth-round  TKO victory.  </P> <P> Going into his title bout against Zaragoza, he is 17-3 with 10 knockouts.  </P> <P> Despite the success in the ring, he has struggled with drugs.  </P> <P> "It all started after I won my third pro fight, in Las Vegas," he said.  </P> <P> "I came home, to Azusa, and for the first time in my life I had real money in  my pocket, about $1,500. I went to a party to celebrate and got involved with  some bad stuff.  </P> <P> "It became the thing to do. I kept telling myself I wasn't addicted, but I  was."  </P> <P> After his first six pro bouts, Banke tried to run away from his drug problem.  He moved to Blythe, but the climate was not any better.  </P> <P> "It was the same . . . drugs were just as prevalent there. I knew I had a real  problem, then. And I knew it was a problem I couldn't run away from."  </P> <P> Banke, after having gone through two managers, was hired by Richardson as a  sparring partner for his bantamweight at the time, Jorge Diaz. Banke turned  Diaz inside out, and Richardson signed Banke.  </P> <P> Banke has won five straight since he was stopped in the seventh round by Jesus  Poll a year ago at the Forum.  </P> <P> "That's a guy I want again, Poll," Banke said. "That was when I wasn't taking  care of myself, I wasn't in good shape. Since then, Bob has shown me I have to  pay the price."  </P> <P> Banke blames some of his problems on amateur boxing.  </P> <P> "In 1983 and '84, I was concentrating so much on making the Olympic team, I  almost stopped going to school (Azusa High School). I traveled to nine  countries my senior year, and never did get a diploma."  </P> <P> He was asked if beating Zaragoza would make up for not making the 1984 Olympic  team.  </P> <P> "That's hard to say," he said. "I cried so hard when Steve McCrory beat me in  the trials that year. The only satisfaction I have now is that McCrory won the  gold medal, so I can always say it took a gold medalist to keep me off the  Olympic team."  </P> <P> Of his relationship with Richardson, Banke described it pretty much as  Richardson does.  </P> <P> "Sometimes it's like a father-son relationship, or it's like we're pals," he  said. "But at other times, it's like we're enemies, when we're yelling at each  other."  </P></p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Job market blues hinder recovery - Investing in   ..the United States A 'GROWTH recession' may sound like a label economists apply to a situation they cannot understand, but it is the best anyone can think of to describe the US economy. A growth recession describes an economy which is growing but not robustly enough to have a positive impact on the unemployment rate. This is the US today. The economy is growing, (output climbed 2.7 per cent in the first quarter and should grow between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent in the second), but unemployment has also been rising, to an eight-year high in June of 7.8 per cent. The explanation is simple. Instead of increasing payrolls in response to improved demand, normal in a recovery, companies have been stabilising payrolls or, worse, shedding jobs, while getting more production from remaining employees. Jobs market problems have hindered the recovery severely, keeping a lid on demand growth. Against this background, it is not surprising that US stock markets have been subdued, in price terms at least. Trading volume has been strong, because of a large influx of individual investors' money, which switched out of low-yielding short-term instruments and into equities. Investors have been searching for higher returns since US interest rates fell sharply at the end of last year. Stock performance, however, has been disappointing. The Dow Jones industrial average has gained just 4 per cent since the start of this year and languishes more than 100 points below its year's high. The broader market indices have fared even worse, with Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index both showing net declines for the year so far. The Dow has done relatively well because it is packed with cyclical stocks. Companies such as Alcoa, International Paper, General Electric and Du Pont, the fortunes of which are most closely tied to the economic cycle, are thus expected to do well during a recovery. Investors have been buying cyclicals over the past six months in anticipation of a solid economic recovery. Cyclicals were favoured over big growth stocks that did so well throughout most of the post-1987 crash bull market. Companies such as Pepsico, Merck and Coca-Cola, consistently beat market averages on sales and earnings. Now it is clear that recovery will be much weaker than expected, cyclicals are out of favour. Analysts are recommending that investors should refocus on earnings, meaning growth stocks are back in fashion. Over the near-term, Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chair of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs in New York, recommends such growth stocks as Merck, Pfizer, Gap Stores and General Mills. Michael Sherman, market strategist at Shearson Lehman, has warmed to capital goods and big technology stocks, such as IBM, Sun Microsystems and Black &amp; Decker, while shying away from consumer stocks, especially retailers and drug/pharmaceutical companies. Most seem keen on financial stocks, which took a hammering in 1990 and early last year but which have performed best this year among the main stock groups. Low interest rates and low inflation favours banks. Well-capitalised regional banks, which are fast growers and have much tidier balance sheets than their counterparts among the big trading banks such as Chase Manhattan and Bank of America, are especially recommended. Since this is election year, foreign investors should be aware that there is considerable political risk in the market. A Bush victory was priced into equities after the Gulf war, and, although some of that discount has since been given back, there is still room for more losses if the President looks likely to lose, or loses, in November. A Clinton victory would not be welcome - he plans increases in spending and Wall Street is sceptical about how he would tackle the budget deficit. A large uncertainty factor has now been dissipated with Ross Perot's withdrwal from the race. The dollar has been falling steadily this year. Michael Duff, of Lehman Brothers in London, thinks British investors should focus on the strength of sterling vis-a-vis the dollar. Lehman will buy American stocks in dollars and its cheapness in sterling terms means a greater number of stocks can be purchased. He, like many others, believes that sterling is near its high against the dollar, which suggests the possibility of a currency gain for the UK investor. In international terms, US equities still look expensive. Using the S &amp; P 500 as a guideline, US stocks are trading at 15 times expected 1992 earnings, more than the UK (12.8 times), France (10.3 ) and Hong Kong (14.1). Only Japan (34.7) and Germany (16) are more expensive. Goldman's Cohen, however, believes US stocks are about 5 per cent undervalued based on her own in-house models, and are considerably more undervalued based on 1993 earnings. For the smaller investor, risk is spread by going into the US market through a collective fund such as a unit or investment trust. There are a large number of unit trusts investing in North American stocks, which may also include some Canadian stocks. Some of the unit trusts which have performed well include Perpetual's American growth fund, the US smaller company funds of Schroder, Thornton and Foreign &amp; Colonial, Cannon North American and Fidelity American. The minimum investment in most of these funds is Pounds 1,000 with initial charges around 5.25 per cent and an annual charge of approximately 1.5 per cent. Many US banks now offer accounts which allow investors with a minimum of Dollars 10,000 to invest in a portfolio of mostly blue-chip US stocks. Alternatively, high net worth individuals can go through the large American brokerage houses in London, such as Lehman Brothers, Citibank, or Merrill Lynch which provide complete portfolio management. Merrill Lynch estimates that to gain diversification through American mutual funds (similar to unit trusts) you would need at least Dollars 50,000. Citibank has a discretionary and advisory service, both for a minimum investment of Dollars 1m. At Lehman brothers, the minimum account size ranges from Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 100,000 for its managed portfolios.  ----------------------------------------------------------------                         FACTFILE: THE US  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Population, mid 1991:                                   250.9m Gross Domestic product:                       Pounds 3,205.9bn Market capitalisation, end 1991:              Pounds 4,213.3bn Inflation rate, June:                              3.1 percent Interest rate, 90-day commercial paper:           3.43 percent Exchange rate:                           Pounds = Dollars 1.93  ----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

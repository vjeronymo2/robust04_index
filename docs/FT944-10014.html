			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Swedish political rivals unite to call for Yes vote on EU Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Swedish prime minister, and Mr Carl Bildt, his chief political rival, joined in a rare show of unity last night to appeal for a Yes vote in tomorrow's referendum on joining the European Union. With the latest opinion polls showing the outcome will hinge on a large portion of still undecided voters, Mr Carlsson and Mr Bildt appeared together in a final television debate, arguing that membership of the Union was vital for Sweden's economy. Two polls published yesterday showed the Yes and No campaigns neck-and-neck, with up to 20 per cent of the electorate still uncertain. One poll, in the Gothenburg Post newspaper, showed the Yes campaign moving ahead by 42 per cent to 39 per cent. A second, in Dagens Nyheter, showed the two sides at 40-40. Mr Carlsson's Social Democrats ousted Mr Bildt from power in September's general election. But the two men united in the debate hoping that their combined political authority would overcome a strong anti-EU campaign led by dissident Social Democrats, leftwingers and environmentalists. Yesterday, Stockholm's financial markets were nervous, with long-term interest rates moving upwards early in the day. But with the latest polls giving sign of a Yes recovery after a surge for the No side a week ago, interest rates fell back. The krona strengthened and Stockholm stocks rose marginally. The referendum will determine the success of the EU's enlargement programme. Fellow applicants Austria and Finland have already voted to join, but a rejection by Sweden would represent a serious snub for Brussels, almost certainly presaging a No vote in Norway. The EU wants to bring the four new members in from January to clear the way for closer ties with, and eventual integration of, eastern and central European countries. But if Sweden votes Yes, the chances of Norway doing so on November 28 will be greatly increased. Yesterday, an opinion poll in the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten showed, for the first time for several months, the Yes vote moving ahead of the No side - by 46-41 per cent - if Sweden decides to join. Another showed the two sides equal at 41 per cent in the same circumstances. In Stockholm, Mr Mats Hellstrom, minister for Europe, said Sweden would push for greater openness in EU affairs.

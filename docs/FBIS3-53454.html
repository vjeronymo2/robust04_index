They will resume on Tuesday [18 January] instead of tomorrow.    Hasan 'Asfur, the head of the Security Committee emanating  from the Gaza-Jericho Committee, says the postponement is  because Dr. Nabil Sha'th, Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's  political adviser, is in Tunis, where he is briefing the  Palestinian leadership on the course of the negotiations and the  obstacles facing them. 'Asfur added that the coming round of  talks is expected to last until Friday. The discussion during  the coming round, he added, will focus on issues that are the  subject of differences between the two sides, primarily the area  of Jericho, the control of the crossing points, and the control  of the border points between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho  and the West Bank.    At its last meeting, the Palestinian-Israeli Security  Committee ran into difficulties due to differences in views over  issues relating to Jericho, the security of the settlements, and  the crossing points.    As for the Civilian Committee, progress was made on the  transfer of civilian powers to the Palestinians in the areas of  services and infrastructure. Some points relating to water,  archaeology, and town planning remain to be solved in the coming  round.</p>

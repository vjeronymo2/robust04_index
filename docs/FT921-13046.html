			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Sharp decline in venture capital THE VENTURE capital industry contracted sharply in the second half of last year, according to Levy Gee, the accountants. UK Venture Capital Database, the firm's computerised directory of venture funds, showed that 17 funds ran out of cash to invest and one new fund was set up. That represented a decline of about 10 per cent in the number of funds still active. A total of 146 funds responded to the latest six-monthly update of the database. The figures reflect a marked acceleration in the decline of the venture capital industry.</p>

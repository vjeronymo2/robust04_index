			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Mobiles for the masses: Michiyo Nakamoto on competition over portable telephones After years of spectacular growth, spurred by the image of the high-powered businessman, changing conditions are forcing the mobile telephone to go down-market. The expensive but essential business accessory of the 1980s is set to become the mass-market consumer item of the 1990s. The change is being ushered in this summer by a battle between the UK's two cellular phone operators which want to bring mobile telephones to the ordinary consumer. Yesterday, Vodafone, owned by Racal Telecom, announced a new pricing scheme called Low Cost Vodafone, to be launched in October. It comes in response to a similar scheme, Cellnet Lifetime, which was unveiled by Cellnet, owned by BT and Securicor, in June. Vodafone's new pricing policy will mean connection charges will fall from the current Pounds 50 to Pounds 30, and monthly line rental charges from Pounds 25 to Pounds 15. Cellnet is likely to offer similar rates. Handsets will also be priced at about Pounds 250 from this autumn, compared with as much as Pounds 800 today. In exchange for lowering these charges, the network operators are making it more expensive for users of the scheme to make calls during peak hours. Vodafone's new low-use tariff has a peak-time call charge of 54p a minute inside the circumference of the M25 motorway; 46p outside. Peak hours are 7am-8pm, Monday to Friday; off-peak charges from 8pm-7am anytime during the week are 15p a minute. Cellnet's new low-use tariff has a peak call charge of 50p per minute for anywhere within the UK and an off-peak charge of 20p per minute. Peak hours are from 8am to 7pm, Monday to Friday; off-peak charges are at all other times. The aim is to expand into the consumer and small business markets of mainly occasional users who are keen to own a mobile phone for the convenience it offers, but who are discouraged by the high costs of subscribing to a service. For users who do not make many calls, the service will be cheaper, but those making at least one peak-time call a day will find it more expensive. Cellnet expects to add 200,000 new subscribers to its service in the first year after the scheme is launched in November. Vodafone predicts that with the new low-use tariff the number of mobile phone users in the UK will increase from 1.3m today to 7m by 2,000, of which half will be non-business users. At the moment, only about 5 per cent of users are non-business. 'The cellular phone industry has now passed its adolescence,' says a Cellnet representative. 'We're going from a low-volume, high-margin business to a high-volume, low-margin one.' This direction holds out the only hope of growth, as the business market has become saturated, he says. The recession has played a part in the transition. Although there are some signs that the market is picking up from its lowest point in summer 1991, there has been a substantial loss of customers over the past year - more customers are making fewer outgoing calls, which means lower revenues for the operators. 'It's a middle-management and small-business recession, and those are the people who mainly use the network,' says a Vodafone representative. What is worse, however, is that the business market of mobile phone users may not be growing much at all. The overall cellular phone market grew just 7 per cent last year, compared with growth rates of anywhere between 70 and 100 per cent in the heydays of the late 1980s. Cellnet believes that high-usage customers, who are more profitable for the network operators, are already signed on to a service. New subscribers, Cellnet is discovering, make less use of their phones. To stimulate growth, prices would have to come down to levels acceptable to ordinary consumers. Rates of Pounds 50 for a connection and a monthly line rental charge of Pounds 25 are seen by many consumers as too expensive. One City observer said that when Cellnet announced its new pricing policy, his mother decided she could now afford to operate a mobile phone. But simply reducing prices across the board, while it would enlarge the market, would hurt profitability. The complicated arrangement of introducing a different pricing scheme was necessary to lure non-business users while keeping business customers happy on the current scheme. Business users who do not use their mobile phones frequently are expected to switch to the new pricing structure. Vodafone anticipates that 20 per cent of its existing customers will migrate, meaning a drop in profits of Pounds 5m in the first year. But the company expects customers to have switched to the new pricing scheme within two years, after which it hopes to see overall profit growth as new customers subscribe. Unlike Cellnet, Vodafone believes there is still room for growth in the business market, though it is just as keen to tap the non-business market as its rival. Both Vodafone and Cellnet face the prospect of competing with a new mobile system with the launch next year of Personal Communications Networks (PCNs). These are digital radio communications networks that will link users via radio handsets to ordinary telephone exchanges. Because they will user smaller handsets, and will cost only about half what Vodafone and Cellnet charge their business customers, they are expected to pose a serious threat to current mobile telephone systems. In addition to PCNs, the GSM system, a digital standard that has been adopted by 17 European countries, will make a pan-European mobile telephone system available in a few years. PCNs are likely to pose a greater immediate threat to the UK's two existing mobile phone operators, since it will take some time for the GSM network to be set up. GSM handsets are also likely to be heavier and more expensive than those currently available. Vodafone already planned to address the PCN threat by launching a lower-cost scheme, called MCN (microcell network), which would reduce connection and line rental costs. Although Vodafone stresses that the impending battle with Cellnet for more of the consumer market is not a price war, it is clearly launching its new pricing structure just one year before it plans to introduce MCN, because it fears being pre-empted by Cellnet. 'We cannot afford to let the competition offer something we don't,' Vodafone says. With new services coming on offer over the next few years, competition is bound to heat up even further, reducing prices and bringing mobile telephones within reach of more people. 'It will undoubtedly be a war,' says Mr Chris Gent, Vodafone's managing director.</p>

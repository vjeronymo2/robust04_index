			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: The UK Treasury's mid-year forecast of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement was perceived as quite conservative, so analysts will be watching today's figures for June's deficit to see if the government is likely to undershoot its Pounds 36bn forecast for 1994-95. June's PSBR is expected to be Pounds 3.7bn. Wednesday: While M0 growth has been racing away beyond its monitoring range, growth in M4, the government's broadest measure of the money supply, has been subdued. Figures published today are expected to show the trend continuing, with annual growth edging up to 5.5 per cent in June, from 5.3 per cent in May. The more erratic sterling M4 lending figure is ex- pected to show net new lending of Pounds 1.3bn in June. Thursday: The UK's trade balance has been improving slightly in recent months and the non-European Union trade deficit in June, released today, is expected to have dropped to Pounds 700m in June, from Pounds 767m in May. Also published today: the British Chambers of Commerce quarterly economic survey, which is expected to reflect businesses' concern about rising costs.</p>

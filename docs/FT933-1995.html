			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Profit warning hits Nike shares SHARES in Nike fell sharply yesterday after the US athletic shoe and apparel manufacturer warned that earnings in the current fiscal year would fail to match 1992-93 levels. In response to the announcement, Wall Street marked down Nike's shares by Dollars 2 to a 52-week low of Dollars 46 in heavy trading. The stock, which was hit hard in June after the company scaled back its growth projections, has lost nearly half its value since November. At the company's annual meeting in Beaverton, Oregon, Mr Philip Knight, chairman, also announced that Nike would cut its worldwide workforce by 3 to 4 per cent as part of an effort to reduce costs by Dollars 50m this year. The company said it was basing its earnings projections on a downturn in 'futures' orders, placed by retail outlets six months ahead of delivery. These were lagging, it said, because retailers remained cautious in the face of continued economic sluggishness. In the first quarter of the year ended August 31, net income was Dollars 114m, or Dollars 1.49 a share, down 7 per cent from the comparable period last year, when Nike posted earnings of Dollars 122m, or Dollars 1.60. Nike said unfavourable currency exchange rates and higher US taxation were largely responsible for the decline. If these factors had remained at 1992 levels, earnings would have been Dollars 1.61 a share, about the level analysts had anticipated. The setback came on a 1 per cent increase in revenues, to Dollars 1.107bn, against Dollars 1.099bn in the first quarter last time. In the US, footwear and apparel sales out-paced last year's levels by 5 per cent. Sales of basketball shoes, Nike's mainstay line, slid 16 per cent to Dollars 159m.</p>

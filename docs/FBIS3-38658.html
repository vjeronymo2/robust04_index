Speaking at the 31st  Conference on Security Policy in Munich, Perry stressed,  however, that the United States would by no means take such  steps unilaterally, because 28,000 lightly armed UN soldiers  stationed in Bosnia, who had been made available by its allies,  were surrounded by 200,000 "highly armed combatants."    NATO had the capacity to carry out such air strikes, Perry  underlined. It would be possible to begin such a strike only an  hour after the command was given, because all the means  necessary to do so had been deployed. Consideration would still  have to be paid to the probable political consequences of such  an attack. Thought must be given not just to the first act, but  also to whom would play the second and third acts and end the  drama, Perry said.    Perry said another available option was to lift the arms  embargo against Bosnia. On the other hand, he ruled out a  military enforcement of a peace solution in Bosnia. Perry also  rejected the view that NATO and the United States were inactive.  The provision of supplies from the air alone had assumed  dimensions which were comparable to the Berlin airlift.</p>

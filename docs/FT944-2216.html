			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Manila aims at 6% growth The Philippines has formalised an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for an increase in 1995 monetary expansion targets that will allow the country to aim for an overall economic growth of about 6 to 6.5 per cent, negotiators from both panels announced yesterday. Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the central bank, said total domestic liquidity, or M3, would be allowed to grow by 23 per cent, while base money (currency in circulation and reserve balances of banks) could increase by up to 24 per cent. The previous targets were 13.3 per cent for M3 and 9.5 per cent for base money. The IMF agreed to the rise to give the Philippines 'more elbow room for growth manoeuvres' following an 'overperformance' in the international reserves, Mr Singson said. Philippine gross national product is projected to grow by 5.5 per cent this year, compared to 3.5 to 4.5 per cent projected in the IMF programme, while inflation is forecast to average 9.2 per cent, against the target of 9.5 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes From the Proposed Rule in the Final Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The amendatory language to &sect;676.20 in the proposed rule was numbered in such a manner that existing paragraphs (a)(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Qualified persons  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and (a)(2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Vessel categories  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> would have been deleted. This was a technical oversight. Paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of &sect;676.20 will remain as published on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59375), and will not be amended by this final rule. The amendatory language in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of &sect;676.20, which was in the proposed rule published June 28, 1994, (59 FR 33272) will be incorporated in paragraph (a) of &sect;676.20 of this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The reference to &sect;676.22 in &sect;676.21(c)(2) was changed to &sect;676.22(j) to indicate the paragraph of the regulatory text intended to be referenced by the citation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Twenty-two letters of comments were received regarding the Modified Block Proposal. Twelve letters provided comments that supported the Modified Block Proposal, eight letters provided comments in opposition, and two letters provided no comments. These comments, which are summarized and responded to below, were considered during the formulation of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 1:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Modified Block Proposal is overly restrictive, especially to the smaller vessel categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Though the Modified Block Proposal will have a larger impact on the smaller vessel categories, the determining factor of whose QS will be blocked is the amount of catch landed and duration of participation during the qualifying years, not vessel size. Some owners/lessees of large and small vessels will be issued QS as a block, and some owners/lessees will be issued unblocked QS. More owners/lessees of smaller vessels will have blocked QS due to smaller harvests during the qualifying years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most of the QS issued in smaller vessel categories will be blocked. The QS in small blocks will have less value, making those blocks difficult to market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The response to Comment 1 addresses why most QS issued in smaller vessel categories will be blocked. Any determination on the value of blocked or unblocked QS, whether in large or small quantities, is purely speculative. Blocked QS may be more or less valuable than unblocked QS, depending upon market forces. Small blocks, with their lesser overall dollar value, will make the IFQ Program more accessible to new entrants. Furthermore, the Modified Block Proposal allows very small blocks to be combined into fishable amounts under the ``sweep-up'' provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All QS should be blocked or unblocked. It is inequitable and discriminatory to block some QS and not other QS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

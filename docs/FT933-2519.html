			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Size does matter, say New Delhi bureaucrats: Plans to smother soft-drink bottles in red tape anger international bottlers THE INDIAN bureaucracy, famous for its ability to wrap a sub-continent in red tape, has turned its attention to the Coca-Cola bottle. The ministry of civil supplies, consumer affairs and public distribution - apparently oblivious to the efforts of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao to liberalise the economy - has thought it fit to try to regulate the size of soft-drink bottles. The ministry argues that with India opening its economy, new companies, including the US group Coca-Cola, will flood the market with bottles in all shapes and sizes. The Indian consumer would then become thoroughly confused and be cheated by small bottles pretending to be bigger than they really were. Since nearly half the population cannot read, labels stating the size of a container offer consumers too little protection. 'Our country is different from other countries,' says Mr N S Pangtey, a deputy director at the ministry. 'Our masses are illiterate.' Executives at the Indian affiliate of Coca-Cola are incensed at the ministry's move. The company said that elsewhere in the world even illiterate consumers quickly learned to distinguish between bottles. Of the 195 countries in which Coca-Cola operates, only India is planning to restrict competition by controlling bottle sizes. 'This is against the whole process of liberalisation. The consumers should be free to decide what sizes of bottles they prefer,' the company said. Many countries standardise container sizes - so that consumers are not fooled by a 195ml bottle masquerading as one of 200ml. But the ministry of civil supplies is proposing to ban whole size ranges. Soft-drink bottlers would be permitted to use only 250ml, 500ml, 700ml and one-litre bottles, plus some larger sizes. Bottles of 200ml and 300ml would be banned if the ministry's proposals are approved by the government, even though bottles in these sizes have long been sold in India. The ministry also proposes to regiment the sizes of containers for a whole range of other packaged drinks and foods, including bottled fruit juices. However, for fruit juices 200ml and 300ml bottles would be allowed, but not the 250ml to which soft-drink bottlers would be limited. Mr Pangtey cannot explain this discrepancy expect by saying it was a decision of the standing expert committee of weights and measures.</p>

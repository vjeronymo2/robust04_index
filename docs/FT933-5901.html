			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Business and the Environment: Seeing the wood for the trees  -Attempts to manage New England's forests A trip to New England's northern forests appears comforting to anyone looking for unspoiled nature. Trees cover vast areas - New Hampshire and Vermont boast 80 per cent tree cover and Maine 90 per cent - and the forests are home to large populations of deer, moose, black bear and other wildlife. This is misleading though, according to environmentalists, who are concerned about increased logging and mounting pressures for property development in the region. Pressure is building as a result of rising prices for timber and property. The controversy over protection of the spotted owl in the Pacific north-west has driven up timber prices throughout the US. In the first six months of 1993, prices for New England softwood rose by 10 per cent, according to Sidney Balch, chief forester in Maine for Boise Cascade, the paper and timber group. 'With new restrictions on logging in other parts of the country, a lot of demand is heading this way,' says Roberta Borland, executive director for the Vermont Forest Products Association. In 1992, Vermont produced 502m board feet of timber, more than twice that of 1970. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company's purchase last month of 238,000 acres of forest in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont troubled environmentalists. According to the company, the land will not be used for property development, but ecologists are worried. 'There are a lot of land deals going on that we don't know about,' says Lewis Milford, who heads the Vermont Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental agency. 'And when you see large tracts of land changing hands, it all adds to the uncertainty.' Ironically, concern over the future of New England's wooded lands comes at a time when many ecologists are celebrating the seemingly miraculous recovery of the area's forests. The forests are a relatively new, natural resource. By the late 1800s, settlers in the region had cleared most of the timber to make room for farms. Immediately following the American civil war, Vermont had just 25 per cent tree cover, New Hampshire 30 per cent and Maine 40 per cent. When farmers moved to the more agriculturally friendly mid-west, the forests of the north east took over once more. New England's forests have also become a vital natural resource for the region, accounting for at least Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) a year in economic activity. Logging is just part of the equation. Sawmills, paper and pulp factories, furniture makers and maple syrup producers are all dependent on timber from the region. Industrialists and environmentalists alike are determined to maintain the sector's vitality. 'All sides of the issue want to see this economic activity encouraged,' says Charles Levesque, executive director of the Northern Forests Land Council, a group formed to study the impact of development on the forests' ecosystem. 'It's a question of how the land should be managed, how many trees should be cut at a time and how much clear-cutting should be allowed.' Several factors make life more difficult for ecologists. Unlike the Pacific north west, which is covered by vast tracts of public lands, the vast majority of New England's wooded areas are in the hands of private owners. For states which are known for stringent environmental controls, the laws protecting New England's forests are surprisingly loose. New England forests also lack the rare plant and animal life and old-growth forests which have been invoked to enforce protection in other parts of the country. 'Because this is a new natural resource, it's relatively homogeneous ecologically,' says Gary Decordova, who heads the Green Mountain National Forest agency. 'In fact, one of our challenges is to increase diversity.' To maximise the economic impact of logging in the northern forests, state governments are hoping to encourage more 'value-added' activity. Vermont recently converted 12 schools from electric to wood-burning heat to encourage local wood use, cutting energy costs by 10 per cent according to David Stevens, director of forests for Vermont. To encourage value-added activities, New England states have launched a marketing campaign to attract wood-based industries to the area. Several furniture and furniture parts makers have opened their doors and companies have begun to make everything from wood curl packing materials to musical instruments. Even if the logging industry is well-managed, however, the region's forests will still be threatened by pressures for development in the region. Demand is beginning to pick up for second-home building. 'What you get with second home development is a lot of small parcels of timber,' says David Kittredge, associate professor of forestry at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst. 'This poses an environmental problem, because the wildlife can't get to where it needs to go without crossing through developed areas or over highways. It also creates huge problems for the logging industry. Even if a lot of tree cover remains, it's expensive to move all the equipment around to log small plots of land.' Environmentalists hope to introduce legislation to improve controls on land use and forest practices in the region, but with so much land in private hands, they are likely to face an uphill battle. But despite the problems, industrialists and ecologists in the region remain optimistic they will be able to resolve their problems. 'The conflicts are building, but we still hope that with continued dialogue, we can manage the forests in such a way that everyone will benefit,' says Balch.</p>

			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / NatWest launches rival to Firstdirect NATIONAL Westminster Bank is to launch a challenge to Firstdirect, Midland's telephone banking subsidiary. It is the first attempt by a competitor to match Firstdirect, which has more than 350,000 customers. NatWest is planning to extend PrimeLine, a pilot telephone banking service, to people who do not hold NatWest accounts. They will be offered access to a personal account manager, as well as a range of banking services. The bank has been experimenting with telephone banking for 18 months, but has confined the PrimeLine service to about 9,000 NatWest customers. It intends at least to double the number of PrimeLine account holders in the coming year. Most high street banks are experimenting with telephone banking services to support branch networks, but none has established a subsidiary like Firstdirect. PrimeLine is the closest challenge Firstdirect has faced. PrimeLine does not offer a 24-hour service: customers can telephone its centre in Bradford, West Yorkshire between 8am and 10pm on weekdays, and 9am and 5pm at weekends. But NatWest argues that it offers a wider service than Firstdirect. Firstdirect has drawn some 70 per cent of its account holders from outside Midland. Mr Larry Cattle, NatWest's head of customer relationships, said the bank had chosen 'busy professionals' within NatWest as PrimeLine account holders. It now intended to attract a similar mix of customers from outside. 'Firstdirect has been taking some of our customers, and we think we can offer something to people who do not yet bank with us,' said Mr Cattle. He said PrimeLine would probably double or treble its customer base in its next year. Mr Cattle said that if customers outside NatWest reacted well to the PrimeLine service, it was likely to be extended. He said PrimeLine would not be marketed through national advertising. Instead, NatWest would probably try direct marketing for its pilot service. Unlike Firstdirect, which has a separate product range from Midland, NatWest customers who join PrimeLine are offered standard NatWest products and services.</p>

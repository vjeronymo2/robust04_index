It reflects a  continuation of the choices and guidelines set forth in the  Eighth Economic and Social Development Plan.    The reforms initiated in the fields of taxation,  deregulated trade, and incentives for private investment are  being continued.    While the 1994 General State Budget reflects a calm  climate characterized by the positive results recorded over the  preceding two years in terms of growth, employment, restraint of  price developments, and preservation of the internal financial  equilibriums, it nevertheless faces a certain amount of pressure  due to the foreign debt and the need to prevent runaway price  increases as a result of the wage increases granted in 1993.    It is in that optimistic context that the total volume  of the 1994 General State Budget was set at 5.515 billion  dinars[D] compared to D4.95 billion in 1993, an 11.4-percent  increase.    Tax revenues continue to constitute the main source of  funds for the state budget. They are expected to total D3.5  billion compared to D3.08 billion in 1993, a 13.6-percent  increase.    Nontax revenues are estimated at D702 million, thus  remaining more or less at their 1993 level of D700 million.    Borrowing will provide D1.203 billion, of which 72  percent will come from domestic loans.    Expenditures under Title I (state operating  expenditures) are set at D3.422 billion, an increase of 10  percent over 1993.    Operating expenditures related to payroll and current  management expense in government departments are set at D2.116  billion, or 62 percent of total current expenditures. That  increase of 11.6 percent over 1993 is due in particular to pay  raises.    Expenditures under Title II are set at D2.093 billion,  or about 14 percent more than capital expenditures in 1993.    Those expenditures are divided into direct investments  (D635 million), financial operations (D415 million), and  reimbursement of debt principal (D1.043 billion, including D507  million for the reimbursement of domestic debt).    Taking the above data into account, the net budget  deficit is estimated at D320 million, compared to D357 million  in 1993 and D389.8 million in 1992.    The following should also be mentioned:    1. The revenues and expenditures of government  enterprises whose budgets are attached to the General State  Budget as a suspense item are set at D334.961 million, compared  to D305.029 million in 1993, a 9.8-percent increase.    2. The revenues and expenditures of government  enterprises whose budgets are attached to the annexed budget as  a suspense item are set at D1.875 million, compared to D1.793  million in 1993.    3. Revenues in the annexed budget are set at D273  million for 1994, an increase of 10 percent over 1993 (D248  million) despite elimination of the item relative to television  broadcasting revenues.    4. Revenues and expenditures in connection with special  Treasury funds are set at D643 million, an increase of 5.2  percent over 1993 (D611 million).

The increase is concerned basically with equipment and  administrative expenditures (+20.5 percent), compensation for  personnel covered by the Law on Cadres (+10.6 percent) and other  personnel (+11.5 percent), and expenses related to the activity  of the Chamber of Deputies (+9.2 percent).  <H5>  Equipment Budget </H5>   Capital expenditures by the Chamber of Deputies are  estimated  at D4.23 million distributed as follows:    1. Studies and the establishment of a printing office:  D60,000.    2. Financing of projects underway, including the  installation  of a switchboard, equipment for committee rooms, and the  acquisition of equipment for recording debates: D4.17 million.

The increase is due basically to the following:    1. Compensation and pay: +14 percent.    2. Operating subsidies to government enterprises: +8.8  percent.    3. Equipment and administration: +4.4 percent.  <H5>  Secretariat of State for Information </H5>   The operating budget for the Secretariat of State for  Information is set at D18.795 million, an increase of 4.9  percent over 1993.    The increase is due to higher expenditures for:    1. Compensation and pay: +10 percent.    2. Operating subsidies to government enterprises: +4.9  percent.    3. Indirect intervention in the social and cultural area:  +4.1 percent.    4. Equipment and management: +4.1 percent.  <H5>  Secretariat of State for Scientific Research and Technology </H5>   The operating funds allocated to the Secretariat of State  for  Scientific Research and Technology are set at D10.449 million,  an increase of 15.2 percent over 1993.    That sizable increase is due mainly to the following:    1. Direct and indirect intervention in the cultural and  social area: +31.68 percent.    2. Compensation and pay: +2.2 percent.    3. Operating subsidies to government enterprises: +5.8  percent.  <H5>  Secretariat of State for Women and Family Affairs </H5>   The budget allocated to operation of the Secretariat of  State  for Women and Family Affairs totals D831,000, an increase of  18.8 percent over 1993.    The various items concerned by that increase are the  following:    1. Compensation and pay: +35.3 percent.    2. Equipment and administration: +14.8 percent.  <H5>  Equipment Budget </H5>   Capital expenditures by the prime minister's office will  total D11.721 million, compared to 13.354 million in 1993. That  decrease of D1.633 million is due to reduced spending by the  Secretariat of State for Information, whose expenditures have  dropped from D7.754 million in 1993 to D5.222 million in 1994, a  32.65-percent decrease.  <H5>  Prime Minister's Office </H5>   Direct investments by the Prime Minister's Office are  estimated at D3.205 million, of which D805,000 are allocated to  the financing of new projects such as outfitting the  headquarters of the prime minister's office, outfitting the  Government Accounting Office, purchasing motor vehicles and  equipment for the office of the prime minister, the Government  Accounting Office, and the Administrative Court.  <H5>  Secretariat of State for Information </H5>   Equipment spending by the Secretariat of State for  Information is down 32.65 percent from 1993.    It should be pointed out, however, that the 1993 equipment  budget of the said secretariat of state included D3.88 million  for purchasing TV equipment to cover the Africa Cup of Nations.    Disregarding that one-time expenditure, the investment  budget  of the Secretariat of State for Information increased by about  34.8 percent.    The amounts allocated to new projects total D4.115 million,  or 84 percent of the total payment credits.  <H5>  Secretariat of State for Scientific Research and Technology </H5>   Equipment spending by the Secretariat of State for  Scientific  Research and Technology will total D2.772 million in 1994,  compared to D2.45 million in 1993.    The new projects included in the investment budget of this  secretariat of state are essentially the following:    1. The National Scientific Research Program.    2. INSTOP [expansion not given].    3. The Research Development Program.  <H5>  Secretariat of State for Women and Family Affairs </H5>   Equipment credits allocated to the Secretariat of State for  Women and Family Affairs total D327,000 (D233,000, or 41  percent, less than in 1993). The money will be used basically to  finance current projects.

That budget is intended to cover the following expenditures:    1. Compensation and pay: +13.3 percent.    2. Equipment and administration: +10.1 percent.    3. Direct and indirect intervention in the economic, social,  and cultural areas: +4 percent (including a subsidy of D103  million to the common fund for local communities).  <H5>  Equipment Budget </H5>   Capital spending is estimated at D45.5 million, consisting  of  D30 million in direct investments and D15.5 million for  financial operations.    Direct investments in regional projects total D6.955  million,  or 28 percent more than in 1993, and are concerned mainly with  expanding and outfitting prisons, police and national guard  schools, and constructing and outfitting barracks, governorate  headquarters, and branch offices.    Nationwide projects included in the Ministry of Interior's  equipment budget are concerned basically with the high-security  national identification card and the acquisition of motor  vehicles, data processing equipment, special equipment, radio  transmission equipment, and miscellaneous equipment.

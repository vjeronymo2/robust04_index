He had sent a draft of the treaty to Russia's Boris Yeltsin  "back in March," following which the two governments were told  to finalize the document.    The document "tackles the issues of military cooperation and  use of testing grounds in Kazakhstan and the Baykonur space  launch pad." Nazarbayev explained that the treaty also provided  for training of Kazakh officers in Russia, cooperation in  manufacture of weapons and coordination in drafting a common  military doctrine.    "If we are to create a common defense space, which is what  Kazakhstan wants, we have to cooperate very closely in border  protection, personnel training, military doctrine and other  areas, the president said.    In his view, the Russian army would have to spend huge sums  of money to build new testing grounds if it ceased to use those  in Kazakhstan. Over 32.5 Mn hectares were in the past used for  testing grounds while making such large areas available for  military needs is out of the question now. Kazakhstan is  prepared to lease the installations there on mutually beneficial  conditions.    The Kazakh president dismissed the reports that Almaty had  demanded that Russia pay $7 Bn yearly rent for the Baykonur  launch pad. He emphasized, however, that Russia was not the  sole country that kept Baykonur in working order. Kazakhstan  supplied 1 Bn kW hrs of energy yearly to Baykonur which also  used underground water, which "is in short supply in the  Syr-Daria River." New buildings in Baykonur were constructed of  Kazakh materials. "For this reason, the expenses of renting  Baykonur for joint operation by Ukrainian, Russian and Kazakh  rocketry are being computed," Nazarbayev said.    (Interfax Note: Russian and Kazakh negotiating teams in the  talks which started in Moscow Monday are discussing the text of  a new agreement on the status and operation of the launch pad  and the town of Leninsk. According to a spokesman for the  Russian Space Agency, the treaty on the lease of Baykonur and  the issue of which legislation would be in existence in the  areas rented from Kazakhstan are issues that will be discussed  shortly.)    The president thinks that discussion of the status of  Russian  troops in Kazakhstan would be premature at this stage. He said  that he had an understanding with Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin, with whom he had met in Davos, Switzerland, during  the World Economic Forum, on having experts to meet in early  February in order to hammer out an agreement on the issues  involved.    Nazarbayev rejected accusations of conservative thinking  leveled at Chernomyrdin and his new government by the Russian  press and recalled that Chernomyrdin's activities during the  Moscow events of October 3 and 4, when he was unambiguously on  President Yeltsin's side, had been welcomed by the mass media.  Now it is wrong to describe him as a hardliner even before the  government has announced its program, the Kazakh president said.    Currently any Russian government "will have to stay on the  course of reform," Nazarbayev thinks.</p>

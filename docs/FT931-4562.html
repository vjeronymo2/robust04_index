			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report A steadier undertone prevailed on the LME. Dealers said the generally steady trend seen in COPPER helped other metals, although significant upward breaks were unlikely. Three-month copper was reluctant to test the band of resistance above Dollars 2,170 a tonne. Although some traders reported Chinese buying, most felt that China had been a small-scale seller recently, so the market was expected to re-test downside support. Three-month NICKEL remained firmer, building on the move above Dollars 6,050. A fall in LME stocks, Pacific Metals' decision to sustain its production cut to June, and talk of scrap shortages and Russian shipments tailing off in Europe were supportive. London COFFEE and COCOA wound up quietly after a day when the main market features were lethargy and apathy, traders said. In Chicago SOYABEANS moved higher early amid fund buying as rumours circulated that several US banks had re-opened credit lines to Russia. Compiled from Reuters</p>

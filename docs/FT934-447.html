			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Sport: The winners in the money game - In sport, many of the 1993 records were set at the bank. Peter Berlin looks at the year's big names and numbers This has been an excellent year for English football. Ask any club bank manager. The national team failed to qualify for the World Cup finals. Only one British club, Arsenal, is still in a European competition. But by any commercial measure it has been another good year. For English football the recession never happened. Since the old first division split from the lower three divisions in 1992 to form the Premier League, the Premiership clubs have exploited their marketing opportunities with unprecedented efficiency. Meanwhile, the jilted clubs of the Football League have more than made up for lost revenue. Even England's elimination from the World Cup provides clubs with an opportunity; one commercial director said he believes some of the money earmarked to sponsor the England team in the US will be redirected to club football. Before 1992 all four divisions were covered by a Pounds 44m four-year deal with ITV. In 1992 the Premier League signed a five-year contract worth Pounds 304m with BSkyB and the BBC. Meanwhile, the Football League signed one of its own with ITV and this year its broadcasting revenue is Pounds 8.9m. The sponsors have followed. In 1992 the four divisions shared Pounds 2m from Barclays Bank. This summer the Premiership signed a Pounds 12m, four-year deal with Bass, the brewers, and the Football League signed a contract worth Pounds 1.5m per annum with Endsleigh Insurance, to give it total sponsorship revenue of Pounds 2.7m a year. The clubs have coped well with the demands of the Taylor Report on ground safety, chiefly because they have found someone else, the Football Trust, to foot the bill. The Football League clubs have spent Pounds 75m on ground improvements, 75 per cent of which has been grant aided. The number of seats in the three lower divisions rose from 293,000 in 1990 to 455,000. By next season, when fans at Premier League and first division grounds must all be seated, England and Wales will have the largest collection of modern stadia seating 20,000-plus outside the US. Clubs in the lower divisions have until 1999 to meet more lenient conditions, but their costs are daunting - estimated at Pounds 200m by the Football League - especially if the national lottery bites into the pools companies' income and the Pounds 45m a year they pay to football, Pounds 37m through the Football Trust. More seats mean increased revenue: the cheapest seats at English grounds cost as much as 50 per cent more than a standing ticket. The fans are paying more and more, yet attendances climbed in every season from 1985-6 to 1992-3, from 16.5m to 20.66m, and are up by 8 per cent in the Premiership and by 3 per cent in the Football League this season. Most clubs have also installed executive boxes and upmarket catering facilities to increase revenue further. The old army of working -class fans, which would fill English football's uncovered terraces in all weathers, has gone the way of the cloth cap. The football fan has long since moved to Essex and only now is English football catching up with him and his wallet. The question is whether the clubs, having moved upmarket, dare abandon their 'pile them high, sell them cheap' approach to fixtures, drop some of their shoddier competitions and play fewer league games to trim their destructive fixture lists. In part, the smaller clubs are thriving by accepting their second-class status. Clubs wear their commercial status on their shirts. Smaller teams are sponsored by district councils, local building societies and radio stations. The top Premiership teams are sponsored by national beer brands or international electronics goods companies, investing in teams with national or international profiles. These clubs have been the biggest financial winners. In 1989 Liverpool were on their way to the league title, turnover was Pounds 4.77m and profits Pounds 145,000. In 1993 the club was mid-table but turnover was Pounds 17m and profits Pounds 1.6m. Between 1990 and 1993, Manchester United's turnover rose from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 25.3m. United's aim is to match Barcelona's reported turnover of Pounds 60m. The key is Europe. If United win the league they will gain a bye to the divisional stage of the revamped European Cup and at least six matches against Europe's best teams. This season ITV paid Pounds 1.3m to screen United's four early-round matches in the European Cup. Next year ticket and TV revenue at each home game could add up to Pounds 1m. United will use the cash to augment a large, highly-paid squad of players - topped by the British record signing, Roy Keane, bought for Pounds 3.75m, paid an estimated Pounds 6,700 a week. For the moment, the biggest clubs are being helped in this by another growing source of revenue: individual sponsorship for their most exciting players. This year Ryan Giggs of United signed a Pounds 300,000 contract to wear Reebok boots. He can expect to stay with Reebok for his entire career. Things will become interesting when the desires of his two paymasters no longer coincide. For now, as the club chairmen and their sponsors, accountants and bank managers gather in the hospitality lounges of England's football grounds over Christmas and look out on the executive boxes and luxury seats filled with more accountants, bank managers and sponsors, the toast will be for a New Year as prosperous as the old one.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Oil from a ruptured Shell Oil Co. pipeline floated down the Mississippi River  and forced cleanup crews to work round the clock to try to limit effects of the  spill, a Shell spokesman in St. Louis said. Missouri Department of Natural  Resources officials said the spill -- the worst in the state's history -- began  Dec. 24 when a pipeline at Vienna, Mo., ruptured, allowing at least 336,000  gallons of dichlorobenzene, a petroleum product, to flow into the Gasconade  River. The spill has not caused problems with water supplies, but state  officials said they could not measure the long-term effects on fish and  wildlife in the Gasconade, Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Shell spokesman  Tony Canino said that the cold weather prevented the oil from clinging to the  river banks.  </P></p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Markets: The taxman, the free gift and the BES - Serious Money IS THE government going to crack down on the business expansion scheme? As the deadline for abolition at end-1993 grows closer, the industry is getting ever more ingenious in its ways of exploiting the tax shelter, and could be taxing the Inland Revenue's patience. This week, there was news of a battle between the Revenue and Johnson Fry over tax relief on two schemes, Election Protection and part of the Oxbridge Colleges Cash-Backed plan. The dispute is over an investment in a hall of residence at University College, London. All BES properties must be let only on assured tenancies. But because the university let the property to foreign students during the summer vacation (after Johnson Fry and UCL had exchanged contracts, but before Johnson Fry paid for the property), the Revenue is claiming the scheme broke the BES rules. It should not, therefore, attract tax relief. This could be dreadful news for investors in the schemes, since they make little sense as investments per se; the return depends almost entirely on the tax relief. Johnson Fry and its lawyers contend, however, that these schemes should attract tax relief; and it emphasises that those who invested in the non-UCL part of the Oxbridge fund (such as the Balliol college scheme) are not affected. The dispute caused one BES issue, from Capital Ventures, to be withdrawn this week and might have raised fears of a general assault by the Revenue on the industry. Given the structure of many recent schemes, with top-rate taxpayers earning 20 per cent plus profits in six months, it would not be surprising if the taxman were to be itching for revenge. For the moment, however, it seems clear that the dispute is limited to university-backed schemes and, even there, will affect only those using existing halls of residence. The bank and building society schemes continue to flourish, such as the Gracechurch issue launched by the London-based Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Backed by Barclays bank, it offers a non-recourse loan enabling higher-rate taxpayers to get back 74p after six months, equivalent to an annualised return of 30 per cent. This facility is not suitable for basic-rate taxpayers. Prospectuses are available from a limited number of Barclays branches, or from BZW. Such schemes are, effectively, gifts from the broad mass of taxpayers to top-rate payers and lenders with repossessed properties on their hands. The chancellor seems willing to allow this, for want of a better way of soaking up the burden of repossessed properties. Those who can take advantage of the plan will rub their hands in anticipation of profits; those who do not will grind their teeth if other taxes go up in the Budget. ***** ROBIN Angus, of NatWest Securities Ltd, is a sort of Old Testament prophet of the investment trust industry. A fierce traditionalist, he is deeply suspicious of some of the new-fangled split capital structures devised by investment trust companies to attract the private investor. In his latest Yearly Review of the sector, he emphasises one vital point for private investors - that they should consider not just income, or capital, but total return. The present fad is to invest in high-yield investments which do not grow (such as income shares), or in growth instruments which pay no income (such as capital or zero shares). But a conventional trust can offer both; the yield might be low but, if the trust rises in price, the investor can sell some shares and use the proceeds as income. Say you are a top-rate taxpayer with Pounds 100,000 in income shares which yield 8 per cent; your annual income would be Pounds 8,000 gross, or Pounds 4,800 net. But if you owned a conventional trust, you might enjoy a 3 per cent dividend yield and 5 per cent capital growth. The dividend on the conventional trust would pay only Pounds 3,000 gross, or Pounds 1,800 net. But if you sold Pounds 5,000 of shares, you might pay no tax at all on the proceeds if you have no other capital gains that year. As Angus puts it: 'The Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax exemption is the greatest undiscovered tax break available to the small or medium-sized investor - much more powerful than a Pep.' Even allowing for dealing costs of 5 per cent, the investor in the conventional trust would still have a net return of Pounds 6,550, far higher than the income share investor. Furthermore, Angus argues that the conventional trust could well produce a better performance in the long run than a split trust, which might have to tailor its holdings to suit the demands of its different classes of shareholders. 'Conventionally-structured trusts are investment-driven, while split-capital trusts are structure-driven,' he says. Angus's views are a timely reminder for investors that they should not ignore conventional trusts. Indeed, the volatility of split shares yesterday prompted Sphere to reveal proposals for a packaged unit; in other words, creating an instrument which behaves like a share in a conventional trust. That could prove a straw in the wind . . .</p>

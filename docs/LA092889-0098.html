			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> GLENDALE READY FOR EVERYTHING EXCEPT BUS WITH NO COOLING SYSTEM  </P> <P> John Cicuto spent all of last week preparing his Glendale College football team  for the adversity the Vaqueros were sure to face during their game at  Bakersfield College.  </P> <P> Cicuto talked about the crowds, which often exceed 10,000, and the referees,  who sometimes seem to bow to the wishes of the masses.  </P> <P> The one thing Cicuto couldn't prepare his team for, however, was the bus.  </P> <P> The Vaqueros left Glendale at 3 p.m. for their 7:30 game in Bakersfield, but  were slowed when the bus overheated in Burbank.  </P> <P> "We were preaching adversity all week and we had it five minutes after we got  on the bus," Cicuto said.  </P> <P> With no spare buses available, the Vaqueros stayed aboard and endured a slow  ride, with the bus frequently pulling over to cool off.  </P> <P> Glendale arrived in Bakersfield at 7 and played the Renegades to a 19-19 tie.  </P> <P> "We obviously would have preferred a win," Cicuto said. "But under the  circumstances, I thought our players handled the situation very well."  </P> <P> He'll take it: Cicuto is hoping that he'll be able to enjoy the festivities  that surround Saturday night's game between Glendale and Pierce at Glendale  High.  </P> <P> Glendale is still searching for its first win after a season-opening loss to  Pasadena and last week's tie.  </P> <P> Glendale overcame a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter at Bakersfield and  escaped with a tie on David Bowen's field goal with six seconds left.  </P> <P> "The way we came back makes me feel confident that we are getting better and  that we will be a very fine football team by the end of the season," Cicuto  said.  </P> <P> Up and coming: Glendale faces a Pierce team that has responded to the presence  of Bill Norton, a former assistant coach at Glendale who is now the offensive  coordinator at Pierce.  </P> <P> The Brahmas, who finished 1-9 last season, have defeated East Los Angeles and  lost to Santa Barbara. They are averaging 30 points a game.  </P> <P> Norton scouted for Glendale in 1987 and coached the Vaquero running backs in  1988 before joining Bob Enger's staff at Pierce.  </P> <P> "I think he's (Norton) the main reason their program has turned around," Cicuto  said.  </P> <P> Lost in the shuffle: While Occidental's Gary Little and Pomona-Pitzer's Chris  Smith dueled Saturday to see which of the freshman tailbacks would end up with  the most yardage, Occidental fullback Malek Doulat quietly stole the spotlight.  </P> <P> Little gained 215 yards in 24 carries to outdistance Smith -- who rushed for  191 yards in 29 carries -- as Occidental defeated Pomona, 24-14.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the 5-foot-9, 193-pound Doulat had more workmanlike numbers -- 82  yards in 25 carries -- but had several key third-down runs that resulted in  first downs.  </P> <P> On the fast track: Patrick Pearson of Sunland was named Most Improved Driver in  the LuK Clutch Challenge International Sedan Series sponsored by the  International Motor Sports Assn.  </P> <P> Pearson, 38, drove a Nissan 200SX in the 10-race series contested at tracks  throughout the United States. His best finish was eighth place in the series  finale at Sears Point near Sonoma, Calif.  </P> <P> Horse sense: The Flintridge Riding Stables is playing host this week to the  Flintridge Amateur Horse Show and $25,000 Samsung Grand Prix.  </P> <P> The event, which begins today and continues through Sunday, is expected to  attract more than 400 competitors from throughout North America.  </P> <P> Competitions will be held in several equitation and jumping classifications.  </P> <P> The Grand Prix, a World Cup qualifying event, will be held Sunday.  </P> <P> Clinic: UCLA is sponsoring a clinic for high school basketball coaches Oct. 21  at Pauley Pavilion.  </P> <P> UCLA head coach Jim Harrick, Pat Foster of Houston, Sonny Smith of Virginia  Commonwealth and Steve Popovich of Marina High in Huntington Beach are the  featured speakers.  </P> <P> Information: 213-206-6276  </P> <P> Paper chase: The Occidental football team has improved its record to 2-1 as the  result of a clerical error by Azusa Pacific.  </P> <P> Occidental, which lost to Azusa Pacific, 14-0, two weeks ago, was awarded a 2-0  forfeit win this week because Azusa Pacific used a player who was ineligible  due to a transcript discrepancy.  </P> <P> Cliff Hamlow, athletic director at Azusa Pacific, declined to identify the  player who played in two series against Occidental.  </P> <P> At the time, the school was awaiting an official transcript from the player's  previous school.  </P></p>

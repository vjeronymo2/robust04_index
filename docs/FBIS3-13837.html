			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "What Is Left of the International Legitimacy?"] </F>   [Text] As a new round of Arab-Israeli negotiations will be  held next month, the question that should be posed is: Will the  United States sponsor this round on the basis of Resolutions 242  and 338 or based on Resolution 904, which showed a comprehensive  reversal of the U.S. position on both Jerusalem and other  occupied Palestinian territories?    The new U.S. position clearly means that the word "First"  has  been dropped from the famous Oslo agreement, that there is no  more room to talk about the post-Gaza-Jericho phase, and that  Resolution 904 canceled the reported postponement of the  discussions on Jerusalem and the sovereignty over it. Above  all, this also means that the televised display that took place  at the White House on 13 September was sent off to the U.S.  archives to be stored with other shows labeled: No longer  suitable for broadcast!    The Palestinians, along with other Arabs, have gained a  condemnation of the Ramadan massacre, which was registered  against unknown perpetrators. This is because the Security  Council resolution did not condemn the Zionist enemy or hold it  responsible for not committing itself to protecting the  Palestinian citizens in accordance with the Geneva conventions.  Meanwhile, the Israelis-- in return for accepting the  condemnation of the massacre, rather than its  perpetrators--gained recognition of their usurpation of  Jerusalem and other Palestinian territories, except for the  small areas of Gaza and Jericho. This humiliating deal raises  the question: Is it worthwhile for the Arab delegations to  return to Washington for negotiations, and what issues will be  discussed after the United States has granted legitimacy to the  occupation of land?    While realizing the bitterness of returning to the  negotiating table, we should not hesitate to assert that it is  the Palestinian side that chose to return and that prompted the  other Arab delegations to do so. When the PLO decides to agree  on resuming the negotiations, we are confident that the  Jordanian, Syrian, and Lebanese parties will not have enough  bargaining chips to continue to boycott the negotiations as an  expression of their indignation over Resolution 904. It is  essential here to note that the few months between mid-September  1993 and mid-March 1994 have placed us all before the fact that  the peace that Washington and the Zionist enemy are seeking is  not a just peace, that what is left of the bases of the Madrid  conference is not worthwhile, and that the Gaza-Jericho First  agreement has become insignificant since the word "First" was  dropped and after the enemy clearly pursued policies regarding  Gaza and Jericho as two new Palestinian camps on Palestinian  national soil!</p>

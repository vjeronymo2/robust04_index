			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report By Jose Alberto Briceno] </F>   [Text] On 8 March in Washington D.C., Foreign Relations  Minister Bernd Niehaus asked Alexander Watson, U.S. assistant  secretary of state for inter-American affairs, to urge the  United States to stop "twisting" the arms of Caribbean nations  to get them to support Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's bid  to become OAS secretary general.    The minister met with Watson before departing for Santiago,  Chile, where he will attend President-elect Eduardo Frei's  inauguration. President Gaviria and Oscar Arias, former Costa  Rican president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, will also attend  the inauguration. Arias also has expressed interest in  obtaining the OAS post.    President Rafael Angel Calderon said the only topic Niehaus  and Watson discussed at their 8 March meeting was the upcoming  election for the post of OAS secretary general.    Calderon added: "We respect the U.S. position to choose  President Gaviria, but we cannot accept the twisting of arms of  small Caribbean nations. Niehaus wanted to make this point very  clear." Calderon made these statements at the inauguration of  the Monument to the Costa Rican Teacher.    In addition, the head of state stressed that Foreign  Minister  Niehaus told Watson he expects to maintain good relations with  the United States as OAS secretary general.    The Foreign Ministry's Press Office reported that Deputy  Foreign Minister Hernan Castro is visiting Saint Vincent to meet  with representatives of the Caribbean Common Market (Caricom) to  discuss banana marketing strategies. This visit also seeks to  reinforce bilateral relations in the wake of statements by  Caricom Secretary General Edwin Carrington, who said at least  three countries in the region -- namely, Dominica, Saint  Vincent, and Saint Lucia -- had withdrawn their support for the  Costa Rican OAS candidacy.    Niehaus, however, noted that this problem has been  completely  overcome and that he still has 22 votes in his favor, including  the votes of the 13 small Caricom states. Meanwhile, President  Calderon underscored that he has been in contact with the  Caribbean ministers, adding that Costa Rica is proposing a fair  and balanced plan that will not hurt their economies.    Costa Rica has advocated the broadening of the quota system  while maintaining a contingency [contingente] that favors the  islands to ensure that bananas continue to be their main source  of revenue.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Political Opinion" column: "The Khmer Rouge's </F> Only Chance"]    [Text] The unclear response of Democratic Kampuchea [DK] to  the first topic in the agenda of the roundtable commission's  meeting which required that the conflicting parties give a yes  or no answer to the proposed cease-fire continues to cloud the  search for peace in Cambodia.    Democratic Kampuchea's representative Mr. Chan Youran told  the meeting that his party did not want to fight. He demanded  that a real cease-fire be organized with the proper supervision  of a committee or technical group set up for that purpose.  Democratic Kampuchea's current stance as presented by Mr. Chan  Youran was a little different from what it was before in that  this time his party did not insist that other countries be  invited to take part in the cease-fire supervision committee.  However, it could be seen that the nature of Democratic  Kampuchea's stance expressed at the Chhanghsu-on royal residence  on 27-28 May remains virtually the same, as few changes have  been made to it.    Democratic Kampuchea's strategy is to achieve national  reconciliation and end the war right off, without first going  through the stage of a cease-fire. Mr. Meas Chey, an important  official of Democratic Kampuchea at its permanent office in  Phnom Penh, stated outside the meeting that the main reason  behind this Democratic Kampuchea stance was that when all  Cambodians succeed in achieving national reconciliation, there  would automatically be a cease-fire. He went on to say that  otherwise a cease-fire would be ineffective, no matter where and  when it may be, and he cited many specific examples, including  the 1973 agreement in the U.S.-Vietnam war. For this reason,  beginning with national reconciliation remains an important  starting point. Although Mr. Meas Chey did not tell us what  would be used as a basis for national reconciliation, certain  political analysts have cautioned that Democratic Kampuchea was  trying to push its enemies into its "Minimal Policy Program"  trap.    What is Democratic Kampuchea's minimal policy program  anyway?  Mr. Meas Chey explained that the program was not aimed at  dissolving the Royal Government. According to it, the two sides  should make compromises. They should discuss what the Royal  Government would get from Democratic Kampuchea, and vice versa.  Yet most observers believed that Democratic Kampuchea was  insulting the Royal Government elected by the people.    Although the participants expressed some cheerfulness, a  Royal Government official who also took part in the meeting  remained quite pessimistic. He affirmed that he still did not  understand what the minimal policy program really was.    Now, through Democratic Kampuchea's "accepting while  resolutely rejecting the cease-fire" answer, the war in Cambodia  is still going on because what the Royal Government wants is to  set a specific schedule for the cease-fire. Samdech Hun Sen was  very pessimistic when it came to the future of Cambodia all  because of the failure to declare a cease-fire schedule.    Recently, Samdech Hun Sen told the press that he was in  possession of a document that was written by Pol Pot, which he  obtained at the end of last March. According to this document,  the objective of the Khmer Rouge was to increase their forces to  25,000 men between May 1994 and May 1996 in preparation for an  offensive. It should be noted that according to neutral military  analysts, the current Khmer Rouge rebel army is believed to be  20,000 strong, including their militia. The actual fighting  force of the Khmer Rouge, however, is assessed to be about 8,000  men only.    If the proposal for a cease-fire with a specific schedule  fell through and the roundtable commission's meeting collapsed,  the Khmer Rouge would surely lose more of its support. The  Royal Government is certainly employing the Khmer Rouge's own  game to destroy the Khmer Rouge in addition to the military aid  from foreign countries, especially the United States, France,  and Australia. It can equally be said that this is also a  chance for the Khmer Rouge to make up their mind whether they  want to end the war and launch a political attack instead,  because to be frank the Khmer Rouge are far from finished on the  political stage.    On the contrary, if this opportunity is allowed to pass by,  the Khmer Rouge issue will then no longer belong to the  framework of a settlement for national reconciliation and an end  to the war. And His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk already  warned before the roundtable commission's meeting that, should  this meeting fail, he would not propose any more of them.</p>

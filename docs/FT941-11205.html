			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Tidal wave of dirty water: Falling standards in UK public services High standards in the public services are like clean water, according to Professor Peter Hennessy, the historian and veteran Whitehall watcher. You only realise their value when they've gone. If so, there are worrying signs ofcontamination appearing in the UK water supply. Consider some examples: Fraud squad detectives have been called into the Welsh health promotion quango toinvestigate foreign travel expenses. The Wessex regional health authoritywasted at least Pounds 20m on a computerisation project that was later abandoned. Serious conflicts of interest were uncovered in the commissioning process. The employment department has been unable to provide auditors with adequate evidence that almost Pounds 80m paid out for employment training was properly spent. The National Audit Office, Parliament's public expenditure watchdog, found weaknesses in the financial controls of schools that have opted out of local authority control, including in procedures for authorising payments. Ten days ago, the powerful Commons public accounts committee, which monitors government finances, published a brief but scorching attack on the decline of standards in theconduct of public business. It cited 17 of its own studies over the past four years that indicated serious failings in the handling of public money. MrRobert Sheldon, the committee's chairman for 11 years, said the frequency of such cases in recent years indicated that something was going wrong. He warned that they might be the tip of an iceberg. Even the Treasury, the bastion of financial rectitude, has not escaped censure by the committee. Losses of almost Pounds 1m have been clocked up in its catering agency, Forward Civil Service Catering, through 'poor control, mismanagement, irregularity, malpractice and fraud'. Mr Sheldon made much of the link between the decline in standards and themanagement reforms carried out in Whitehall over the past 15 years. The creation of executive agencies, the growth in contracting-out, the delegation of responsibilities to local offices and the encouragement of a more entrepreneurial approach by managers are all blamed for the rising tide of financial scandals. All of these create opportunities for mistakes to be made, money to be wasted and corruption to sneak into the system, according to Sir John Bourn, head of the National Audit Office. He told MPs this week that the delegation of financial responsibility away from Whitehall was in some cases leaving inexperienced staffin charge of large sums of public money. Such problems were compounded,Sir John said, when managers were brought in from the private sector to run public services without being briefed on the procedures for handling public money and parliamentary ac-countability. One agency chief executive he investigated hadasked: 'Why are you doing this to me?' It is a fair point: many of themisdemeanours that Sir John has highlighted would hardly raise an eyebrow in the private sector. The Welsh Development Agency, for example, was censuredfor a long list of offences, including serious conflicts of interest. But the charge sheet included the payment of excessive redundancy payments, use of Concorde for transatlantic flights and the provision of cars for executives without requiring them to pay for private motoring. The agency's record in grabbing 20 percent of the UK's inward investment for just 5 per cent of the population counted for nothing against such errors. Yet career civil servants know that handling public money is not the same as handling private money. The rules are different because it is taxpayers' money they are spending, says Mr Richard Mottram, the permanent secretary in charge of public sector reform at the Cabinet Office. Taxpayers have no choice but to pay their taxes; they want to know that it isnot being spent in ways they would disapprove of. That truth is instilled in those who have worked in the civil service all their working lives. A senior civil servant in charge of an agency puts it like this: 'There is a reflex that twitches whenever you spend public money. You think to yourself 'What would it look like in The Sun?' ' That reflex does not come naturally to business executives brought in to run public services, ac-cording to Mr Derek Lewis, the chief executive of the Prison Service who used to run leisure group Granada. More needs to be done, he believes, to explain the different rules to newcomerslike himself. 'Controls on spending and finances in the private sector operatemuch more on a bottom-line basis,' he says. 'There is less concern over how amanager uses funds if he sticks within the total. 'Government rules paya lot of attention to the specific categories of spending, with complicated andrestrictive rules for moving money from one budget to another.' Mr Lewis is regarded as one of the most successful transplants from the private sector. But he says that the degree of scrutiny in the public sector takes some gettingused to. 'A company is largely in control of the occasions when it accounts for its performance. There is no closed season in the public sector - you are continuously accountable.' The many dimensions of public accountability arestressed by Mr Michael Bichard, former chief executive of Gloucestershire county council who now runs the Benefits Agency, which pays pensions and social security benefits. He finds he is accountable to the social security department, the Treasury, the Citizen's Charter unit, the ombudsman, MPs, select committees, themedia, the general public and, of course, his customers. 'Having worked in thepublic sector myself, it didn't surprise me,' he says. 'But I know that comesas a shock to those coming in from the private sector.' This unfamiliarity with the requirements of public accountability is confirmed by Dr Elizabeth Mellon of the London Business School, who has followed the civil service reformsclosely. 'Interviews with agency chief executives from outside the civil service early in their new jobs showed evidence of lack of clear briefing or even contact from permanent secretaries.' But Dr Mellon sees the growth of financial scandals more as a consequence of government attempts to change the cultureof the civil service. An increasing focus on results is replacing a concern forthe processes by which decisions are taken. As a result, the complex checks andbalances that ensure probity in spending public money - evolved over 140 years - are neglected. 'Inevitably, people will cut corners whenit is results which have become most important,' she says. The CabinetOffice's Mr Mottram concedes that more needs to be done to explain the procedures and ensure that adequate systems for monitoring spending are in place. In doing this, the PAC report will be helpful, he says, because it identifies the failings that have led to mismanagement and fraud. But he warns against 20:20hindsight: 'If we want a less risk-averse culture, people should be allowed tomake legitimate mistakes without being held up to ridicule.' The difficult line to be drawn in these instances, however, is that between legitimate mistakes and those that are unacceptable to the taxpayer. Cross that line, and thewater starts to look very murky indeed.</p>

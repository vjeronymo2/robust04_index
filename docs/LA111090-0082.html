			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IN DEFENSE OF KIDS  </P> <P> I am very disgusted with your article on the New Kids on the Block  ("Low-Voltage Outing for New Kids," Sept. 14). They've been described many  times as the hardest-working kids in show business.  </P> <P> Who are you to say that their concert didn't have enough energy? You sent one  reporter to one concert. There's no contrast. You have to send at least two  reporters. You also need to compare two concerts. Everyone makes mistakes. You  can't control the way your voice comes out if you're singing live.  </P> <P> You are even telling us not to waste money on New Kids items. Maybe they aren't  your idea of a good buy, but maybe that's none of your business. You described  Donnie as being stubble-faced and obnoxious. You might think so, but I don't  see 4 million people screaming and willing to do just about anything to get  your autograph.  </P> <P> Maybe you didn't think the concert was that good, but I can guarantee you that  hardly any fans that went to that concert came home unsatisfied with their  performance.  </P> <P> MELISSA HOKAMA  </P> <P> Rosemead  </P></p>

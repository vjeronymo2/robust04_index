			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. IN THE MIND OF AMERICA;  </P> <P> NEW REALITIES ARE CHANGING THE OLD PERCEPTIONS  </P> <P> NOT LONG AGO, Allen J. Scott, a UCLA professor of urban geography with an eye  for the unexamined, applied to the National Science Foundation for a federal  grant to study industry in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Scott thought he had a strong case. Little scholarly work had been done on  Southern California's remarkably vibrant manufacturing base, which embraces  everything from textile and furniture factories that compete with Third World  sweatshops to sophisticated aerospace and computer companies that push the  outside of the envelope in high technology. So overlooked was the area's  industrial role that a map reflecting high-technology companies didn't mention  the region at all -- although it had already become the nation's largest  high-tech center.  </P> <P> Scott wanted to fill in some of those blanks. His request worked its way  through the agency's bureaucracy, until it reached the foundation's outside  academic consultants. They were not so much hostile as perplexed. "They said,  'Why do you want to study industry in Los Angeles? Everybody knows that  industry in the U.S. is in places like Detroit and Buffalo and Cleveland and  that Los Angeles is . . . built around the movies,' " Scott recalls.  </P> <P> The professor's proposal had run into a wall -- a new Great Divide --  separating East from West: the line where the old image of Los Angeles collides  with the city's emerging reality.  </P> <P> Traditionally, Los Angeles has been defined for the outside world primarily by  Hollywood and its attendant culture: a city of shallowness, vapid  self-absorption and orgiastic materialism. Distilled to its essence in "Annie  Hall," this is the Woody Allen vision of Los Angeles, the city that defines  culture as the freedom to turn right on red. Since you can now turn right on  red in most places, New York's irreverent Spy magazine recently updated the  aphorism in its special issue on the city: L.A. is the place people go "to do  everything they're too embarrassed to do in Manhattan." Los Angeles: City  Without Shame.  </P> <P> Now, though, a noticeable upsurge in interest in Los Angeles on the part of  serious writers and thinkers is challenging the stereotypes. Most immediately,  this reassessment has produced a new appreciation of Los Angeles as a financial  center (the clear financial leader of the West Coast, second to New York  nationally); a business center (with thriving high-tech and manufacturing  communities), and even a cultural center, with new museums and a bustling local  arts scene. It's the stuff of gently paternalistic "Los Angeles Comes of Age"  articles. It has also heightened interest in the city's fashion, food and art.  </P> <P> But, more basically, this recent reassessment suggests an entirely different  way of looking at Los Angeles: as a window on the future of the country. Not a  movie fantasy future, or a laboratory for pop fads, but a city at the forefront  of economic and demographic change, a model of the multiracial, economically  diverse, Pacific-oriented nation America is becoming. Pieces of this picture  emerge in a new book by Scott; another recently published book by journalist  Joel Kotkin and management consultant Yoriko Kishimoto; a cover story in the  Atlantic Monthly last year by Christopher Leinberger and Charles Lockwood; a  book coming this spring from the Atlantic's Washington editor, James Fallows,  and at least three other major books on the way.  </P> <P> "I don't see how even thick-headed New Yorkers can indefinitely ignore the fact  that in many essential ways, to the destiny of their country, it is what is  happening in Los Angeles . . . that is determinative," says David Rieff, a  senior editor at Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux now writing a book about Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> IN THE national mythology, California, particularly Southern California, has  always been on the front line of social trends. If California didn't initiate  the postwar move to suburbia, it perfected it. In the early 1960s, the campus  and inner-city unrest that eventually engulfed the nation crystallized in  Berkeley and Watts. The singles scene that defined the anomie of the 1970s  found its purest expression in the beach-front towns of Los Angeles; it was  morning again in America here first, with Los Angeles, and then the nation,  awaking to a solipsistic vision of sunshine, greed and the perfect bicep.  </P> <P> Along the way, Southern California also came to be seen as the spawning ground  for political trends. The professionalization of politics -- the creation of a  priesthood of political consultants -- began here in the mid-1960s. The  conservative backlash against the 1960s drew its first blood with the election  of Ronald Reagan as governor in 1965. Environmentalism emerged as a powerful  political force after the Santa Barbara oil spill in 1969. In the mid-1970s,  Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown sketched the first outlines of a liberalism with  limits. And in 1978, crusty Howard Jarvis' Proposition 13 heralded the dawning  of the anti-government rebellion that swept Reagan into the Oval Office two  years later. In the 1980s, California has pioneered the impersonal, media- and  money-based negative politics that now dominates national elections.  </P> <P> All of these trends influenced the nation's life in meaningful ways, but they  didn't really challenge the stereotypical view of Los Angeles. Southern  California's reputation as the nation's social foundry only reinforced its  reputation for obsessively trendy quirkiness; it remains known as the place  that gave the world Valley-speak, channelers and macrobiotic gurus. Political  ideas from the state often have been swept up in the same tail wind. All of  Brown's eccentricities, for example, were highlighted by his backdrop; Gov.  Moonbeam was as much a parody of California's purported strangeness as it was  of Brown himself. Strangeness is as inextricably bound to L.A.'s image as sand.  </P> <P> That link shows no signs of dissolving. But still another new picture is being  superimposed on the old, as in a photograph constructed through multiple  exposures. If Los Angeles' old image was as the hothouse for evanescent, silly  trends, the slowly developing image is as the testing ground for fundamental  changes in the way we live.  </P> <P> What are those changes? The most apparent is in the design of the city itself.  Los Angeles is accustomed to criticism from visiting Easterners who ask, with  disorientation and disgust: Where is the city? But, in fact, urban experts now  maintain, Los Angeles' style of decentralized development has proved to be the  model for every American city that has emerged in the 20th Century, from Denver  to Dallas to Phoenix. America, in other words, has grown up to look like Los  Angeles, not New York.  </P> <P> All cities, notes Joel Garreau, a senior writer at the Washington Post and  author of "The Nine Nations of North America," "are formed by whatever is the  state-of-the-art transportation at the time" of their creation. New York,  Philadelphia, Boston -- the great, traditional cities of the East -- coalesced  when the dominant modes of transportation were horses, trolleys, feet and  subways; thus development had to be centralized. But, Los Angeles, Garreau  says, "is the first truly 20th-Century city in America" -- the first laid out  to meet the demands of the automobile, with multiple centers of housing and  business, and networks of freeways connecting them. Garreau, who is writing a  book about the phenomenon, calls dispersed centers, such as Irvine, "edge  cities"; writers Leinberger and Lockwood call them "urban villages" or  "constellations" in an urban "galaxy."  </P> <P> Whatever you call them, these far-flung centers linked by highways have become  the rule, not the exception, in urban development. "Every American city that is  growing now is growing in one and only one fashion: like Los Angeles, with  these multiple urban centers, in the spider-web fashion," Garreau says. "As a  practical matter, the vast majority of the new wealth and new jobs being  created in America today are . . . in these new hubs." Even the nation's  compact 19th-Century-style cities -- from San Francisco and Seattle to  Washington and Boston -- are emulating this style of development, sprouting new  "downtowns" and population centers on their peripheries. "In Boston, they  celebrate Route 128 as the home of the computer industry," Garreau says. "But  what is 128? 128 is Los Angeles."  </P> <P> Increasingly, Los Angeles is also coming to be viewed as the fountainhead of a  second basic trend reshaping American life: the immigration-driven  transformation of the country "from a European offshoot to a multiracial 'world  nation' . . . with ethnic ties to virtually every race and region on the  planet," as Kotkin and Kishimoto put it in their book, "The Third Century."  During the 1980s, the tide of legal immigration into this country -- most of it  from Asia and Latin America -- is expected to match, or even exceed, the  historic rush of the huddled masses from Europe at the turn of the century.  Through 2010, the Southern California Assn. of Governments has projected, the  Southland will absorb an average of 110,000 immigrants annually; by then,  minorities will make up a clear majority of the region's population.  </P> <P> "The thing a future historian will note about 20th-Century America is  immigration . . . and Los Angeles is the great place to look at what this  America . . . will be," says Rieff, whose book is tentatively titled "Los  Angeles: Capital of The Third World."  </P> <P> This analysis is moving beyond the familiar fact of immigration -- Los Angeles  as the new Ellis Island -- to a sophisticated understanding of its effect. To  many observers, this unprecedented mingling of diverse cultures -- not the menu  at Spago or the Ferrari double-parked on Rodeo Drive -- has become the defining  fact of life in the city. Author Ryzsard Kapuscinski argued recently in New  Perspectives Quarterly, a California-based political journal, that in Los  Angeles, the mold for a new American culture is being set: not the traditional  melting pot of assimilating cultures, but a "collage" of co-existing, disparate  ones. Kapuscinski sees Los Angeles producing an unpredictable cultural dynamism  reminiscent of turn-of-the-century Vienna as Asian, Latino, Anglo and black  influences interact.  </P> <P> To journalist Fallows, whose book, "More Like Us," will be published by  Houghton Mifflin this spring, Los Angeles most clearly embodies the creative  economic and cultural "disruption" -- the challenge to accepted, staid,  approaches -- that immigration offers the nation. "Without that kind of  'disruption,' America becomes a stagnant and inflexible society," he says.  "Immigration is one part of a general disruptiveness that America needs to  survive, and Los Angeles and California is the leading example of how that  happens." Similarly, Kotkin and Kishimoto portray Southern California's  Asia-oriented, entrepreneurial, immigrant-fueled economy as the model for an  American economic renaissance.  </P> <P> In that way, they see the immigrant influx reinforcing a third cutting-edge  national trend most apparent in Los Angeles: the organization of the local  economy into an extraordinarily dense web of small- and mid-sized companies.  Although Los Angeles has large employers in industries such as aerospace, its  economic base rests on smaller entrepreneurial companies in everything from  high technology to textiles that spin off enormous numbers of new jobs; 95% of  all Los Angeles businesses have fewer than 50 employees. Put another way, Los  Angeles' economy now mirrors its physical geography: dispersed and diverse. The  centrifugal trends reinforce each other, with the physical sprawl providing  plenty of space for these small companies to inexpensively set up shop, notes  Richard Weinstein, dean of the UCLA graduate school of architecture and urban  planning.  </P> <P> This distinctive pattern has made Los Angeles "a trend-setter as far as the  economic structure of a metropolitan area is concerned," says Leinberger, an  urban-development expert at Robert Charles Lesser &amp; Co. In yet another  recent book, "Metropolis: From the Division of Labor to Urban Form," UCLA  geography professor Scott argues that this flexible, non-union, small-shop  economy has become the model "of the new patterns of industrialization and  urbanization now being laid down on the American economic landscape." Other  American cities, Scott maintains, will increasingly conform to the L.A.  economic model in years to come.  </P> <P> Taken to one extreme, optimists such as Kotkin and Kishimoto believe that these  economic and demographic forces, combined with the city's orientation toward  the Pacific, could transform Los Angeles from " 'Tinseltown' into what could  well be the nation's most important city in its third century." Less sanguine  observers, such as Weinstein and Derek Shearer, professor of public policy at  Los Angeles' Occidental College, worry that those soaring prophecies overlook  the real ruts in the road: an increasingly non-white school system that will  have to be supported largely by whites; the potential of the city to fracture  into a wealthy white elite and an underclass made up mostly of non-whites; and  the growing strains of congestion, traffic and pollution that could choke off  the region's growth.  </P> <P> FROM DIFFERENT angles, those conflicting visions challenge the traditional,  lightweight view of the city. Los Angeles may become the nation's next great  power center; it may become a new paradigm of urban dismay, and it may find  itself straddling those divergent tracks -- but it is no longer a place, if it  ever was, whose principal ingredients are spandex, hair gel, sprouts and  Coppertone.  </P> <P> The coming flow of books examining the city in a new light offers one  flickering sign that America's opinion leaders are ready to begin reconsidering  their gauzy take on Los Angeles. "There is a lot of interest in reassessing,"  says Bill Bradley, publisher of a California political newsletter, who recently  signed a contract to write a book about the ways the California experience can  provide a new model for America's future. When he visited publishers in New  York last summer, Bradley says, "there was a real sense among them that  something important is happening out West, perhaps more important than the  latest premiere or the latest hair style."  </P> <P> Another sign of change is the way elite Eastern newspapers such as the  Washington Post and the New York Times now cover Los Angeles. In the Post, L.A.  bureau chief Jay Mathews is in the midst of an irregular series on how  immigration is changing the country; in the New York Times, new L.A. bureau  chief Robert Reinhold has examined racial tensions in this city of immigrants,  the controversies over growth and Los Angeles' emergence as the West Coast  capital of finance and culture.  </P> <P> These new images are beginning to challenge the old ones. Until recently, the  Reason Foundation, a libertarian think-tank based in Santa Monica, found it  difficult to convince Eastern money sources that anyone on the West Coast was  committed to contemplating something more challenging than the perfect wave.  "But the changed reality of Los Angeles is making a big difference in our  ability to have a credible reputation with Eastern foundations and  corporations," says Robert W. Poole Jr., Reason's president. "They see that  money is coming here now, serious money, and not just the entertainment  industry; they see major banks as well as Japanese banks as fixtures in Los  Angeles; they see real estate being owned by the Japanese; they see national  firms like Citicorp and Chase Manhattan getting their names on big buildings."  </P> <P> Still, that isn't the L.A. most of the country typically sees. Most national  magazine coverage of Los Angeles emanates from New York and remains fixated on  the movie business and its trendy satellites in West L.A. As one West Coast  contributor to an East Coast publication put it, for editors in New York "the  coast is a euphemism for the movie business." In the book publishing industry  -- Bradley's experience notwithstanding -- the old stereotype hangs on even  more tenaciously. In academia, as UCLA professor Scott discovered, the story is  largely the same.  </P> <P> AFTER ALL THESE years, why is it that these cramped and myopic images are so  resilient?  </P> <P> One reason is that, inadequate as they may be, they're not entirely inaccurate;  the stereotypes mercilessly capture one piece of Los Angeles. After all, Spy  didn't make television producers Candy and Aaron Spelling build themselves a  house the size of a department store in Holmby Hills; they just recoiled from  it -- when they saw it -- something like Martin Sheen when he finally comes  upon bloated Marlon Brando in "Apocalypse Now."  </P> <P> Fear and envy -- perennially popular motivations -- also help explain New  York's particularly sulfurous disdain for Los Angeles, Kotkin and Leinberger  say. Much the way mannered Boston and Philadelphia looked down on grubby,  arriviste New York as it shouldered past them to economic supremacy in the 19th  Century, they argue, New Yorkers now denigrate spacey, flaky Los Angeles with  vigor directly proportional to the accumulating evidence of its economic  prowess. That explanation for New York's hostility has a pleasing historical  weight, but to New Yorkers, worried more about subway breakdowns than global  shifts in power, it feels like something of a reach. "That's a little bit of  wish-ful fillment," says Mickey Kaus, a New York-based senior writer for  Newsweek and former West Coast correspondent for The New Republic. "New York  maybe should fear Los Angeles more than it does, but New York is really falsely  contented."  </P> <P> More tangible, and less arguable, is California's isolation from the  predominantly Eastern circles that set the nation's conventional wisdom in  politics, culture and the media. It's easier for the Eastern opinion leaders to  ignore the new realities of California -- best exemplified by Los Angeles --  because so few Californians are part of their world.  </P> <P> Consider the American Assembly, a national convocation launched after World War  II by Averell Harriman and Dwight Eisenhower, which brings together economic  and political leaders to chew over The Big Questions. It is now engaged in a  massive multiyear study on the United States' changing global role that will  produce six books, six national gatherings and 35 regional assemblies; this is  to the academic conference what "War and Remembrance" is to the miniseries. But  only about 10% of the people who have agreed so far to participate in this epic  undertaking are from the West Coast, says Daniel A. Sharp, the assembly's  president. "The foreign-policy network is very much East Coast-dominated,"  Sharp says. "It is hard to identify as many people outside the East Coast who  are thoroughly knowledgeable and influential in foreign affairs."  </P> <P> Individual experts have carved out a niche on national policy from California;  but even on subjects that should be California's area of expertise, such as  relations with Asia or Mexico, Eastern policy- and opinion-makers generally  don't look toward this state. "In terms of policy, California still has a long  way to go before its real weight is felt in the East," says Sharp, in a  judgment echoed by several Californians.  </P> <P> Part of the problem is simply social. At Los Angeles parties, academics and  other intellectuals jostle movie stars; at Washington parties, they mingle with  assistant secretaries of state. "We don't have as great an influence on the  public-policy process simply because we are not interacting socially with the  people who are prowling the halls of power in Washington," says the Reason  Foundation's Poole.  </P> <P> Distance doesn't explain everything, though. "There is nothing surprising about  the East Coast attitude about all of this," says John Gerard Ruggie, professor  of international relations at University of California, San Diego, who  relocated here recently from Columbia University in New York. "What most  puzzles me is the response on the part of California: the lack of burning  desire to do something about it. What I can't understand is the lack of concern  or interest in building up the institutions for California to have a voice in  national- or foreign-policy debates."  </P> <P> Ruggie, like many California boosters, laments the absence of think-tanks,  institutes and indigenous publications that could offer an alternate definition  of Los Angeles to the rest of the country and interpret national policy through  California's unique experiences and interests. From Los Angeles, for example,  expanding economic relations with Asia looks much less threatening than from,  say, Detroit; but the tone of the national debate over trade has been set by  East Coast and Rust Belt voices, not Californians.  </P> <P> "We do not have the self-confident intellectual institutions," Kotkin says.  "There is no Western-oriented think-tank that I'm aware of projecting, not a  future of the West, but a future of the country. Institutes in New York and  Washington don't think twice about being able to think for the country."  </P> <P> Why in a city so huge and affluent -- with so much intellectual brainpower at  its universities -- is that instinct so wanting? Kaus maintains that it is  because "the people who do the sort of thing that creates the conventional  wisdom back East aren't valued in Los Angeles. That may be good sense on Los  Angeles' part. But NBC president Brandon Tartikoff will always be a bigger man  than if L.A. produced a syndicated political columnist like Jack Germond. If  L.A. had a culture that made a big deal of people who played that game . . . it  would be different. Washington and New York have that culture."  </P> <P> Well, so what? Writer Leinberger argues that a city busily creating itself,  such as Los Angeles, "doesn't have as much time to worry about national  trends." But just having like a reputation for excellence in the arts, one mark  of a world-class city is its influence on the intellectual and political life  of a nation. After the next congressional reapportionment, California will have  at least 50 seats in the House of Representatives, more than any state has ever  had. Can a state so intrinsically powerful remain so essentially voiceless?  </P> <P> Probably not. Already, change is stirring. Established institutions such as  RAND Corp. in Los Angeles and the conservative Hoover Institute in Palo Alto  have always had a role in national debates; now, newer forces such as the  Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy, the graduate school in  Pacific Studies at UC San Diego, and New Perspectives Quarterly magazine in Los  Angeles are providing a California slant on national affairs that challenges  the picture of the state as a desert when it comes to intellectual life.  </P> <P> Those stereotypes die slowly, but Nathan Gardels, New Perspectives editor, sees  a gradual westward "tilt" in the nation's center of economic and political  power that cannot forever be ignored by the East. "For cumulative reasons,  someone like economist Lester Thurow is at MIT because he wants to be  influential like anyone else; but at some point, the East becomes so much less  innovative than the West that it doesn't contribute, it's dead," Gardels says.  "We have the opposite problem here. We have a lot of innovative thinking. But  it hasn't been able to jell yet. Once the thinking in the East becomes moribund  enough, the thinking in the West will get some respect."  </P> <P> That respect is still off somewhere in the future, and it won't be won until  the encrusted caricatures that define Los Angeles beyond its borders are  scraped away. It may be that Los Angeles' image will not catch up with its  reality until the city itself takes the time to remake it.  </P></p>

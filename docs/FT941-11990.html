			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sales steady at Amgen Amgen, the US's biggest biotech company, reported that sales of Neupogen, its biggest selling drug, remained static in the final three months of last year, as a squeeze on costs in the US took effect. Sales of Neupogen, a stimulant for the immune system, reached Dollars 186.9m, 15 per cent up on a year before but almost in line with the third quarter of 1993. The company's shares plunged last February when it announced that Neupogen sales would be lower for the first quarter of 1993, although sales rallied during the second and third quarters. For the year, sales of Neupogen reached Dollars 719m, up 32 per cent from 1992. Sales of Epogen, a treatment for kidney failure, rose 16 per cent to Dollars 587m. Net income for the quarter was Dollars 91m, or 64 cents a share, compared with Dollars 134m, or 91 cents, the year before.</p>

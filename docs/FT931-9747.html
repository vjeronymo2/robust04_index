			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: SFA to think again on futures fund trading advisers THE treatment of futures fund trading advisers is to be re-considered by the executive committee of the Securities and Futures Authority after the UK regulator's capital committee failed to reach agreement on the issue last week. Earlier this week, three representatives of the futures fund industry met SFA officials to put their case for a change in what they argue are onerous requirements for small trading advisers, whose business is being driven offshore as a result. While the SFA made it clear that their original request for a separate classification of futures fund trading advisers (commonly known as CTAs or commodity trading advisers) will not be met, the SFA is considering relaxing its capital rules for trading advisers. Currently, trading advisers are treated in the same way as arranging brokers who have some discretion over funds but do not handle clients' assets. Consequently, they face more onerous requirements than advisory firms. However, the SFA's executive committee will consider whether to change the current requirement of Pounds 10,000 in liquid assets to a net asset test. Essentially, this would allow futures fund advisers to include money of their own invested in their funds to count towards capital, according to SFA officials. If such a change is made, the SFA may also demand greater disclosure of past records of trading advisers. The amount of money in futures funds and managed accounts around the world is estimated at around Dollars 20bn, according to Tass Management, a specialist tracking firm. However, the bulk of the market is in the US, with only some Dollars 2bn managed in Europe. Those familiar with the industry are concerned that the futures fund business will develop in offshore centres rather than in the UK, if regulatory requirements prove too onerous. Mr Peter Moon, of Royston Investments, one of the three industry representatives who saw the SFA this week, said he was extremely disappointed by the meeting. 'This is such a small step and one they seem to be taking reluctantly,' he said. 'They are not really looking at the issue of how to expand this industry.'</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Booker's salmon leap to the top  -The UK group's latest acquisition The decision by Booker, a UK food group, to buy the salmon farming operations of Marine Harvest International of the US makes Booker the biggest single salmon producer in the world. It is also a vote of confidence in an industry which has repeatedly fallen into crisis in the past few years. No one is saying that the crises triggered by the sharply oscillating prices caused by the market dominance of Norway, the biggest salmon producing country in the world, will not recur. This year Norway's expected output of 220,000 tonnes will once again dwarf that of Scotland, the second biggest producer, which is expected to harvest 59,000 tonnes. Chile comes third with about 50,000 tonnes. But the experience of the last few months gives some room for optimism. Only a year ago Scottish salmon farmers despaired as another unexpected surge of output by Norway pushed prices to their lowest level for several years. Yet, against the predictions of many experts, prices have recovered since April and a leading Norwegian salmon producer told a conference in Scotland this month that in 1994 salmon farmers would have their most profitable year for many years, despite the fact that prices are still below 1992 levels. One reason is that in the past few years new vaccines have led to a sharp drop in losses caused mainly by the disease furunculosis. Mortality rates at McConnell Salmon, Booker's salmon subsidiary, fell from 12 per cent in 1990-91 to 5 per cent in 1993-94. Farmers have also invested in better production equipment and introduced more efficient methods of husbandry, producing bigger and better fish. The result is that the breakeven point for most salmon farmers has dropped substantially as UK consumption has risen by 22 per cent in the year ended June. 'We've looked into the abyss on price and disease, and believe we can still make money in salmon farming,' Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive of Booker, said yesterday. 'We project the average, not the peaks, of salmon prices and we assume salmon prices could fall.' On that basis, Booker, he suggested, thinks it can still make money. The takeover of Marine Harvest brings to Booker the biggest salmon producer in Scotland, pushing its share of Scottish salmon production from about 9 per cent to just under 25 per cent. With output from Chile thrown in, Booker will have about 7 per cent of the world market, with production of 26,000 tonnes of salmon a year out of world output of about 365,000 tonnes. The next largest producer is probably Hydro Seafood of Norway, part of Norsk Hydro. Operations will be more efficient after the takeover. Booker will close Marine Harvest's heaquarters in New Jersey, and merge the two companies' research and development departments, saving about Pounds 3m a year. The acquisition of Marine Harvest's salmon farming operation in Chile brings it a set of farms in a country which has the lowest production costs in the world, thanks to excellent water and growing conditions, and low labour costs. These benefits amount to a saving of 5p per pound off production costs which in Scotland are about Pounds 1 per lb. The takeover also gives Booker access to the Japanese and US markets. But the cost advantage of producing in Chile is offset by the cost of transporting fish to the US market, making Chile overall only as competitive as US salmon producers. The resulting diversification of production and markets should mean that no more than 10 per cent of Booker's output could suffer a disease problem at any one time. In any event, salmon turnover will still be only about Pounds 100m, compared with the group's total of Pounds 3.5bn. However, the danger of a future glut of salmon on the European market remains as Norway continues to push up output faster than Scotland. To prevent this, Booker has led a campaign to establish a system to regulate salmon output in Scotland, Norway and Ireland. Farmers would form producer groups and agree production quotas which they hope would maintain prices. But for the scheme to work their governments would have to permit the producer organisations to enforce controls on non-members, which the UK government rejects, saying it would harm the consumer. Whatever the outcome, Booker believes that creating a Scottish-based company with about 25 per cent of production will help strengthen the industry as it comes under attack from Norway.</p>

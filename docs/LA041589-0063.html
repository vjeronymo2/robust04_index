			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BERNARDI SAYS NO TO HALL'S CODE OF ETHICS  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi on Friday rejected as meaningless a  code of ethics he was asked to sign by challenger Lyle Hall in the northeast  San Fernando Valley's 7th District race.  </P> <P> "Lyle violated his own code in the primary campaign," Bernardi said. "Yet he  asks me to sign a code that I have never violated in all my years of political  campaigning."  </P> <P> Hall on Thursday challenged Bernardi to sign a pledge to exchange campaign  literature 24 hours before it is distributed and to refrain from personal  attacks and distortions during their campaign leading to the June 6 election.  </P> <P> "There will be no need to distort the facts to defeat Lyle," Bernardi said.  </P> <P> He said that Hall, a former president of the city firefighters' union, has  strong labor support because "he has always pushed for exorbitant salaries and  pension benefits at the cost of city services."  </P> <P> "Giving him a vote on the city budget would be putting the fox in charge of the  henhouse," Bernardi added.  </P> <P> Hall has denied that if elected he would be beholden to the city employee  unions.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, both candidates were courting also-rans in Tuesday's primary in an  effort to win their endorsements.  </P> <P> Each met privately Friday with Al Dib, an Arleta community activist who  finished third among eight candidates. He got 12% of the vote. Dib said he  probably would announce his choice Monday.  </P> <P> Bernardi, the council dean with 28 years of service, received 42% of the vote  but fell short of the majority required to avoid a runoff against Hall, who  finished second with 26%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lunch With Tovar  </P> <P> Bernardi will have lunch today with Irene Tovar, who finished fourth with 10%  of the vote. Tovar is a Latino activist who has strong roots in the district's  increasingly Latino community. Hall also has phoned Tovar.  </P> <P> Those who hope to elect a Latino to the seat someday are urging Tovar to back  Bernardi because the 77-year-old councilman is likely to vacate the office  sooner than 49-year-old Hall. But Hall and Tovar both have friends in common  within the United Farm Workers.  </P> <P> Bernardi also will meet today with Jules S. Bagneris III, a Lake View Terrace  homeowners' leader who finished fifth with 7% of the vote.  </P> <P> In a related development, the city clerk's office asked Hall's campaign to  correct omissions in its last campaign fund-raising reports. Hall's campaign  failed to identify the employers and occupations of many of its contributors.  </P> <P> Hall's political consultant Harvey Englander said the campaign was making every  effort to obtain the required information.  </P></p>

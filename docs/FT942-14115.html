			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: BCP registers 5.8% rise in net earnings Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP), Portugal's largest quoted company, registered a 5.8 per cent rise in net earnings during the first three months of 1994, compared with the same period last year, to Es5.45bn (Dollars 31.3m). Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, president, attributed the growth to an increase in the margin between loan and deposits and a broadening of the bank's retail customer base amid signs that the Portuguese economy was beginning to recover from recession. Net assets increased 17 per cent to Es1,889bn over the 12 months to March. Total deposits rose 14.4 per cent to Es1,478bn and loans grew 15.2 per cent to Es834bn. The bank more than doubled assets invested in unit trusts to Es575bn. Earnings per share increased from Es47 to Es49.7. Mr Jardim Goncalves said the first-quarter results were affected by the setting aside of Es3bn in provisions against bad debt.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: Pricing pressure hurts CMB CARNAUDMETALBOX (CMB), the Anglo-French packaging group, yesterday announced a 7 per cent fall in first-half net profits. It warned of a similar decline during the second six months. The shares closed down FFr10.5 at FFr198.5. The company reported net profits of FFr509m (Dollars 89.8m) for the first half of 1993, compared with FFr549m in the same period last year. Sales declined 6 per cent to FFr11.89bn. Mr Jurgen Hintz, chairman, said operating profits in the first half were 'hit hard by severe pricing pressure in European beverage cans and some exceptional events in Asia and Africa'. These included problems at its Singapore plant concerning the conversion from steel to aluminium drinks cans, and disruptions to supplies in Africa, particularly in Nigeria where the group's operations suffered from fuel shortages. The group chairman said: 'We are not expecting a net profit improvement for the rest of this year because recessionary pressures in Europe have been worse than expected in recent months and are not likely to ease soon.' In response to the difficult markets, the company said it was planning to cut production capacity, and would close a plant in Germany this year. Mr Hintz said the group intended to raise prices next year in an attempt to restore falling margins. Despite the fall in profits and the difficult outlook, Mr Hintz described the figures as a 'solid net result'. The company said the downturn during the period had been exaggerated by the impact of currency movements. Excluding currency factors, net profits would have risen by 3 per cent, rather than declining 7 per cent. The fall in operating profits, from FFr1.23bn to FFr974m, would also have been much smaller.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fernando Fernandez from the "RPC Television News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares has stated  that it is unfair for the incoming administration to have to pay  for the current government's inability to meet its obligations  with the international financial institutions [IFI's].    The president-elect made his statements following a meeting  with recently elected PRD [Revolutionary Democratic Party]  legislators and members of the future cabinet, who will take  office as of 1 September. The meeting was designed to  coordinate future government policies between the executive and  judicial branches during the transition period.    According to Perez Balladares, the government's announced  budget cuts should not affect the incoming administration.    [Begin Perez Balladares recording] I believe it is unfair  that our incoming administration should be the one to pay for  the current administration's inability to meet its debt  obligations. In this respect, it seems to me that the best  approach would be to meet with the IFI's and agree on an  adjustment and reform program that takes into account the  nation's social needs. I am quite sure Planning Minister  Guillermo Chapman is of the same opinion and will discuss the  issue with the IFI's in due time. [end recording]</p>

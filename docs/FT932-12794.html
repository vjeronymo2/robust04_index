			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: John Major states his continued support for Britsh industry MR JOHN MAJOR last night continued his campaign to persuade industry that the government is now on its side with a commitment to establish more joint public/private sector projects in Britain and to fight harder for its interests in Europe, Philip Stephens writes. In a speech to the Freight Transport Association the prime minister also underlined his commitment to further deregulation to reduce the burdens on business. Welcoming the latest evidence from official GDP figures that recovery is under way, Mr Major said that his priority was to ensure the upturn was sustained. Industry would have to take advantage of the opportunities offered by low inflation and interest rates. The government for its part was giving high priority to projects to improve the nation's infrastructure. Where possible the government would ensure that private companies provided the finance and expertise.</p>

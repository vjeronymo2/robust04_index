			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Gentle upturn in housing market signalled Further evidence of a gentle recovery in the housing market came yesterday in a survey of more than 100 estate agents which reported rises in sales last month. The survey by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) confirmed that prices had stabilised in the second half of last year. It said that 88 per cent of estate agents questioned in England and Wales reported that prices had remained static during the three months to the end of January. More than 9 per cent said prices had risen over the period. Only 2.6 per cent reported price falls. Housebuilders also have reported a modest rise in house sales in January compared with the corresponding month last year. But builders are concerned that tax increases scheduled for April could dent prospects for further recovery in sales and prices. The institute's survey said: 'The level of activity in January across the country gained momentum as the month wore on, with many agents reporting growing numbers of inquiries and sales in the second half of the month after a quiet phase immediately after the Christmas and new year break.' The institute said reports of an increase in the number of new properties coming on to the market 'could be the first sign of an end to the 'instructions famine' that has prevented even committed buyers from finding a suitable property'. It was concerned, however, that sellers were asking too high prices for their properties.</p>

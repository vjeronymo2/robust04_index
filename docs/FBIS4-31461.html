			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bratislava, June 3 (CTK) -- "The interim Slovak  Government is proving in practice that reckless privatization is  characteristic of it. Recklessly, unsystematically, and without  any clear program it is striving to fill the coupon  privatization coffers," Ivan Lexa, former state secretary in the  Privatization Ministry and a "minister" in the shadow cabinet of  ex-premier Vladimir Meciar today says in the daily SLOVENSKA  REPUBLIKA, published by Meciar's Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia (HZDS).    Lexa points to the fact that the government failed to  approve  Privatization Minister Milan Janicina's proposal according to  which of the total 190 billion crowns (more than $6 billion)  worth of the state-owned property put to privatization in the  second wave, property amounting to 80 billion crowns should be  privatized through the coupon method.    Janicina intends to offer the maximum of state property for  coupon privatization so as to please his future voters, Lexa  says, adding that voters will, however, receive nothing of it  since the "collapsing enterprises bring no profits and the  prosperous ones are designated for others."    He says ``the cream will be licked off by the investment  privatization funds under which an "indefinite foreign capital  and maybe dirty money" allegedly hide. [quotation marks as  received] "For example, the chemical industry, a considerable  part of the spa and all mines are to be privatized in such a  way," Lexa asserts.    On the other hand, the appearance of the diffused mass of  anonymous owners without any capital share would necessarily  lead to collapse, Lexa says, adding that the HZDS had sought to  provide employees with shares to motivate them as owners.    Renowned foreign experts are also expressing ever-growing  surprise over the course of privatization in Slovakia, Lexa  says. On the one hand they allegedly rejoice over the  opportunity to obtain "Slovak factories cheaply," and on the  other they do not understand an irrational approach by the  current government, he adds.

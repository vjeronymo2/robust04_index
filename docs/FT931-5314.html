			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Letter: Union bill sign of moral slide Sir, The Citizen's Advice Bureaux report on growing exploitation of people at work ('Unfair dismissals increasing', March 2) must surely add to concern about the nation's moral decline. The way in which people are treated at work is just as important as behaviour outside. The government is encouraging exploitation through its refusal to accept basic social standards set by other European Community countries and through the Trade Union Reform Bill which removes the limited protection of the Wages Councils and makes it harder for unions to help those being exploited. Norman D Willis, general secretary, TUC, Congress House, Great Russell Street, London WC1B 3LS</p>

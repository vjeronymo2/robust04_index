On the  IZVESTIYA newspaper's recent publication on the issue of part of  the former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal deployed in Ukraine,  he said there were certain forces in Russia who did not want to  see any normalization between Kiev and Moscow.    Tarasyuk also said that the article should disclose the  Russian defence minister's secret letters and cables was not all  random. He called for putting the issue on the agenda of the  next CIS summit.    IZVESTIYA referring to informed sources maintains that  commander of the long range nuclear weapons general Igor  Sergeyev is no longer in control of the 43rd missile army  deployed in Ukraine. Sergeyev says that "Russia is in no way  able to monitor the safety of nuclear weapons deployed in  Ukraine or guarantee their inadvertent use."    However, Deputy Defence Minister of Ukraine Ivan Bizhan said  that Kiev retained administrative control of the nuclear forces  while Russia was still in charge of operational and management  control. He said that all functions of the military planning and  duty were part of the operational control something that Ukraine  would never interfere with.    Bizhan described as a lie the paper's allegations saying the  Ukrainian nuclear force was grossly undermanned. He put the  43rd army was staffed by 85 percent in officers and 100 percent  in non-commissioned officers and men. More than 80 percent of  officers are Ukrainian citizens, Bizhan said.    The Ukrainian official warned that the IZVESTIYA publication  might strain relations between Kiev and Moscow.</p>

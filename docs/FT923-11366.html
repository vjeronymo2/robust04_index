			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / France's balance of trade slips into red FRANCE slipped into a trading deficit of FFr951m (Pounds 97m) last month after five months of trade surpluses. News of the June deficit comes at a sensitive time for France's socialist government which has previously countered criticism of rising unemployment by pointing to French industry's success in its export markets. The socialists are anxious to avoid further criticism in the approach to September's referendum on the Maastricht treaty and the National Assembly elections next spring. So far this year French companies have benefited from buoyant exports which have helped to shelter them from the sluggish state of the domestic market, where high interest rates and concern about unemployment have dampened consumer demand. The value of French exports rose to FFr106.4bn last month from FFr103.4bn in May. However imports rose at a faster rate to FFr107.4bn in June from FFr99.3bn in the preceding month thereby pushing the trade account into the red. Despite last month's deficit, France recorded a healthy trading surplus of FFr16.6bn in the first half of this year, representing a healthy recovery from the deficit of FFr23.2bn for the same period of 1991.</p>

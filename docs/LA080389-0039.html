			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFINING EFFORTS;  </P> <P> NEW BEEF, RAISIN AD CAMPAIGNS  </P> <P> While the seafood industry was celebrating its first national advertising  campaign, two other commodity groups were refining highly visible promotional  efforts.  </P> <P> The Beef Industry Council has announced that its next series of commercials  will feature regular people from towns with odd names. The format is a  departure for the "Beef: Real Food for Real People" ads that in the past have  used film, television and sports stars. Some of those who made sales pitches  for the council were James Garner, Cybil Shepherd, Lauren Bacall, Larry Bird  and country singer Reba McIntire.  </P> <P> The original campaign, launched in 1986, was considered a success, according to  a trade newsletter.  </P> <P> The new commercials, scheduled to begin airing in October, will "show slices of  life featuring real people . . . doing the things they do everyday in a few  small American towns with cute names," according to Lean Trimmings, published  by the Western States Meat Assn.  </P> <P> Some of the locales filmed for the series are Utopia, Tex., Luck, Wis., and  Yale, Wash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> On a Different Tack  </P> <P> Taking a somewhat different tack is the California Raisin Advisory Board. The  group announced last week that a new set of commercials featuring the cartoon  raisin characters have been filmed. But in this series, pop star Michael  Jackson will be portrayed by one of the raisins. The spot received its first  public viewing in 5,700 movie theaters last week.  </P> <P> The inclusion of Jackson with the wildly popular dancing raisins came about  because the singer/dancer was fascinated by the dried grapes as well as by the  Claymation process used to create them.  </P> <P> Jackson's cartoon alter-ego will be the first celebrity in the series, and his  character has been named "Michael Raisin," according to the advisory board.  </P> <P> The challenge, the commercial's producers claim, was to capture Jackson's  spirit.  </P> <P> The commercials are scheduled for network television in September.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Raisins vs. Cranberries  </P> <P> In an unrelated matter, the California Raisin Advisory Board is not flattered  by what it claims is an attempt by cranberry growers to cash in on the  popularity of the dancing raisins.  </P> <P> The dispute centers around Ocean Spray's new product, Craisins. The dried  cranberry snack was introduced this summer, according to California Farmer  magazine.  </P> <P> The raisin advisory board has complained that Craisins will confuse consumers  and hurt sales of raisins.  </P> <P> "The dehydrated cranberry's name plays on (the word) raisin in an unfair  attempt to capitalize on the raisin advisory board's hard-won success with the  dancing raisins," the magazine reports.  </P> <P> Also of concern is that consumers may eat a Craisin and think it's an inferior  raisin.  </P> <P> Ocean Spray maintains that their product does not infringe upon the dancing  raisins and that there is room in the marketplace for more than just one dried  fruit.  </P></p>

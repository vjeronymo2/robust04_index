			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Observer: WHAT more can we say? WTA might make it. GAT is in with a chance, as is MTA. But GATO and WHAT are probably all dead ducks. There's nothing like skirmishing over acronyms to get a serious politico hot and bothered. The selection above are all candidates to replace the scarcely understood Gatt, or General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, due to expire any minute. US negotiators fret that MTO, or Multilateral Trade Organisation will displease the US Congress. It sounds too much like ITO, or International Trade Organisation, which Congress vetoed in the late 1940s on the grounds that trade sovereignty was threatened. In 1990 Congress raised the same objection against WTO, World Trade Organisation. So maybe General Agreements on Trade, GAT? The General Agreements on Trade Organisation - GATO  - fails because it's Spanish for cat. But the biggest no-hoper so far proffered must be the World High Authority on Trade, or WHAT.</p>

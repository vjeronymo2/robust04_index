			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Peter Gill] </F>   [Text] Tough U.S. trade action against China and Japan  "would bring havoc and the dogs of war" to the whole  Asia-Pacific region, according to a group of leading Australian  and regional economists.    The dark potential of aggressive U.S. action is countered  with suggestions that countries in the Asia-Pacific region must  remain committed to free trade, accelerate trade liberalization,  and draw the U.S. back into the so-called "open regionalism".    The Asia-Pacific Economics Group -- which includes  Australian  National University Professors Ross Garnaut and Peter Drysdale  as principals and other economists from around the region --  criticizes the current thrust of U.S. trade policy but maintains  that America cannot be isolated and ignored by countries in the  Asia-Pacific region.    The latest Asia Pacific Profiles -- published yesterday by  the Asia-Pacific Economics Group in conjunction with Ernst and  Young -- paints a picture of continued growth in East Asia in  1994.    Among the majors, the profiles suggest Japan will return to  growth, the boom conditions in China will ease slightly, Korea's  growth rate will increase marginally, and Hong Kong, Taiwan,  Indonesian, and Malaysia will generally match existing growth  rates.    In an extensive discussion of the troubled trade policy  environment, the economists encourage countries in the region to  further liberalize trade and effectively remove the incentive  for unilateral U.S. action. "What the Western Pacific can  reasonably demand from the United States is genuine commitment  to the rules and spirit of the multilateral system, and  consultation within APEC [Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] on  proposed departures from them," the latest Profiles says. "The  withdrawal of most-favoured-nation treatment (by the U.S.) from  one country (China) is a threat to the multilateral system as  well as to Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation: "The same can be  said of unilateral punitive action (by the U.S. against Japan)  under Super 301. There would be no neat containment of the  consequences of such action to U.S. bilateral relations with  particular countries. It would bring havoc and the dogs of war  to the whole region."    Against such a disturbing backdrop, Professor Garnaut and  Professor Drysdale argue that countries in the region should  accelerate trade liberalization plans -- even to the point of  allowing the U.S. to "free ride" and gain benefits while not  opening its own market further.    The economists flag their concern at the sudden reversal of  fortunes in the trade arena after the "brilliant trade policy  triple play" which saw the NAFTA [North American Free Trade  Agreement] pass Congress and a successful APEC leaders meeting  in Seattle in November and a conclusion to the Uruguay Round in  December. "And now, four months after Seattle, it seems that  the two sides of the Pacific, lying in the same bed of  commitment to trade liberalization and free trade, have  discovered that they have different dreams."    Professor Garnaut and Professor Drysdale attribute part of  this scenario to the lag in perceptions across the Pacific that  the economic center of gravity has moved west to East Asia.    "Americans underestimate the corrosion of their overwhelming  power, and their capacity to lead by fiat. East Asians  underestimate the expansion of their influence on the  international system, and their responsibility for systemic  leadership."</p>

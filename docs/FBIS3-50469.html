			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone report by Radio ACIR reporter Maricarmen Camacho </F> from Tuxtla Gutierrez and reporter Jaime Alejo in the Radio ACIR  studios in Mexico City]    [Text] [Camacho] From the early hours of this morning, the  members of the Zapata Army of National Liberation [EZLN] -- who  are still occupying Ocosingo, Altamirano, Las Margaritas, and  part of San Cristobal -- unexpectedly withdrew from the main  square of San Cristobal de las Casas.    We talked to local columnist Jorge Paniagua Herrera on the  phone, and he told us that the main square was empty and  everything seemed to have returned to normal in San Cristobal.  However, it is being suspected that EZLN members might be  preparing to attack other municipalities. Last night, there  were rumors that they might attack the city of Palenque at  midnight. We have not received any reports on this yet, and  everything seems to be calm.    Here in Tuxtla Gutierrez, we are seeing some Air Force  planes  flying over, and some ambulances as well. There have been  rumors that seven people have been killed, but we have not  received any official reports. What is true is that EZLN  members murdered the commander of the Ocosingo Judicial Police  yesterday. Another three people were stripped and tied up.    In Ocosingo municipality, which is the largest in Chiapas  and  is close to the Lacandon jungle, the peasants -- including some  Guatemalans -- are still occupying the installations of the  state government's radio station. This radio station has a  strong signal in the jungle area, and the peasants are using it  to broadcast their ideas. It was reported in Ocosingo that the  peasants have withdrawn from the square but still remain at some  radio station.    Eyewitnesses mentioned that the runway was set on fire to  prevent airplanes from landing. Early this morning some shops  in San Cristobal were robbed. The situation in the municipal  county seats of Margaritas and Trinitarias remains unchanged:  EZLN members are still in the area. We talked to some people  in the cities of San Cristobal and Ocosingo, where we have only  been able to get through by telephone because the roads were  blocked until the early hours of the morning. People are very  afraid, and they are desperately asking for the government's  intervention. According to an official communique, the  government is trying to prevent a bloodshed in those  municipalities. Do you have any doubts, questions?    [Alejo] Is there any information on the identity of the EZLN  leaders?    [Camacho] We have not been able to identify any of the faces  that were shown on television. However, it is obvious that the  group includes Guatemalans. Precisely yesterday, we were able  to watch some recordings from Ocosingo, where they were talking  on the radio, and it is obvious that the leaders are not  peasants, but rather well-educated people. Their speeches are  too well-written. Many people believe there are Guatemalans  among the leaders because of the accent among other things.  Some of them have tried to cover their faces with stockings to  remain anonymous.    The bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas also has been  accused of being involved in these incidents, but so far there  is no evidence of this. What is true and evident is that there  are Guatemalans involved. It is evident because of the accent;  we are very familiar with the accents, and we know how the  Indians speak. People I have talked to in Ocosingo have said  that there are people with features different from ours.    [Alejo] Maricarmen, it has also been said that most members  of the armed group are Indians and peasants?    [Camacho] There are peasants from Chiapas, but not Indians,  because EZLN members do not speak any dialects. EZLN members  include mestizos rather than Indians. There are even youths  between the ages of 13 and 18 who are armed, as well as women.  Some of the women have been identified as being from the  Lacandon area, but they are not necessarily Indians.</p>

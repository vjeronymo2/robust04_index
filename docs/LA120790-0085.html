			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> FOUR PEOPLE HURT IN FREEWAY PILEUP  </P> <P> Four people were taken to local hospitals Thursday after a tractor-trailer and  seven cars collided in a chain-reaction pileup on the Artesia Freeway, the  California Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> It was not known how the 7:25 a.m. accident at the Orangethorpe Avenue exit  started, CHP officer Linda Burrus said.  </P> <P> The four unidentified drivers were treated at two nearby hospitals and  released, she said.  </P> <P> Burrus said that accident made the morning rush hour miserable on both the  westbound and eastbound sides of Artesia Freeway while cleanup crews removed  the wreckage.  </P> <P> About 40 feet of the center divider was damaged when the truck nearly tore  through it, Burrus said. It was unclear if the truck caused the accident or if  it plowed into the center divider to evade the colliding cars.  </P> <P> Burrus said the investigation is continuing.  </P></p>

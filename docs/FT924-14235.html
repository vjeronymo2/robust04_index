			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Books: Ghote has wife trouble - Fiction FOR YEARS, HRF Keating has created taxing problems for his long-suffering (and happily long-lived) Inspector Ghote to solve, working against the forces of evil and the chaotic inertia of Bombay. When Keating began this series he had never been to India. Since its deserved success, he has visited the country, but the reader cannot help asking: was this trip necessary? For, like many gifted authors, Keating has invented a country to suit his purposes. The people of this made-to-order India speak a language that echoes the peculiar English of the subcontinent, but is not a etymologist's transcription. Keating is careful, too, to keep its quaintness within tolerable confines; he does not use it solely for humour. His latest Ghote, Cheating Death (Hutchinson, Pounds 13.99, 172 pages) is exemplary in this respect: he makes tempered fun of academic pretentions, in both students and professors; but he respects wisdom and intelligence. Only two miscalculations: he sets up two running jokes (one involves Ghote's determination to beat his wife, the other harps on the Inspector's misunderstanding of a quotation from Shakespeare). Neither is particularly funny; both outstay their welcome. Michael Pearce has produced a fifth novel in his series about Edwardian Egypt and the British administration. The Mamur Zapt and the Girl in the Nile (HarperCollins, Pounds 13.99, 224 pages) is perhaps the best. As usual, the author displays not only an uncanny knowledge of complex Anglo-Egyptian relations, but also a subtle social sense, a grasp of fine distinctions, an elaborate code. Here, too, language is cogently employed. Inspector Thomas Pitt and his 'better born' wife Charlotte are the familiar leading performers in Anne Perry's novels set in Victorian London. The latest, Bluegate Fields (Souvenir Press, Pounds 14.95, 308 pages), is somewhere between a Police Operational (1880s style) and a court room drama. Social taboos and distinctions play an important role here, too, especially as the circumstances of the murder, involving homosexuality, are considered not so much distasteful as unmentionable. The keen reader will probably spot the murderer early on, but that is not the point. It is the search for truth that counts, not the punishment of the guilty. In her Conan Doyle pastiches, June Thomson relies heavily on imitating the Holmes-Watson dialogues of the real stuff and succeeds in establishing the proper claustrophobic atmosphere, adding a touch of mock authenticity with footnotes, foreword by a modern Dr Watson, and so on. In The Secret Chronicles of Sherlock Holmes (Constable, Pounds 12.99, 203 pages) the mysteries are enjoyable, though less ingenious than the verbal and visual reconstruction of the period and the style.</p>

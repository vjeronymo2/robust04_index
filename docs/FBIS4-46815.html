			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tomas Juknevicius: "The Labor Market; the </F> Freezing of Natural Processes May Generate a Social Explosion"]    [Text] Sixty-six thousand fifty-six unemployed citizens  looking for work were registered in Lithuania on May 1, 1994  (their number was 68,002 at the beginning of last month),  including 27,366 (28,547) official jobless individuals.  Forty-six percent of the jobless were registered in the cities,  and 54 percent in the districts.    The largest number of the jobless is in Vilnius 4,952 (5,031  at the beginning of April) and Panevezys -- 1,910 (2,074), the  fewest are in Marijampole --238 (261) and in Palanga -- 216  (248).    The districts with the most jobless are Taurage -- about 1.8  thousand people, and Silute -- 1.4 thousand.    The number of jobless workers keeps increasing in the  country. On May 1, there were 65.7 percent of them (65.4 percent  at the beginning of April). The number of jobless women remains  stable (61.7 percent).    The level of unemployment and joblessness has changed little  in the country, as compared with April 1: the level of  unemployment -- 3.2 percent (it was the same at the beginning of  April), and of joblessness -- 1.3 percent (1.4).    One available job in the country is sought by about 19  people  who are not working, and 8 jobless individuals.    The Lithuanian labor exchange's inquiries among the  employers  have revealed that at the beginning of May 120,000 people in  this country worked an incomplete working day, not in their  working place, were taking a compulsory vacation, or were about  to be fired.    The president's adviser on questions of social economic  policy, A. Vasiliauskas, told LIETUVOS RYTAS that hidden  unemployment, which the official statistics pass over in  silence, was entrenched in the country and was a negative  phenomenon. Many enterprises avoided applying the Bankruptcy  Law, because the people are paralyzed by psychological fear. On  the other hand, procrastination might lead to a social explosion  in the future.    V. Aleskaitis, the chairman of FIDA, a firm of the agency  for  the promotion of foreign investments, and the former minister of  international economic relations, said that investors in  Lithuania are not being scared away by the bastions of industry  with thousands of workers drawing minimal wages. The serious  investors may even find this unreally low level of unemployment  attractive, but they immediately try to compute how fast it  might rise in Lithuania.    "Instead of paying unemployment benefits and granting the  right to seek work, people get minimal wages and are left with  no prospects -- this is a faulty situation," V. Aleskaitis said.  "The freezing of natural processes promotes a social explosion."    The director of the Vilnius labor exchange, J. Jagminas,  asserted that this spring there was an increased demand for  construction workers in the capital city. Other typical large  city trends were also noticeable: fewer registered jobless and  youths, more able-bodied people. The enterprises in the capital  city have so far been reluctant to furnish the labor exchange  with statistics about working at less than full capacity; by the  way, directors of private enterprises in the Northern countries  are acting in a similar manner.</p>

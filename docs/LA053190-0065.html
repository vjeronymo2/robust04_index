			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISANDROSY AND MILLS COLLEGE STUDENTS' BATTLE TO BAR MEN  </P> <P> As a male who has suffered the slings and arrows of outrageous feminism, I have  some sympathy for the complaints of Arnold about the blatant misandrosy now  raging in the land.  </P> <P> However, Arnold's debating techniques do not inspire confidence.  </P> <P> In referring to the research cited by the Mills rebels he calls it  "pseudo-research." He does not offer any rebuttal; he evidently thinks  name-calling can pass for argument.  </P> <P> Also, in attacking misandrosy, Arnold picks some mighty strange targets. Riane  Eisler seems to me entirely free of misandrosy; indeed her book is dedicated to  her husband, and her ideal "partnership society" is one of equality, unlike the  matriarchies posited by the real man-haters in the feminist movement, such as  Robin Morgan or Susan Brownmiller.  </P> <P> It is a pity that Arnold has discredited his argument with these shoddy  techniques because misandrosy is a real and dangerous trend. If anybody spoke  of Jews, African Americans, Latinos, gays, or even foot-fetishists in the way  many leading feminists speak of men in the major media he would be suspended,  forced to apologize and perhaps successfully sued for libel.  </P> <P> Incidentally, the misandrosy of our time, nutty as it is, is a direct response  to the misogyny spouted by the Christian clergy for 2000 years. Why does not  the Rev. Arnold address that issue?  </P> <P> ROBERT ANTON WILSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

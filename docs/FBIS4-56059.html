			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, May 25 (AFP) -- Moslem-led Bosnian  Government forces Wednesday [25 May] pressed on for the second  day an offensive against Serbs west of Tesanj, in the north of  the country, the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] said here.  [passage omitted] On the ground, EC observers reported that  Tuesday's fighting, which involved artillery exchanges, left at  least three dead among government forces and nine among  civilians, according to Major Rob Annink, spokesman for  UNPROFOR. Annink also pointed to the presence of three tanks,  two of them Soviet model T-84s, in government lines, the first  time they had been noticed in the region. He was unable to say  whether the tanks were part of the Bosnian Army's armor or  whether they had been borrowed from local HVO [Croatian Defense  Council] Croat forces, now their nominal allies.    The Bosnian forces were pushing westwards, towards the  Serb-held town of Teslic, possibly in order to seize some  strategic heights and so bolster their defensive positions,  Annink said. The government attack was a "limited" one, but was  "well prepared and continuing," he said.    Further north, calm returned to the outskirts of the  Serb-held town of Brcko, an area linking western Bosnia to  Serbia. On Monday, government forces fired 10 shells at the  town, five of which hit a power transformer, Annink said.  Elsewhere in the country, there were clashes in the Bugojno and  Turbe regions of central Bosnia and near Kladanj and Dastansko,  northeast of here. [passage omitted]</p>

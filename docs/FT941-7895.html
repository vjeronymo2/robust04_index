			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Pakistan to ask donors for Pounds 1.7bn Pakistan will seek about Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in fresh assistance during talks with donor countries and multilateral agencies at the two-day annual aid consortium meeting in Paris tomorrow. The meeting, the first of its kind in almost two years, is important for the four-month-old government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Last year, Islamabad postponed the event twice, amid fears donors would be reluctant to make any large commitments because of political uncertainty. The meeting may not be immediately followed by disbursements, but an announcement would help boost Islamabad's image in financial and business sectors. Pakistan is almost certain to highlight improvements in its official foreign exchange reserves which now exceed Dollars 1.2bn, up from last July's all-time low of Dollars 137.5m. The government claims that large official bank borrowings which had earlier upset budgetary estimates have been considerably reduced. For the first six months of the fiscal year (June-December), the figure rose to Rs26bn (Pounds 584m) but has now fallen to Rs10bn. A campaign to clamp down on tax defaulters has been intensified, with tax collection officials scrutinising the accounts of large industries which have declared incomes far below their potential output. Ms Bhutto recently declared her government's policies would start showing results within 18 months. But critics argue the new government still needs to show it is prepared aggressively to push forward the country's three-year-old programme of economic reforms aimed at eliminating unnecessary official controls and privatising state-owned utilities and factories. Power shortages and lack of road and rail networks also need to be overcome before new investors enter the market on a large scale, they add. 'The make-or-break issue is the economy. So far, they haven't taken tough decisions,' says Mr Mahbub-ul-Haq, a former Pakistani finance minister, working as an adviser to the UN Development Programme in New York. He favours rapid privatisation to raise funds which could be used for paying off public sector debt, to eliminate large parts of annual debt payments which consume almost 30 per cent of the budget. Other experts say Pakistan is expected to hear donor concerns over the lack of progress on its privatisation programme, excessive spending on defence and the need for more social spending. In Washington, the International Monetary Fund announced yesterday that it had approved loans totalling 985.7m special drawing rights (Dollars 1.4bn), under its extended funds facility and its enhanced structural adjustment facility, a special fund offering highly subsidised credit to poor countries.</p>

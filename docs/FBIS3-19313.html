Disclosing that some sections of the enquiry have been  handed  over to the Milanese prosecutor's office, the sources said the  Left Democrat Party officials whose names have come up during  the collection of evidence include Party Secretary Achille  Occhetto, his right-hand man Massimo D'Alema, and others.    Yesterday, Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta, an  ex-Christian Democrat, said in an electoral speech in Pisa that  the investigators had so far shown "little curiosity" about  contracts granted left-wing cooperatives.    According to Andreatta's charges, the left-wing parties  seemed to be unaware of the way in which many of the present  cases involving crimes against the public finances included  agreements drawn up to leave space for these cooperatives,  especially in those working in construction.    In particular, he mentioned, but failed to identify more  precisely cases in Milan in 1975, in Sicily, in the area covered  by the former Fund for the Mezzogiorno to finance development in  southern Italy, and in aid projects, for example in Mozambique.  [passage omitted]    Judicial sources, who disclosed that a meeting of  investigators here this morning covered the state of play in the  investigations and speculated that they may extend more widely,  confirmed that Occhetto and others were on the list of those who  had entered the enquiries, a formal procedure for anyone whose  name crops up during the collection of evidence, but far short  of issuing any form of subpoena or warrant.    The judicial sources said that all the cases in question  were  among those mentioned in a dossier submitted to the Roman  judicial authorities in February by former Socialist Party  Secretary Bettino Craxi, himself under multiple investigation  for accusations of massive corruption, illegal party funding,  and other misdeeds.    The sources said that the cases extracted from the dossier  and handed on to the Milanese prosecutors include the building  of the Milanese subway and the re-building of Malpensa Airport;  the installation of emission purification plant at Brindisi  power station; and various bribes allegedly paid for  construction contracts. [passage omitted]    The sources said the Rome prosecutor's office has kept the  section of Craxi's dossier alleging that the ex-Communist Party  received illicit funding from East Europe. Many of the charges  within the competence of the Milanese investigators have already  been shelved for some defendants, only to be exhumed when Craxi  cited the names of Occhetto, D'Alema and the others in Rome.    The Left Democrat Party's lawyer, Guido Calvi, pointed out  that the various names involved had been registered in Rome on  the list of those whose names appear in an enquiry only on the  basis of Craxi's allegations. In a further step, as the result  of a recent agreement between the Turin, Milanese, Roman and  Venetian judiciaries, the investigators agreed to criteria for  territorial competence in anti-corruption enquiries whereby the  Roman magistrates have now sent back those sections of Craxi's  allegations that "could find no roots in Rome," Calvi noted.    "Nothing more has happened, and nothing more could happen,  since Milan has been investigating the subway and Malpensa for  over a year, and the preliminary hearings are now very close,"  said the lawyer, who also appealed for respect for the facts of  the case: "The rest is pure, shameful electoral speculation".    A statement from the Left Democrat Party also pointed out  that entering a name on the register of those entering an  enquiry is a "formal obligation which is therefore automatic."  The statement also reiterated the Left Democrats' conviction  that Craxi's allegations were based on "slanderous and unfounded  accusations destined solely to set up hurdles and traps on the  path of justice."    Meanwhile, in a radio interview, Milan's Chief Prosecutor  Saverio Borrelli said that, "after deep thought," his office has  decided to pursue its anti-corruption investigations "as if  there was no electoral season." "I would be a hypocrite if I  said the problem doesn't exist," added Borrelli of the debate  over whether the enquiries should proceed during the campaign  for the March 27/28 vote, but he also pointed out that, if the  investigators were to allow their work to be conditioned by  political circumstances as regards "timing, let alone  substance," accusations of having pursued political criteria in  rendering justice would surely follow.    "Even delaying acts for which the time is ripe in strictly  judicial terms could be a choice representing a favour to one  political side and a disfavour to another, and tomorrow could  represent a reason for blame," he noted. In other points, he  said it was a simple rule of "good civic education" to read the  acts of the magistrature for what they are and for what they  "objectively appear as."    "I think it is uncivil...to try to psychoanalyse a measure,  carrying out psychoanalysis of the motivation in order to claim  that the words say one thing, but underneath them there is  something else."</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Budget '92: Industry looks to set its wheels in motion - Peter Marsh hears a mixed batch of hopes from companies struggling in recession BRITAIN'S battered industrialists hope that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will offer them a few crumbs of comfort in next month's Budget. After about 18 months of what may turn out to be the longest recession since the 1930s, industry wants the chancellor to ease its tax burden and possibly extend help in the form of extra investment allowances. Some would prefer increased public spending that would help the economy to recover and assist hard-hit sectors such as construction. Many industrialists hold out little hope that base rates, stuck at 10.5 per cent for more than five months, will come down very much in the near future, because of the need to keep sterling within its fixed band in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System. Some believe, however, that the high interest rates required by the mechanism may be more than offset in the next few years by the gains of lower inflation. Another factor that leads many industrialists to downplay calls for assistance is their belief that the ingredients for a slow recovery later this year are already in place. Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil, the building treatment and services group, is an optimist. He argues that, as the economy is now poised for an upturn, there is little need for sweeping action in the Budget. On the issue of cuts in income tax - thought to be under consideration  - opinions are divided. Mr Mike Alderson, chairman of the UK arm of Motorola, the US electronics company, says that reducing the basic tax rate by 1 percentage point would provide 'a psychological lift' that could help industry by raising overall spending. Mr Christopher Haskins, chairman of food-maker Northern Foods, argues against a cut in personal taxation. 'Cutting income tax could be dangerous as it would probably have the effect of increasing imports and triggering a balance-of-payments problem in future years,' says Mr Haskins. Like many in manufacturing, Mr Haskins wants the government to increase the proportion of new investment that qualifies for tax relief from the current 25 per cent. Mr Paul Lester, chief executive of Graseby, an electronics company, says the need for new capital spending is so great that the allowance should be pushed up to 100 per cent 'for an indefinite period'. Behind such proposals is the sharp fall in manufacturing investment resulting from the recession, which some believe will hold back UK companies' ability to compete with overseas rivals. According to the Confederation of British Industry, by the end of this year manufacturing investment is likely to have come down by about one third, compared with the period before the start of the recession in late 1989. The CBI wants Mr Lamont to increase the investment allowance to 40 per cent, a move which it says would cost Pounds 1.05bn in 1993-94. The Engineering Employers' Federation echoes that, arguing that existing tax arrangements 'discriminate against investment in favour of other kinds of business expense'. Sir Ivor Cohen, chairman of the Japan Electronics Business Association, a group of 100 companies that sell equipment and services to Japanese electronics groups, also supports increased allowances. He is gloomy about recovery: 'I don't see anything ahead that creates conditions for a lift-off.' Some argue that tax allowances have only a marginal effect on capital spending, with more potent factors being general industrial confidence and the broad state of the economy. Sir Anthony Gill, chairman and chief executive of the Lucas engineering-components group, says any extra government cash would be better directed towards improving the public-sector infrastructure. He also wants the government to reduce advance corporation tax, which many industrialists say unfairly penalises companies with large overseas earnings by effectively taxing profits twice. Sir Anthony supports the ERM discipline: 'I accept the pain we're going through in the cause of getting inflation down.' Also calling for Mr Lamont to use the Budget to inject extra money into the infrastructure is Mr Chris Lewinton, chief executive of TI, the engineering company. 'When you return to Britain from abroad, everything looks a bit shabby,' he says. 'Improved roads and rail links would have a direct benefit for industry.' He argues that Britain may be able to afford the extra borrowing that increased government spending entails, on the grounds that its debt is much lower than that of many other industrialised countries. Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive of the Unigate food, distribution and car-auctions company, says a reduction in taxes on new cars would help ease the pressures on an industry which has seen sales nose-dive in the past two years. Professor Kumar Bhattacharyya, head of the Warwick Manufacturing Group, a research and teaching organisation at Warwick University, says Mr Lamont should take 'minor' action - perhaps by announcing extra grants to aid innovation or technology development. 'I don't believe he needs to do anything very much, but even small sums spent in areas such as grants can have a big psychological effect. The main thing for Mr Lamont is make people in industry say: 'Hey, you've listened to us.''</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. RESTRICTIONS ON AIDS-INFECTED VISITORS CHALLENGED;  </P> <P> HEALTH: THE WHITE HOUSE IS URGED TO EASE VISA BARRIERS. AN INTERNATIONAL  CONFERENCE ON THE DISEASE IS SET FOR NEXT MONTH IN SAN FRANCISCO.  </P> <P> Challenging the Bush Administration's claim that it cannot remove an  immigration barrier against AIDS-infected people, two congressmen Tuesday  released documents that they said showed that the policy can be changed through  executive action.  </P> <P> "Now the Administration cannot beg the question (of travel restrictions) with  legalisms any longer," said Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of  the House energy and commerce subcommittee. "Any further rationalization and  delay cannot be explained."  </P> <P> But White House Deputy Press Secretary Alixe Glen said the President does not  intend to take action because he "continues to believe that the issue of  amending or reversing the congressional mandate rests with the Congress." She  said, however, that the President would support congressional legislation  reversing the measure.  </P> <P> The travel restrictions on people with AIDS have come under mounting global  criticism during the past year, particularly as June's international AIDS  conference in San Francisco nears.  </P> <P> The law enacted by Congress in 1987 added the AIDS-inflicted to the list of  people denied entry because of disease. The Administration, saying it does not  have the power to change the law, instead has offered to issue special 10-day  visas to enable travelers to attend certain conferences deemed "in the public  interest" by the secretary of health and human services. The special visas  would not require foreigners to declare whether they are infected with the AIDS  virus.  </P> <P> This solution has been attacked as unsatisfactory by many in the AIDS network,  who have threatened to boycott the San Francisco conference and other important  scientific and medical meetings.  </P> <P> Waxman and Rep. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.), a physician and member of the National  Commission on AIDS, released a memo Tuesday from the U.S. comptroller general  concluding the law that added AIDS to the list of "dangerous contagious"  diseases "does not clearly bar" the President or the HHS secretary from "later  deciding that (AIDS) infection is not a dangerous contagious disease. . . . "  </P> <P> The memo said the measure -- passed as an amendment to a 1987 supplemental  appropriations bill -- may have been effective only for the fiscal year to  which the appropriation act applied.  </P> <P> "If that were the case, its effect . . . might be said to have expired with the  appropriation, at the end of fiscal year 1987," the memo said.  </P> <P> Dr. Mervyn F. Silverman, president of the American Foundation for AIDS  Research, said the opinion by the comptroller general gives the President "the  perfect opportunity to take the high road."  </P> <P> The memo further said control of the list of diseases continues to remain with  the secretary of health and human services. Rowland, seeking to clarify the  authority, recently introduced legislation that would give the secretary of  health and human services power to change the list.  </P> <P> The lawmakers also released an internal memo written by Dr. James O. Mason,  assistant secretary for health, to HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan urging that  AIDS and six other conditions -- including leprosy and several treatable  sexually transmitted diseases -- be removed from the list because the policy  was "outdated." He proposed leaving only tuberculosis on the list.  </P> <P> "Unlike the other diseases on the list, tuberculosis can be transmitted through  the air and an infectious person can place others at risk through casual  contact," Mason wrote.  </P> <P> As to the other conditions, Mason wrote, " . . . there is no public health  value in continued screening. . . . "  </P> <P> He suggested the secretary order the removal of the six conditions other than  AIDS, and that the Administration offer a legislative proposal to delete AIDS  from the list.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASK THE JUDGE: IS NEW WIFE LIABLE FOR ALIMONY?  </P> <P> Q My fiance is divorced and is paying alimony to his ex-wife. I would like to  know if any of my salary could be held accountable to his ex-wife after we  marry.  </P> <P> K.M.,  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P> <P> A Your earnings after marriage would be considered community property and would  be liable for any alimony payments your husband has incurred from a previous  marriage. However, if you deposit your earnings in an account separate from  that of any community property funds, those earnings would not be considered  community property and would not be subject to any alimony obligations.  </P> <P> You should also be aware that if any community property from your marriage is  used to pay such alimony payments, and your husband had separate property of  his own, your community property is entitled to be reimbursed by his separate  property for the amount which was paid to his ex-wife.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q My life has been a mess for the past year or so. I have been in and out of  hospitals and have finally gotten my health back. I just recently got a new  job, and it looks like I'm starting to straighten out my life. I tried to buy a  car but was told that I had bad credit because of an unpaid judgment against  me. I don't know anything about this judgment. What can I do to fight it?  </P> <P> J.G.,  </P> <P> Orange  </P> <P> A There are two ways that you could get the judgment set aside, and have a new  trial. The first way is if you never received notice that you were being sued.  The time limit within which you must file for the relief is 2 years after entry  of the default judgment if no notice of entry of the judgment was given, or 6  months after written notice of entry of the default or default judgment was  given to you. The clerk's office in the court which issued the judgment can  give you this information.  </P> <P> The second way to obtain relief is to ask the court to set aside the judgment  on the basis that the judgment was obtained through your mistake, inadvertence,  surprise or excusable neglect. To qualify for this method, you must provide the  court with a reasonable explanation as to why you did not contest the lawsuit  against you. The time period to file for this relief is within a reasonable  time not exceeding 6 months after the judgment was taken against you. Again,  the clerk's office can provide you with whatever information you need.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Q I got a fix-it ticket for no taillights a year ago and didn't bother to take  care of it. A friend said that I could be arrested. Is this true?  </P> <P> T.S.,  </P> <P> Irvine  </P> <P> A Yes, you could be arrested for failing to appear in court on the ticket. When  you signed the ticket, you promised to appear in court on the date which the  officer wrote on the ticket. When you failed to do so, you could be charged  with the misdemeanor offense of failure to appear in court. Normally, the court  will issue a warrant for your arrest. You should take care of this ticket as  soon as possible to avoid being arrested.  </P> <P> Got a question for Judge Nomoto? Write: Ask the Judge, Orange County Life, The  Times, 1375 Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Questions of broadest  interest will be answered in her column.  </P></p>

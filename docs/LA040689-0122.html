			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: PASADENA;  </P> <P> BROADER PHONE TAX PLANNED  </P> <P> By a 4-2 vote, the Pasadena Board of Directors has instructed the city attorney  to prepare an ordinance extending the city's telephone tax to interstate and  international calls.  </P> <P> Mary J. Bradley, city finance director, told the board that the extension would  raise $1 million a year in tax revenue. The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way  for the extension recently by upholding state and local taxes on interstate and  international calls, rejecting the argument that the taxes are an  unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.  </P> <P> The city tax of 7.86% currently applies only to calls made within California.  Representatives of the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce and the Ralph M. Parsons  Co. argued against broadening the tax, asserting that it would put a heavy  burden on businesses. Director Jess Hughston agreed, saying the city has lured  companies to Pasadena and should not now be raising their costs. Mayor William  E. Thomson Jr. opposed the tax increase on grounds that the city had not yet  identified a purpose for the revenue.  </P> <P> But other directors supported the increase, saying that the city's financial  position is deteriorating.  </P> <P> Director John Crowley said the city is caught between declining allocations  from the state and federal governments and rising demand for city services.  Director Rick Cole warned that Pasadena has a "tough fiscal year ahead," adding  that "this is probably not the only tax that is going to have to be raised next  year." Directors Kathryn Nack and William Paparian voted with Cole and Crowley.  Director Loretta Thompson-Glickman was absent.  </P></p>

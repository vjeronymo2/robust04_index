			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: NAVY SEALS FORESEE A BIG CINEMATIC COMING OUT  </P> <P> THERE IS a definite air of excitement among Orion Pictures executives as "Navy  Seals," starring Charlie Sheen and Michael Biehn, prepares to open Friday.  Recent screenings of the action-adventure tale received tremendous reaction --  and women, surprisingly, were just as turned on by the film as men, leading  Orion insiders to predict they have another "Top Gun" box-office bonanza on  their hands.  </P> <P> It seems that audiences go wild finally seeing real American heroes get the bad  guys (in this case Middle East terrorists). The Seals are an elite, secretive  arm of the U.S. government's special forces, and they've basically been kept a  secret since President John F. Kennedy designated them in 1962. (The Seals have  been known to credit other branches of the armed forces for their successes.)  </P> <P> Now the Seals are coming out, partly because they knew the film was going to be  made whether they liked it or not, and partly because they want more Seals.  They want to make young men aware that this outfit exists. So everybody is  jumping on the "Navy Seals" bandwagon, including the fighting men themselves,  nine of whom served as technical advisers, and higher-ups in the Navy who are  convinced that this movie will make the Seals -- no longer a secret operation  -- a sought-after enlistment.  </P> <P> EARTHA KITT, she of the indestructible growl and purr, has been signed to star  in Noel Coward's famous 1929 musical "Bitter Sweet." Written by Coward for  Gertrude Lawrence, it was introduced to Broadway audiences by Evelyn Laye, one  of the great beauties of the stage, who recently turned a serene 90 in London.  ("Bitter Sweet" was filmed twice, most memorably by Jeanette MacDonald and  Nelson Eddy in 1940. Coward's score contains, among other gems, the lovely  "I'll See You Again.")  </P> <P> After tryouts across the country, the show will be brought to New York as a  major revival.  </P> <P> ARTIE SHAW, the legendary band leader and swing clarinetist of the '30s and  '40s, who's written three books, is now preparing a fourth. Shaw says he has  eight chapters, "and when I finish eight more I'll be done." It's fiction, he  says, "because fiction is the only way to tell the truth."  </P> <P> Shaw has plenty to tell. Married eight times, to such beauties as Lana Turner,  Ava Gardner, Evelyn Keyes, Doris Dowling and "Forever Amber" author Kathleen  Windsor, Artie got a lot of mileage out of his song of seduction "Begin the  Beguine." Shaw won't think about a publisher until the book is finished, though  his new movie script is now making the rounds. Artie Shaw, still swinging!  </P></p>

According to these first  results from 11 constituencies, the Togolese People's Rally is  leading with six seats, followed closely by the Action Committee  for Renewal and the Togolese Union for Democracy, which will go  to the second round of elections in several constituencies.  [passage omitted]    According to the electoral code, the complete results of the  first round of elections must be communicated to the Supreme  Court by the evening of 9 February so that they can be  announced. In an evening radio and television program on the  elections at the Palais des Congres yesterday, CEN Chairman Kue  Sipohon Gaba admitted the slowness with which the votes are  being counted. This slowness is due to lack of sufficient means  to count the votes. According to the general opinion, voting  took place in satisfactory conditions. Opposition candidates  and those from the presidential group unanimously admitted this,  although they pointed out certain shortcomings in the  organization.</p>

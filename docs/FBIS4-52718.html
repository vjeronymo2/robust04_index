			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) on May 10  issued an appeal on the occasion of the 14th anniversary of the  Kwangju popular uprising, calling upon the South Korean people  of various strata to rise in the nationwide struggle for  anti-U.S. independence, according to Seoul-based radio Voice of  National Salvation.    The Kwangju popular uprising was sparked by the frantic  repressive offensive the U.S. imperialists and their stooges  "Yusin" remnants launched after proclaiming the "Emergency  Martial Law" all over South Korea in May 1980. It was an  anti-U.S., anti-fascist resistance and a death-defying massive  armed uprising against the fascist suppression.    Our people suffered a terrible disaster in Kwangju 14 years  ago owing to the United States, the appeal says, and continues:    Before the grudge of those days vanishes, the cursed United  States is bringing a horrible nuclear holocaust to our people  and our nation.    The United States is running amuck in putting pressure on  the  North even through the United Nations in a bid to open the way  out for the U.S. war industrial complexes facing marketing  difficulties with the end of the cold war and to jumpstart the  sluggish U.S. economy by turning the land of our country into a  nuclear war theatre and making our nation a sacrifice of a  nuclear war.    Our nation cannot overlook the present grave situation.    Our nation must determinedly rise in a struggle to get the  U.S. troops and nuclear weapons fraught with nuclear holocaust  withdrawn from South Korea and to smash the U.S. pressure to  open rice and weapon markets.    Let us all put an end to the colonial rule and intervention  of the U.S. imperialists and retake the sovereignty of the  nation with the nationwide anti-U.S. struggle.    Let us all overthrow Kim Yong-sam, the arch traitor to the  nation, who has reduced South Korea to a colony and nuclear  forward base of the United States and is scheming to ignite a  nuclear war in this land, and realize the sovereignty of the  nation.</p>

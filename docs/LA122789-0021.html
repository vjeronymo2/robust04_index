			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIA, CHINA  </P> <P> The Bush Administration has strongly condemned the brutal killings of  protesters by Romanian security forces, calling this action one in sharp  contrast to those in the other Eastern bloc countries. The Administration is  correct; the action is in sharp contrast.  </P> <P> However, another sharp contrast is that of the response of the Administration  to this event and to very similar, but undoubtedly far worse, events in Beijing  last June. Those events prompted a very mild, diffident and, as we have learned  since, hypocritical reaction by this Administration. The difference, it  appears, is that we have few business or political expectations of Romania, and  so we may object vigorously, without loss of what we don't have anyway.  </P> <P> HARRY M.

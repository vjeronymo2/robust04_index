			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Architecture Award: Horden gallops past the post with a classic - A report on the 'high-tech' appeal of this year's winning entry Two English obsessions were united in the presentation yesterday of the Financial Times Architecture Award to the designers of The Queen's Stand at Epsom Racecourse - horse racing and 'high-tech' architecture. Some critics might say that the third national obsession, gambling, was also part of the winning equation. The architects, Richard Horden Associates, is a young practice, set up in London in 1985, and it was an adventurous choice  -indeed something of a gamble - for United Racecourses to chose it for this prestigious commission at Epsom, Surrey. The chairman of United Racecourses is Sir Evelyn de Rothschild - a man used to winning in the world but also a man with a stern eye for quality. The members of the jury of the FT Award were unanimous in their selection of The Queen's Stand as this year's winner - they were in fact bowled over by the consummate elegance and practical beauty of the design. What is 'high-tech' architecture and why is it a purely English obsession? Put simply, it is an architecture that celebrates the glories of contemporary technology and turns mere functionalism into something expressive - almost poetic. 'High-tech' buildings such as the Lloyd's building in the City of London elevate the language of engineering and structure above and beyond any simple single purpose or function. There is something almost gothic about the expressiveness of structure which combines with an enjoyment of the symbolism of our times. 'High-tech' architects enjoy new materials and the application of technologies learned in other fields to the development of architecture. Many sources of ideas are plundered to feed the god of high technology - architects have learned from car manufacture; prefabrication and space and rocket technology; and marine engineering, aeronautics and computing has also nourished its growth. Why is it so much an English phenomenon? Architects would say that 'high-tech' grew out of engineering and the pioneering traditions of designs like the Crystal Palace by Sir Joseph Paxton, or Brunel's bridges and railway stations. But it is also closely linked to ship and aircraft design  -the skills that went into Concorde and the QE2 have also enriched 'high-tech' architecture. England's 'high-tech' pioneers such as Sir Norman Foster and Nicholas Grimshaw are enthralled by yachts and aircraft - indeed, Sir Norman is famous for arriving at site meetings by helicopter. Richard Horden, this year's winner of the Financial Times Architecture Award, is a pedigree product of the best 'high-tech' stables. He started in an office with Nicholas Grimshaw and then worked for 10 years in Norman Foster's office. While he was with the Foster practice he was involved in the design of the Sainsbury Centre for the Visual Arts at the University of East Anglia, and the remarkable headquarters of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank in Hong Kong. He also helped evolve the early design of the Nimes art gallery and the Stansted airport proposals. On setting up his own practice Horden faced the problem of how to utilise his experience of working with the design leaders of the profession while developing a distinctive style of his own. During the early 1980s he was fortunate to secure several commissions for private houses. An aluminium house in the New Forest generated several revolutionary ideas. He was also teaching and continuing to practice his own particular interest in yachting and boat design. Like many of the best contemporary architects Horden moved into the design of furniture and interiors. His small 'Yacht House' and 'Ski Haus' projects are the result of his own wide sailing experience and his work with yachting engineers and carbon craftsmen. Direct work in the factory gives Horden an edge over many of his contemporaries: a sense of control is evident in his buildings. The Queen's Stand at Epsom is beautifully sited and has a remarkable view of the Epsom Downs and the surrounding seven counties. The club stand for the racecourse, it is located opposite the finishing line of the Derby. As the brief demanded a series of balconies and boxes all with a clear view of the course, it was natural for the architect to draw parallels with a large ocean liner with sleek deck forms. Masts and flagpoles add to the impression of a ship, especially as the whole building is painted white. Continuous balconies create the sense of a grandstand and provide racegoers with views of the Royal box and of other racegoers as well as the horses. While the stand is well equipped for racegoers it also has fine facilities for jockeys. Part of the competition brief for the stand (which was drawn up in 1988) was that the building should be in use for as much of the year as possible for functions and entertaining. It runs like a great hotel on the Downs and the sleekness of the design makes it an agreeably neutral setting that can be transformed easily for a variety of events. The design team included engineers Ove Arup and Partners with Peter Rice and the quantity surveyors were Davis Langdon and Everest, Clyde Malby. Planning permission was granted in March 1991 and a phased fast track construction programme allowed the completion of the whole project within 18 months. Richard Horden has several promising successors to this award-winning building in the pipeline. His practice won the European-wide competition for a 100 metre high tower for Glasgow, to be built (funding permitting) in the city centre to mark the millennium. An important scheme for Shell UK for a new headquarters building in The Strand in London is currently awaiting planning consent. Land Securities and NM Rothschild have both commissioned important projects from the Horden practice. Any visitor to the offices of this London firm, in Golden Square just behind Piccadilly Circus, will sense a new architectural spirit. The office includes a showroom and cafe and tourists are welcomed to glimpse the design process at the heart of the capital. The FT jury felt that the Queen's Stand was magnificent and saw in it the seeds of many future projects of high quality. Awards should encourage as well as reward and Horden seems to have a golden future as one of Britain's band of world leaders in the 'high tech' architectural market.</p>

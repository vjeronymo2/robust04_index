			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta </F> by Bernardo Valli in Rome; date not given: "`Europe Will  Respond to the East's Fears'"]    [Excerpt] Rome --  [introductory passage omitted] The election results in Russia  took almost everyone by surprise, and now Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's 20 million votes loom like a threat over the  Atlantic Council session in Brussels. Andreatta gave this  analysis of the Russian election results: "Inertia,  indifference, the fact that so many Russians failed to take part  in the first democratic elections in their history could prompt  a comparison with Weimar (pre-Nazi Germany -- LA REPUBBLICA  editor's note). Questions also arise concerning the national  character, the legacy of communism, apathy, nostalgia for  equality within poverty. Zhirinovskiy's violence and the  mourning for the loss of empire, the anti-Semitism, and the  spirit of self-pity and revenge are reminiscent of men who hide  in cellars, a reminder of Russia's constant oscillation between  humiliation and a sense of mission -- the Third Rome, the New  Constantinople. All this creates a sense of danger, the  impression of the possible collapse of the institutions, of the  political mechanism."    [Valli] In other words, something in a precarious state of  balance, from which we must protect ourselves but that at the  same time must not be angered, offended, provoked, to avoid  causing or hastening a possible disaster?    [Andreatta] On the one hand, there is our objective anxiety  about Russia, and, on the other, the realization that the way in  which the West manages its security policy could prompt  reactions in Russia, could determine events at an unsteady time  when the country has an identity problem. [Andreatta ends]    Hence the existence of two schools of thought. One, strict  and unyielding, that would extend NATO to the countries of  Central Europe or even the Baltics, that have become emancipated  since the collapse of the Soviet empire, both to protect them  and to "contain" possible future Russian impulses. The other is  concerned with not prompting the old sense of insecurity that  has often been behind these expansionist impulses on Russia's  part.    [Andreatta continues] Henry Kissinger represents the former  school of thought, ruthlessly, albeit lucidly, as always. He  says that to leave a security vacuum on Russia's borders means  causing history to repeat itself. The other school of thought  would help Russia's reformist leaders in the security field, as  has been done in the economic field, with a view to facilitating  democratic development.    [Valli] But the prevailing line is the middle path proposed  by the Americans under the name Partnership for Peace.    [Andreatta] Yes -- with all the ambiguities concealed  beneath  the concept of flexibility that lies at the root of the project.  It provides no proper guarantees. Indeed, the first school of  thought says that they are weak guarantees, similar to those  that characterized relations between the Western countries and  those of Central and East Europe in the 1930's. The difficulty  is how to deal with two problems using the same instrument. On  the one hand, it is necessary to reassure Russia and on the  other it is necessary to protect the neighboring countries that  feel threatened. In both instances anxiety about security could  block the democratic process, which -- except in  Czechoslovakia's case -- is new everywhere and has no foundation  in the past.    [Valli] Do you have a solution?    [Andreatta] It seems to me that there is a division of  tasks.  The United States and NATO have the task of creating security  conditions, and therefore also of reassuring the Russian  federation. The other task perhaps lies with the European Union,  and it is to strengthen bonds, ties, connections, relations with  the countries of Central and East Europe so that it is clear to  even the most impetuous of Russians that beyond their country's  historical confines lie European territories.    [Valli] Are you referring to the recent Italian-British  initiative?    [Andreatta] Yes, and it proposes that the European Union  extend the second and third pillars of the Maastricht Treaty --  which concern foreign and security policy and internal and  judicial policy -- to the countries of Central and East Europe.    [Valli] Basically, a gradual association with the European  Union with regard to the various fields of policy -- leaving  aside the Economic Community, with which it is definitely too  early to proceed.    [Andreatta] The rationale is to have several instruments for  resolving a number of problems.    [Valli] So you regard the security architecture proposed by  the Americans under the name of Partnership for Peace as fragile  or incomplete.    [Andreatta] We will say in Brussels that any wrong moves or  intimidations on Russia's part would call the philosophy of that  plan into question. Indeed, it is a plan that envisages an  orderly evolution of life in Russia. Clearly, if imperialist  options were to emerge again, this project -- being flexible by  nature, and not a treaty of alliance -- would undergo some  profound changes. [Andreatta ends]    The partnership -- in which Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, and  the Czech Republic should participate -- does not envisage  NATO's automatic intervention in the event of an outside threat,  as is the case with the 16 members of the Atlantic alliance, but  it does envisage the possibility of asking the NATO Council to  examine the consequences of the crisis or conflict and perhaps  to secure help. It also envisages the possibility of  participating in peacekeeping military operations, without  integrated commands. This is rather like an apprenticeship with  a view to future membership.    [Valli] So the plan entails a certain dynamic and leaves  matters unresolved. This is why you talk about flexibility and  ambiguity. Is it a transitional plan? Until the situation in  Moscow becomes clearer?    [Andreatta] NATO must not lose its role with respect to its  16 member countries; it must not dilute its task of guaranteeing  their security. However, if a normal reform were to become  firmly established in Russia; if, of the two tendencies in  Russian history, the European one were to prevail; then the  possibility of its joining NATO could be reappraised, and NATO  itself would have to be reappraised. This cannot be ruled out.  For that matter, the Partnership for Peace does not rule out a  gradual accession.    [Valli] For the present the prospect of Russia's accession  to  the alliance is regarded as the entry of the wolf into the  European sheepfold -- especially in view of the emergence of the  Zhirinovskiy phenomenon.    [Andreatta] That seems to me an image suited to the  rationale  that Kissinger represents. [Andreatta ends]    Another important topic at the Brussels summit is the now  recognized possibility for the Europeans to use NATO's technical  infrastructures for strictly European operations under European  command. That is, operations without American participation.    [Valli] At one time the Bush administration opposed it,  because it feared that the United States would lose authority  over the Old Continent. And some Europeans, and especially the  French, did not consider it a positive prospect, because they  thought that it would delay the establishment of a European  army. What has changed in the meantime?    [Andreatta] Some of the tensions between Europe and the  United States have been alleviated. While the dispute between  the French and Americans over GATT (the updating of which led to  a confrontation between Paris and Washington over agricultural  products and cultural products including television programs --  LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) was in progress, Edouard Balladur's  government in Paris was resolving other problems with the United  States.    [Valli] Minor trade conflicts often arise within NATO,  sometimes harming relations between the two sides of the  Atlantic. Could they in time constitute a threat to the alliance?    [Andreatta] It is important that the use of unilateral  decisions be abolished in trade policies when minor conflicts of  interest arise between the two sides of the Atlantic -- minor  compared to those between America and Japan. We must prevent the  newspapers from being full of headlines about steel and tomato  wars. Those were minor events as long as the imperatives of  security were predominant, but the relaxation of tension brought  about by the end of the Cold War could make them much more  troublesome and damaging, partly because they cause a stiffening  on the part of public opinion. [Andreatta ends]    Minister Andreatta's early references to George Kennan are  significant. He no longer cites that name, and neither did I,  but as our conversation approached its conclusion it drifted  toward the Mediterranean (to which Andreatta would like to  extend the partnership for peace) and I was reminded of Kennan.  I tried to remember what he wrote in the winter of 1946 when,  rather isolated in the victorious and suspicious Moscow, he  pondered what stance to adopt toward that former ally, now an  adversary. By proposing to President Truman a strategy of  containment, Kennan perhaps believed that Russia's  "irresistible" expansionist impulses were due more to defensive  reasons, to the fear of isolation, rather than to an impetus to  rule the world. Be that as it may, he had to ponder this  dilemma and concluded that the right thing to do was both to  prevent and at the same time to reassure. There ensued the  inevitable Cold War, won by NATO without recourse to guns. In  very different terms, it is true, and within a very different  international context, Russia now poses a less dramatic, but not  so dissimilar, dilemma. One school of thought says that we must  wait so as not to cause a provocation, while the other argues  that if in the future East Europe absolutely must join NATO to  protect itself from a situation that has grown worse in Moscow,  it would certainly be more dangerous to do it then than now.  That is what Kissinger says. Perhaps he is not mistaken.</p>

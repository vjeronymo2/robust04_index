			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE ABSOLVE BORDER AGENTS IN BOY'S DEATH  </P> <P> San Diego police have found no evidence of negligence in the death of a  14-year-old Mexican boy run over by a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle in August, and  authorities have no plans to prosecute the agent who was driving, federal and  local officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The incident, which occurred just inside U.S. territory in San Diego early in  the morning of Aug. 20, sparked considerable controversy -- and a call by the  Mexican government for a thorough investigation -- after an attorney  representing the dead boy's family alleged that the agent had been driving  recklessly.  </P> <P> U.S. Border Patrol officials, who characterized the incident as an unfortunate  but unavoidable accident, said immediately afterward that an initial inquiry  had uncovered no evidence of wrongdoing by the driver, Agent George Brunner,  29, or his partner, Agent Oscar Lomeli, 34.  </P> <P> On Monday, San Diego Police Cmdr. Cal Krosch said the official police  investigation found no criminal negligence by the agents. "As far as we're  concerned, it's a closed matter," Krosch said.  </P> <P> James W. Brannigan, chief assistant U.S. attorney in San Diego, said U.S.  authorities, who reviewed the police investigation because it involved federal  officers, did not dispute the police findings.  </P> <P> "The San Diego police concluded this was accidental," Brannigan said, "and we  see no reason to take any further action at this point."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for the Mexican consul in San Diego declined comment Monday.  </P> <P> Still to be litigated is a civil claim filed by the family of the dead boy,  Luis Eduardo Hernandez, a native of the Mexican state of Jalisco. He and a  15-year-old brother, Angel, were en route to Los Angeles, where their father,  Aurelio Hernandez, resides, when the boy was run over at 2:30 a.m. Aug. 20.  Luis Eduardo was buried 11 days later in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The family's attorney, Michael D. Padilla of San Diego, has maintained that the  Border Patrol vehicle, a 1988 Chevrolet Blazer, was driving at excessive speed  -- up to 50 m.p.h. -- when it ran over and killed the boy at a spot just north  of the border fence and south of the Tijuana River channel. The boy was one of  scores gathered that evening along the channel, which has become the most  popular crossing spot for undocumented migrants along the entire U.S.-Mexico  border.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeking Damages  </P> <P> The family is seeking unspecified damages from the U.S. government for wrongful  death and for emotional distress inflicted upon Angel Hernandez, who witnessed  the death. U.S. authorities have rejected the initial claim. The family plans  to file suit shortly in U.S. District Court in San Diego, Padilla said.  </P> <P> The Border Patrol has maintained that the vehicle was traveling at no more than  15 m.p.h. -- within agency guidelines -- when it struck and ran over the boy.  The youth was running when he fell in the path of the vehicle, which was unable  to stop, the patrol said.  </P> <P> The death occurred in an area where, each evening, all-terrain enforcement  vehicles patrol back and forth along the tattered border fence as hundreds of  migrants gather on the Tijuana side and just inside U.S. territory, all waiting  for an opportunity to dart north. Witnesses estimate that the vehicles, which  churn up clouds of dust along the dirt track, have been seen traveling as fast  as 35 m.p.h.  </P> <P> In the past four years, according to a San Diego civil-rights coalition, Border  Patrol vehicles have run over and killed at least six migrants in the  California-Mexico border region, prompting calls for more safety procedures.  </P></p>

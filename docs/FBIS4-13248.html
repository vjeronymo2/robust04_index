			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Birri is now  visiting Jordan. Shortly after arriving in Amman today, he met  with the speaker of the Lower House of Parliament Tahir al-Masri.    In remarks during the meeting, al-Masri said that the Arab  nation is facing the most difficult conditions and must unify  its ranks to confront the challenges and dangers. He said  Jordan and Lebanon are living through similar conditions in  terms of their being targeted by a joint enemy and being exposed  to foreign pressures.    Mr. Birri paid tribute to his majesty the king's pan-Arab  stands and said Jordan had withstood the pressures. He called  for closer coordination among Arab partners to the peace talks  with Israel.    The Lebanese Parliament speaker is accompanied on his visit  to Jordan by a number of Lebanese deputies and officials.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CLEAN UP CAPITAL, PEROT TELLS BUSINESSMEN  </P> <P> Billionaire H. Ross Perot, saying the nation's capital has some of the nation's  worst schools, urged local business leaders Tuesday to pitch in and help fight  the city's murder, drug and crime epidemic.  </P> <P> "Get out of your fancy house," Perot said. "Get down there where the rubber  meets the road . . . and say, 'Let's fix this; let's help these folks.'  </P> <P> "It's pure self-interest, if I can't get you excited any other way, because  you're helping the tax base," he said.  </P> <P> Perot, a colorful and controversial Texas businessman, spoke to more than 500  Washington-area business leaders who support the Salvation Army at the  charitable group's annual district luncheon. He cited Washington's surge in  drug-related slayings, which have given it the highest per capita murder rate  in the nation.  </P> <P> "You say, 'What can I do?' Here's what you can do. You can clean up the schools  in this town. You can clean up streets in this town. You can make it a safe  place for people to live."  </P></p>

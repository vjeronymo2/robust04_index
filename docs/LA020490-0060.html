			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $343 MILLION IN COCAINE SEIZED IN FULLERTON  </P> <P> In what law enforcement officials said was the largest narcotics bust in Orange  County history, more than two tons of cocaine were seized Friday night from a  Fullerton warehouse described as a distribution center for the drug.  </P> <P> No arrests were made in the raid, but FBI agents believe the 4,719 pounds of  cocaine came from sophisticated drug cartels operating in South America.  </P> <P> Authorities estimated the cache has a street value of $343.2 million. They said  an investigation is continuing into the operators of the cocaine warehouse.  </P> <P> While not as large as the record 21.4-ton cocaine seizure in Sylmar last  September, Friday's raid underscores the fact that Orange County has joined Los  Angeles County as a major drug trafficking area, local police officials said  Saturday.  </P> <P> The investigation in the Fullerton case lasted more than a month and culminated  Friday, when authorities obtained a search warrant for the warehouse, located  in the 700 block of State College Boulevard near several auto shops and retail  businesses, Parker said.  </P> <P> Inside the warehouse, officials said they found the cocaine wrapped in boxes  and stacked onto wooden pallets inside a white GMC truck.  </P> <P> Authorities believe the drugs were about to be moved from the truck to two  smaller vehicles that would have taken the cocaine to other locations. No one  was inside the warehouse at the time of the raid, authorities said.  </P> <P> Thomas R. Parker, a Los Angeles-based assistant special agent, said the amount  of cocaine seized suggests that the drugs were to be sold not just in Orange  County, but throughout the nation.  </P> <P> The cocaine packages bore distinctive marks, such as red stars and green  blocks, which FBI officials say can be traced to cocaine cartels operating in  parts of South America. But officials refused to specify which cartels.  </P> <P> "These cartels work like major corporations. They have their own subsidiaries  and their own markings (for the cocaine)," Parker said.  </P> <P> Orange County and the rest of Southern California have seen an increase in drug  traffic in recent years partly because of successful efforts to keep drugs out  of the south Florida area, Parker said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The U.S. government has continued to sell millions of dollars worth of tritium  -- crucial to the manufacture of nuclear weapons -- while saying that there may  not be enough of the gas to continue production, it was reported. The only  reactors able to make the rapidly decaying radioactive gas in the United States  are at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina, which was closed last April.  The Energy Department has said there may be an urgent shortage by year end. But  the New York Times, citing private experts, said the commercial sales to  American and foreign companies indicate the situation may not be as serious as  the department suggested. However, Troy Wade, acting assistant secretary of  energy for defense programs, told the paper that the sales were small and that  the possible shortage was not exaggerated.  </P></p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Letter: Singapore aims to maintain competitiveness in face of western recession Sir, Your article 'Growth falls give Singapore an attack of economic angst' (September 16) is misinformed. Singaporeans do not 'watch as their old rival, Hong Kong, continues to grow rapidly'. Each year since 1988 Singapore has achieved higher growth and lower inflation than Hong Kong. This year Hong Kong expects growth of 5 per cent, the same as Singapore. The construction boom is due to the private sector rather than the government - the share of public sector projects fell from 80 per cent in 1987 to 48 per cent this year. The government is not pump-priming the economy 'by pouring money into the construction sector'; in fact it is considering postponing some of its projects until the industry cools down. Manufacturing output does not 'continue to fall'. While the sector contracted in the first half of 1992 (-0.4 per cent), it is now expanding, and full-year growth should be 2 per cent. Being a small open economy, Singapore never believed it could 'escape the effects of the recession in the west'. Hence, its emphasis on maintaining competitiveness. The strong exchange rate reflects investor confidence and has kept inflation low. Transportation, telecommunications and other business costs have remained stable. Wages have risen faster than productivity, but no more than in other newly industrialised economies. Measured against them our overall relative competitiveness is at the same level as in 1986. Commentating on the Singapore economy is not at all hazardous, but anyone leaking or receiving confidential official data does so at his own risk. GDP growth estimates are classified secret until they are properly released, because they are price sensitive information. Journalists or financial analysts who obtain or use them without authorisation will be dealt with according to the law.

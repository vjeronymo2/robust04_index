On the same day, OPM published a notice (58 FR 45558) that included Runzheimer's ``Report to OPM on Living Costs in Selected Nonforeign Areas and in the Washington, DC Area, May 1993.'' In response to the proposed regulations and notice, OPM received comments from nearly 250 persons. An analysis of the comments follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> General Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> One commenter stated that OPM did not comply with provisions of the Treasury, Postal, and General Government Appropriations Act 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;141) as these provisions apply to COLA. This law requires that OPM study living cost issues and submit to Congress a report on possible changes in the COLA methodology. The report is due March 1, 1995. The commenter believes that the law directs OPM to make changes in the COLA model before 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM's General Counsel carefully reviewed Pub. L. 102&hyph;141 and the related Senate Appropriations Committee report. The General Counsel determined that the law has two requirements: (1) COLA rates may not be reduced through December 31, 1995, and (2) OPM must submit a report to Congress on possible changes to the COLA methodology. The law does not direct OPM to implement methodological changes at this time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Senate Committee, however, requested that OPM research specific methodological issues. This OPM is doing, and OPM plans to include the results of this research in its report to Congress. Although the law does not require OPM to implement changes, OPM will continue to make improvements in the COLA methodology as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter said that OPM regulations should describe in greater detail the COLA model and survey. The commenter also stated that all of the data collected should be made public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPM believes that its COLA regulations are adequately detailed and that any attempt to subject the COLA survey process to a set of overly detailed and inflexible rules would impair rather than improve the COLA program. The flexibility results in a more accurate COLA model because improvements can be made from one year to the next. Such changes are made public because, before COLA rates are adjusted, OPM publishes in the Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a detailed report on the survey methodology and results. Therefore, employees have the opportunity to comment on any changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

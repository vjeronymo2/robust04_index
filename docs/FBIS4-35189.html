The Palestinian Statistics Center  <H5>  Preamble </H5>   Palestinian Authority is established today on the liberated  Palestinian soil in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area, declaring  the end of long years of suffering and pain experienced by the  Palestinian people as a result of occupation and displacement  and long years of coercion inside the homeland and alienation in  exile. Despite occupation and displacement, this great people  have not surrendered or relinquished their rights. They  resisted and struggled one generation after another for their  freedom, independence, and repatriation to their homeland. They  offered thousands of martyrs such as ['Izz-al-Din] al-Qassam,  Hasan Salamah, and the prince of martyrs Abu-Jihad [Khalil  al-Wazir], and thousands of prisoners and wounded to regain  their usurped rights. Throughout the years of struggle, this  people have adhered to their national unity under occupation and  in the diaspora.    This struggle and its various tools -- armed struggle,  political struggle, and brave intifadah -- as well as this firm  national unity constituted the real lever to regain the people's  rights. This struggle led to recognizing our people, their  leadership, and political framework, the PLO, the representative  of the Palestinian people, whose cause has become the cause of  the age. Consequently, world countries and organizations  recognized the legitimacy of this people's struggle and right to  independence and repatriation.    Our people have always believed in regaining their rights  through a just peace that can achieve security and peace for all  people in the region. In 1939, a nonsectarian democratic state  plan was proposed; in 1974, a independent Palestinian state plan  was proposed; and the Palestinian peace plan was presented on 15  November 1988. However, others rejected the participation of  our people and their legitimate representative.    When the opportunity arose, our people and their leadership  did not hesitate to join the Madrid peace process that produced  the principles signed in Washington 13 September, 1993. Now that  the Gaza-Jericho agreement -- the first executive agreement of  the Declaration of Principles -- has been signed, the first step  toward the implementation of the peace project begins by  implementing the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and  the establishment of the Palestinian authority on this dear part  of Palestine. We thus confirm the return of Palestine to the  political map of our region and the world and the beginning of  the process of regaining the rights of the Palestinian people on  their land.    The Palestinian authority will work toward the step-by-step  realization of the legitimate Palestinian aims -- independence,  freedom, equality, and repatriation -- through negotiation and  the peace process.    This will be realized through a commitment to the full  implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord and its development by  entering the second phase as quickly as possible, beginning by  settling what has not been decided in the agreement regarding  the Jericho area and some areas of the Gaza Strip and by the  early empowerment of the Palestinian Authority on the  Palestinian territory in the West bank and then by convening the  four-side committee in order to open the door for the return of  those who were displaced after June, 1967 and for completing the  interim period agreement that would bring about a total Israeli  withdrawal from all the cities, villages, and camps of the West  Bank, and electing the legislative council, and finally opening  negotiations on the final status within the shortest possible  period, as called for by the Declaration of Principles.    Our stand at the latest negotiations was absolutely clear.  For us, these negotiations were the right way to bring about  the full withdrawal from the territories conquered by Israel in  1967, the establishment of an independent Palestinian state,  with Jerusalem as its capital, and the termination of settlement  building in the West Bank and Gaza as it was ended in Egypt's  Sinai in implementation of UN resolutions, especially  Resolutions 242 and 338, and to find a comprehensive and just  solution to the Palestinian refugee problem in accordance with  UN Resolution 194.    Until all that is accomplished through negotiation and in  phases, we stick to the territorial integrity of the Gaza Strip  and the West Bank. We will also not allow any tampering with  the status of the integrity of this Palestinian territory. We  will also reject any interpretation of the postponement of the  final status of Jerusalem that would allow the occupation  authorities to change the physical or demographic status through  illegal settlement activities or the continuing development and  isolation of the Arab city of Jerusalem and its people. We  emphasize the Arab and Palestinian identity of Jerusalem as an  integral part of the West Bank in line with UN resolutions and  the stands of all the nations of the world that refuse to  recognize the illegal annexation of Jerusalem by the state of  Israel.    The Palestinian authority will work to realize that  principle  in all its work plans, until the final status of Jerusalem is  negotiated in the coming stage.    We understand the letter and spirit of the Declaration of  Principles agreement and the Gaza-Jericho agreement in light of  the Israeli policy known to us; namely, that settlement activity  is to be frozen during the interim period and that settlers will  not be permitted to muscle their way into Palestinian land  carrying their weapons to duplicate the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre  and other such atrocities. We also understand settlement  activity founded on occupation and the confiscation of land to  be a racist phenomenon that will be phased out ahead of its  complete elimination through peaceful means.    We understand clearly that the agreement that has been  signed creates new conditions in which the Israeli occupation  will never return to our liberated land. We also understand  that this is an irreversible march and that this march should  continue to move forward.    We also understand the agreement to be the road to real  peace  between the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, and to full  security for both peoples. It is also the means for realizing  justice, prosperity, and welfare for all countries of the  region, and is a prelude to Israeli withdrawal from all occupied  Arab territories, and to a just and comprehensive Arab-Israeli  peace on all fronts.    As we ask the Israeli Government to commit itself to  continue  its implementation of the agreement as soon as possible and to  go ahead in its withdrawal and dismantling of settlements, we  are also fully committed to what the PLO -- the representative  of all of the Palestinian people -- committed itself in this  agreement, the Declaration of Principles, the messages of mutual  recognition between the PLO and Israel, and all commitments  emanating from these agreements. We are also committed to  anything that achieves peace and security for the Palestinian  and Israeli people, and to resolving all our current and future  conflicts through peaceful means as long as Israel is committed  to this.    We understand this agreement also as a tool to change the  situation of our people from occupation, constant oppression,  injustice, and impoverishment to quick economic development,  prosperity, dignity, and justice for all Palestinian citizens,  and to an effective and honest government, and safeguarding  their human rights.    In spite of all our expectations of a brilliant future for  our people, we are aware of the great responsibility we  shoulder. This agreement is a transitional and partial  agreement, and is a limited initial step that does not at all  represent the peak of our ambitions and aspirations of our  people. The implementation of this agreement will face several  difficulties. The occupation ruled militant Gaza Strip for 27  years, and left it in a very difficult situation. It has  usurped land, water, and resources. It has destroyed its  economy, establishments, and facilities. The Palestinian  Authority will shoulder the responsibility in a difficult Arab  and international situation in which aid diminished and the  burden increased.    The building of the Palestinian Authority is a laborious  endeavor. We should depend only on ourselves and the creative  capabilities of our people and their readiness to offer endless  sacrifices. We should remind that construction after struggle  requires sacrifices and efforts, and that dangers facing our  march require the participation of all sons of our people in  shouldering the responsibility and leading the Palestinian ship  to safe shores. This requires further national unity, rallying  behind the PLO, and ensuring the participation of the  Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza, and abroad regardless of  their current nationalities or present location.    The Palestinian Authority is aware that it should be a model  in its actions, based on democratic principles, the rule of law,  respect for rights and basic liberties, including the freedom to  worship, political and ideological pluralism, and equality  between man and woman.    The Palestinian Authority should follow an open and  responsible system, and carry out its task under popular  supervision. It should commit itself to the principle of  effective participation, mobilization of qualified cadres,  building of establishments, human development based on an  integrated system that guarantees honesty, efficiency and work  development.    Our confidence in our people is limitless and is the  foundation on which the Palestine of tomorrow will be built.  Our people can give to their homeland Palestine under freedom  and independence the same amount of effective contribution in  construction and development they have given, together with  their Arab brothers, in all countries.    The Palestinian Authority also stresses the Arab and  Palestinian identity of our people in the Galilee, the Triangle,  and the Negev. It views their steadfastness on their land and  insistence on their right to citizenship and full equity and  adherence to the homeland a bridge that links them to their  people under the canopy of peace which we are now starting to  implement between Palestine and Israel.    Our Palestinian people will never forget the virtuous  martyrs  of the Arab nation who sacrificed their lives for the sake of  Palestine. Nor will it forget the suffering of the neighboring  Arab states that resulted from the Israeli occupation and the  Arab nation's fostering of Palestine and its people during their  diaspora and suffering under occupation.    The Palestinian Authority underlines its commitment to the  Arab nature of Palestine and its affiliation to the Arab nation,  the Arab-Islamic culture, and the varied heritage of the  heavenly messages, which consider Palestine a sacred land. It  pledges to protect the freedom of worship and the exercise of  faith and religious rites for all without any discrimination.    The new Palestine under the Palestinian Authority will  proceed from its civilization, religious, and cultural roots.  It will be open to this world and committed to its charters,  chief of which are the UN Charter, the Arab League Charter, and  the conventions on human rights.    As long as occupation remains on part of our territory, the  Geneva Conventions and the Hague Treaty should apply since they  are the tools of the international law to protect the peoples  under occupation. The international legitimacy, and  particularly UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, will  remain the basis for all future negotiations.    The special relations between Palestine and the neighboring  Arab states, particularly Jordan and Egypt, require a special  policy which will be translated by the Palestinian Authority  into political and economic cooperation agreements to embody and  strengthen these special relations.    In implementation of this declared policy, the Palestinian  Authority is hereby declaring to the masses of our Palestinian  people its working program for the future phase to win their  support, backing, and participation in implementing these  objectives in this important phase of our people's life.  <H5>  Nature and Definition of the Authority; Its Powers and </H5> Method of Action    --The Authority shall be formed by a decision from the PLO,  the Palestinian people's sole legitimate representative.

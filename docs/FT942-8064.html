			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / International Press Review: Saudis hope to set up oil refineries Saudi Arabia will send a delegation to China soon to explore new investment opportunities in oil refining and exploration following last week's visit to Beijing by Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister. China's official Business Weekly reported that the Saudi mission would visit Lianyungang, a port city in northern Jiangsu province, and Dagang in Tianjin on the Bohai gulf south-east of Beijing to investigate new projects. The newspaper quoted Mr Nazer, who was on his first visit to China, as saying that Saudi Arabia hopes to establish refineries to meet Chinese domestic needs and to ensure a 'stable, long-term supply of crude oil'. The Saudis are proposing to take a 45 per cent stake through Aramco, their state oil company, in a 200,000 b/d refinery to be located near Qingdao in Shandong province, north of Shanghai. Other partners include South Korea's Ssangyong and Chinese organisations. China, which last year produced 143.7m tonnes of oil, has become a net importer in the past 12 months. It is looking to the Gulf states to help overcome a growing shortfall as the Chinese economy continues its rapid growth. Mr Nazer, who was a guest of China National Petroleum Corporation, reportedly discussed with China's President Jiang Zemin several oil projects in which the Saudis may become involved. Mr Jiang was quoted as saying that he would support Mr Nazer's proposals and 'help forge agreements as soon as possible'. The Saudi minister said his country expected to set up joint venture refineries in China, similar to those it has established in the US, South Korea and the Philippines.</p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Arabs back UAE in island row with Iran IRAN yesterday responded angrily to a claim by Arab League foreign ministers that its presence on the disputed island of Abu Musa threatened peace in the region, Our Middle East Staff reports. Mr Amr Moussa, Egypt's foreign minister, said after a meeting of the 21-member Arab League that Iran's continued presence on the island in the Gulf was a 'dangerous development' and urged Iran to review its position there. But Mr Morteza Sarmadi, an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, said the Arab stance was irresponsible. The Abu Musa dispute flared last month when Iran, which maintains a garrison on the island and shares its oil revenues with Sharjah, one of the UAE's seven emirates, turned back a boatload of foreigners, most employed by the UAE. Abu Musa and two nearby islands, the Greater and Lesser Tumbs, have been in Iranian hands since 1971 but are claimed by Ras al-Khaimah, another of the UAE's constituent emirates.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / International Company News: Harcourt Brace bid abandoned GENERAL Cinema, the holding company whose interests include retailing and entertainment, has terminated its tender offer for the publicly-held debt of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, the troubled US publishing and insurance group. It seems unlikely the Dollars 1.4bn bid by General Cinema for Harcourt will now proceed. Harcourt Brace junk bonds fell on Wall Street after the announcement, while the shares slipped Dollars  1/16 to Dollars . The offer was conditional on a successful tender offer by the bidder for at least 90 per cent of the five outstanding public debt issues. but despite several months of negotiations with bondholders, no agreement between General Cinema and the investors over the terms proved possible. The Massachusetts-based General Cinema has walked away from deals in the past - it last year dropped an offer to buy in a minority stake in Neiman Marcus, the US retailer, after stockholder resistance to the terms - and said yesterday that it was 'moving on to other acquisition possibilities'. Harcourt Brace, meanwhile, said it 'must now consider all its available alternatives'. The company made a net loss of Dollars 80.9m in 1990.</p>

An official from the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday  that each of the 900 million farmers in the country now pays 11  yuan ($1.3) less than before for various financial charges and  public duties imposed by government departments at various  levels.    Li Xiangang, official with the department of rural  co-operative economy under the Ministry of Agriculture said,  "That is a direct result of a series of measures taken by the  central government last year to reduce burdens on farmers."    In an interview yesterday, Li said the information came from  a just-completed nationwide inspection made by his team on the  implementation of the central government's policy.    Prompted by increasing complaints and discontent in the  country's rural areas about the growing levies, which required  cash payment or labour contributions from farmers, the central  government has since last year cancelled 43 non-agricultural  public duties and abolished 37 charges borne by rural residents.    Those decades-old duties, previously imposed by different  ministries and departments under the central government,  included a variety of communal projects, such as training of  militia, rural public security, housing land charges, rural film  and TV relay services, rodent control, subsidies for rural  doctors, and the construction and development of social welfare  projects and facilities.    All these projects demanded farmers to offer either labour  or  money, resulting in excessive burdens on farmers and disruption  of normal agricultural production, the official said.    The State Council had earlier stipulated that a farmer  should  not have to pay more than 5 per cent of his annual income as  taxes or duties to the central and local governments.    But a survey early last year showed that farmers in  one-third  of the country's provinces municipalities and regions had been  forced to cough up 10 per cent or more of their annual income  for special assessments.    The complaints from farmers about these improper practices  flooded into the central government as they were too heavy for  farmers to bear.    The State Council set up a special inspection team last  September with members from five ministries to conduct a survey  of more than 2,000 rural households in 18 provinces.    Now more than a half of China's provinces, municipalities  and  regions have issued decrees or regulations, or set up  supervision, auditing and budget systems, to control the  imposing of these burdens on farmers, he added.    But he pointed out the central government's policies have  not  been well carried out in some areas and some cases of excessive  levies still exist.</p>

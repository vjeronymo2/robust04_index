			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of Computers in Finance (3): Still room for enhancement - Wholesale banking systems It is easy to take electronic links between the global banking community for granted. The sheer scale of automated payments make these transactions appear commonplace. The UK's Clearing House Automated Payments System (Chaps) handles Pounds 90bn worth of payments every day. These payments are settled on a daily basis, with the danger of one participant being unable to honour a transaction termed settlement risk. The idea of failure in such a system seems faintly ludicrous. Chaps has processed up to 76,000 items in one day - the very extent of computerised transactions lends the whole system a clinical air, but there is still room for improvement, and Chaps has commissioned systems house Logica to undertake a Pounds 3m enhancement of its service. The aim of this project is realtime gross settlement (RTGS). Chaps needs to move beyond a reconciliation of accounts at the close of trading and into RTGS. This prevents a payment instruction going through unless the sender has funds or central bank backing to cover the transaction. Logica wrote the original gateway software that translates Chaps messages into a suitable form for the network. Now its consultants are moving UK banks to RTGS while Chaps continues normal operations. 'It's an evolutionary change that should be implemented by the end of 1995,' says Eric Sepkes, a director of the Chaps governing body and London-based vice-president with Citibank. Mr Sepkes identifies the policy of building on an existing system as a Chaps strategy - 'the whole idea is not to start from scratch,' he says. RTGS migration is one obvious path for electronic settlement systems across the globe. But other striking trends are emerging in the international financial messaging market. The Royal Bank of Scotland joined forces with Banco Santander, Credit Commercial de France and Portugal's Banco de Comercio e Industria in 1991. Together they launched the Interbank Online System (Ibos), described by the participants as a virtual banking association. Ibos links the customer networks of the participating banks without reference to existing financial infrastructures. John Bertrand, managing director of Ibos, is blunt about the motivation for the Pounds 5m project. Existing structures were not up to the job, he says - 'the old method involved a flow of payments through the correspondent banks. There would usually be four banks involved in passing on one transaction.' Ibos has been perceived as a challenge to worldwide Swift international funds transfer system. Mr Bertrand is not too worried by that perception - 'Ibos is different from Swift: we don't compete directly because Ibos has evolved to the next level. Swift is a hub-based system with technology dating from the 1970s. Ibos allows users to send a message direct, wherever they want.' This simple function flies in the face of traditional wholesale banking practice, where payments would be passed down through the network. While Swift's system enjoys worldwide acceptance it is dependent on this heritage of correspondent banks. Ibos used network expertise from British Telecom and computers from Digital Equipment for the initial phase of operations. In January this year the US computer services giant Electronic Data Systems (EDS) joined Ibos. The Royal Bank of Scotland's own IT staff were able to integrate the first incarnation of Ibos. But EDS made its reputation by managing other people's technology in a cost-efficient manner. By calling in the experts, the Ibos partners have tacitly admitted that they need help in expanding the network. EDS will certainly provide vital technical credibility as Ibos trawls for more subscribers willing to pay the Pounds 50,000 entrance fee plus another Pounds 48,000 for annual hardware and software rental. Royal Bank of Scotland has moved its traffic off the Swift system and claims a cost-saving of 23 per cent on cross border transactions. The use of third parties to handle the nuts and bolts of technology is an established practice in banking. Outsourcing IT contracts is big business, and the market for outsourced corporate telecoms in Europe is estimated at Dollars 11.7bn by 1997. Financial institutions will take up a large slice of this lucrative trade, and some players are diversifying from the money markets into data manipulation. MW Marshall is one of the world's largest money brokers. Since September 1992, it has operated a wholly-owned subsidiary, Saturn Global Networks (SGN), that flashes critical financial communications around the globe for over 50 clients. SGN targets medium-sized banks that require their own secure network for voice and data transmission but are not willing to pay for a huge in-house project. SGN delivers computer intelligence in the form of local processors and appropriate communications software. 'Integration of voice and data is what the market wants,' says Peter Hase, SGN business development manager. Hase and his colleagues deliver that capability while the banks stick to their core activity. It is a healthy reaction to the heady days of the 1980s when banks became preoccupied with IT and telecoms strategies. Julian Wood works with City financial and training consultancy Profile - his experience of working on ambitious IT projects within commercial banks during the 1980s has convinced him that too many institutions still go in at the deep end when investing in IT. 'A lot of banks haven't really learnt the lessons of the last decade,' he says. 'They still put money into huge, 'inter-galactic' systems meant to cure all ills. What they don't do is get the planning cycle right. They should either take a long-term view, and accept that there will be hiccups and changes to the specification en route. Or they should only invest in short-term projects.' The rise of operations like Ibos and the demand for services offered by SGN suggest that a lot of institutions are getting out of Wood's overblown 'inter-galactic' projects. Logica's enhancements to Chaps will add a new dimension to the banking capability without a wholesale redesign of the core system. Electronic networks are now part-and-parcel of commercial banking and many subscribers are learning that the smaller, less ambitious advances offer the most gain.</p>

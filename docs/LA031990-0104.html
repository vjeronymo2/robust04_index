			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> TOKYO STOCK MARKET PLUNGES TO ITS THIRD-LARGEST DAILY LOSS  </P> <P> Panic selling spurred by a strong U.S. dollar swept through the Tokyo Stock  Exchange today, sending the major index tumbling to its third-largest daily  loss, as individual and institutional investors dumped stocks across the board.  </P> <P> The blue-chip Nikkei Average of 225 selected issues, which fell 55.20 points  Friday, plunged 1,353.20 points, or 4.15%, to 31,263.24 -- for its lowest  closing level in more than a year.  </P> <P> The broader-based Tokyo Stock Exchange Price Index of all major listed shares  fell 92.98 points to 2,326.23.  </P> <P> "Everyone has given up on the market," said Hidetada Yoshida, general manager  of the equity trading department of Kidder, Peabody.  </P> <P> Yoshida said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. had a large impact on the market,  selling an estimated 70,000 shares of Nikkei Average stocks.  </P> <P> "This is more serious than Black Monday," Yoshida said, "because the October,  1987, crash was due to Wall Street's weakness, but Tokyo's plunge is due to  weak fundamentals."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mikael Holmstrom: "Loopholes in Export Control </F> Eliminated"]    [Excerpt] The government will today decide to propose  export controls for advanced Swedish civilian technology.    For 45 years such state control of Swedish strategic goods  was contrary to the neutrality policy, but is now being  implemented as an adjustment to an altered surrounding world.    A bill with a legislative proposal lies ready on the  government's table for adoption Thursday [24 March]. The new law  is called the Law on Strategic Products.  <H5>  Last Loophole Eliminated </H5>   With that, the last loophole in Swedish export control is  being eliminated.    Previously, it has not been possible to halt export of  Swedish-manufactured civilian technology that can also be used  for military purposes, such as data systems or ships, by legal  means.    In the new law export of this so-called dual use, Swedish  technology is being added to the existing legislation for  missile and rocket technology, substances for biological and  chemical weapons, nuclear technology, and advanced technology  controlled abroad.  <H5>  Strategic Goods </H5>   This is being done by expanding the existing Law on  Prohibition of Export of Products Usable for Purposes of Mass  Destruction to become a universal law for strategic goods.    The high-technology ordinance, which the Palme government  introduced in 1986 after several incidences of smuggling and  pressure from the United States, will thus be superseded and  abolished; it only covers foreign advanced technology.    It is proposed that the War Materials Inspectorate should be  given greater resources and comprehensive responsibility for  control and export licenses based on the new law.    Henceforth the Customs Office, which today issues certain  export permits, will only devote itself to control. If the  number of cases becomes too large for the War Materials  Inspectorate, in a later phase they could be given over to the  Board of Commerce.    With this bill Sweden will acquire the same export controls  as the NATO countries, which since 1949 have cooperated on a  technology embargo against the East bloc. This has taken place  under the leadership of the United States in Cocom [Coordinating  Committee for Multilateral Export Controls], a child of the Cold  War, which began its activity in deepest secrecy in Paris in  1949.  <H5>  Top Secret </H5>   An informal and top-secret Swedish cooperation was in  existence between 1950 and 1967 and after the mid-1980's. Not  until 1992 did Sweden officially establish contacts with Cocom,  at the same time as the countries in the former East bloc.  [passage omitted]</p>

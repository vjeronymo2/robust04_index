			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Regional bias 'hampers R &amp; D' The UK's poor record in research and development in recent years, relative to its main competitors, is partly attributable to the overwhelming concentration of R &amp; D activity in south east England, says a report published yesterday. This concentration leads to poaching of workers, creates skill shortages and fuels wage inflation, says the report by Newcastle University's Centre for Urban and Regional Development Studies. It says that the government's 'free-market' approach to the funding of R &amp; D is a factor in the creation of this regional imbalance. Tackling the UK's poor R &amp; D performance is central to addressing its decline as a manufacturing economy, says the report. It says the UK experience contrasts with that of other European Union countries, where governments have developed policies to regionalise R &amp; D activity by building on industrial clusters. It advocates that the UK government creates a strong regional dimension to R &amp; D policy by setting up regional technology teams, or task forces, to promote research networks with a clear sectoral focus, linking small- and medium-sized businesses with universities and big companies with significant R &amp; D resources. The task forces' immediate role would be to sponsor research, policy and analysis and sectorally-sensitive R &amp; D initiatives. The report, produced for the north east-based Trade Union Studies Information Unit, says that among European countries, the US and Japan, only in the UK did the proportion of gross domestic product spent on R &amp; D decline in the 1980s. There was also a marked shift from public to private R &amp; D financing, with public sector expenditure concentrated on defence-related activities. The report was sparked by a recent spate of heavy job losses in the north east, concentrated in highly skilled craft, technical and scientific grades. The report says such jobs are those which the region can least afford to lose. It questions whether the current emphasis on diversification of the regional industrial base through inward investment, such as Samsung's recently announced Pounds 450m electronics complex for Teesside, is addressing underlying structural problems. Mr Andy Pike, one of the authors of the report, said: 'You can see Samsung as a great success, or a confirmation of the north east's role in Europe as a low-cost assembly location.'

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: ANA launches restructuring plan All Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest carrier by turnover, yesterday announced a long-awaited restructuring plan designed to increase operating profits by Y26bn (Dollars 239m) in 1994-95. ANA made post-tax profits of Y2.4bn on sales of Y808bn during the year to March 1993. ANA said turnover should be boosted by transferring about 20 per cent of planning and administrative staff to sales and marketing positions. No decisions had been made about new routes, acquisition of new aircraft and capital investment, it added. The plan includes a 10 per cent reduction in staff through reduced recruitment, natural attrition, and the introduction of contract employees for some cabin positions. The company expects to have trimmed the workforce by 1,500 by March 1996. It stressed there would be no compulsory redundancies. Mr Seiji Fukatsu, president and chief executive, said: 'The global slump in demand for air travel, continued recession at home and increased competition, have left ANA facing the toughest challenge since its foundation.' The company said it expected turnover to fall during the 12 months to March by 3 per cent to Y782bn, and was cautiously optimistic about keeping in the black. Separately ANA announced the conclusion of a deal with its rival, Japan Air Lines, to co-operate in a number of areas, including maintenance facilities for the Boeing 777 jets the two companies are buying. This is the first time the two companies, which have been fierce competitors, have formed a major alliance on technical matters and reflects the growing need each faces to cut costs in the face of the industry slump. The agreement is expected to save Y8bn to Y9bn over a five-year period, the companies said. Both JAL and ANA are undergoing cost-cutting exercises in an effort to reduce their high costs which have damaged their competitiveness amid the slump in business and first class air travel, particularly among Japanese leisure and business travellers. Under the agreement, the airlines will jointly purchase parts for the Boeing 777, which will enter their fleets from 1997, as well as the Boeing 747 and 767. The two airlines will also co-operate in repairing parts and in the development and preparation of technical and staff training manuals, and will share hangar space and other technical facilities such as engine test cells they said. 'We're both in the same boat. We have huge inventories of spare parts and pay enormous rents for hangar space,' JAL said. The deal comes a week after JAL decided to pick the same Pratt &amp; Whitney engines as ANA for the 777.</p>

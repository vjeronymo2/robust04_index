			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Alliance of the Palestinian </F> Forces--place and date not given]    [Text] In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate.    The Alliance of the Palestinian Forces has held a meeting in  which it discussed the latest political developments given the  determination of 'Arafat and his team to plunge deeper into the  quagmire of the liquidatory Oslo-Washington agreement and to  make concession after concession in order to meet the Zionist  enemy leaders' conditions, the latest of which was 'Arafat's  declaration in Davos that he had no intention of establishing a  Palestinian state, but that he was working to establish a  confederation with Jordan.    On the occasion of the beginning of the 75th month of the  intifadah, which coincides with the arrival of the blessed month  of Ramadan, the Alliance of the Palestinian Forces extends its  greetings and appreciation to the sons of the brave intifadah,  who are stepping up their heroic deeds in the face of the  growing violence of the enemy's soldiers and its herds of  settlers. This is, in fact, a practical retaliation in order to  topple the Gaza-Jericho agreement and to continue and escalate  the intifadah against the invaders.    In light of these developments, the Alliance of the  Palestinian Forces assert that the Palestine question is not the  property of 'Arafat and his men and, therefore, he cannot do  with it whatever he wishes because it belongs to the Palestinian  people and their national forces, who reject liquidatory  solutions, and who struggle to achieve our people's goals of  repatriation, self-determination, and full national  independence. What 'Arafat says basically means an annexation  by Jordan of the partial self-rule authority, which is being  rejected by the overwhelming majority of the sons of our  Palestinian people.    This statement is aimed at reassuring the Zionist enemy.  'Arafat no longer speaks for or expresses the will of the  Palestinian people. Therefore, his opinions and positions are  no longer binding on our people.    The alliance again urges the sons of the Arab and Islamic  nations, as well as all the forces that love freedom and peace,  to take practical positions in support of our people's  legitimate rights and to put an end to the rampage of Zionism,  which uses the defeatism of 'Arafat and his team -- this only  represents a slight minority of our people inside and outside  the occupied homeland -- as a pretext to entrench its occupation  of the Palestinian and Arab territories.    The alliance urges the exposure of the United States' use of  double standards and the extension of all sorts of support to  the Zionist enemy in order to develop its military arsenal and  to consider the occupied Palestinian and Arab territories as  disputed territories.    The alliance will resolutely continue its policy to topple  the Oslo-Washington agreement, strip 'Arafat and his team of  their popular legitimacy, rebuild the PLO's institutions on  democratic bases, and secure every means to prolong and escalate  the brave intifadah and its unity under the banner of the  unified national and Islamic unity of the intifadah.

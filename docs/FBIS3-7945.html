			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Krzysztof Dobrowolski, director of the </F> Ministry of Ownership Transformations Gdansk Agency, by  correspondent Slawomir Lewandowski; place and date not given]    [Text] [Lewandowski] The Mass Privatization Program [PPP]  envisages simultaneous, quick, and inexpensive privatization of  several hundred large state enterprises. Shares issued by these  enterprises will be distributed among National Investment Funds.  The latter are devised as strong blocs of Polish capital groups  capable of competing effectively in the international arena.  How many state enterprises have so far declared their readiness  to join the PPP?    [Dobrowolski] At the moment there are two groups of  enterprises set up according to the relevant Council of  Ministers act. Together they represent more than 360 state  enterprises. Currently the Ownership Transformations Ministry is  completing the list of a third group of joint-stock companies  which also declare their willingness to take part in the  privatization program.    [Lewandowski] Shares issued by enterprises which want to  join the PPP will be handed over to the National Investment  Funds. What will happen then?    [Dobrowolski] The National Investment Funds will be faced  with the task of managing these shares and investing them  profitably. The shares will be distributed so that one  strategic investor will be allocated to each enterprise--or,  rather, one joint venture.    [Lewandowski] How many shares will one National Investment  Fund receive?    [Dobrowolski] Each National Investment Fund set up as a  strategic investor will get 33 percent of enterprises' shares.  The remaining funds will get 27 percent, and the rest, that is,  40 percent, will be allocated to joint ventures' employees and  to the State Treasury. A strategic investor, that is, a  National Investment Fund with 33 percent of shares in its  allocated company, will be obliged to encourage the company to  make profits that should be reflected in its shares. We should  note here that the form of this encouragement must be in keeping  with the regulations and provisions of the Commercial Code.  This means that the investors' proposed operations must be  approved by the company board. Strategic investors will also  help draft restructuring programs for their companies and assist  them in seeking credits in domestic and foreign markets.    [Lewandowski] Will the state act as a guarantor when  companies decide to apply for foreign credits?    [Dobrowolski] Probably not, because the National Investment  Funds will not be set up as state-owned funds. The reason for  this is that our enterprises--even the best ones--quite often  have no experience in handling complex operations in  international financial markets. So we are hoping to encourage  Western firms, which are perfectly familiar with the principles  of playing the financial market, to participate in our National  Investment Funds system.    [Lewandowski] Who will select the firms to be entrusted with  the task of managing their joint-stock companies?    [Dobrowolski] These matters will be decided by the Selection  Committee, which has already started its work. Those firms  which would like to participate in the Mass Privatization  Program have already submitted their applications, and the  Commission has begun to examine their cases.    [Lewandowski] Which firms from Gdansk and Elblag  Voivodships have declared their accession to the PPP?    [Dobrowolski] In Gdansk Voivodship we have the following:  the Gdynia Industrial Construction Company, the Elbud Gdansk SA  [joint-stock company] Power Engineering Construction Company,  the Bacutil SA Animal Feed Company, Elmor SA, MEAT SA, the  Lubiana SA China Tableware Products, and Metrix SA in Tczew. In  Elblag Voivodship we have the Elzam SA Production and Services  Company.    [Lewandowski] So how many National Investment Funds will you  create altogether?    [Dobrowolski] We estimate that we will set up about 20  National Investment Funds. It is impossible to be more precise  at this moment because the exact number will depend on the final  number of enterprises willing to join the national privatization  program.    [Lewandowski] Let us look at the question of the transfer of  enterprises' shares to the National Investment Funds. How can  you avoid a situation whereby the first funds to be set up will  select for themselves the best joint-stock companies, while the  rest will have to be satisfied with economically weak firms?    [Dobrowolski] That will not happen, because we are planning  to introduce a "points system" whereby each fund will be able to  "purchase" a given number of joint ventures with the set number  of points allocated to it. Thus the order in which the  available joint ventures will be chosen by individual funds will  be determined by random selection. In addition, the selection  of joint ventures will be carried out under the supervision of  the Antimonopoly Office, which will ensure that no monopolies  will be created in these circumstances.    [Lewandowski] So it looks likely that by the end of this  year every adult citizen of our country will be able to own  shares in the National Investment Funds, does it not? Even  though shareholders will not be given actual possession of their  shares, but will only be issued with share certificates  confirming that they are indeed shareholders. Will it be worth  holding on to these certificates for any length of time?    [Dobrowolski] I am convinced that it will.    [Lewandowski] But it is inevitable that some  shareholders--or, rather, certificate holders--will be forced by  circumstances to sell them.    [Dobrowolski] Certainly. The privatization program aims to  achieve a situation where everybody has an equal chance. And  that is what will happen. However, it will be difficult for us  to interfere in individual people's decisions about what they  want to do with their share certificates. In any case, the  Stock Exchange experience to date shows that it is certainly  worthwhile to own shares.    [Lewandowski] So, one year after the launch of the National  Investment Funds, our share certificates will be changed into  actual shares of the relevant joint ventures and will then be  eligible for Stock Exchange operations. Consequently, we will  be able to buy and sell them, and generally to "play" the Stock  Exchange with them, will we not? And, of course, the general  public will come to experience capitalism at first hand.    [Dobrowolski] That is precisely what we hope will happen.  Perhaps it will not be possible to sort out the whole question  smoothly in one go, but we can be sure that the public will  receive a sound lesson in economic education--certainly much  sounder than our present knowledge of the subject.    [Lewandowski] Will we be able to make money by buying and  selling those shares? After all, we know that quite a few of  our enterprises cannot be counted among economic giants....    [Dobrowolski] Of course. However, it is worth stressing  that access to the PPP will be open only to selected enterprises  which can guarantee a return of good profit. That is one of the  basic requirements of PPP membership.    [Lewandowski] Let us now consider the following question: I  have received, or else purchased, National Investment Fund share  certificates to the value of 10 percent of the average national  [monthly] wage. What should I do with them now?    [Dobrowolski] You can keep them for a while, and then  exchange them for shares in individual companies and wait until  their value goes up. You can also sell your share  certificates....    [Lewandowski] ...by trading outside the Stock Exchange?    [Dobrowolski] Yes.    [Lewandowski] But we do not have an established market in  stocks and shares outside the Stock Exchange yet. So I can  determine the price of my share certificate myself by selling it  to a friend?    [Dobrowolski] Yes, you can. Consequently, your certificate  will represent an independent market value outside the Stock  Exchange.    [Lewandowski] What about the employees of the budget-funded  sectors of the economy? Will they also receive share  certificates?    [Dobrowolski] There will be a certain difference there  because the employees of the budget-funded sector will receive  additional free share certificates--on top of the entitlement  due to all citizens, and chosen from selected funds--within the  terms of their compensatory pay uprating schemes. [Dobrowolski  ends]  <H5>  The Mass Privatization Program [PPP] Timetable </H5>   1993--End of third and beginning of fourth quarter:    Council of Ministers draws up the list of single-person  State  Treasury companies and state enterprises selected for  participation in Mass Privatization Program.    1994--First quarter:    Decision reached on results of international tender for  companies administering National Investment Fund assets;  competition for candidate National Investment Fund board members.    1994--First quarter:    Creation of National Investment Funds and appointment of  their board members.    1994--First quarter:    National Investment Funds sign agreements with their  administering companies.    1994--Second quarter:    Company shares transferred to National Investment Funds;    1994--End of third and beginning of fourth quarter:    Share certificates distributed.    1995--Second through third quarters:    National Investment Fund Shares announced at Stock Exchange.

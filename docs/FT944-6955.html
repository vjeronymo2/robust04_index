			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Try the rakia, but hang on to your head - Giles MacDonogh visits Bulgaria. He has a meal to remember with a retired cavalry officer and sees the problems of the country's wine industry There is something odd, not to say unsettling, about sitting in a restaurant in one of the more remote corners of old Europe and having the waitress bring you a bottle of wine on which the label says that it was bottled for the exclusive use of J Sainsbury, of Stamford Street, London, SE1. We Britons are familiar with Bulgarian wine now, but perhaps less aware of the turn of events which led to Britain becoming one of Bulgaria's prime markets. Bulgaria was designated a wine-producing state for the entire communist block under the Comecon agreement of the late 1940s. Until the arrival of Gorbachev, the Soviet Union provided its main market. Far from liberalising the Soviet state, one of Gorbachev's first moves was to ban drinking in the Communist Party. This resulted in an unexpected blow to Bulgaria's wine industry. Fortunately for the Bulgarians, their wines had begun to attract attention in certain western markets, notably Germany and Britain. From the mid-1980s onwards the best wines made their way west. By some curious irony, the kolkhoz system, which had destroyed the old peasant vineyards on the hillsides and brought the vines down on to the productive (but not nearly so promising) plains, proved a boon to British supermarket buyers. Here was a chance to purchase huge quantities of cheap, decent quality wines for their branches. The price they paid was shoring up Zhivkov's regime with a little much-needed foreign capital. But at the time no one cared much about that. Attention was focused on South Africa. The success of this change of direction was short-lived. In 1989, Bulgaria underwent its own version of the Velvet Revolution. Privatisation plans, voted as early as August 1991, were finally enacted in the course of the following year. Land was to be given back to those who had owned it in 1947 (or their heirs). Many of the wineries had been constructed by the state, but some had not and in those cases there was a good deal of chicanery about giving them back; but, at the time of writing, a third are already in private hands. Confusion reigns. Not least because of the uncertainty engendered by the probable return of the communists (now disguised as the Bulgarian Socialist Party) in the December elections. In the two years following the privatisation decree, more than 5m Bulgarians, from a population of just 8.5m, have become property owners. Political commentators say the BSP will not be able to proceed against this new property-owning class without bloodshed, they will, however, try to slow down the pace of privatisation. They will also direct business to the state-owned wineries rather than the new private ones. In many areas the vines themselves are in a lamentable state. Already in the 1980s declining production meant that whole vineyards were left to die. Now the need to compensate the state for 'improvements' made to the land during the 40-odd communist years, has resulted in some people refusing to take back their land. They prefer to wait until the vines have died. That way the need to pay money to the state in compensation will be invalidated. If this process is allowed to continue it could mean that both state and private wineries will have problems putting their hands on grapes to satisfy their customers in the west. In the new private sector there is considerable interest in how the British buyers will jump. Will they continue to buy from the more efficient state-run wineries such as Russe on the Danube, or will they turn to the new private companies such as Lovico in Suhindol? Konstantin Madjarov, who got his family winery in Stamboliiski back only months ago, is bitter about both the Bulgarian state and the western buyers. The new regime has proved itself uninterested in agriculture and his impression is that the west has no desire to see the development of private wine production in Bulgaria. Foreign investment has so far been made in Hungary, Romania and Moldova, but not in Bulgaria. Madjarov may be right. The British buyers will almost certainly continue to buy where they may be assured of decent quality in sufficient quantity. In the meantime, the Bulgarians' old friends in Russia have come to the rescue. Yeltsin's land is not the sober place it was under Gorbachev and demand from Russia is high. The trouble is that they only buy cheap wine. Driving back from Plovdiv to Sofia I could still make out the old south-facing terraces where the best grapes were grown before 1947. The thought of replanting these good sites filled me with a mild optimism. I found something of the same spirit among Sofia's leading political scientists. They pointed out that Bulgaria was in the throes of a social revolution comparable to that which took place in France two centuries ago. A new social class has come into being. One of them asked me if I had noticed the hordes of horses and donkeys which now clutter up the Bulgarian roads: 'The old communists hate them; they see them as a return to pre-modern times. This is not true: the donkey is the first step to independence.' The same peasant-farmer who invests in a donkey will look after his newly acquired vines, and who knows? Maybe one day his son will stop taking the grapes to the co-operative and make the wine himself? It was a cheering argument and one which continued in a local Sofia restaurant over a bottle of Young Vatted Merlot (bottled exclusively for Safeway).</p>

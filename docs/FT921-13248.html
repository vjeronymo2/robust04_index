			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / Arts: History in the making - Television The idea of this column was to express a few straightforward thoughts about history on television because there is, as you may have noticed, a lot of it about. On Mondays we get Voices From The Past showing travel films which 'reflect the ideas and attitudes of an earlier age', last week the 1947 voyage of the Passat, one of the last of the working square riggers. Sure enough, as well as some wonderful pictures there were some pretty old fashioned ideas such as that busy-busy 'let's be jolly' music which used to fill every moment of the cinema newsreels when nobody was talking, and Duncan Carse described the bodies of the seamen as 'machine like in their precision and endurance'. Then, at the climax of the voyage when the mother and father of a storm broke over the ship, the commentary petered out and the viewer was left trying to work out what on earth was going on. Tuesdays have been bringing Brother Felix And The Virgin Saint, a fascinating account by Bamber Gascoigne of a 15th century trip by a German monk to Jerusalem and the Sinai desert. This has been an unusually entertaining series because of the way that Gascoigne and producer Douglas Rae have shown not only the differences between tourism in the 15th century and today (which you would expect) but also the amazing similarities (which you might not). Last week Gascoigne told us some of the rules for Christian pilgrims in mediaeval Jerusalem: don't give alcohol to Moslems, not because Islam forbids it but because they will get drunk and attack the next lot of pilgrims; don't paint your coat of arms on the monuments; and don't race one another to the next site. On Wednesday we had Timewatch, BBC2's regular history series which, this month, went back over the argument that arose after the Houses of Parliament burned down in 1834 and a new building was needed: should it be classical or gothic? This was not the clearest possible exposition of the debate, which has such obvious echoes today. I was never sure whether there was any possibility of the new building being constructed using the techniques exemplified by Crystal Palace and St Pancras Station rather than the classical or gothic style. Incidentally, having mentioned the 1947 music it should be noted that this Timewatch sometimes used music and speech simultaneously, a daft and self defeating yet increasingly widespread habit today. Wednesdays are also bringing Churchill, a four-part television biography written and presented by Martin Gilbert. The structure is wholly familiar: newsreels are interspersed with interviews, some from the archives and some shot specially. It seems remarkable how many of Churchill's staff are still around and still lively; they must have been considerably younger than he was. We are also treated to shots of the presenter posed in front of some empty room saying 'Here is where . . .' which does precious little for the viewer but doubtless pleased the production staff who presumably got some nice foreign trips. There are occasional amusements: the description of Churchill on the saluting base in north Africa when the surrendered German general came past in a smart uniform and splendid car but towed by a mule, and the two men caught one another's eyes and both began to laugh; and the moment when Churchill got out of the bath in the White House, urging Roosevelt to stay with the words 'The Prime Minister has nothing to hide from the President of the United States.' But generally it is a dry and dutiful account which seems to add little to what was known. It would make an excellent schools programme. It is pretty clear that all those mentioned so far are history programmes, and there are others about which there would probably be little argument: The Treaty, for example, although presented in the form of a two-hour drama, was actually another history programme, this time dealing with the partition of Ireland. It was a notable achievement for writer Brian Phelan and director/producer Jonathan Lewis who managed to make cross-table negotiation on the detailed drafting of a political document seem dramatic . . . which it is, no doubt, but making it seem so in a television drama is an impressive trick. The difficulty with reaching any broad conclusions about history on television arises when you start trying to decide what is not history. Sometimes the dilemma is not particularly important. For instance a programme which has recently begun on BBC2, The Day The World Changed, appears to be considered by its producers as a historical series but after watching the first two - with Steven Berkoff choosing the day when Herschel Grynszpan shot a German in Paris, and Liz Lochead the day when Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded (to be screened this evening) - I have my doubts. It seems clear that the presenters are being encouraged to make their approaches deeply personal and to 'come on strong', and the result is that the programmes convey more about their presenters than about their historical subjects. But what about the four-part documentary on The Falklands War on Channel 4? Watching this makes you realise that historiography is probably changing, and television is probably changing it. Throughout the whole of recorded history up to now a nation's perception of its own recent history has been inevitably nationalistic: the communications did not exist for it to be anything else. Now here is a series, produced by Denys Blakeway and Hugh Scully, which, just 10 years after the event, is proving to be everything that television news coverage at the time was not: broad ranging, carefully considered, with access to virtually all sources of information on both sides of the conflict at all levels. Monday's programme on what really happened over the sinking of the Belgrano included information delivered to the viewer by the captain of the British submarine, the captain of the Belgrano, the commanders of the Royal Navy in London and in the South Atlantic, members of the British war cabinet, and of the Argentine junta. That is not to say that we were given the whole truth (though it began to feel like most of it) but it is to say that we are in a better position to judge what was done in our name than, for instance, our forebears listening to fourth-hand hearsay evidence 10 years after the victory over the Spanish armada (most of our gratitude on that occasion being due to foul weather in the Channel, I believe). Yet many people would not even concede that The Falklands War is 'history' at all. Even among those who do, there will be many who would certainly draw the line at The Washington Version which, in programmes on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, gave a detailed and completely engrossing account of the planning and conduct of the the Gulf War as seen from a US standpoint. The Gulf War took place just 12 months ago: at what point do matters cease to be current affairs and begin to be history? In the end the only logical answer to that may be that anything which has happened is history and the rest is speculation. What seems so striking, as you watch not only hefty international stories about wars and other great events but also accounts of popular taste in the recent past (Paul Madden's investigation of The Avengers on Without Walls or the wickedly funny accounts of fashions in interior decoration in Signs Of The Times) or detailed descriptions of the development and use of particular vehicles (delightful programmes on the Morris 1000 and the Avro Shackleton in Perpetual Motion) is that, with history as with so many other subjects, television is telescoping the process of communication. The raw material of history is being delivered straight into the nation's sitting rooms.</p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SIMI VALLEY;  </P> <P> COURT CLOSED IN CHILD-SLAYING CASE  </P> <P> The Ventura County Superior Court judge presiding over the case of a man  charged with slaying an 8-year-old boy ordered his courtroom closed to the  public Thursday.  </P> <P> Behind closed doors, attorneys discussed a possible conflict of interest with  the public defender's office representing Gregory Scott Smith.  </P> <P> Judge Steven Z. Perren's order cleared the courtroom of all but the attorneys,  himself and a court stenographer.  </P> <P> Smith, 23, of Canoga Park was scheduled to be tried Jan. 8 on charges of  murder, kidnaping and arson in the March 23 death of Paul Bailly of Northridge.  Prosecutors have alleged that Smith abducted Paul from a day-care center at the  Darby Avenue Elementary School, gagged him with duct tape and strangled him,  then set the body afire in Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Jury selection was to continue Monday, but Perren said he would postpone it  until Jan. 8 and put off the trial so he could spend Monday handling the  matters that he discussed privately with attorneys this week.

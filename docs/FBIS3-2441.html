Premier Li Peng will open the annual session with a reading  of his government work report which will lay down the themes of  the congress and the government's main tasks for this year.    Li is expected to call for 9 percent economic growth this  year and an inflation rate below 10 percent, while he will push  forward reforms in the banking, financial and tax sectors,  Chinese sources said.    Much of Li's report is based on the decision by the Third  Plenum of the 14th Communist Party Congress last October to  construct a "socialist market economy," sources said.    The report is expected to address China's main economic  problems including inflation, high fixed asset investment and an  inefficient state sector, as well as other problems including  corruption and excessive bureaucracy.    Not much new is expected in the report, although Li will  announce new regulations on fixed assets investment and the  establishment of a state development bank to stabilize the  funding of basic construction projects, well-placed sources said.    Li will also announce a plan for reappropriating funds  raised  by state-run enterprises for infrastructure projects to help pay  for the bankruptcy of inefficient enterprises and displaced  workers, the sources said.    The report will briefly praise the work done in 1993 in  nearly every area of government including, propaganda, science  and technology, culture, health and education, while laying down  the work outline in these areas for 1994.    Li will stress that continued economic development will need  a stable social environment and call on all levels of government  to safeguard social order and fight corruption in government.    On foreign policy, the premier is not expected to harshly  criticize the British handling of issues concerning Hong Kong,  but in a veiled reference to the U.S. he will staunchly  maintain that China will refuse to accept any form of hegemony  or power politics, sources said.    On Friday, Chen Jinhua will give his report on the  implementation of national economic and social development and  submit his draft plan for 1994, while Finance Minister Li  Zhongli will report on the 1993 and 1994 state budgets.    During the congress, the 2,970 deputies will later debate,  amend and approve the reports along with reports from the  Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procurator and the  NPC Standing Committee.</p>

			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Walesa seeks powers to choose cabinet members PRESIDENT Lech Walesa of Poland signalled yesterday he is intent on installing a cabinet of his own choosing and broadening his executive powers. This would mean dropping the centre-right minority government headed by Mr Jan Olszewski. The president said on the main evening TV news yesterday that he needed 'the means to act effectively' and that he was now convinced the country had to have a 'cabinet of professionals which transcended party divisions.' He added this would mean 'greater powers for the president' in a system modelled on the French constitution, 'where the prime minister answers to the president.' Mr Walesa, who was elected president at the end of 1990, is looking to rising discontent to propel his drive to dominate the executive and parliament. However, he will need a majority in parliament to make the necessary constitutional changes. This might be difficult as the MPs may well unite to resist Mr Walesa's demands. Poland's constitution has the prime minister and his cabinet answering to parliament, with the president merely responsible for nominating the premier.</p>

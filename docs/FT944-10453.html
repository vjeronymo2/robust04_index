			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI discusses sale of sensors business to Racal Thorn EMI, the music and rentals company, is in discussions with Racal Electronics over the sale of its defence sensors businesses. No price has been disclosed, but the businesses, based at Crawley, West Sussex and Wells, Somerset, had turnover of about Pounds 75m last year. The division employs 1,140 people. Its main products are specialised radars, such as the Cymbeline weapon-locating radar, electronic counter-measures equipment and command and control systems for land forces. Thorn is in detailed discussions with Thomson of France over the sale of its defence group business, which does not include the sensors operations. The defence group's turnover is about Pounds 80m and its main activities are fuses and electro-optics equipment. Thorn has also sold its electronic security business. If both the defence and sensors sales are completed, it will only be left with its transaction ticketing operation outside its declared core areas. Preliminary discussions on the ticketing business are also taking place. Sir Colin Southgate, chairman, has said that the company will concentrate on its music production, music retailing and rental operations.</p>

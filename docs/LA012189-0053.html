			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMOCRACY'S BIG DAY -- JOY AND PAGEANTRY  </P> <P> The peaceful transfer of power in America -- what George Bush called  "democracy's big day" -- was celebrated Friday with moments of pageantry,  solemnity, joy and politics as tens of thousands crammed into the monumental  center of Washington to wait, jostle and crane for the barest glimpse of the  inaugural excitement.  </P> <P> On an extraordinary sunlit winter's day, with winds sending swirls and clusters  of cloud across the sky, President Bush made the wait worthwhile for thousands  of well-wishers by emerging from his new $600,000 limousine three times during  the inaugural parade, walking down Pennsylvania Avenue with his wife, Barbara,  at his side.  </P> <P> Clutching Mrs. Bush's hand, the new President, hatless but wearing a gray  overcoat and scarf in the sometimes biting wind, waved happily to the crowds  who cheered in return and then shouted, "No, no, no," whenever nervous Secret  Service bodyguards succeeded in ushering the Bushes back into the limousine  with the "USA-1" license plates.  </P> <P> "Did you see him walking?" a woman cried out to her children at the corner of  Pennsylvania Avenue and 13th Street. "You got to see him and wave to him. All  right!"  </P> <P> Bush handled the mixed mood of the day -- the blending of happiness and history  -- with great ease and warmth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Few Minutes Late  </P> <P> He actually took his oath of office on the West Front of the Capitol a few  minutes late -- just after the noon hour set by the Constitution for the end of  the term of President Reagan. Perhaps to make up for the lost moments, Bush, a  hand on both the Bush family Bible and on the Bible used by President George  Washington at his inauguration 200 years ago, got ahead of himself in repeating  the oath, breaking in before Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist could finish  reading the first few words.  </P> <P> But Bush soon calmed, his serious features forming into a half-smile as the  oath neared its end and finally breaking into a full smile, practically a  happy, boyish grin, when it was over. Then, for the first time as President of  the United States, he heard a military band play "Hail to the Chief" in his  honor.  </P> <P> The power of the symbol of an American presidential inauguration was  demonstrated most clearly by 43-year-old Cynthia Levi of Chattanooga, Tenn. She  had shown up before dawn at 4:30 a.m. to become first in line for the standing  room at the foot of Capitol Hill. A Democrat, she explained simply: "I'm here  because he's our new President."  </P> <P> Other patient enthusiasts included Paul Gleason, a history teacher from  Lincoln, Ill., and his wife, Cheryl. "We're used to standing," he said. "This  is my fifth inauguration."  </P> <P> Levi and the Gleasons were joined later by more than 100,000 others --  including a group of seniors who spelled out the message, "Good Luck Mr.  President," with a single letter on each of their blue shirts. All crowded  beneath the hill to see and hear a distant figure of a new President take the  oath and then deliver his inaugural address.  </P> <P> In a departure from most inaugural addresses, Bush, who had attended a  non-televised service at St. John's Church on Lafayette Square across from the  White House in the morning, included a formal prayer in his own speech. Calling  it his first act as President, he prayed to the heavenly father to "write on  our heart these words: 'Use power to help people.' "  </P> <P> With five enormous flags hanging from the Capitol -- two copies of the 13-star  flags from the first days of the republic in 1789 and three modern 50-star  flags -- Bush stressed the continuity of American history.  </P> <P> George Washington, the President said, "would, I think, be gladdened by this  day. For today is the concrete expression of a stunning fact: our continuity  these 200 years since our government began."  </P> <P> In a message to schoolchildren watching the inauguration on television screens  in their classrooms, Bush said: "Thank you for watching democracy's big day."  </P> <P> The inaugural parade, led by Bush and a presidential honor guard, also linked  the new Administration with history, for inaugural parades have been a hallmark  of presidencies since Andrew Jackson on horseback led his followers down  Pennsylvania Avenue in 1829.  </P> <P> Almost 12,000 marchers, 54 bands, 79 floats and 457 horses took part in  Friday's parade along the 2.2-mile route between the Capitol and the White  House. For some it was old hat. Robert Auguste, a trumpeter for the Connecticut  1st Company Governor's Foot Guard, has marched in every parade since the John  F. Kennedy inauguration of 1961.  </P> <P> "You have to feel proud and patriotic because you're involved in it," said  Auguste, a 54-year-old plumber.  </P> <P> Some were obviously not supporters of Bush. Paul DiTeodoro, a 20-year-old  member of the Purdue University marching band, wore a badge under his uniform  supporting the defeated Democratic candidate for President, Gov. Michael S.  Dukakis of Massachusetts. But he was good-natured about his difference. "It's  better not to be too bitter about it," he said.  </P> <P> Some high school students muted their excitement somewhat. Jane McDonald, who  marched with Shawnee Mission Northwest High School of Kansas, said: "I like  George Bush and I'm glad I came. But it's kind of cold. . . . I hope we get to  go to the Super Bowl next year."  </P> <P> "We came because we want to see Bush," said 13-year-old Lauren Rubin of  Rockville, Md. "And so we could get out of school."  </P> <P> A number of protest signs cropped up along the parade route when President and  Mrs. Bush passed by. Some called on the new Administration to "Keep Abortion  Legal" and "Free Nicaragua." In one case of special pleading, followers of  Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., the political extremist recently convicted in a fraud  case, carried signs demanding: "Pardon LaRouche."  </P> <P> But the protesters, though accepted without rancor, were vastly outnumbered by  the cheerers and clappers along the parade route, including a large number who  chatted in Spanish to their children, pointing out the strolling Bushes to  them.  </P> <P> Although Mrs. Bush, wearing high-heeled shoes, often had to trot to keep up  with the President along Pennsylvania Avenue, she rarely fell behind during all  the many events of the day, chatting with friends, blowing kisses, waving,  flicking a speck off the cheek of an Episcopal minister outside St. John's  Church.  </P> <P> And there was little doubt about the affection for her. When the Bushes showed  up at church in the morning, some in the crowd of onlookers applauded Bush but  shouted, "Hey, Barbara," at her.  </P> <P> Donna Walbrecht of Alexandria, Va., attending only her first inauguration  despite living in the Washington area for 20 years, said that she had done so  partly because she liked the Bushes so much.  </P> <P> "Especially Barbara," she said. "She's marvelous. She's a grandma. I'm a  grandma. I say good for her."  </P> <P> Staff writers Melissa Healy, Marlene Cimons, Micheal Shear, Tom Redburn and  Brian Couturier contributed to this story.  </P></p>

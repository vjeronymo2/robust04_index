			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Technology: Counting on cellular customers Market research predictions in the UK mobile phone business have rarely borne relation to the eventual size of the business. With cellular radio in particular, pundits greatly underestimated the number of potential subscribers. With this in mind, Unitel, one of the licensees for personal communications networks (PCNs), which should begin services in 1993, has chosen a novel way of more accurately evaluating the market. 'All the research in the past has been based on what consumers think they will do,' points out Andy Sukawaty, Unitel's chief operating officer. 'But it's impossible to quantify what people will do just by asking them.' In addition, points out Sukawaty, research in the past has concentrated on how many people will buy portable phones, not on how many calls they will make. Instead of asking people what they intend to do Unitel selected some 400 potential domestic and small business users in three areas where the existing cellular radio was of high quality and gave each of them one of the latest hand portable cellphones. They then charged them for the subscription and calls as if they were PCN users. One of the most striking results of the survey was the number of users who, once the initial three-month trial was over, wanted to keep the phones - some 250 of them. As a result of the survey Unitel has concluded that the potential exists for 1.88m households in the UK to subscribe to PCN and a further 436,000 small businesses. Unitel also concluded that PCN would increase the usage of the phone generally. Before the trial began the customers spent an average 230 minutes on the phone every month, but that rose to 300 minutes a month with the mobile phone. Although the usage of the ordinary BT line went down to 200 minutes a month, Sukawaty points out that BT's revenues are likely to increase rather than decrease because most of the calls will use BT lines for part of the journey.</p>

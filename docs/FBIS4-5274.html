			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Okinawan Governor Masahide Ota's statement on 6 </F> April the crash of a USMC helicopter at Futenma Air Station]    [Text] The statement of Governor Masahide Ota is as  follows:    I have not yet fully been informed of the details of the  accident, but I am greatly frustrated with repeated accidents by  U.S. Forces. My impression is that the increase in accidents is  part of a sequence caused by U.S. defense budget cuts. If so, I  cannot help feeling great fear about the recurrence of such  accidents. The U.S. Forces say their training must continue to  fulfill their duties defined in the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.  I am wondering if we cannot be free from the danger and  problems until the security treaty is scrapped.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Belarusian radio programs "Belaruskaya  Maladzyozhnaya" [Belarusian Youth] and "Krynitsa" [Spring] have  been suspended since 28 May. The publishing house "Belarusian  Printing House" refuses to print the newspaper SVABODA. Media  representatives issued declarations on the issues at a press  conference held on 30 May. In particular, the declarations  stated that employees of both radio programs were confronted  with the fact that, as a result of transforming the National  State Television and Radio Company into the Television and Radio  Committee of the Belarusian Council of Ministers, "Krynitsa" and  "Belaruskaya Maladzyozhnaya" are merged -- or virtually closed  -- and will be replaced by the Main Broadcasting Editorial  Office to be established of the Second Radio Channel.    As a matter of fact, this transformation can be seen as a  move to get rid of politically inconvenient journalists who  disseminate objective information. As is known, "Belaruskaya  Maladzyozhnaya" was planning a feature a live program on 28 May  with Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislaw Bahdankevich  who is against the populist decision to merge Belarusian and  Russian monetary units, a move that has been greeted with mixed  opinion.    The employees of the two radio programs consider the  crackdown politically motivated and an infringement of freedom,  which places the possibility of holding democratic elections in  Belarus in doubt. The program calls on the international  community, law-enforcement agencies, media, and society to do  their best to stop the violence against democratic mass media  and freedom of speech.    A declaration was also issued by the opposition Belarusian  Popular Front deputies. It said that the "offensive against  democratic journalists and the independent press is not casual  -- the Cabinet of Ministers and the Supreme Soviet, subordinate  to it, seek to have the elections held in the atmosphere of  misinformation. The radio and television leadership plans to  offer inconvenient hours for democratic candidates for  president. Meanwhile, all radio and television information  programs and all government newspapers are jammed with  propaganda about Prime Minister Vyachaslav Kebich." The deputies  call on the Belarusian public and the international community to  pay attention to the crackdown on the democratic press and other  mass media as well as to the restoration of totalitarianism in  Belarus. They demand that publication of newspapers VYBAR,  NAVINY BNF, and SVABODA as well as the broadcasting of radio  programs "Belaruskaya Maladzyozhnaya" and "Krynitsa" be  immediately resumed.</p>

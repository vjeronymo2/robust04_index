			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. TRIO OUSTS SEEDED PLAYERS IN AUSTRALIA  </P> <P> Americans Brad Pearce, David Pate and Scott Davis were spoilers today, ousting  seeded players in the Australian Indoor championships.  </P> <P> Fifth-seeded Aaron Krickstein was another of the favorites to get caught up in  the upset wave at the ATP tournament.  </P> <P> Pearce unleashed some fierce passing shots to spoil a 25th birthday for  13th-seeded Australian Darren Cahill 6-4, 6-1.  </P> <P> Pate downed No. 8 Richey Reneberg 6-2, 6-3, while Davis ousted No. 14 Jim Grabb  3-6, 6-3, 6-3.  </P> <P> Canadian Grant Connell upset Krickstein 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 in a second-round match.  Connell, a doubles expert, romped through the second set in just 19 minutes.  </P> <P> Krickstein, who was beaten by fellow American Brad Gilbert in Sunday's final of  the Queensland Open, had no explanation for his latest loss.  </P> <P> "Sometimes these things happen," he said. "There is nothing wrong with me; what  do you want me to say?"  </P> <P> Mats Wilander of Sweden, once the world's No. 1 player, continued his bid to  get back toward the top with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Australian Mark Woodforde  in a first-round match. Wilander, now 68th in the rankings, advanced to a  second-round meeting with No. 2 seed Boris Becker.  </P> <P> In other tennis news, an ankle injury forced Monica Seles to withdraw today  from this week's Nokia Masters, a WTA tournament in Essen, West Germany.  </P> <P> Seles, ranked No. 3 in the world, injured her right ankle in a quarter-final  singles against Amy Frazier in Tokyo last week. The ankle was placed in a  protective brace and diagnosed as an injured lateral ligament in the joint.  </P></p>

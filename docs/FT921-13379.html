For an Englishman the odd thing about this is that only the Scots seem to be aware of it ..or perhaps 'obsessed by' is better than 'aware of'. Western broadcasters have latched on rapidly to the fact they can now make documentary programmes in the old Warsaw Pact countries and that recent history is providing a visually dramatic underclass: prostitutes, black marketeers, and in tonight's Dispatches, thousands of children living on the streets of St Petersburg (9.00 C4). The second episode of BBC1's biography of Churchill moves to the period for which he is most famous: World War 2 when, having apparently run his course as a politician, he suddenly turned out to be the needed inspirational national leader (9.30 BBC1).

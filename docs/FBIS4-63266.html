			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev [no date as received] -- The press service of  Ukraine's Economy Ministry stated yesterday that reports of  considerable consumer goods and services retail price and tariff  rises, to be expected in May or June of this year, have appeared  recently in some of the mass media. Interviews and statements  on this are making purposeful references to a draft resolution  that allegedly has already been drawn up by the ministry, the  adoption of which would lead to a new round of inflation and a  fall in the population's living standards.    The press service of Ukraine's Economy Ministry states in  connection with this that no plan of general retail price and  tariff rises has been developed. On the contrary, the  government's moves to stabilize the economy have resulted in  reducing inflation from 90 percent in December of last year to  six percent in April of this year. Approximately the same level  of inflation has been forecast for May. Of course,  insignificant fluctuations in retail prices as a result of this  or that factor are not ruled out. Ministry of Economy  specialists expect, for example, that tariffs on city  transportation services may rise, which will have to be approved  by local authorities.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA CRUZ;  </P> <P> BOAT CAPTAIN JAILED IN ALLEGED ATTACK  </P> <P> A commercial fishing boat captain was arrested after a woman crew member jumped  into the sea, swam to a passing boat and reported that he had beaten, shot at  and sexually abused her. The Coast Guard intercepted the 40-foot Dorothy L. and  ordered it into Santa Cruz Harbor, where, authorities said, a search turned up  a cache of emeralds, possibly smuggled from South America. Paul Batsford, 49,  skipper of the vessel, was jailed on suspicion of sexual assault and weapons  violations after another crew member "generally confirmed all of the victim's  statements," Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Lt. Bruce Simpson said.  </P></p>

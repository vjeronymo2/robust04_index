			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MILLIONS LOST IN ERRORS ON RENT, HUD AUDIT SAYS  </P> <P> Errors in calculating rents for subsidized housing are costing the federal  government millions of dollars a year, according to a Department of Housing and  Urban Development internal audit obtained today.  </P> <P> A second audit, sent to Congress this week, raises fresh charges of favoritism  in the awarding of rent subsidies and says such conduct was allowed because of  poor program accountability. Mismanagement and political favoritism are the key  subjects of congressional investigations of HUD during the Reagan  Administration.  </P> <P> For the rent study, completed last week and released under the Freedom of  Information Act, HUD's inspector general reviewed 142 of the 2,755 areas for  which the department sets fair-market rents for subsidized housing. He found  that in 116 of those areas, the government was paying as much as $39.1 million  a year in excessive subsidies.  </P> <P> Since the review covered only 5% of the rent areas and that sample was not  drawn at random, the auditors said they could not provide a nationwide estimate  of likely overpayments but noted that HUD's long-range commitments to the  Section 8 program are in the area of $188 billion.  </P> <P> Still, they recommended that HUD take a number of steps to bring its Section 8  rent formulas in line with local real estate market conditions, particularly in  rural areas not covered by government or industry housing surveys. In a  smattering of areas, the auditors said HUD might also be paying too little in  subsidies.  </P> <P> The report was sharply criticized by HUD officials in charge of the program,  who responded to a draft copy in July by saying "the evidence simply does not  support a conclusion of any serious problem."  </P></p>

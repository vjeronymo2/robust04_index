			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / International Company News: Monsanto forms joint venture in Thailand MONSANTO, the US chemicals company, has formed a joint venture in Thailand that will invest Dollars 150m to build a specialty plastics manufacturing plant south-east of Bangkok. The venture, with Premier Enterprise of Thailand, is being formed in co-operation with Monsanto Kasei, a 50-50 Tokyo-based plastics venture formed two years ago between Monsanto and Japan's Mitsubishi Kasei Polytec. The new Thai company - to be known as Monsanto Premier Kasei - will be 44 per cent owned by Monsanto of the US, 30 per cent by Premier and 26 per cent by Monsanto Kasei of Japan. Premier is a private sector conglomerate. Monsanto expects the Thai plant to employee 200 to 250 people at Map Ta Phut, 125 miles south-east of Bangkok, and to produce special engineering resins by early 1995. The venture is supposed to produce about 66,000 tonnes of engineering resins a year, to be marketed throughout south-east Asia and China. Main uses for the resins include business machine enclosures, refrigeration liners, appliances and general purpose moulding.</p>

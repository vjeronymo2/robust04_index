			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Israel eases curbs on Palestinians in Gaza ISRAEL yesterday partially relaxed tough new rules put into force on Monday restricting the number of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip allowed to work in Israel following protests from Israeli employers whose businesses were threatened by the regulations. The hasty climbdown underscored the dilemma Gaza has posed the hardline Likud government as the June 23 general election approaches. It sealed Gaza to prevent a repeat of a fatal stabbing of an Israeli schoolgirl near Tel Aviv, which led to furious protests over security policy. But Likud ideology also dictates that Gaza is an integral part of Israel and Israeli industries such as construction have come to depend heavily on cheap Gazan labour. The Labour opposition argues that Israel cannot absorb Gaza and the West Bank, which should be allowed to develop as a separate entity. Yesterday's regulations dropped the lower age limit for Gazans allowed to work in Israel to 25 from 28.</p>

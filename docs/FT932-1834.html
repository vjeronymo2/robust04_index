			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Observer: Seeking a new voice Now that David Cameron, the last of Norman Lamont's advisers at the Treasury, is heading off to join Michael Howard at the Home Office, the way is clear for the new Chancellor of the Exchequer to beef up his team of outside advisers at Her Majesty's Treasury. Not that Kenneth Clarke has left himself much room since he has brought Tessa Keswick and David Ruffley with him from the Home Office. However, Clarke has said that he wants to be remembered as the chancellor 'who helped British industry'. So the search is on for a special adviser who knows the facts of industrial life. Given the dearth of takeover activity, there are any number of merchant bankers who would dearly love to take time off to bend the chancellor's ear on the subject and build up their contact books at the same time. The job doesn't pay much but it would look good on the CV. However, the chancellor would be better advised to cast his net wider and bring in someone who has real experience of what a rise in interest rates or sterling means to the bottom line. Hiring a souped-up stockbroker or the like would send the wrong signal. If Clarke's quarry is a wise old bird, a couple of still unstuffed owls would seem perched appropriately. For one, BTR's ex-chairman Sir Owen Green has plenty of time on his hands these days. As for the other, it would ease life for the next generation of management at Hanson if the good Lord himself took on some outside interests that kept him out of the office.</p>

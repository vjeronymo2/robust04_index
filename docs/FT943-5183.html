			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Kohl, Gorbachev clash over eastern land Mr Helmut Kohl, the German Chancellor, and Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, former Soviet president, were yesterday locked in a public dispute, the outcome of which could affect thousands of former property owners in east Germany. Mr Kohl, who will meet Mr Gorbachev in Bonn on Wednesday, said on German radio that the Soviet Union had linked its agreement on the German unification negotiations to Bonn's acceptance as legal the Soviet administration of what was occupied eastern Germany between 1945 and 1949. During that time, the Soviet administration expropriated 8.2m acres of land and hundreds of enterprises. The land was subsequently divided and distributed to ethnic Germans fleeing eastern Europe. Last week, however, Mr Gorbachev challenged Mr Kohl, claiming that Moscow had never linked the expropriation issue with the Soviet Union's acceptance of the unification talks. Yesterday, Mr Gorbachev was supported in this by Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, his former Soviet foreign minister. Their reluctance to support Mr Kohl, who is seeking re-election in October, coincides with claims by former land-owners who argue that it was west and east German politicians, not Mr Gorbachev, who agreed among themselves not to give back land to, or compensate, Prussian aristocrats. The former land-owners believe that Bonn used the so-called Moscow veto for different reasons. Bonn, for example, could not finanically support full compensation, while the first east German non-communist government believed the former land owners were either former Nazi sympathisers or would return and expel the small land-holders who had been established by the communist regime. After German unification, former property-owners, including Daimler-Benz, tried to reclaim their property in the east but were over-ruled by Germany's Constitutional Court, which cited the existence of the Moscow veto. These former property-owners are seeking the same rights to restitution and compensation enjoyed by those whose property in Germany was confiscated by the Nazis between 1933 and 1945, and by the East German communist regime between 1949 and 1990. The meeting of Mr Kohl and Mr Gorbachev follows a crucial compromise agreement by a special joint committee of Germany's lower and upper houses of parliament about how the government should compensate former property-owners whose land was confiscated by the Nazis or the communists. This accord, expected to be passed by both houses this month, would end four years of wrangling among politicians. It could also help acelerate investment decisions in the eastern German states, dogged by property rights disputes. Its recommendations include: A DM4,000 (Dollars 2,564) payment to those east Germans never compensed for confiscated property under the former communists. The level of compensation, to be calculated on the 1935 valuation of land and financed from a DM12.6bn (Dollars 8.1bn) fund. Depending on the status of the property, the value of land will be multiplied several times. Former owners will be issued with bonds in 2004, redeemable five years later. Former property owners of the 1945-1949 period will be allowed to buy back a limited amount of their property at a price below the current market value.</p>

No. 46&hyph;01433) located in Marion County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions in the air course along the West Side of the Main North entries that flow south from 1 North (adjacent to 3 North Crossover Seals) to the junction with the 1 West entries, the entire area cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish check points to monitor the quantity of air; and to have a certified person test for methane and the quantity of air on a weekly basis and record the results in a record book kept on the surface and made available to all interested persons. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 10.

No. 46&hyph;01438) located in Marshall County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof and rib conditions in the 4 South seals and certain air courses from the 4 South seals to the No. 2 Fan, the area cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to change the location of air measuring stations ``C'' and ``D'' and to continue evaluating daily air measuring stations ``A'' and ``B'' that were established in Decision and Order dated July 17, 1989, Docket No. M&hyph;88&hyph;252&hyph;C; to post a sign in the adjacent travel entry designating the location of these measuring stations in the adjacent travel entry; to establish an air measuring station ``F'' on the surface at Ireland Mine No. 2 Fan in lieu of air measuring stations ``C'' and ``D''; and to have a certified person monitor each air measuring station daily and record the results in a book that would be provided at each air measuring station and on the surface and made available to all interested persons. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 11.

No. 11&hyph;02752) located in Saline County, Illinois. The petitioner proposes to use electric motor-driven mine equipment in a longwall recovery room. This equipment would serve as a power center (transformer) in intake air to furnish power to roofbolters with a 1200 foot long, Number 2, G&hyph;GC, 2KV trail cable, protected for a short circuit fault with an instantaneous circuit breaker set at not more than 600 amperes at all points of the recovery room.

The petitioner proposes to use air passing through inaccessible abandoned workings and additional areas by mixing with the air in the intake haulage slope to ventilate the only active working section, to ensure air quality by sampling intake air during pre-shift and on-shift examinations, and to suspend mine production when air quality fails to meet specified criteria. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 13.

The petitioner states that application of the standard would result in a diminution of safety to the miners. In addition, the petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 14.

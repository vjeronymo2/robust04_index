			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: RELIABLE BANANAS PEEL AWAY GLOOM  </P> <P> These are tough times for fresh fruit fanatics. Apples are on the wane, citrus,  while in greater supply, is still too expensive, and imported peaches and plums  seduce the winter-weary eye only to betray with one dry and tasteless bite.  </P> <P> Bananas do not betray you, however; a lovely, evenly yellow skin will contain  what you expect, fruit that's creamy and ripe.  </P> <P> Here is a low-fat, cheesecake-like dessert that calls for the ever-dependable  banana. This treat also can include the fresh strawberries that should be  flooding the markets shortly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BANANA CHEESECAKE  </P> <P> 1 cup cottage cheese  </P> <P> 1/3 cup plain yogurt  </P> <P> 2 medium bananas, mashed  </P> <P> 2 eggs, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 1/4 cup sugar or honey  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon grated lemon zest  </P> <P> Sliced fresh strawberries, optional  </P> <P> Process cottage cheese in blender or food processor until smooth, taking care  not to liquefy. Add yogurt and blend until evenly combined. Add mashed banana  and blend until smooth. Transfer to mixing bowl.  </P> <P> Stir together eggs, sugar, vanilla and lemon zest in separate bowl. Beat into  banana mixture until well combined. Pour mixture evenly into 6 (6-ounce)  ramekins or custard cups.  </P> <P> Place custard cups inside deep baking dish. Pour hot water 1/2 way up sides of  ramekins. Bake at 375 degrees 40 minutes, checking often to maintain water  level. Dessert is done when knife inserted in center comes out clean.  </P> <P> Remove from oven and let cool at room temperature. Chill at least 3 hours  before serving, topped with strawberries. Makes 6 servings.  </P></p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Rail bidders face stringent controls Far-reaching controls on fares, timetables and levels of overcrowding will have to be accepted by the bidders for the first eight train operating companies due to be offered for sale today. Fare increases will be limited on many commuter routes while rules designed to prevent any increase in present levels of overcrowding have been drawn up. Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director responsible for the passenger train operations sell-off, hopes to revive the momentum of British Rail privatisation when he announces the terms for the first round of franchises. But the 'passenger service requirements' are expected to provoke a political storm, with critics of privatisation arguing that they will lead to a reduction in services. The service requirements will cover: Timetables. Operators will be told the minimum number of trains which they will be expected to run on weekdays and at weekends, the intervals between trains, and the times of the first and last services. Mr Salmon is expected to guarantee only an hourly service on some main lines compared with current half-hourly services. Subsidies will be available for these services but Mr Salmon expects additional trains to run to maximise revenue and to compete effectively. Fares. The franchising director is expected to intervene to hold down fares on routes where rail travellers do not have a realistic alternative, including rush-hour London routes and Edinburgh services. Responsibility for fares in other large urban centres lies with local passenger transport authorities. Overcrowding. Train operators will be limited in terms of the numbers of passengers they may carry. That is intended to ensure that if an operator reduces services when demand falls, it will be obliged to increase services when demand picks up. That measure is designed to prevent further overcrowding. At present train operators may carry up to 35 per cent more passengers than they have seats. Tickets. Train operators will be obliged to accept discount and full-fare tickets sold by other train companies (though Apex fares, which have to be bought in advance, will not be covered). However, requiring operators to accept other companies' tickets could be seen by critics as stifling price competition. Consequently, while the lead operator on a particular route must accept other companies' tickets, an operator offering an alternative service would be allowed to provide a lower-priced ticket. The rail regulator is considering proposals to concentrate the sale of long-distance tickets on a limited number - perhaps 400 - stations. Tickets are increasingly expected to be sold by tele-sales offices and off-station outlets. However, rail user groups are concerned that this would complicate ticket purchases. Details of the franchises to be put up for sale in the first round will be published today as pre-qualification documents. Bidders will be expected to register an interest by March. Detailed bids will then be invited in April, and the first sale is expected by December next year.</p>

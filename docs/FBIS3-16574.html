Last night People's Deputy of the Republic of Belarus, Iosif  Fyodaravich Vashkevich, died suddenly. He had been working as  chief of management of the republic's Council of Ministers.  [passage omitted]    The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet proposed considering the  question of elections of the President of the Republic of  Belarus. A report on this question was delivered by the chairman  of the standing commission for state construction, Uladzimir  Lewchyk. Here is an excerpt from his speech:    [Begin Lewchyk recording] As for the time limit for the  collection of signatures, the commission within the framework of  time for preparing the holding of elections of the president has  tried to make these time limits as long as possible. They are  20 days, including time for forming the initiative group. The  mechanism for collection of signatures (?in many ways)  corresponds to the mechanism for collecting signatures for  holding a referendum. In accordance with the Constitution of the  Republic -- which was passed -- elections for the president are  held using two rounds of voting. The candidate who receives  more than half the votes of electors participating in the  election is considered elected president. Elections are  considered to have taken place if more than half of the  registered voters participate. The second round of the  elections is also conducted according to these rules, with the  two candidates receiving the greatest number of votes in the  first round. The draft law envisions the possibility of holding  repeat elections for the president if none of the candidates is  elected on the first or second round of voting, or in the event  of the elections being recognized as not having taken place or  invalid. According to preliminary estimates of the Central  Electoral Commission, the presidential elections will cost us  116 billion rubles. [passage omitted]</p>

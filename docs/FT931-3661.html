			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / BBC management board backs Birt SENIOR managers at the BBC today rally to the defence of Mr John Birt, the director-general at the centre of a row about his tax arrangements, saying he has their 'unanimous support'. In a letter to The Times newspaper today, the 10 members of the BBC's board of management, responsible for the day-to-day running of the corporation, say the controversy surrounding Mr Birt has obscured the most important issue in broadcasting - the need for the BBC to have a clear vision in order to safeguard its future after its charter expires in 1996. 'In January John Birt laid out that vision of a wide range of high-quality programmes, greater efficiency and accountability with value for money for licence payers,' the letter says. The letter adds: 'We . . . believe that John Birt is the best person to lead the BBC and he has our unanimous support.' The letter may strengthen Mr Birt's position ahead of Thursday's meeting of the BBC'S 12-strong board of governors which is expected to hear calls for his resignation. Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of network television, yesterday admitted in a BBC radio interview that both Mr Birt and the corporation had been damaged by the revelation that he had been paid through a private company, John Birt Productions. But Mr Wyatt insisted that Mr Birt should not lose his job. 'He's clearly been damaged by it, John knows he's been damaged by it and . . . he'll need the help of his colleagues, which he will get, to get over it. But we believe it is get-overable.' Mr Wyatt said he did not believe there was a conspiracy against Mr Birt, but suggested that 'factions who would like to stop change in the BBC' might be under the impression they could do so by destabil-ising the director-general. Mr Wyatt's comments followed calls by several Sunday newspapers for the resignation of Mr Birt, and of Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the BBC chairman who approved his financial arrangements. Mr Hussey last week vigorously defended Mr Birt. It later emerged that several BBC governors had not given their support to his statement, and some had not known of the director-general's status as a freelance consultant.</p>

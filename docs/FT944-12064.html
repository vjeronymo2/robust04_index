			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Tories get into deep water on Scots reforms: A look at mounting opposition to the council overhauls While the government seems close to abandoning hopes of achieving a radical reform of local government in England, in Scotland plans for a complete reorganisation should now move into a higher gear. On Tuesday night the Commons approved the bill to replace the present two-tier system in mainland Scotland with 28 single-tier authorities. Nine regional councils and 53 district councils will disappear in April 1996. The three island councils will be unchanged. What was a small majority in the opinion polls backing single-tier councils has over the past two years turned into one modestly against them. Many thoughtful Scots doubt whether the new structure will be more effective and cheaper to operate, and even Tories fear it will initially do little to improve the party's standing in local government. Whereas in England the government's desire for change has been thwarted by strong support for the status quo, detected by Sir John Banham's travelling commission, in Scotland and in Wales - where a single-tier structure also comes into effect in April 1996 - there has been no such consultation. However, creating a single-tier structure has long been on the agenda of the Labour, Liberal and Scottish National parties but with the crucial proviso that it followed the setting up of a Scottish parliament. The unpopularity of the reforms to local government is partly due to the fact that it entails removing water and sewerage from the control of local authorities, an issue whose sensitivity in Scotland the government probably underestimated. Water is not being privatised but will be handed over to three publicly-owned companies which will contract out services to private-sector companies. The most sweeping change in the local government map is the abolition of Strathclyde region, in which nearly half Scotland's 5m people live. It is to be broken up into 12 unitary councils. Strathclyde's break-up highlights the disadvantages of the government's policy. Although the Strathclyde passenger transport executive will continue to provide rail services in the Glasgow area, it will be under the control of a number of unitary councils. ScotRail executives who operate the trains do not conceal their misgivings at the prospect. Strathclyde has an office in Brussels which has been very successful in securing EU grants but could now disappear. Critics of the scheme such as Professor Arthur Midwinter of Strathclyde university say that if Scottish local government had to be reformed it would have been efficient to create only 15 councils. But the desire to satisfy local interests, break up Labour power blocks and preserve the few Tory ones will mean the setting up of some tiny authorities which will be obliged to provide a full range of services - Clackmannan, carved out of Central region, will have only 49,000 people. However the new local authorities - notably the four cities, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee - are delighted to be receiving their independence. Although the Scottish Office argued that the reform would create significant savings in public expenditure, the promised figure was gradually whittled down under challenge from the regional councils. Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, eventually settled for saying that the reform would save Pounds 1bn over 15 years - a modest figure compared with current annual spending of Pounds 6bn. The government has set a tight timetable with elections next April for the new councils which will have only 12 months as shadow bodies before taking control. The tightness of the schedule was exacerbated by delays in getting the bill through parliament and the fact that the big regions, mostly Labour-controlled, offered minimum co-operation with the Scottish Office. Mr Graeme Wallace, a local-government specialist with Price Waterhouse, the accountants, said this week: 'It is difficult to conceive of members of a newly elected shadow council, beset with all the problems of setting up a new authority while running down an old one . . . rushing to embrace the tenets of reinventing local government.' The first moment of truth will come on April 9 next year with the shadow council elections. It will be another test for the Conservative party whose standing in the Scottish opinion polls is at rock bottom. A calculation by The Herald newspaper yesterday suggests that the Tories will be lucky to win control of more than two of the 28 new mainland councils. Nearly half are likely to be once again won by Labour.</p>

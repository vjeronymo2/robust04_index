			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / EU in fresh look at tobacco ban The European Commission agreed yesterday to re-examine its proposed ban on tobacco advertising, after EU health ministers had again failed to agree on the controversial directive. Mr Padraig Flynn, European health commissioner, said it was a 'matter of great regret' that member states were unable to agree on a ban, which would end all tobacco advertising in the European Union, except at the point of sale. The proposal has been fiercely opposed by the UK, which favours a system of voluntary restraint, backed by a blocking minority of Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Greece. Lawyers advising the council of ministers yesterday disputed the Commission's decision to press for a ban under single market rules in the EU treaty. The Commission argues that, unless conflicting national legislation is harmonised, publications containing tobacco advertising will not circulate freely around the Union. But the Commission and the Belgian presidency said yesterday they were extremely surprised that the council's legal service had raised such objections after two years of debate on the measure. Mr Flynn said he could not comment on the possible options for the Commission until he had considered the legal base for any new approach to the problem.</p>

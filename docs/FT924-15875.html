			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Piracy warnings A 24-hour centre to counter piracy in the seas of south-east Asia has opened in Kuala Lumpur, the UK-based International Maritime Bureau announced yesterday, writes Alexander Nicoll, Asia Editor. The centre, funded by the shipping industry, will broadcast warning messages to ships, receive warnings on suspicious movements, liaise with law enforcement agencies and provide support services after incidents of piracy. The bureau said there had been about 200 attacks by pirates last year. As well as the danger to ships' crews, piracy could cause environmental disasters if tanker crews were tied up and unable to steer their vessels.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council, with only six of its nine members present, delayed  until Oct. 30 a decision on a proposal to build a 472-foot luxury condominium  tower at Broadway and State Street.  </P> <P> With council members Abbe Wolfsheimer, Gloria McColl and Ed Struiksma absent,  the council could not come up with a five-vote majority for the Huntington  building, an alternative development, or a proposal to solicit new project  ideas for the city-owned site.  </P> <P> The condominium project has been approved by the Centre City Development Corp.  but has failed to win council approval several times in recent months.  </P> <P> At issue is whether the building's height makes it incompatible with its  surroundings. Two council members, Bob Filner and Judy McCarty, voted Tuesday  for an alternative proposal by another developer to build 287 less-expensive  rental apartments in a smaller structure that also would house a child care  center.  </P></p>

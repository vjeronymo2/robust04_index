			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KEATING TELLS TV AUDIENCE TO BLAME REGULATORS, CONGRESS FOR LINCOLN'S FALL;  </P> <P> THRIFTS: IRVINE-BASED S&amp;L'S OWNER SAYS, 'WE HAD $700 MILLION EXCESS ASSETS  OVER LIABILITIES IN OUR SUBSIDIARY' BEFORE 'CONNIVING' RUINED HIM.  </P> <P> Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Assn. owner Charles Keating said Friday that the  "conniving" of federal regulators and the guilt of Congress are to blame for  the multibillion-dollar failure of his Irvine-based thrift.  </P> <P> Keating said Lincoln showed a profit until it was taken over by federal  regulators. "We had $700 million excess assets over liabilities in our  subsidiary," he said on ABC-TV's "Good Morning America" program.  </P> <P> Regulators say the failed savings and loan is expected to cost taxpayers a  record $2.5 billion.  </P> <P> "The numbers they come by are numbers that are arbitrarily written down,"  Keating said of what he called the "conniving" regulators.  </P> <P> "It's a ridiculous situation," he said, "and it's causing a loss unprecedented  in the history of the United States. It's the regulators."  </P> <P> Keating is appearing on a series of talk shows to defend his point of view,  even though he took the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer the questions of  a congressional committee investigating Lincoln's failure.  </P> <P> Keating said Congress is part of the problem.  </P> <P> "The Congress tried to stop (former top thrift regulator) Ed Gray, and a lot of  things happened there that make them guilty," Keating said of Congress.  </P> <P> Gray testified before Congress last year that he turned down the request of  five senators to ease investment rules affecting Lincoln.  </P> <P> Those five senators are being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee in  connection with allegations of improperly trying to interfere with federal  regulation in return for $1.3 million in campaign contributions.  </P> <P> On Cable News Network on Thursday, Keating said he made donations to the  senators -- Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Donald Riegle, D-Mich., John Glenn,  D-Ohio, Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and John McCain R-Ariz. -- because he liked  their views on the thrift industry.  </P> <P> Lincoln, a unit of American Continental Corp., may be the most spectacular of  the nation's thrift failures, because of the expected record cost of its  bailout.  </P> <P> Lincoln's parent filed for bankruptcy protection April 13, 1989. Regulators  seized Lincoln a day later.  </P> <P> American Continental's bankruptcy left shareholders and investors with  now-worthless stocks and bonds. Among the bondholders are about 22,000 small  investors who bought nearly $200 million in Lincoln's corporate bonds.  </P> <P> Almost two-thirds of the buyers were elderly Lincoln depositors, many of whom  thought the bonds were federally insured because they were sold in Lincoln's 29  Southern California branches.  </P></p>

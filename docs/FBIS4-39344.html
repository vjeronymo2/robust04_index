			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by RIA NOVOSTI correspondent Vladimir Bibikov </F> specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI: "Electronic `Threads' To Link  CIS Enterprises"]    [Text] An interstate electronic system of information  cooperation among industrial enterprises has been ratified  within the CIS. This decision was reached at a routine  conference of the council of CIS industrial enterprise chief  designers.    "Some 5,000 plants in six of the biggest Commonwealth  countries will be able to pass their customers information on  the parameters, cost, and terms for selling their output, and to  obtain similar information on other producers' materials and  products," Leonid Gancharik, chairman of the chief designers'  council and general director of the "Tsentrsistem" Science and  Production Association in Minsk, said. "Subscription to the  service will make it possible to obtain regular thematic  information without any additional request being made, along  with an analysis of the market situation regarding availability  of goods and their price. Above all, shipments of output under  intergovernmental agreements will be placed under operational  control."    The creation of this global information network is very  important today. Simply reducing crosshauls and "freeing up"  middlemen will have enormous benefits -- accurate knowledge of  the market situation plays a fundamental role in the fate of  enterprises. Similar information structures have long been in  operation in many industrially developed countries.    Any enterprise with ordinary telegraphic communications, a  phone line with a modem, or a fax can link up with the system.  These information "nerves" will join up at republic and  regional centers. For instance, there will be 12 of them in  Russia, linked by high-speed modems. There will be no "main"  center in the system -- all of them will have absolutely equal  rights and technical capabilities. Nor will any country have  priority in obtaining, processing, and transmitting important  production and economic information.</p>

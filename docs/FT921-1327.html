			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / Cut in jobs at Swan Hunter SWAN HUNTER, the Tyneside shipbuilder, announced 95 white-collar redundancies yesterday. The job cuts, affecting management, technical and clerical staff, arise from a gap in the order book at the company, which won its last shipbuilding contract - for three Type 23 frigates for the Ministry of Defence - in December 1989. Swan Hunter, privatised in a management buyout six years ago, has fought to cut its dependence on UK warship orders. It has hopes for its first overseas ship order since privatisation, a Pounds 200m deal from Singapore for 12 vessels.</p>

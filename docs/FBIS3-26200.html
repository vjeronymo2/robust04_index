			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Commentary" by Yu Hong (0060 3163): "A Rational Response </F> -- Comment on Percy Craddock's Article Entitled: `Patten Has  Got It Wrong Again'"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 2 Feb (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- Chris  Patten went back to Britain a few days ago. At a hearing of the  Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons, in addition  to continuing his attack on the Chinese side, he also distorted  facts, used lame arguments, and wantonly attacked some British  personalities who are relatively more rational in the  Sino-British disputes over constitutional issues.    This move by Chris Patten naturally called forth responses  from people with breadth of vision, including the abovementioned  personalities. Akers-Jones refuted Chris Patten's distortion  and slander against him as a "cheap jibe." Percy Craddock even  published an article entitled "Patten `Has Got It Wrong' Again"  in Hong Kong's SOUTH CHINA SUNDAY MORNING POST. In a cool and  rational style, Craddock used facts to clarify Chris Patten's  distortion and attacks. The rational response from Percy  Craddock is in striking contrast to Chris Patten's character and  morals as one who is rude and unreasonable and who fabricates  lies. It has provided reference material, which is hard to come  by, to help people understand the right and wrong of the  Sino-British controversies over constitutional issues.  <H3>  No Consultations With the Chinese Side Before Publishing  Chris Patten's Proposals </H3>   The Joint Declaration states: In order to ensure a smooth  transfer of government in Hong Kong in 1997, China and Britain  are to "continue their discussions in a friendly spirit and  develop the cooperative relationship that already exists between  the two Governments over Hong Kong with a view to the effective  implementation of the Joint Declaration." In the second half of  the transitional period, "there will be need for closer  cooperation," and "joint consideration of measures to be adopted  for a smooth transition in 1997." However, Chris Patten has  gone in the opposite direction. A year and a half have passed  since he took up the post as governor of Hong Kong. He has done  nothing good to safeguard and maintain Hong Kong's economic  prosperity and social stability, but instances of his  conspicuous behavior in opposing Sino-British cooperation are  numerous. Percy Craddock disclosed that Chris Patten's refusal  to consult with the Chinese side on the constitutional reform  proposals before making his policy address was his first major  move of confrontation with Sino-British cooperation.    Facts have shown clearly that there was no consultation with  the Chinese side prior to the formulation of the constitutional  reform plan,and the plan was published unilaterally despite the  admonition and warning of the Chinese side. Percy Craddock has  always had reservations toward Chris Patten's refusal to consult  with the Chinese in advance and his unilaterally dishing out and  implementing a "three violations" constitutional reform package,  ignoring the provisions of the Joint Declaration. Proceeding  from the interests of Britain, he did not hesitate to criticise  this openly. However, instead of making a self-examination,  Chris Patten pretended to speak sternly at the Parliament, out  of a sense of justice, blaming Percy Craddock, saying that this  "is completely untrue, and that whether its was the result of  misunderstanding or of other motivations is for Sir Percy to  explain in due course." Since he distorted facts and made  unfounded counter-charges, Percy Craddock had no alternative but  to respond.    Quoting a passage from a book he had written, which would be  published soon, Percy Craddock pointed out that the Chinese  reaction to the "three violations" constitutional reform package  dished out by Chris Patten was so violent "because of both the  manner and the substance of the proposals. Although they were  informed of the substance of the Governor's speech two weeks in  advance, their request that they be consulted (which in their  eyes probably meant negotiation) before the speech was delivered  was rejected." What is especially interesting is that this  passage had been "carefully checked" with the Foreign Office as  part of the official clearance and had been "accepted." The  statements in this passage, which has gone through official  British clearance and is officially accepted, are exactly the  same as what the Chinese side has said. Chris Patten, being an  "intimate friend of the prime minister" and the person who  concocted and dished out the "three violations" constitutional  reform package, should know better than anyone else. However, he  went so far as to deny them and falsely accused the person who  spoke the truth as having other "motivations." This can show  only that Chris Patten intentionally tried to withhold the truth  and to continue deceiving Parliament and the British public in a  bid to gain support for his erroneous stand. Recently,  Sino-U.S. relations have been improving, China's domestic  situation has become more and more favorable, and more and more  Hong Kong people have come to understand China's policy toward  Hong Kong and have identified themselves with it. On the other  hand, Chris Patten's constitutional reform plan has been opposed  by more and more Hong Kong people, and has been criticized by  industrial and commercial circles and by people with breadth of  vision of other circles in Britain. Under such circumstances,  Chris Patten, after returning to Britain, indeed had no way to  court support in Britain other than to disguise himself, resort  to sophistry, and withhold the truth.   <H5>    Chris Patten Deliberately Practices "Three Violations" </H5>   At the hearing, Chris Patten also said that Percy Craddock  had not told him in advance of "the existing political and  constitutional settlement," implying that although Percy  Craddock knew very well that his constitutional reform plan was  one of "three violations," he had no objection. The fact is  that everyone knows very well that Percy Craddock does not agree  with Chris Patten's abandoning the relevant Sino-British  diplomatic agreements and understanding, takes an attitude of  reservation toward his constitutional reform plan, opposes open  confrontation with Sino-British cooperation, and takes the stand  of regarding such confrontation as "the tragedy of Hong Kong."  Chris Patten has completely confounded black and white in his  attempt to put Percy Craddock in the ranks of those who show  support the "three violations" constitutional reform plan.    In his article, Percy Craddock said that at that time, he  "had no inkling of plans to circumvent existing arrangements and  substantially widen the electorate by bringing in a new kind of  functional constituency." On the contrary, he explicitly  advised Chris Patten: "Given the existing agreements," the  British side "has very limited room for maneuver"; "it is  dangerous to disregard Chinese objections to any increase in the  number of directly elected seats in 1995; and therefore, it is  necessary to work within the agreed framework." This is  tantamount to clearly and correctly reminding Chris Patten that  by no means should he go beyond the agreements and understanding  reached with China to make the so-called constitutional reform  plan.    The Joint Declaration officially came into effect as early  as  1985 and the Basic Law also was published long ago. Chris  Patten also bragged that he "read the Basic Law more frequently  than the Bible." Regarding the agreements and understanding  concerned, which were reached by the foreign ministers of the  two countries, even if Chris Patten did not know about them in  advance, did he ever show any indication or take any action to  return to the "three conformities" when the Chinese side  explained to him, item by item, and explicitly pointed out his  mistakes of "three violations?" Moreover, Chris Patten also has  repeatedly undermined Sino-British talks on arrangements for the  1994-95 elections in Hong Kong. Consequently, no positive  results were attained and the talks finally broke down.  Evidently, it is not that Percy Craddock did not tell Chris  Patten the gains and losses in advance, but that Chris Patten  turned a deaf ear to the advice, and deliberately and stubbornly  took the road of confrontation with the Chinese side. He cannot  shirk his responsibility for the deterioration in Sino-British  relations.  <H5>  Who Is Responsible for the British Interests? </H5>   In view of Chris Patten's attack to the effect that Percy  Craddock "advocates an indulgent policy" toward the Chinese  side, Percy Craddock pointed out that if the British side  insists on not cooperating with the Chinese side on the Hong  Kong issue, "the Chinese do not have to negotiate at all; they  could dictate, or simply wait until 1997, when, by the mere  passage of time, Hong Kong will fall into their hands with no  restraints on their freedom of action." In a certain sense,  this has reflected the truth. It also shows that Percy Craddock  has a far better understanding of China than does Chris Patten.  The British side once insisted on continuing the governing of  Hong Kong after 1997, and it was willing to hold talks on the  issue of returning Hong Kong only after Deng Xiaoping sternly  warned the British side that if it did not change its attitude,  the Chinese side would be compelled to announce unilaterally the  principles and policies for resolving the Hong Kong issue. The  reason is quite simple: Since time immemorial, Hong Kong has  been a part of China's territory, and the Chinese Government has  an absolute right to recover Hong Kong at any time. The three  unequal treaties which Britain imposed on the Chinese people  through such illegal means as armed invasion cannot have the  authority of international law. Still less will Britain be able  to continue forcibly occupying Hong Kong in the 1980's [year as  published]. Therefore, Britain's returning Hong Kong to China  is a question of respecting facts and legal principles, and is  not a so- called question of "indulgence" or "kow towing."  Chris Patten's wishful thinking of implementing the "three  violations" constitutional reform plan and of attempting  effectively to extend the privileges and interests of the  British colonial rule after 1997 is precisely a repetition of  Britain's past mistake of demanding to continue its colonial  rule in Hong Kong and underestimating the firm confidence and  strength of the Chinese side in safeguarding the principle of  sovereignty. His experience and knowledge is a far cry from  that of the more practical Percy Craddock!    In his article, Percy Craddock also held that "the more we  can work out by agreement, the greater the protection. That is  what made the achievement of the Joint Declaration so  important." Facts have precisely proved this. The signing of  the Joint Declaration has given a definite date for Britain to  hand over Hong Kong to China, has established the principles and  mechanism for close Sino-British cooperation for a smooth  transfer in 1997, and has provided sufficient protection for the  rational interests of the British side in Hong Kong during the  transitional period and after 1997. The principle of  convergence with the Basic Law, the agreements and understanding  between the two sides concerning arrangements for the elections  in 1994-95, and the memorandum of understanding on the new  airport are all beneficial to both sides. As long as the  British side abides by all agreements on Hong Kong between the  two sides, Hong Kong will benefit, and the existing and future  interests of the British side also will be well protected.    The interests of the British side can exist only within  Sino-  British agreements, and not outside them. Percy Craddock has  warned repeatedly that on the issue of Hong Kong, the  Sino-British agreements and understanding cannot be ignored, and  that the road of confrontation with the Chinese side should  never be taken. This should be said to be a rational direction  for protecting the interests of Britain. The purpose of Chris  Patten's persistence in "three violations" confrontation is to  turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political  entity, and to preserve the absolute influence of the British  side so as to grab illegal privileges and the interests of  colonial rule outside the Sino-British agreements. In addition,  Chris Patten's gambling with politics in Hong Kong also has a  personal political objective, but it is evident that all this  will fall through. In addition, the interests of Hong Kong, and  even those of Britain, will be damaged by Chris Patten's  confrontation activities. Is it not very clear, who -- Percy  Craddock or Chris Patten -- as personalities of British  political circles, really is responsible for the interests of  his own country?</p>

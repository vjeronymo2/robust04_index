			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Teachers agree 5% pay deal Scottish teachers' leaders yesterday agreed a two-year pay deal worth just over 5 per cent, as strike ballot papers were about to be sent out over a 2.3 per cent one-year offer. The teachers will receive a 2 per cent increase backdated to April 1, a further 1 per cent from December 1 and 2 per cent from April 1 next year, adding Pounds 75m to the Pounds 1bn a year salaries bill paid by the government and local authorities.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNCILWOMAN ANGRILY DENIES CONFLICT OF INTEREST CHARGE  </P> <P> Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jan Heidt, in an angry outburst at a council  meeting Tuesday night, said a developer had unjustly accused her of having a  conflict of interest that could leave her ineligible to vote on a project  proposed by the developer.  </P> <P> Heidt said she was angered by a letter to the state Fair Political Practices  Commission by Douglas R. Ring, attorney for G.H. Palmer Associates, raising the  issue of conflicts of interest.  </P> <P> Heidt's husband, Gerald Heidt, owns property near the location of a proposed  project by the Palmer firm at San Fernando Road and Sierra Highway.  </P> <P> At a public hearing before the City Council more than a year ago, Palmer's  attorneys had suggested Gerald Heidt's property could constitute a conflict for  his wife.  </P> <P> Heidt said she was tired of having the matter brought up again.  </P> <P> "Mr. Ring, I am tired of being jerked around!" she said angrily. She said  Ring's letter, mailed Tuesday, was filled with "innuendo I resent very much."  She did not read the letter at the meeting.  </P> <P> Councilman Carl Boyer III denounced the letter as well. "I think the letter  alleging a conflict of interest is a filthy smoke screen," Boyer said.  </P> <P> Ring, in an interview, said the letter never mentioned Heidt and sought general  guidelines on conflicts of interest.  </P> <P> He said he only wrote the letter because of recent news accounts which  suggested the Heidt case had never been resolved by the FPPC.  </P> <P> At issue is a proposed agreement that would allow G.H. Palmer Associates to  construct more than 2,400 condominiums in Canyon Country in exchange for $30  million in road improvements.  </P> <P> The road projects are centered in the proposed developments but would help  traffic flow throughout Santa Clarita, city planners said.  </P> <P> The council will hold a hearing to take public testimony on the issue March 27.  </P> <P> The agreement would guarantee Palmer the right to build three separate projects  -- known as Santa Catarina, Vista Terrace and Westcreek -- over 10 years.  </P> <P> Zoning and development requirements would remain constant during the life of  the agreement, thus freeing the developer from potential changes in city  regulations in the future.  </P> <P> The agreement, as approved March 6 by the city Planning Commission, would let  Palmer build 1,452 condominiums in Santa Catarina, 103 condominiums in Vista  Terrace and 903 condominiums in Westcreek.  </P> <P> But Palmer officials want a fourth development, a 800-condominium project  called The Colony, also included in the pact.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission voted to exclude The Colony, saying it had reservations  about residential development on the 43-acre site east of the Antelope Valley  Freeway and west of Woodfall Road.  </P></p>

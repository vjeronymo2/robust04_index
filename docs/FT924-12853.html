			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: Kodaly's Hary Janos' - Concert Although rarely seen outside Hungary, Kodaly's Hary Janos is still a familiar face in his home country. A traveller to Budapest may come across the opera at a Sunday matinee in the city's second opera-house, as I did. If so, he should be prepared for a noisy outing, as the theatre on my visit was filled with enthusiastic children. There were not many smiling young faces in the audience at the Royal Festival Hall on Thursday; nor, sadly, as many faces of any kind as there should have been. This was a disappointing audience for an imaginative programme. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra does not have a record as being the most adventurous London orchestra. and one imagines it could face a hefty loss on a concert demanding so large an orchestra, chorus and soloists. This was doubly to be regretted, as Kodaly's music was given splendid advocacy. The orchestral numbers of the score, mostly marches and interludes of swaggering panache, all Kodaly's own invention, are well-known from the popular suite. It is less widely recognised that the vocal and choral numbers, which the composer took from Hungarian folk music, are just as winning in a different way - magical, comic, sentimental by turn. This concert gave us over half the score mostly in sequence. In fact, continuity is not especially important outside the opera-house. The crucial thing is that the performers should bring to the music the same vivid colours that light up the stage in Budapest. The RPO had a good line-up with two Hungarians, Tamara Takacs and the fine baritone Karoly Szilagyi, as the main soloists and Adam Fischer the dynamic conductor. The music makes good entertainment in the concert-hall, enough to make one wonder if the inimitably Hungarian Hary Janos would work here as an opera. Not at the London Coliseum, as the theatre is too big for the work and its probable audience. Sadler's Wells would be more the size and then it would have to be in English - as Janos Hary presumably, if we are to get the hero's name round the right way. A novelty of a different kind preceded it. This was Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto according to the composer's manuscript, already heard in London in 1988, but now with a shorter version of the first cadenza incorporated. There are few vital differences, but having some extended passages down an octave does give the concerto a calmer, more lyrical aspect. Luigi Alberto Bianchi was the soloist. Sponsored by Candle</p>

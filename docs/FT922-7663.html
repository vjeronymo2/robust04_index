			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Books: Detective friendly - Crime WHAT SHOULD a Detective Chief Inspector be like, ideally? More often than not he is in early middle age, tall, reasonably handsome, long-suffering, considerate of his lower-ranking colleagues, and patient with superiors, even when they are obtuse, demanding and snobbish (a frequent sin among Chief Constables). If he is not divorced or a widower, he is likely to have an even more long-suffering wife, who thoughtfully leaves him cold suppers or a casserole to heat up when she goes to bed before he gets home after a hair-raising, frustrating day. This could be a description, for instance, of Richard Hunt's DCI Sidney Walsh, making his third appearance in Death of a Merry Widow (Constable, Pounds 12.99, 191 pages). Walsh's private life is kept firmly out of the picture: he exists only to investigate crimes, question, ponder, direct his team and - on privileged occasions - have a hunch. Walsh stands in loco auctoris, allowing us to get a closer view of the events as they develop. The real protagonist is the victim, and Hunt - who has deservedly won praise for his preceding novels set, like this one, in Cambridge - builds suspense through the gradual revelation of the murdered woman's real and singular character. The university is less prominent than usual, but there is still a sense of a rarefied atmosphere, with the real world laying siege. Dorothy Simpson's popular Inspector Thanet has a wife, Joan and two children, both of whom give their parents few serious worries But the family serves chiefly as relief, to show that cops do not always bring their work home with them. In the latest, eleventh Thanet story (Wake the Dead, Michael Joseph, Pounds 14.99, 250 pages) the author subtly provides a kind of manual on how to interrogate a witness, how to weigh a reaction, how to pace an approach, when to relax and when to pounce. Real policemen always claim not to read crime fiction: they would do well to read this one, not least because, like all of Simpson's work, it is admirable for its clean writing, shrewd portraits and tight plot. Charlie Salter, Toronto's less colourful but equally human and beleaguered answer to Inspector Ghote, sometimes has rather more private life than he can comfortably handle. In the newest story, A Fine Italian Hand (Collins, Pounds 13.99, 190 pages), his wife Annie is off visiting her parents and the two Salter boys are not much in evidence, so Charlie has more time to deal with what seems to be a Mafia killing in the raffish theatre world. He also has an innocuous encounter with a long-ago girlfriend. A pleasant adventure, though without the excitement of some of the earlier Salter tales. Sometimes understatement can be carried too far. Nothing understated - or pleasant - where RD Wingfield's DI Jack Frost is concerned. As in all the Wingfield books, Night Frost (Constable, Pounds 13.99, 312 pages) is awash with blood and guts. The solution follows a now predictable pattern: initial bewilderment, apparent discovery of the culprit, frustration when the discovery proves erroneous, then final triumph. Frost's running battle with his egregious Divisional Commander provides ample comic relief, when the repetitious murders threaten to pall (problem: how to keep a serial killer from being repetitious?), and his blissfully obscene language is a welcome change from the prissiness of some other DI's. Charlie Resnick, the equally rumpled, unruly anti-hero of John Harvey's novels (the latest is Off Minor, Viking, Pounds 14.99, 260 pp.), bears some resemblance to Frost, but is a more rounded, complete character, still involved, however reluctantly, with his divorced, sick wife. He suffers through his cases, too, and we learn his character as he deals with them. Off Minor (the title is connected with Resnick's authoritative understanding of classic jazz) shows Resnick at his best: sensitive, shrewd, independent. He is a genuine creation. We read Harvey's books not just to find out who killed whom, but to renew our acquaintance - our friendship - with the unique Resnick.</p>

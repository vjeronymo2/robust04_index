			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Business Travel: The fast and the frustrating There are two routes from Boston airport to the city itself (where the market, above, can be found) - the fast way and the frustrating way, writes Kate Bevan. The frustrating way is by road. Although the airport is just 3 miles from downtown, toll payments and heavy traffic in the tunnel under the harbour mean it can take up to 45 minutes to reach the city along Route 1A. The result can be a taxi fare of up to Dollars 20 (Pounds 13.60). There are buses, but there are faster options. The first is by water. A free bus ferries you from the airport to the jetty, where a seven-minute boat ride will deliver you at Rowe's Wharf, close to most downtown hotels. The water shuttle runs every 15 minutes on weekdays from 6am to 8pm, and every half-hour at weekends, from 10am until 11pm on Saturdays and 8pm on Sundays. It costs Dollars 8 one way. The other fast option is to get the subway (on the blue line), where the fare into town will cost only 85 cents.</p>

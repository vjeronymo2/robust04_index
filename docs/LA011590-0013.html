			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCIETY SECURITY EARNINGS CAP  </P> <P> Your editorial advocating the elimination of the Social Security "earnings cap"  was right on the mark ("Time to Eliminate the Inequity," Jan. 7). It is high  time that our nation recognizes the value of our seniors and stops this  counterproductive practice.  </P> <P> I have introduced a bill in Congress (HR 311) that will do just as your  editorial recommended -- remove the earnings limitation altogether. The  earnings test places an unfair penalty on the elderly. I hold by the philosophy  that "a dollar earned is a dollar earned" and I can see no justification for  requiring a forfeiture of $1 in Social Security benefits for every $2 or $3  earned.  </P> <P> Specifically, I believe we should allow senior citizens to maintain full and  productive lives and to earn their full value for any work. These are the  people who possess knowledge and experience that are invaluable to our economy.  </P> <P> REP. RON PACKARD  </P> <P> R-Carlsbad  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATO, EAST BLOC NEAR ACCORD ON 'OPEN SKIES';  </P> <P> SURVEILLANCE: SHEVARDNADZE PREDICTS 'AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE' ON OVERFLIGHTS.  BAKER CITES 'VISION OF A NEW EUROPE.'  </P> <P> Thirty-five years after former President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed it --  and after U-2 spy planes and various spy satellites -- the "open skies" idea  for sanctioned military overflights moved toward reality here Monday with the  opening of a 23-nation conference of NATO and Warsaw Pact foreign ministers.  </P> <P> "Agreement in principle" for the concept, in which each military alliance would  send aircraft over the other's territory, was predicted by Soviet Foreign  Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze before the conference ends in two weeks. A  full-scale agreement on the confidence-building measure is expected before  summer.  </P> <P> "Open skies is potentially the most ambitious measure to build confidence ever  undertaken," Secretary of State James A. Baker III told the conference's  opening session. It is "an integral part of our vision of a new Europe."  </P> <P> The aircraft would be equipped to take photographs with ordinary and infrared  film and with radar. They would also collect other information, including dust  samples that could indicate a nuclear test. Only electronic signals would be  excluded.  </P> <P> They would fly day or night, in all weather, U.S. officials said. The  all-weather capability is important because Eastern Europe is covered by clouds  80% of the year. Until recently, spy satellites could not penetrate clouds or  darkness.  </P> <P> The overflights could occur at "any time, any place" within the limits of  safety, officials said. Satellites, in contrast, follow a highly predictable  course and schedule. It is easy for new weapons and other secret equipment to  be hidden when satellites pass over.  </P> <P> Under the plan, Soviet and East European surveillance aircraft would become a  common sight over Western Europe, the United States and Canada, while American  and West European airplanes would be equally common over the Soviet Union and  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> The open skies treaty, which may later be extended to include the neutral  nations of Europe, is not associated with any arms control treaty. But the  information gathered under it should complement arms treaties and make smaller  nations, particularly those without spy satellites, feel more confident about  their security.  </P> <P> While the continuing negotiations for radical cuts in conventional forces in  Europe "are the primary means to codify strategic stability in the new Europe,"  Baker said, "open skies can and should become a key component of our efforts to  increase predictability while also supporting stability."  </P> <P> Nations will be able to see more clearly than ever before the actions and even  the intent of others, including military exercises in which offensive tactics  may be practiced, and thus reduce the risk of surprise attacks, he said.  </P> <P> Shevardnadze, whose country rejected Eisenhower's proposal in 1955 as an  attempt to spy, called for extending the principle to "open space and open  seas."  </P> <P> He warned that with increasing access to space technology, nations with "crazy"  leaders or even private companies might place in orbit weapons "to endanger  mankind." He urged that an "international space inspectorate" be created to  monitor space activities.  </P> <P> He also renewed Moscow's longstanding proposal for naval arms control. At  least, he said, the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization  should agree to confidence-building measures such as notice of naval maneuvers  and troop transfers.  </P> <P> The United States remains adamantly opposed to any naval arms talks, however, a  senior U.S. official said. "This country is an island nation and needs to  ensure free sea lanes," the official commented, noting that, by contrast, the  Soviet Union is a land power. Any restrictions on navies are certain to limit  the United States more than the Soviet Union, he added.  </P> <P> The open skies idea, revived by President Bush last year, differs somewhat from  Eisenhower's original proposal in that it would cover the two military  alliances, NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The 1955 proposal involved only the United  States and the Soviet Union.  </P></p>

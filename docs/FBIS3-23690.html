Morozova, Geology and Geophysics </F> Institute, Uzbek Academy of Sciences, Tashkent; UDC 528.871]    [Abstract] An analysis of imagery from the NOAA 11 and NOAA  12 satellites (scale 1:25 000 000) revealed cloud anomalies over  faults near the epicenters of earthquakes in Armenia in December  1988 and in Turkey in March-April 1992. No allowance is made for  the possibility of influence of gravity fields. Two photographs  showing the pattern of cloud cover at the time of these events  are interpreted. The appearance of these cloud anomalies gives  evidence of an intensification of tectonic activity in these  regions. For example, the geometry of the cloud lineament  accompanying the Spitak earthquake rigorously corresponds to the  pattern of faults at the surface and therefore this lineament  unquestionably is associated with crustal faults. Other cloud  phenomena included ridges, corridors without clouds and sharply  defined boundaries of cloud masses. Much the same was observed  during seismic events occurring in Turkey. The fact that strong  earthquakes in the Near East were accompanied by an atmospheric  reaction registered on space imagery inspires hope that this  phenomenon can be used in evaluating the tectonic activity of  regions or, in a special case, seismicity. The interrelationship  of the largest faults in the Near East, repeatedly generating  catastrophic earthquakes, as revealed in the studied space  photographs, further confirms the results given earlier by V. G.  Trifonov, et al. in GEOTEKTONIKA, No 6, pp 46-60, 1990. Figures  2; references: 4 Russian.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / The dutiful stampede that never was: David Barchard explains why potential house buyers have been staying at home BUILDING SOCIETIES and other mortgage lenders are bracing themselves for a fall in the number of house sales from tomorrow when the eight months' exemption from stamp duty on house purchases of less than Pounds 250,000 comes to an end. The exemption was introduced by the government in December as a modest gesture to help revive the housing market. At the time the government estimated that in the eight-month moratorium about 600,000 transactions  - or 90 per cent of private house purchases - would not bear stamp duty. First-time buyers purchasing an average property in the south-east were expected to make a saving of just under Pounds 600 on their purchase. But, in the event, the stamp duty exemption has not triggered a widespread market recovery. Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest building society, said at the weekend it had evidence that homebuyers were rushing to complete purchases before stamp duty was reintroduced. Mr Richard Stapleton, managinging director of Alliance &amp; Leicester's estate agency chain, said: 'I believe that there is every chance that some of the sales momentum stimulated by the reintroduction of stamp duty will continue after August 19.' However, some other lenders are more nervous, at least in private. At the back of their minds lurks a comparison with the rush to beat the August 1988 deadline on double mortgage-interest tax relief, which drove the housing boom to its peak. What is striking about the housing market in 1992, in spite of a mild boost from the lifting of stamp duty, is the shrinkage in the property market. In 1988, the peak of the housing boom, building societies and banks between them approved 1.5m loans and other financial institutions brought the total to about 1.7m. Last year, according to the Council for Mortgage Lenders, the number of new residential loans fell to just over 1m. This year the fall in the number of house sales has marched on. In the first half of this year, mortgage loans approved fell by 15 per cent on the same period last year to 477,000. This may understate the problems the market is facing. According to the Central Statistical Office's figures, total property transactions, including commercial as well as residential deals, dropped by 21 per cent in the same period, from 668,000 in the first half of last year to 526,000. The fall in the number of transactions has been much greater in London, the south-east, the east midlands and the south-west than in other parts of the country, although Wales has also fared badly. According to the CSO, transactions in these regions last year fell by more than 40 per cent on those of 1988. The two regions where the housing market has contracted least are the west midlands and the north-west. Even there, it has fallen by about a quarter since the days of the housing boom. For all that, there seems to have been no fall in the number of people who say they are likely to move. Stanliland Hall Associates' index of the number of people who say they are likely to move stood at 105 in July, up from 102 a year ago and 100 at the beginning of the year. The trouble is that would-be purchasers still seem to believe that it is in their interests to postpone a move. Two main factors restrain many people from moving. One is that many would-be second-time or third-time buyers cannot sell up and move on because the value of their house has fallen, perhaps wiping out all or part of the cash they put into it, and perhaps leaving them with 'negative equity' - a mortgage debt larger than the sale value of their house. The other is that although houses have become cheaper and more affordable, many potential first-time buyers are reluctant to buy a house until they are sure that the market has started rising again. However, there are those, such as Halifax Property Services, the estate agency arm of Halifax Building Society, that believe they can see some glimmers of hope. Lex, Page 14</p>

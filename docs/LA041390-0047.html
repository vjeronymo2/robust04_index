			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A SPIRITUAL REFLECTION ON LIFE OF KRISHNAMURTI  </P> <P> Movies about philosophy are so rare that "Krishnamurti: With a Silent Mind"  (Monica Showcase) gets points for daring its subject at all. This multi-faceted  portrait of the late philosopher-teacher-world traveler J. Krishnamurti mixes  archival footage of his life and early years, videotapes, TV shows and  interviews, with extracts from his notebooks, read with studied lyricism over  quiet pastoral scenes.  </P> <P> Krishnamurti is a more fascinating subject than he might first seem, yet the  film is ultimately too worshipful. Producer Evelyne Blau and director Michael  Mendizza want to spread the word, get us to accept Krishnamurti -- or "K" as  his acolytes reverently-affectionately call him -- as a great man. To that end,  they've enlisted several dozen interviewees, who either discuss K.'s life or  praise him to the skies. These interviewees, never identified until the end  credits, distract from the story and subject -- as if the "witnesses" from  Warren Beatty's "Reds" took over the whole last half of the movie.  </P> <P> It's a shame. As we see it here, the story of Krishnamurti's early years --  from his birth in India in 1895 to his great public crisis in 1929 -- has the  subtle twists and turns, the absorbing ironies of a great  philosophical-psychological drama.  </P> <P> A Brahmin Hindu from a civil servant's family, the 16-year-old K. and his  younger brother were spotted near the Ganges one day by a pan-religious British  group called the Theosophists, who immediately recruited him as the potential  next World Teacher, in the Christ-Buddha line. He was brought to England,  sheltered, shown off, educated, indoctrinated. Meanwhile, his little brother,  left behind on a tour in San Francisco, died alone: a loss that shattered him.  </P> <P> In 1929, after Krishnamurti had assumed the leadership of the order of the  Star, he announced that he was dissolving it. Apparently, he renounced his own  destiny, resigned as World Teacher -- while then embarking on the same path,  teaching around the world, which his patrons had mapped out for him. His creed  preached the renunciation of all creeds, the abandonment of preconceptions,  mistrust of potential messiahs. He died in 1986; his admirers apparently  included such crusty skeptics as Bernard Shaw, Henry Miller and novelist Howard  Fast -- interviewed in this movie.  </P> <P> This is a clearly a great story, rife with possibilities for barbed social  satire, and psychological revelation, but after the first half of  "Krishnamurti," Mendizza and Blau don't follow it up. The last 47 years of  Krishnamurti's life are never examined in depth.  </P> <P> Neither, unfortunately, is his philosophy. We learn, vaguely, that he advocates  emptying the mind; wise-crackers will see empty minds behind the entire  project. They're wrong, but we'd like to know what happened to K. afterwards,  how he detached himself from the group and how the Krishnamurti Foundation --  which publishes his writings, distributes his tapes and, not coincidentally,  produced this movie -- was formed. What happened to K.'s old patroness, Annie  Besant? What happened to the Order of the Star?  </P> <P> Those are subjects other movies, unfortunately. What we see here certainly  piques the interest, but it doesn't fully satisfy either the mind or soul.  </P> <P> Still, there's something admirable about a film that so completely disproves  the old adage about the difference between European and American films.  European films, it is said, begin with a shot of clouds, then dissolve to  clouds, then dissolve to more clouds. American movies begin with clouds, then  cut to an airplane, and finally cut to the plane exploding. In "Krishnamurti:  With a Silent Mind" (Times-rated: Family), Mendizza and Blau start us off with  more clouds than even a Swedish pastoralist or Japanese Buddhist director like  Yasujiro Ozu would have dared.  </P></p>

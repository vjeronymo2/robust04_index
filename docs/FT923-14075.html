			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Economic Viewpoint: An appreciative view of the French franc The image of France in recent days has been dominated by blocked roads and railways. Added to these troubles are the political problems of Francois Mitterrand and the president's truculent attitude to agriculture and the Gatt negotiations, which resembles on a larger scale the British make-work attempt to preserve the European Fighter Aircraft. In one case, the French president is trying to preserve unviable farm employment. In the other case, the British government wants to subsidise aircraft jobs rather than promote market-oriented employment. There is, however, another side to the French economy associated with low inflation, competitiveness and an increasing role for market forces. Too much emphasis has been placed among searchers for a European economic model on Germany, which has been lurching away from a social market economy under the domination of interest group politics. The exchange rate mechanism (ERM) was not deliberately constructed by the former leaders Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut Schmidt in 1979 as a German anchor to hold down French inflation. But when it worked out like that, French leaders, as good pragmatists, were happy to embrace it. In contrast, Britain did not join until October 1990 after a bitter and prolonged debate, which shows no sign of dying down. It joined when German interest rates were about to soar, in time to experience the costs of ERM membership. But it has not been inside the system nearly long enough, or in a fortunate enough period, to enjoy the benefits. How do the track records of the two countries compare? On inflation, France wins hands down. In a report on France, published today, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) points out: 'There is no major disequilibrium in the way of French recovery. The household sector is not unduly indebted by international standards, liquidity is adequate and overall balance sheets seem to be healthy. Competitiveness continues to improve as increases in wages and prices have been kept below rates in most other countries.' The current account deficit - for what it is worth - is a much smaller proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) in France. On a comparable basis the French budget deficit is half that of Britain's; and most of what fiscal deterioration there is can be explained by the business slowdown. In terms of consumer prices, French inflation has been below the German level for a year; in terms of the more fundamental GDP deflator, it has been below it for two years. The OECD expects French consumer price increases to fall further from 3 per cent to 2 1/2 per cent next year. But has not France paid a heavy price for reducing inflation via its link with the D-Mark in terms of lost output and jobs? The chart suggests that there is little to choose between Britain and France on average performance. But one difference stands out. Both growth and employment have been far more stable on the French side of the Channel. The recessions of both the early 1980s and the early 1990s have - so far - been much less severe there. France was also spared the very high peaks and unsustainably low troughs that have been such a feature of the British unemployment scene. The immediate prospect is also less unfavourable in France. Growth dipped in 1991 to 1 to 1 1/2 per cent. At least it was still positive. The OECD by 2 per cent this year, compared with barely more than zero in the UK. Even the modest growth recorded in 1991 has placed France in the upper half of OECD countries for the fourth year in a row, and the unemployment rate has risen no faster than elsewhere in Europe or in other OECD countries. Obviously, the current jobless rate of more than 10 per cent is too high, in both France and Britain. The OECD report examines the question carefully and concludes that the high French unemployment rate is due to labour market failure, and is neither caused by, nor can be cured by, exchange rate or other financial policies. It is easier to make this case in France where unemployment is endemic rather than in Britain where it is more clearly linked with the business cycle downturn, which the so-called 'authorities' are powerless to fight with lower interest rates. Of course, there is a black-red coalition in France as well as the UK which sees the ERM as the root of all evil. But the argument does not dominate the economic debate as it does in Britain. The OECD stresses: 'A cheaper franc would not do much to stimulate exports either, given the likely effect on domestic wages and prices. In any case, the logic of the strong franc policy has always been to promote competitiveness through cost moderation rather than to ratify agents' inflationary wage and price setting through devaluation'. Not everything in the French garden is lovely. Indeed, there are lessons from France on what to avoid. What has gone wrong stems more from aspects of social policy than anything to do with the ERM. The supply side of the French economy is held back not by the ERM but by a corporatist legacy, evoked by the OECD's own talk of 'social partners'. Very high spending on labour market programmes has not helped job prospects. Unemployment is particularly concentrated among females and younger or older workers who 'suffer from a lack of adequate incentives to price themselves into work'. The 'floor on the cost of taking on an employee set by the minimum wage and social charges may limit employment of youths especially the least educated'. Indeed, there is a warning in the OECD report about the harm done by an excessively academic educational system, which gives rise to misplaced envy elsewhere. There is talk in British establishment circles of the possible need for an agonising reappraisal policy in a year's time if German interest rates are still acting as a drag on the European economy. It may then be worth considering a direct link-up with France. An incidental benefit of that, often stressed by Lord Cobbold, is that by a happy coincidence of currency units, the freezing of the franc-sterling rate at 10 for one has long looked attractive. The doubt thrown over the Maastricht treaty by the Danish referendum has postponed the chances of an attempt by either France or Britain to reduce interest rates below German ones, and some clarification of the French political scene may be required first. Nevertheless, France is much nearer being able to set the pace of ERM interest rates than the UK is. Having used the D-Mark as an anchor, the French franc is near to attaining independent credibility as a low inflation currency. There is a hint in the OECD report that French interest rates could eventually follow their own path below German ones  - but only on the assumption of there being some prospect of a franc appreciation.</p>

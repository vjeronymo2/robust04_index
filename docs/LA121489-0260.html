			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> EXPOS OWNER MAY SELL BALLCLUB  </P> <P> Montreal Expos owner Charles Bronfman said today he would consider selling the  team but only if the purchaser agreed to keep the club in Montreal.  </P> <P> The Expos owner responded to a report in this week's issue of Sports  Illustrated that said Bronfman wants to sell and that a Florida investment  group in Orlando or St. Petersburg might bid for the franchise early in 1990.  </P> <P> "I'm thinking of selling, but not to just anyone," Bronfman said. "The most  important thing for me is that the team stays in Montreal."  </P> <P> The Expos have lost Mark Langston, Bryn Smith and Pascual Perez to free agency  and replaced them with Joaquin Andujar, Oil Can Boyd and Dave Schmidt.  </P> <P> "The Expos are run by good baseball men," Bronfman said. "Don't worry, we'll be  there this year and we'll be more competitive than some people have been led to  believe."  </P></p>

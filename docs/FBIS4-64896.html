			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with CDU/CSU presidential candidate Roman Herzog </F> by Helmut Kerscher, Heribert Prantl, and Martin E. Sueskind;  place and date not given: "In God's Name, I Will Accept the  Election"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] The  future president will, above all, have to be a president for the  east Germans. Or do you believe that unification has now been  accomplished and that it is important to treat it as something  normal?    [Herzog] No, unification has not yet been completed. In  fact, I am convinced that the need for spiritual unification is  smaller than currently portrayed in the public discussion. Some  people would like to have unified Germans. The Germans have  always been a people with different tribes, and these tribes  have always had completely different views. The citizens in the  new laender are in a very difficult situation. Everyone who has  a heart must primarily take care of them. Thus, the focal point  of attention will certainly be in the new laender in the next  few years.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In the West, France assumes a special  role at Germany's side. Will Poland one day play a similar role  in the East?    [Herzog] I do not know to what extent this would be  possible. In any event, it would be desirable. Our relationship  with Poland is as burdened as our relationship was with France  in the past. A certain reconciliation has been achieved with  France. If something similar were possible with Poland, and  also with the Czech Republic, this would be a big  accomplishment. By the way, I believe that our major problem in  our policy vis-a-vis East Europe is a psychological one. On the  one hand, leaders in numerous capitals have expressed the hope  for a German hegemony over East Europe, but, on the other, they  also voiced the fear of such hegemonial efforts. I think the  decisive political-psychological task in the next few years will  be to dispel such expectations and fears -- not only verbally,  but they must become unfounded.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Mr. Herzog, as president of the  Constitutional Court, you have probably thought and written more  about the meaning of the president's office than any former  federal president. You are quite familiar with the competences  of the head of state. Do you believe that basic or minor  changes are required?    [Herzog] It is impossible for me to run for an office while  at the same time saying what has to be changed. I ask for your  understanding. People are usually referring to the election  procedure when talking about changes. If we had a presidential  system like the one in France or the United States, the  president would naturally have to be elected by the people.  Since we do not have this principle and the president should be  suprapartisan, there can be no middle way. Otherwise Germany  would have to decide in favor of a semi-presidential and  semi-parliamentarian system. However, there is not the slightest  reason for such a step.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You claim that there is no reason.  But would you support such a move?    [Herzog] I would not support it. The idea that the  president's office is weak actually prevails to a certain extent  among the German people. This is due to the fact that they are  convinced that laws, administrative decrees, and such determine  our lives. Yet this is only true to a limited extent. Apart  from that, a moral instance is also needed -- somebody who  admonishes, warns, encourages beyond what is stipulated in the  code of law, as the British claim.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] You are probably the first candidate  for this office who links the acceptance of the election with a  certain condition. Could you explain this condition to us?    [Herzog] My condition is: The required majority must not be  solely achieved with the eight votes of the Republikaner. In  other words: I need 50 percent plus nine votes in the first two  ballots, and nine votes more than the next-strongest candidate  in the third ballot.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Theoretically, this might have the  effect that you reject the election despite a narrow absolute  majority?    [Herzog] Theoretically, this would be possible.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Would it be possible for you to run  again in another round if you rejected the election in the first  ballot? Do you consider that possible politically?    [Herzog] Politically, it is possible. I would even have a  respectable motive. Yet, I do not consider this a likely  scenario.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] However, in the event of this  scenario: Would you run again?    [Herzog] If my party wants that, then I will go through all  three ballots.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] In the unlikely event that you  receive six or eight votes more than the absolute majority  because of a sudden split in the Free Democratic Party of  Germany, would you reject the election?    [Herzog] Yes.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] And run again in the third ballot?    [Herzog] Yes.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Is this not an invitation for your  rivals to proceed in the same way?    [Herzog] My motive is completely different. I believe that  the fight against the Republikaner is a task on the right  fringes of the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union  (CDU/CSU). Thus, the presidential candidate cannot simply say:  I welcome every vote from this side. Second, I want to avoid a  situation like the one in 1969, when the votes of the National  Democratic Party of Germany were decisive in the vote of the  candidates Gerhard Schroeder versus Gustav Heinemann -- which  backfired. I believe it is always better to be open about one's  dealings. The third and most important reason was: If I had  not announced my plans at such an early stage, a journalist  would have called me every morning for the past four months,  asking whose support I want. And I would have had to give  evasive answers, which is not my style. Things are clear for me  in this respect. Of course, I knew that someone would ask  Johannes Rau about the Party of Democratic Socialism at some  point. Yet, this was not my motive, whether you believe it or  not. I acted on the basis of the three motives I just mentioned.    [SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG] Let me ask you one final question,  which results from your commentary on the election procedure  stipulated in the Basis Law. In the event that you are elected  on 23 May at the Berlin Reichstag, will you accept the election  immediately or will you make use of the legal 48 hours for  reflection?    [Herzog] In view of the uncertain situation at the Federal  Postal Administration, I would say, in God's name, I accept the  election.</p>

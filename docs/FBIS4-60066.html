			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sidelines" column by Sabri Hammadi: "Who Did It Then?!"] </F>   [Text] The Saudi regime's foreign minister has said the  Arab Gulf states have been surprised by the military  developments in Yemen, and he called on northern and southern  Yemenis to end the fighting!!    We believe that some Gulf states may indeed have been  surprised by the military developments in Yemen, but certainly  not the Saudi regime. Because we are certain it is behind those  developments. The Saudi regime has played a major role in  plotting against Yemeni unity and fostering the secondary and  marginal differences and disputes which have led to these  military developments!    The Saudi regime, which has fought the Yemeni revolution  since the first hours of its outbreak and cannot bear to see one  unified, progressive, and developed Yemeni Republic, cannot but  conspire against Yemeni unity and encourage war and rebellion  against legitimacy.    When one of the Yemeni unity sides turns to Riyadh and other  Arab and western capitals, and goes to the Saudi capital in  search of "guarantees" for unity, as he claimed at the time,  when he was probably looking for assistance and support for what  he planned and had in mind, it is only natural for the  reactionary, hostile Saudi regime to exploit Arab unity in  general, and Yemeni unity in particular, and to fully exploit  its relationship with that side in order to make secession look  attractive and to instigate that side to escalate the crisis and  ignite the fire of war and sedition.    Sa'ud al-Faysal has lied twice: First, when he claimed that  they were surprised by the military developments in Yemen,  because it was his regime which created the atmosphere and paved  the way for these developments; and second, when he called on  northerners and southerners to end the fighting, because his  regime is interested in the continuation of the war more than  anyone else in order to exhaust and weaken the Yemeni Republic  and waste its military and economic resources.</p>

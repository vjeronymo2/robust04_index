			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / International Company News: Threat to NRMA's ADollars 2.2bn flotation The proposed ADollars 2.2bn (USDollars 1.35bn) float of NRMA, the Australian motorists' and insurance co-operative, has been thrown into doubt by a Federal Court ruling yesterday, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney. The court ruled in Sydney that a meeting of NRMA members to vote on the float, scheduled for October 19, should be postponed indefinitely. It also banned the NRMA from distributing more float prospectuses, describing this as 'conduct which is misleading or deceptive'. The ruling followed an action brought by dissident NRMA directors who object to directions on the matter will be issued on October 25. The NRMA said it would consider an appeal.</p>

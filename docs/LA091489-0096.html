			<p><P> September 14, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> 7 CARS IN FUEL TRAIN DERAIL  </P> <P> Seven tank cars loaded with liquefied petroleum gas derailed near Byron in  Contra Costa County, forcing evacuation of 15 homes, when one of the tankers  leaked a mixture of propane and butane through a broken valve. Emergency crews  stopped the leak, and no one was hurt. The Oakland-bound, 33-car train jumped  the rails about 45 miles east of San Francisco. Southern Pacific Railroad  spokesman Andy Anderson blamed a "mechanical failure" under one of the cars for  the accident.  </P></p>

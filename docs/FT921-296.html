			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Slovenia (11): Focus on expanding markets - Profile: Iskra Telecom THROUGH sheer hard work, skilled expertise, and good business sense, Iskratel, a joint venture company in which Siemens holds a 47.2 per cent share, is thriving. But no thanks is due to the former Slovene government. Iskratel is part of the Iskra Telecom group, the successor of Iskra Telematika which was founded in 1946 in Slovenia to manufacture electronics and high precision equipment. Today, the group consists of 12 companies specialising in the production and marketing of telecommunications equipment, high-quality computer equipment, and services. The majority owner of the Iskra Telecom group is Iskra Telecom Holding which was established in 1989 as one of the first holding corporations in the former Yugoslavia. It controls the programmes and strategies of the dozen companies which are grouped under this parent company. The creation of Iskra Telecom Holding was one of the main prerequisites for Iskratel entering into a joint venture with Siemens. The joint venture was mooted in the late 1980s, when the late Mr Franz-Josef Strauss, former West German defence minister, visited Slovenia. At that time, the Iskra group had already been co-operating for some years with another west European telecoms company. Slovenia's communist authorities, anxious to attract Siemens to the republic, proposed to the Iskra management that if it ended co-operation with the other west European company, it would match the capital put up by Siemens. Siemens, for its part, was anxious to gain a foothold in this part of southern Europe. 'We have not seen one penny from the Slovene authorities,' said an Iskratel employee. 'We really needed that capital to invest and to restructure.' The employee, a computer engineer, said the government created the Iskra Telecom group so as to carve out Iskratel from the core company in such a way that it would be attractive to Siemens. 'The Iskra company was beginning to have financial problems at that time. Naturally, a foreign partner did not want to inherit any debts from our side,' the employee explained. 'Luckily, the joint venture has worked out. But the much-promised capital from the government would have given us greater clout with our foreign partner. We could have marketed our own products more successfully in Europe,' he added. Despite broken promises, and some restructuring difficulties, Iskratel has pulled through successfully, and looks set to strengthen its markets throughout this part of southern and eastern Europe. As a joint venture, Iskratel produces and markets EWSD, a digital electronic switching system for public communication networks. This has been licenced from Siemens. This system is complemented by the Slovene-produced SI 2000 digital switching system which is specifically designed for private and public networks of small and medium capacities, and is particularly suited to rural and less-developed regions. This is licenced from Iskra Telecom. Mr Andrej Polenec, managing director of Iskratel, says the complementary system is very successful. 'The two programmes are compatible and suit the needs of our future strategy,' he explained. Iskratel has its eye on expanding into the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), or the former Soviet Union, eastern Europe, and Turkey. Turnover in exports to the CIS, particularly the Ukraine, amounted to DM10m last year, and in 1991, turnover to Turkey exceeded DM10m, an increase of 13 per cent. 'This part of Europe - the CIS, eastern Europe and Turkey - is potentially a vast market for us,' said Mr Polenec. 'We know the region, we have the contacts and skills from many years experience of working with electronics and telecommunications here in Slovenia, and we are competitive, yet sophisticated,' he said. Iskratel is also determined to capture the large market of the former Yugoslavia. Despite the war, and the change in the units of currencies in Slovenia and Croatia, Iskratel has not encountered any big difficulties in payments with any of the republics. 'For instance, we have concluded business with the republic of Serbia's PTT worth between DM16m and DM17m,' said Mr Polenec. 'When we have payment problems with Serbia, we deal in barter. After all, the economies of Slovenia and Serbia are complementary. In lieu of money, we receive copper and cable, which are the strengths of the Serbian economy,' he said. 'I reckon Iskratel is in a good position to provide the former Yugoslavia with our switching system,' he added. The balance sheet of Iskratel is now healthy. Debts amounting to DM20m have been cleared. Siemens extended a DM20m credit line - in addition to capital  -which is guaranteed by one of Slovenia's largest banks. The company has also been restructured. The workforce has been reduced from 2,200 to 1,100. The initial start-up capital amounted to DM52m, with Siemens contributing DM25m, and Iskra Telecom, DM27m. Turnover last year totalled DM134m, an increase of 30 per cent on the previous year. The company estimates a turnover of DM159m in 1992, reaching DM228m by 1996. About 12 per cent of turnover is earmarked for research and development. Profits in 1992 will exceed last year's total of DM500,000. 'Investments have been considerable. Siemens invested DM25m. The initial investment phase is now coming to an end, so we expect bigger profits,' explained Mr Polenec.</p>

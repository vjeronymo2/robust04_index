			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mazhar 'Arif: "The Crow's Nest""] </F>   [Text] The incident involving two helicopters in Iraqi  Kurdistan must open the eyes of the world public to the nature  of the complicated and grave situation in that dear part of Iraq  under the control of the coalition forces. It should show the  need for action by all possible political means in order to  secure the withdrawal of the aggressors from the region and the  return of the Iraqi Government to Kurdistan to serve our Kurdish  people, as well as peace and stability in that entire region.    Nobody, under the conditions prevailing in Kurdistan, and in  light of the incident involving the two helicopters, can  guarantee the avoidance of an actual military confrontation  between Iraq and the coalition forces. It could happen at any  time the United States or any other aggressor state fabricates  an incident similar to the one involving the two helicopters, or  some other incident, and accuses Iraq of being behind such an  incident in order to carry out an aggression against it. This  is especially true during the interim period prior to the next  UN Security Council meeting, which will decide whether to  increase or reduce the months of the blockade, which is the best  description of the current general trend within the Council,  including the position of three permanent member states that  requested that the chairman's statement on the Council period  meetings include reference to Iraq's cooperation with the world  organization.    The systematic U.S. campaign against Iraq since the last  Security Council meeting, accusing it of violating what is  termed "human rights" and perpetrating attacks on UN employees  and observers in Kurdistan despite Iraq's repeated denials of  these allegations, generally confirms Washington's intentions  against Iraq; namely, to carry out a new aggression against it  without going back to the Security Council. They hope to do  this on the basis that the United States and its collaborators  are not in need of another resolution from the Security Council  in this regard since the Council had previously empowered them  in the session which permitted the 30-state aggression on Iraq  in 1991 to wage new attacks if Iraq declined to implement the UN  resolutions according to their own opinions. If for some reason  the new aggression could not be carried out against Iraq, the  other solutions would be continuing the blockade and keeping the  situation as it is in the Iraqi Kurdistan region on the pretext  of protecting Iraqi Kurds from the Iraqi Army.    We must observe the following:    1. The first announcement about the shoot down of the two  U.S. helicopters came from the sources of the renegades. The  announcement claimed, even before the facts about the incident  became known, that the two helicopters were shot down by the  Iraqi Air Force, a deliberate attempt to mix the cards and  prepare the psychological environment for a military action by  the United States and another ally against Iraq. This is  explained by what U.S. officials had kept repeating, several  hours after the incident, that they were waiting for the  findings from the Coordination Center in Kurdistan and the  European Command in Germany before determining the party  responsible for the incident.    2. U.S. officials kept insisting, despite their admission  that the two helicopters were shot down by two U.S. F-15 fighter  bombers, that the two helicopters were carrying UN personnel,  which was denied by the United Nations. The U.S. aim behind this  was to mislead the world public about the foreign presence in  Kurdistan and to portray it as a UN presence. This also was  refuted by the spokesman of the UN secretary general when he  pointed out that the United Nations had nothing to do with the  different activities of the United States and its allies in  Kurdistan. The U.S. reference to UN personnel was intended to  avert the reaction of the families of the dead Americans,  especially in the present circumstances when the U.S. Congress  is locked in a sharp dispute with the waffling U.S. president  over the Whitewater scandal. So, it was decided to release the  information on the helicopter incident and the nationalities of  the dead men to the American people in installments.    At any rate, our people and the international community need  to be extremely alert so as to confront the intrigues and plans  of the United States, which seeks to greatly harm Iraq by every  means, both inside and outside the UN Security Council, and to  do all it can to make people in the United States and abroad  forget the helictoper incident and to implement new plans  against Iraq.</p>

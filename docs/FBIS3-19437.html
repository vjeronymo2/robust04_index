			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has charged that the Greek  Cypriots are continuing to implement their Akritas plan. This  was obvious during the last meeting of the Greek generals, he  said.    The Council of Ministers convened under President Rauf  Denktas this morning and assessed the developments concerning  the confidence-building measures [CBM's]. In a statement before  the meeting, Denktas said he was meeting with the Council of  Ministers in order to lay the ground for his meeting this  afternoon with Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  deputy special envoy in Cyprus. Denktas pointed out that the  measures will also be assessed by the Turkish Cypriot Republican  Assembly. He noted that the stage of discussing the measures  has now been reached.    The president pointed out that at their last meeting, the  Greek generals clearly showed what they really think about  Cyprus. Their aim is to continue to implement the Akritas plan,  he said, adding that the issue must be assessed seriously. This  is an outright threat, he stressed, and the United Nations will  be informed of the situation by letter. Denktas pointed out  that the behavior of the Greeks runs counter to the contacts  being held by the two sides. If this is the policy of the Greek  Cypriot Administration, he said, then the CBM's have no meaning.    In a statement after the meeting, Denktas said that they  reviewed the benefits cited in the CBM's, as well as the  benefits promised before the measures. We tried to determine  the shortcomings and to work on getting whatever is being  promised, he said, adding: We expected to see the promises  become concrete; instead, we realized that many benefits were  withdrawn. Replying to a question, Denktas said that even  though the principle of secrecy is still valid, he would like to  give an example. Experts said there would be gates and customs  on both sides of Lefkosa [Nicosia] Airport, he said, but now  this clause has been removed. We insist on this clause.    Asked if the Turkish Cypriot side will go to New York at the  end of the month, Denktas said that this can only happen if the  UN secretary general invites him.    Prime Minister Hakki Atun said that a beneficial assessment  was conducted at the meeting and that they discussed the start  and the current stage of the negotiations. He said: We briefed  the Council of Ministers on the views of the coalition parties  regarding the measures. He stressed that they worked in harmony  with the president.    Ozker Ozgur, state minister and deputy prime minister, said  that the issue was assessed by the coalition parties separately  during the Bayram holiday. The Council of Ministers  consolidated the views of the two parties, he said, and  President Denktas will meet with Gustave Feissel in light of  this information.    The Council of Ministers session continued under Atun after  Denktas left the meeting.</p>

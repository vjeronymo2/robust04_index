			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentors including F. Losey of the Shipbuilders Council of America (Ex. 7&hyph;2), D. Knecht of Litton Ingalls Shipbuilding (Ex. 7&hyph;22), and C. Klein of Newport News Shipbuilding (Ex. 7&hyph;71) encouraged OSHA to adopt the SESAC-recommended regulatory text for shipyards (Ex. 7&hyph;2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> J. Collins of Naval Operations objected to OSHA's proposal to apply the construction asbestos standard to shipyard industry because he considered some of the provisions infeasible on vessels (Ex. 7&hyph;52). In his opinion the construction standard requires showers be located at the entrance to the regulated area and that this was not reasonable on small ships like submarines. Other comments, (apparently by others) in this submission expressed the view that shipyard industry activities should be regulated under the construction standard since they are often identical to construction work. To the same effect see Ex. 7&hyph;52.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BCTD stated in its testimony that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;* [It] agrees with OSHA that, because the manner in which maritime employees work with and are exposed to asbestos is similar to the experience of construction employees, the provisions of the construction standard should apply in that industry. In particular, whenever the likelihood exists that asbestos-containing materials will be disturbed in ship repair and renovation, that activity should be conducted under a negative air apparatus. [Ex. 34, p.2] <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The rulemaking process revealed that there was confusion in the shipyard industry sector as to which of the standards applied to the various activities within the shipyard. In his testimony, the Chairman of the Shipyard Employment Standards Committee said: ``In the case of asbestos, both 1910 and 1926 are both applied in various shipyard operations. This is confusing to the shipyard work force who are required to follow one set of rules one day and another set the next day.'' (Tr. 337)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the current revision of the asbestos standards, OSHA has determined that a separate vertical standard for shipyards is appropriate. OSHA understands that many spokespeople for the shipyard industry believe that compliance with OSHA's asbestos standards will be facilitated in shipyards if only one standard applies to those workplaces. Because OSHA wishes to promote compliance, and because the Agency acknowledges that some shipyard conditions are unique, OSHA is issuing a standard that will apply only to shipyard industries. It is neither less nor more rigorous than the general industry and construction standards. How it differs from the two other asbestos standards will be discussed under the topic heading for each substantive provision, in the preamble text which follows. The recommendations will be discussed more fully, following a summary of the relatively small number of comments received by the Agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most provisions in the final shipyard standard include some relevant provisions similar to the revised construction standard. In addition OSHA has incorporated some of the specific recommendations made by the Shipyards Employment Standards Advisory Committee discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Relatedly, the Great Lakes Carriers Associates, representing fleets on the Great Lakes, wanted assurance that asbestos exposures of seamen aboard vessels will continue to be regulated by the Coast Guard under an existing Memorandum of Understanding between the Coast Guard and OSHA (Ex. 7&hyph;8). OSHA does not intend to alter the agreement it has with the Coast Guard. Rather, the maritime standard under discussion concerns shipbuilding, ship repair and ship-breaking activities (29 CFR part 1915, Shipyards).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Definitions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (b) General Industry, Construction and Shipyard Employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA has deleted some definitions which appear in the 1986 standards, and has added others. Alphabetically, the changes are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1986 standards contained an ``action level'' of 0.1 f/cc, one half the PEL of 0.2 f/cc. The action level provides a ``trigger'' for certain duties, such as monitoring, medical surveillance and training. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit instructed OSHA to consider reducing the action level to 0.05 f/cc should the PEL be reduced to 0.1 f/cc. In most single-substance air contaminant standards it has issued, OSHA has set an action level equal to half the PEL. The action level triggers duties of monitoring, medical surveillance, and training, and assures that workers who are not exposed at or above the PEL but who may nevertheless be exposed to levels that present a risk to their health receive a degree of protection. The action level thus helps to reduce residual risk that may remain at the PEL.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In these standards, OSHA has taken a different approach to protecting workers exposed to levels of asbestos below the PEL. Instead of a numerical action level, employer duties involving training and medical surveillance are triggered by exposure to ACM or PACM or by the type of work being done. Additionally, work practices also are required regardless of measured exposure levels. OSHA considers this approach to better protect employees than an action level, which triggers training and medical surveillance duties based on monitoring results. OSHA's approach is particularly appropriate for asbestos because in many cases, asbestos levels below the PEL cannot be reliably measured, and duties tied to an action level might therefore be triggered by measurements of dubious accuracy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [FINSKA NOTISBYRAN report: "EEA Conflict Over Alcohol </F> Monopoly"]    [Text] The EFTA [European Free Trade Association]  countries and the EU [European Union] are agreed that the last  unresolved issues in the supplementary protocol to the EEA  [European Economic Area] agreement must be resolved before the  end of January. The two sides fixed this deadline at the first  meeting of the EEA Mixed Committee in Brussels yesterday.    The issues have to be resolved if the supplementary protocol  is to be able to come into force by the beginning of July at the  latest. Before it comes into force it has to be ratified by the  parliaments of the EU countries and those of the five  participating EFTA countries -- something that will take a few  months.    "If matters are not completed by then the supplementary  protocol could be delayed until the beginning of next year --  something that we must avoid at all costs," said the EC  Commission's Hans van der Pas, who is the chairman of the Mixed  Committee in the first half of 1994.    The supplementary protocol contains around 400 EU laws which  have come into existence since the negotiations for the EEA  agreement were completed.    Around 10 questions remain unresolved, but both Van der Pas  and the EFTA countries' representative on the Committee, Antti  Sauli, believe that it will be possible to resolve them.    Yesterday's meeting was devoted chiefly to organizational  matters, but a first bone of contention regarding the  interpretation of the EEA agreement has already surfaced.    Norway and the EU Commission take different views as to  whether the Norwegian state alcohol monopoly can be reconciled  with the EEA agreement, and the Commission has asked EFTA's  oversight body, the ESA [EFTA Surveillance Authority], to look  into the matter. Norway wants to retain its wholesale monopoly,  but the Commission wants it abolished.    With Finland and Sweden the EU has reached agreement  regarding their alcohol monopolies in their membership  negotiations. The solution was that all monopolies apart from  that in the retail sector will be abolished.    The ESA is currently beginning its work by going through all  legislation regarding the EEA agreement of the five EFTA  countries participating in the EEA.    This review of Finland's, Norway's, Iceland's, Sweden's, and  Austria's legislation will cover laws on alcohol and other  monopolies, and also the free movement of people, and the  abolition of tax and other obstacles to trade. The ESA will  also look at all state support paid out in the five countries.  The work is expected to take several months.</p>

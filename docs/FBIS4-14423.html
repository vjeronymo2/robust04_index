			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report followed by Yuriy Konorov commentary: </F> "Baykonur's Future Decided" -- first three paragraphs are  ITAR-TASS report]    [Text] The changes made to the agreement between Russia  and Kazakhstan on the status of and conditions for using the  Baykonur cosmodrome and the city of Leninsk in literally the  last few hours before the ceremony at which the two countries'  presidents signed it cannot be described as significant.  Moreover, the document preserves the points on which the  Russian side in particular was insisting: a lease period of 20  years with a further 10-year extension, and agreement for  Russian citizens -- servicemen of the Russian Federation  Military Space Forces -- to stay at the cosmodrome and service  it. The only change is that the rent payments are $115 million  a year [as published].    The problems over Baykonur's status in fact started last  summer, when Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev put forward  the idea of turning Baykonur into an international spaceport.    Both sides win from the Baykonur lease arrangement.  Kazakhstan cannot maintain Baykonur on its own: It has neither  the money nor the specialists for this at present. And Russia  would be deprived of a base for launching heavy carrier rockets  over the next few years while it establishes a new cosmodrome.    [Konorov] Now that all the worries are over, we can look  back and recall the circumstances under which the negotiations  took place. The politicians, economists, and legal specialists  spent a long time preparing for them; and, to give them credit,  they prepared well: Every figure was checked down to the last  cent (given that the cost of the rent is in dollars -- 115  million a month) [as published]. It emerges that the Russian  specialists, basing themselves on international experience and  Kazakhstan legislation, insisted that the real cost of the lease  should be $80 million. The Kazakh side took no account of these  arguments. The essence of their claims boiled down to the  statement: "But we need 150 million." The negotiations were  going badly until a "judgment of Solomon" was found. The two  sums would be added together and then divided in half. The  so-called "arithmetic mean" came to 115 million.    In addition, an understanding was reached that a significant  proportion of this sum would be paid "by barter" in the form of  all kinds of services.    How firm is this understanding? Like Russia, Kazakhstan now  has certain obligations to foreign partners to carry out  international space programs. The influence of international  public opinion and the prestige of space powers are arguments of  considerable weight in this protracted dispute.</p>

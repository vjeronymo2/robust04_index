			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UN team urges moretroops for Somalia A CONFIDENTIAL United Nations report has recommended that at least a further 1,000 armed UN guards be sent urgently to protect aid efforts in Somalia, with or without the consent of the warring factions. The controversial recommendation, soon to be put to the Security Council, is made by a UN team which recently visited Somalia. It is likely to antagonise most of Somalia's feuding warlords, who have threatened to fire on UN troops who enter the country without their agreement. The unpublished report says more armed UN guards are necessary to help relief efforts reach an estimated 1.5m people facing starvation in a country where banditry and looting is widespread. An agreement was clinched last week, after months of obstruction by one Somali military faction, to allow 500 UN guards to protect relief operations, but they are confined to Mogadishu. The report recommends that every effort should be made to reach agreement with the warring factions for the deployment of more UN security personnel. But it adds: 'In the event that no agreement is reached the UN should be prepared to do so without the consent of the parties.' The report goes on: 'The essential point is that the international community cannot stand idly and witness the unnecessary loss of human lives in Somalia.' The UN report says at least 500 troops should be dispatched to both north-east and south-west Somalia to protect humanitarian relief operations and safeguard ports, airports and road convoys. It says the troops should be armed with light weapons, armour-breaking weapons, teargas and rubber bullets and have armoured personnel carriers. The report suggests the two battalions should be based in Bossaso, in the far north-east, and Mandera, a Kenyan town on the Somali border. The report, which was presented to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, on Wednesday, also recommends the deployment of further military observers in the north-east, south-west and southern regions of Somalia. Fifty military observers are already in Mogadishu. Other recommendations include: The creation, under UN auspices, of a disarming force which would carry out a 'food for arms' exchange programme. The division of the country into four operational zones. Delivering 39,000 tonnes of food relief each month. The provision of assistance in re-establishing a police force. A non-food aid programme, covering health, water, sanitation, agriculture and livestock. Meanwhile, US and Kenyan officials scrambled to limit the damage after a bruising diplomatic row about the massive US airlift of food to Somalia. US Ambassador Smith Hempstone and the US general in charge of the airlift were summoned for a hurried meeting with President Daniel arap Moi after the Kenyan government protested that the US had flouted Kenyan sovereignty and had not sought proper clearance to send armed troops on to Kenyan soil. Mr Ndolo Ayah, the Kenyan foreign minister, said President Moi had now authorised the first flight of the airlift to Wajir, northern Kenya, and the US and Kenya had established a committee to co-ordinate all details of the relief effort.</p>

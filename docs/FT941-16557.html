			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Mexico City hit by four bombs as uprising spreads Four bombs exploded in Mexico City over the weekend, and a hand grenade was tossed at a government building in the Pacific resort of Acapulco, in further signs of an extension of last week's uprising in the southern state of Chiapas. A group claiming to represent a previously active urban subversive movement, known by its Spanish initials Procup-PDLP, told news agencies it was responsible for three of the attacks. A man claiming to represent the movement told the Italian wire service Ansa that it was acting in 'solidarity' with the self-described Zapatista Army of National Liberation which led the new year uprising in the southern state of Chiapas. The Mexican government has linked the Zapatistas with Procup, and said it has found its propaganda in the Zapatista camps. Another caller, claiming to represent the Zapatistas, claimed responsibility for the first of the bombs. There were no deaths or injuries reported, and Procup, as is its custom, appears to have chosen its targets to cause material damage. The first car bomb, early on Saturday morning, destroyed a car park and damaged nearby shops. Another bomb exploded near a military base in the district of Naucalpan, and two others were planted next to an electricity tower in the district of Cuautitlan. In Chiapas the army continued to seal off the conflict zones as soldiers hunted for the Zapatista rebels. The search is taking place in the hills around San Cristobal de las Casas and other towns which the rebels seized earlier last week. Around 100 people have already died in the uprising, according to official figures. The government said the rebels were 'not an indigenous movement nor is it peasants' action'. They were 'professionals manipulating the disaffected and those who have suffered from recent adverse economic conditions'. The Attorney-General's Office has concluded that of the 30 bodies found in the town of Ocosingo, four had been executed at close range. However, it said that three of them were shot with rifles not used by the Mexican army, ruling out the possibility, in its view, of army responsibility. It said an investigation would continue to determine who was responsible. The bodies appeared to be those of Zapatista rebels.</p>

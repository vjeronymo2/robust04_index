			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (3): A tightening of the rules / Regulation will match that in other centres Barring last minute complications, the second Finanzmarktforderungsgesetz - Financial Markets Promotion Act - will become law on August 1 this year. The new law fulfils a pledge made by Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, at the beginning of 1992 when he promised to introduce legislation to strengthen the standing of Finanzplatz Deutschland, Germany as a financial centre. The Act, which implements European Union legislation outlawing insider dealing and promotes a number of 'shareholder-friendly' revisions of corporate law, will bring Germany into line with the regulatory framework prevailing in the world's leading financial centres. 'Germany has finally agreed to implement this law in order to create an environment for banks and other financial institutions which is competitive and acceptable internationally,' comments Mr Kersten von Schenck, a partner in Punder, Volhard, Weber &amp; Axster, a leading German law firm. The law is not without controversy in Germany: for some businessmen it represents the imposition of an alien, Anglo-American regulatory model on the Finanzplatz. 'But on the issue of insider dealing for example,' says Mr von Schenck, 'you can't stand up to majority opinion in world financial markets - not if you want to be accepted as a major financial services centre, that is.' The main provisions of the act are as follows: Insider dealing becomes a criminal offence, subject to a jail sentence of up to five years and or a substantial fine. Currently, insider dealing is not a crime in Germany, although many banks and companies follow a voluntary code of conduct outlawing the practice of dealing in securities on the basis of privileged information. A new Federal Supervisory Office for Securities Dealing will be established, a German version of the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The so-called Bundesaufsichtsamt fur den Wertpapierhandel will be based in Frankfurt and will be responsible for policing Germany's securities markets in conjunction with individual stock exchanges and state governments. New disclosure requirements will be established, under which the threshold at which stakes in other companies must be disclosed will fall from 25 per cent to 5 per cent of the voting rights. Share stakes will also have to be disclosed as they move through successive barriers  - 10, 15 , 25 and 75 per cent of the voting rights. This implements the EU Transparency Directive and will do much to improve the lack of disclosure which characterises corporate stake-building in Germany. The new act will introduce an amendment to the Stock Corporation Act (the Aktiengesetz) which will allow companies to reduce the nominal value of shares from DM50 to DM5. This is designed to reduce the top-heavy share prices prevalent on the German stock - share prices of DM500 or even DM1,000 are common - which are deemed to put off small investors. Money-market funds - short-term investment vehicles popular in countries such as France or the US - will be allowed for the first time. This provision was introduced into the legislation only in May after the Bundesbank dropped its opposition to such funds. Several of the most important measures - for example those banning insider dealing and introducing new disclosure requirements - do no more than implement, somewhat belatedly, EU legislation. But the collective impact of the new piece of legislation, which has all-party support in the German parliament and seems set to be enacted this summer despite the distractions of an election year, will be substantial. It will counteract a series of mini-scandals in Frankfurt which - although none have been as serious as any one of a crop of important scandals in the UK or the US in recent years - have done much to tarnish the image of the Finanzplatz. These started with an insider dealing probe at Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, in the summer of 1992, which led to the sacking of senior Deutsche personnel for breaches of internal rules. A Frankfurt Stock Exchange enquiry said there was no evidence of insider dealing but Deutsche has never disclosed which internal rules were broken. Last year, Mr Franz Steinkuhler lost his job as head of the IG Metall union after allegations of insider dealing on shares in a Daimler-Benz holding company. He was alleged to have profited from information gleaned as a member of the Daimler-Benz supervisory board. The 'scandals' of 1992 forced the big banks to put their house in order  - appointing compliance officials to police new rules. Internal rules were introduced to ban the practice of front-running - placing personal share orders before executing a large order on behalf of a client in the hope of profiting from the share price movement - and to encourage Anglo-American-style chinese walls between different departments, with the aim of eliminating conflicts of interest. Even if insider dealing is no longer prevalent in Germany, as senior businessmen argue, the new law will send a strong signal to the international financial community that Germany is serious about promoting its underdeveloped financial services sector. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, said last year that one of the reasons why it decided to make a big commitment to the Frankfurt Finanzplatz was because of the new legislation. However it would be wrong to expect the new law to transform the German financial services landscape overnight. As is often the case in Germany, change will be slow and the new securities and exchange commission will not be up and running until well into next year. Important pieces of financial legislation are not included at all - for example regulations on takeovers . The biggest danger is that the new legislation proves too cumbrous - the three-tiered structure for regulating the securities industry, for example, looks extremely complicated, the product of political compromises rather than an ideal solution. But the new legislation will improve the image of Germany as a financial services centre, with tangible benefits for German companies and banks. It will help German companies raise funds more easily with international investors. The German securities and exchange commission will be able to represent the interests of the German securities industry at conferences of international regulators. Hitherto, German interests have been represented by government officials or not at all. In the absence of a German securities and exchange commission, it has also been difficult for the Deutsche Terminborse, the German screen-based derivatives market, to obtain recognition for its products outside Germany. With the new body, this will change.</p>

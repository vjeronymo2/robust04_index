			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REVIEW OF ERASURE CONCERT HARPED ON SEXUALITY  </P> <P> After reading your review of the Erasure concert ("Capering Andy Bell Leads  Erasure Through Zesty Evening" by Mike Boehm, Calendar June 18), I was pretty  upset. For me and for three good friends of mine, this was our first concert,  and we were very excited. Naturally, our hopes were high for this concert, and  Erasure proved very quickly to be a very enthusiastic group. The four of us, as  well as many others at the concert, knew of the two men's homosexuality. That  had absolutely no effect whatsoever on our feelings toward the music or the  band.  </P> <P> Erasure's performance was nothing short of awesome. Maybe I feel this way  because this was my first concert, but I'm almost positive that I really  enjoyed the concert to the fullest.  </P> <P> One of the most eye-catching lines in the article is this: "Bell didn't make a  big point of his sexuality. . . ." I (also) didn't feel that Andy Bell made any  special attempts to "exploit" his sexuality. In your article, however, there  was one basic theme that you seemed to revolve around: Bell's sexuality! Your  review didn't seem to be much of a review. It was more along the lines of gay  performers and how much straight people love to see them perform.  </P> <P> I think that most of the people there were able to overlook the sexuality of  the two singers and enjoy the concert. It was neat. Nobody was making  derogatory remarks that are usually heard when there are a couple of gay people  around. I don't believe that I lowered my guard for the fun that they provided,  and I'd like to believe that the other 10,000 there didn't either.  </P> <P> You did Erasure an injustice by your constant harping on their homosexuality.  If you went to a concert to later offer a review, please do that. Don't stoop  to the level of bigotry that a lot of society has. Offer your readers an  evaluation of the concert and Erasure's wonderful ability to give a stage  performance that kids and adults will never forget. Please don't make such a  big deal about their choice of life.  </P> <P> LESLIE CARR  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg April 17 SAPA -- The planned Inkatha  Freedom Party Youth Brigade [IFPYB] march through Johannesburg  on Monday [18 March] has been postponed, but rolling mass action  would continue at a later date, possibly Tuesday, IFPYB  executive committee member Sipho Mathobela told a news  conference in Johannesburg on Sunday.    But he evaded questions on whether the mass action would be  provocative by saying: "Mass action will take place. The date  will be announced late tomorrow (Monday). It will be peaceful,  very, very peaceful and non-violent."    The brigade's executive committee was meeting the IFP's  Executive Committee to discuss plans for the protests, he said.    Mr Mathobela said the march would have to be held in  Johannesburg because eight Zulu marchers were killed outside the  African National Congress headquarters at Shell House in  Johannesburg. He said people could decide themselves whether to  take part in the stay-away and wreath-laying ceremony outside  Shell House.    When the IFP Youth Brigade first announced its planned  week-long stay-away on Friday, PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] regional chairman Charles Lilowe said only  journalists, students and civil workers were exempted from the  call.    Youth brigade members at the media briefing said they could  not comment on details of the planned mass action because it was  being discussed at the moment. They insisted the march would be  peaceful.    But the march would go ahead by force if police did not give  permission, brigade PWV Regional Secretary Carter Ndlovu said.</p>

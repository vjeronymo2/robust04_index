			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Bank chief warns on Polish interest rates THE debate over easing Poland's monetary restrictions has been joined by Mr Andrzej Topinski, acting head of the country's central bank. His warning that the bank would not agree to a base rate much below the level of inflation came as a draft budget was being prepared by the government. The controversy became public as a senior International Monetary Fund team left Warsaw. The country needs an agreement with the IMF if disbursement of a three-year Dollars 2.5bn loan facility suspended last year is to be resumed. Mr Topinski said in a newspaper interview that the bank would not lower its base rate to between 25 and 28 per cent as long as the government continued to run up a budget deficit, which could reach Zl 60,000bn (Pounds 2.9bn) this year or 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product. He appeared to be arguing against Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, the senior minister responsible for the economy, who is looking for ways of reviving Poland's recession-bound state owned industries without igniting hyper-inflation. Mr Eysymontt wants to see a base rate at around the inflation rate which he estimates will reach 35 per cent this year. The central bank's stance strengthens the hand of Mr Karol Lutkowski, finance minister, who is arguing that interest rates have to stay around their present 40 per cent annual level if the budget deficit is to be financed. The Finance Ministry agrees the inflation rate will reach 35 per cent this year or half of its 1991 level. Mr Eysymontt would also like to see an exchange rate 'which would avoid an appreciation of the zloty'. Here Mr Topinski wants to leave his options open, maintaining that exchange rate policy should not be strictly linked to the inflation rate but to the state of 'foreign currency reserve levels', as well as other factors.</p>

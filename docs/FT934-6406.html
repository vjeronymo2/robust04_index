			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Accountancy Column: Standards setters try to hammer out differences - Encouraging signs of a move towards harmonisation of financial reporting The third annual meeting earlier this month of standards setters from around the world highlighted some important lessons in the changing attitudes of international accounting across borders. Representatives from 16 developed countries as well as the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), the EU and the European Accounting Federation (FEE) gathered in London following previous meetings in Brussels and New Jersey. Harmonisation of standards was not formally on the agenda, but one underlying purpose was to curb further diversity in financial reporting. David Tweedie, chairman of the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and the conference host, suggested that the IASC conceptual framework would provide a useful basis for analysing accounting issues. However, he implied that some countries were seeking 'ideal standards' and greater convergence in reporting might emerge by these countries taking the lead and influencing others. This reflects Tweedie's belief that good accounting will be achieved by clear-thinking pioneers of new practices. It represents a challenge to the IASC, which has traditionally been represented by senior members in professional bodies and has been tied by the need for consensus. The discussion and presentations, which took place over two days in London, displayed just how wide are the differences in the objectives of financial reporting around the world. While the function of accounting is perceived as serving different needs in different social and economic environments, agreement on individual issues is hard to secure and harmonisation remains an uncertain goal. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is changing. Compared even with last year's gathering, sponsored by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the mood was subtly different. Only the delegates from FASB itself seemed entirely at ease with the debate format, but most participants were more relaxed and showed a surprising willingness to drop their defences and discuss issues on a conceptual basis, sometimes in sharp contrast to the principles adopted in their own jurisdictions. The agenda contributed to the emphasis on concepts. Most of the first day was taken up considering a number of simple case studies appended to a substantial paper on Accounting for Future Events. Introducing the paper, Jim Leisenring, FASB deputy chairman, said that his organisation, and the standards setters in Australia, Canada, Britain and the IASC all shared very similar conceptual frameworks but none the less entered into 'some heated debates' over the issues involved. One case study was of a retail store which paid out Dollars 30,000 on a single injury claim from a customer in three years and had decided, on the basis of past experience, to charge Dollars 10,000 each year as a 'self-insurance' expense, recognising that a corresponding liability would grow while no claims arose. Participants were asked to consider whether this store should recognise this 'self-insurance' liability in its accounts. Seven argued that it was a general business risk and should be accounted for only as and when the expense arose. Five were adamant that there was a liability and it should be recognised. Geoffrey Whittington, academic adviser to the ASB, said accounts were supposed to state the position at a point in time and the liability should be recognised only when a risk had occurred. Herman Marseille from the Netherlands, and Karel van Hulle, head of accounting at the European Commission, agreed, adding that there would be a liability only if there were a legal duty to insure. Atle Johnsen from Norway and Heinz Kleempker from Germany argued that the risk could be assessed and quantified by insurers, whether or not the store paid for insurance - so it was a liability and should be recognised. Interestingly, Dietz Mertin from the German Institute of Accountants disagreed with his countryman and argued that the compensation payments were a general business risk for which there should therefore be no recognition. Such disagreements are more common in the US. On the second day, Jim Leisenring told delegates that FASB wants to revise the rules for consolidated accounts, but cannot get agreement on a new definition of a subsidiary. Its board cannot reach the necessary 5-2 majority on any definition that goes beyond the traditional ownership of 50 per cent plus one of the voting shares. A session on accounting for goodwill on acquisitions proved contentious: international practice varies widely and, as Leisenring said at the end of the debate: 'I don't think it fits in with any of our conceptual thinking. We ought to work harder at it than we already have.' A position paper was presented by Dominique Ledouble of the Conseil National de la Comptabilite who said there was pressure in France for flexible rules on intangibles, to match those of the UK. Three years ago France had moved to allow goodwill to be carried, but amortised. However, 'numerous kinds of new intangibles' - such as brands, patents, lists etc - were emerging and these were more and more difficult to measure and, in most cases, were not depreciated materially. Allan Cook, ASB technical director, emphasised the importance of the issue in the UK. In the early 1980s the proportion of goodwill in the accounts of acquiring companies amounted to 6-7 per cent. By mid-1987 this had risen to 44 per cent. Cook called for all intangibles to be treated in the same way. Tweedie ended this debate on goodwill with a plea that the standards setters should listen to what industry was saying. The problem in the UK was with service companies, he said. They argued that the value of goodwill was rising, so why should they amortise? 'A lot of industrialists simply don't understand what we are trying to do with goodwill - 93 per cent of industry respondees said 'rubbish' to a 20-year write-off,' said Tweedie. Meanwhile, internally generated intangibles tended not to get on to the balance sheet because such assets frequently fail reliability/recognition tests. 'So we must look at it again, from scratch,' said Tweedie. Warren McGregor, executive director of the Australian standards setting body, gave a presentation on accounting for leases. He argued that the leasing standards that involved capitalisation of finance leases were fundamentally flawed. The correct approach was to capitalise all leases, subject only to a materiality threshold. Van Hulle said that some European countries had difficulty in accepting that the same asset might appear in several balance sheets at the same time. There were different legal frameworks in different countries and reporting rules for financial institutions in particular made lease accounting a highly problematic issue. He added that to put economic benefits on the balance sheet as an asset was to open up a 'Pandora's box'. Tweedie emphasised the inadequacy of the present arrangements, saying there were airlines flying round the world with no aircraft on their balance sheets. Leisenring argued that the key question for the standard setter was whether the accounting captured the economic reality. The conference showed, beyond doubt, that what constitutes economic reality depends upon where you live: is it the tax collector's reality, the stock market's reality or that of the creditors?

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irma Franco] </F>   [Text] Foreign Cooperation Minister Erwin Kruger reported  that during the first working meeting between the Taiwanese  president's delegation and the Chamorro cabinet officials from  both nations acknowledged the economic progress made in four  years of government with the support of the Republic of China  and the pardoning of 75 percent of Nicaragua's debt.    This working meeting was attended by the minister-president  of the Council of Economic Planning and Development, the  president of the Federation of Industries and Chambers of  Commerce, and the minister-president of the Central Bank of  Taiwan.    Social Action Minister William Baez, the Central Bank  president, the foreign relations minister, and the economy  minister represented Nicaragua.    Among the topics discussed were the structural adjustment,  economic stabilization, foreign cooperation, continued support,  and the market economy.    Kruger affirmed that a document pardoning 75 percent of  Nicaragua's debt with Taiwan and outlining cooperation for the  1994-96 period will be signed today. The cooperation accord  will be defined in this second round of meetings.    Social Action Minister William Baez said the meeting was  fruitful because the economic cabinet was able to explain the  problems with the debt payment. He added that the Taiwanese  officials expressed their firm interest in continuing to support  Nicaragua.    Baez asserted that the issue that most impressed the  Taiwanese delegation was the 20-percent growth in the  agricultural sector, a figure they considered very high.</p>

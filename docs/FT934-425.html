			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Affairs of the Art: Bowled over by Beethoven - Music Nobody should doubt the importance of music-teaching in schools. My school used to run regular trips to London for concerts and operas, usually one or two a term. It was as much an excuse for an evening out as anything else, but at least young minds came to associate music with having a good time, which is no bad thing. My first outing was to The Magic Flute by Sadler's Wells Opera, about which I remember nothing except that Sarastro's priests were dressed in a gaudy orange which I thought very tasteless. The next trip made more of an impression. Indeed, it changed the direction of my life. We went to the penultimate night of the Proms, an excellent seat I recall, directly above the royal box. (It was possible to drop sweet-wrappers down on to the crown below.) The main work was Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which I had not heard before, and even the vagaries of the Royal Albert Hall's acoustics could not dull the music's power (I distinctly remember seeing the conductor finish the symphony and the promenaders jump to their feet before I heard the final chord). The thrill and power of the music left my head spinning. I went out the next day and bought my first classical record. The only comparable experience came years later. English National Opera had put on a production of Massenet's Werther, then a rarity, for Janet Baker. The first two acts seemed to me sentimental in just the way I had imagined Massenet to be from the snobbish criticism he used to get in those days, but the third act held me rivetted. As Werther and Charlotte circled each other at their fateful Christmas Eve meeting, I was swept away with the intensity of it to a world far removed from St. Martin's Lane. Only when the curtain came down for the interlude did I regain my bearings. My forehead felt cold and damp, so I lifted a hand to wipe the sweat from my brow and was surprised to find bits of paper stuck to my fingers, dropping on to my face. I had just ripped the programme to shreds. What the people around me thought I do not know. Either they had been as engrossed as I was or they were asleep. Unfortunately, given Massenet's lack of popularity with British audiences, I suspect the latter.</p>

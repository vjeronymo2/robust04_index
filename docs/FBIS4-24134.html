			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Zairian territory is serving as a base for French  troops in Operation Turquoise, a mission that France has termed  humanitarian and that it claims is aimed at saving the civilian  population who are in danger of being exterminated.    The French units are based in Goma and Bukavu at the  Zaire-Rwanda border, from where they have been making incursions  into Rwandan territory since this afternoon. A third base is in  Kisangani, where French Army planes are stationed. In all,  2,500 troops have been mobilized today. A security corridor has  been established from Goma to evacuate the 8,000 Rwandans  trapped in (Assiengoungou). France has given assurances that  its troops will not go as far as Kigali. According to French  Defense Minister Francois Leotard, the mission is strictly a  humanitarian and not a peacekeeping one.    The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], however, is opposed to  the  French intervention. The front says France is using Operation  Turquoise as an alibi to give the Rwandan Army a helping hand.  The Rwandan interim government thinks the French intervention  should cover the entire territory.    According to a communique issued by the Rwandan Embassy in  Kinshasa, the priority concerns for this humanitarian action  should be to break the war trend which these hardened firebrands  are bent on pursuing and ensure security conditions which would  enable displaced people and war victims to get out of the mental  and financial distress resulting from the continuation of  hostilities, which RPF sponsors are staking on.    The communique further stated that it is absolutely urgent  for Rwandans to get out of this tragedy and for the  international community to get mobilized and respond effectively  to the people's distress calls. It also stated that the  cease-fire is constantly being violated by this indisciplined  group under the command of officers who thirst for power and  blood and who had moved up in rank in Uganda in the Army of,  quote, the former rebel, Museveni.

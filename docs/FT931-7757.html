			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Pay for top jobs shows small rise TOP JOB vacancies handled by headhunters last year paid just 1 per cent more than equivalent vacancies in 1991, according to an analysis of more than 2,000 unadvertised posts. Executive vacancies in London and the south-east continued to command the highest salaries in spite of reductions in job opportunities throughout the region. London and south-east pay averaged Pounds 51,800 compared with salaries offered to senior managers in central southern England (Pounds 46,800) and the north (Pounds 46,300). At the bottom of the league were East Anglia (Pounds 44,900) and the south-west and Wales (Pounds 44,300). There was a drop of 7 per cent in executive vacancies in the Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 50,000 pay band last year according to InterExec, the outplacement consultancy that conducted the survey. At the same time, there was a 5 per cent rise in opportunities for those earning Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 100,000, indicating that companies were still willing to pay for top performers. Executives overwhelmingly chose cash over a company car when changing jobs, said Mr Nick Hawkins, InterExec's chairman. 'While salaries remain static, the car as a status symbol - known as the 'driveway syndrome' - is likely to become even more pronounced,' he said. Overall, there would be an excess of middle and senior managers for the next five years, which meant that most executives were likely to see their pay frozen for some time, said Mr Hawkins. The figures 'appear to support the view of many major employers that by 1995 the annual salary review will be the exception rather than the norm', he said.</p>

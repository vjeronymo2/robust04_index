			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TIRED OF LONG HOURS;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS, INTERNS STAGE UCI SLEEP-IN  </P> <P> About 20 medical residents and interns staged a "sleep-in" in front of UCI  Medical Center on Thursday to protest the long hours -- sometimes 36-hour  shifts and 100-hour workweeks that have been the traditional regimen of  physician training.  </P> <P> "If I can crash a car, I can certainly make mistakes in the operating room,"  said Gina Angiola, a third-year resident in obstetrics who joined with 20 other  residents and interns in a short protest. Angiola said she fell asleep while  driving home after a 36-hour shift in April and smashed into a utility pole in  Seal Beach.  </P> <P> Dr. Tom Nelson, an associate dean of the medical school, said he sympathized  with the protesters and noted that the institution was moving toward  controlling the number of hours they are forced to work.  </P> <P> "An 80-hour week is what we're working toward and we are already there in all  the specialties, except obstetrics and gynecology and surgery," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Artificial Caps Called Difficult  </P> <P> Placing artificial caps on the working hours of surgeons is difficult, Nelson  said, because they often have to be at the operating table for many hours.  </P> <P> "If a law says they have to leave after a 12-hour shift, it leaves no  flexibility," he said.  </P> <P> Allan Brill, executive director of the California Assn. of Interns and  Residents, said California should follow the lead of New York, which this month  put regulations into effect that limit a single shift for young doctors to 24  hours and a workweek to 80 hours, averaged over four weeks.  </P> <P> "The University of California, the California Medical Assn. and the Hospital  Assn. do not want this legislation," Brill said. "Last year they stonewalled  it."  </P></p>

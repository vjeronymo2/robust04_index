			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Federal authorities should expand their tough new anti-terrorism measures to  cover foreign air carriers with landing rights in the United States, said the  chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), in a  letter to Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, said he was "dismayed"  that emergency security precautions taken after the holiday bombing of Pan Am  Flight 103 over Scotland, which claimed 270 lives, apply only to domestic  carriers with international flights. "I do not think it requires a quantum leap  in logic to conclude that as it becomes more difficult to penetrate the  security of U.S. flag carriers because of their superior security systems, the  terrorist threat may well shift to foreign air carriers. . . . " Bentsen said.  About half of Americans traveling abroad fly on foreign carriers, he said. Last  December, the Federal Aviation Administration announced tightened security  procedures by U.S. air carriers at 103 airports in the Middle East and Western  Europe.  </P></p>

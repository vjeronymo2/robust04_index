			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Dividend worry hits Barclays SHARES in Barclays Bank fell sharply at the start of trading as the market became increasingly concerned at the possibility of a cut in the bank's dividend. Turnover of 25m shares has only been higher in the stock once in the past five years - the day after Britain left the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Even the announcement of an interest rate cut was not enough to get the shares out of the doldrums. They recovered as Barclays, with most other banks, cut lending rates to 8 per cent, but the optimism did not hold and in the afternoon the stock eased back to close a net 21 off at 317p. Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker, confirmed it was forecasting a dividend cut by Barclays. The house was telling clients that the bank should come out with 15p in February against 21.15p a year ago. The house also believes the bank could well announce a pre-tax loss of Pounds 94m; it had previously pencilled in a profit of Pounds 188m. Laing is especially concerned about the amount of loan write-off the bank will have to make - particularly following its association with Olympia &amp; York. ICI forecast cut The price of Imperial Chemical Industries was hit by a sharp revision from securities house Smith New Court. The shares closed a net 25 lower at 1027p after the house cut its 1993 profit estimate from around Pounds 825m to Pounds 775m and cautioned that it could drop further. The house also believes that the dividend is so thinly covered that the share price needs to reach 900p before the yield matches the inherent risk in buying the shares. Smiths has taken a harsh view of ICI's prospects for some time but the latest view comes when many analysts were beginning to wonder if the shares were low enough to present a buying opportunity. Mr Charles Lambert, of Smiths chemicals team argues however that there is every possibility that the dividend might be cut and that the demerger proposed for next year could be postponed. 'It is hard to see how it (the demerger) enhances shareholder value,' he said. The team is busily preparing a demerger valuation for the group which it expects to publish after third-quarter figures are released at the end of the month. Guinness falls International drinks group Guinness tumbled 15 to 527p as rumours abounded of downgrades from two leading houses, one of which was denied and the other unconfirmed. Guinness has come under pressure in recent weeks as analysts have questioned the company's rating in the market in relation to what is perceived as its limited scope to secure continued profit growth. Several houses have downgraded their profit forecasts recently. and observers believe Guinness shares, currently at a 4 per cent premium to the market, will remain under pressure. A flurry of excitement greeted the news that RHM (Ranks Hovis McDougall), subject to a Pounds 680m bid from Hanson, will demerge into three separate companies by December. Analysts said that the plan would give some of the value of the Hanson takeover - which most believe will presage the break-up of the group - to shareholders should RHM fight Hanson off. Since Hanson made its 220p a share cash offer last week, RHM's shares have been stuck around the 240p level in the hope of attracting a higher offer. Yesterday's move by RHM added a further 10p, although the shares later retreated to close a net 5 up at 246p. The Pounds 24m sale of its bakery division to RHM boosted Dalgety, the shares jumping 9 to 431p. Hopes of further rationalisation in the industry lifted Associated British Food, 9 higher at 453p. A large line of stock in Dixons, 3m believed to be on offer at 199p, failed to find a home in early trading and was then quickly withdrawn after the rate cut announcement. The shares advanced 4 to 209p. Kingfisher lost 3 to 505p, unhinged by a placing of 1.5m shares at 499p. Abbey National saw the heaviest turnover in the market yesterday - 28m shares. Most of the business consisted of an agency cross of 12.2m shares dealt at 313p and representing about a 1 per cent stake in the company. The shares rose 10 to 314p, mainly in response to the latest interest rate cut and Abbey's statement that it would cut mortgage rates again. A healthy rise for Shell Transport reflected yesterday's sharp currency shifts. A fall in sterling against the dollar boosts earnings because of the translation effect and strength in the D-Mark lifts the dividend because of the guilder link through Royal Dutch Shell. The stock lifted 10 to 532p on heavy turnover of 8m. Enterprise fell a further 15 to 408p on continuing concerns about its imminent New York listing. Burmah lost 14 at 618p with Kleinwort Benson warning that the company was most exposed in the sector to a downturn in France and Germany and Smith New Court said to have cut forecasts. Water stocks were strong as the market responded to Thursday's interim pricing agreements with the official regulator. Thames was especially buoyant, jumping 20 to 460p. The regional electricity companies held firm but the two generators fell as regulatory worries continued, along with concerns over the impact of a possible coal strike. Lehman Brothers upgraded Wellcome which recovered 18 to 949p following recent falls. Mr Stewart Adkins of the US investment house raised his 1993 earnings per share forecast by nearly 7p to 50.5p and argued that the group had strong volume growth plus opportunities for margin expansion, cash generation and tax rate reduction. Glaxo Holdings picked up on a buoyant annual meeting and an analysts' recommendation. Glaxo said it had made a good start to the current year, which began in July, but much depended on the introduction of its five new drugs to the market. Lehman Brothers raised its forecasts to reflect new exchange rate estimates. The shares firmed 5 to 786p.

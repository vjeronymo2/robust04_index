			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Viacom seeks another gem for its crown jewels: Martin Dickson reports on the Dollars 8.2bn bid to take over Paramount VIACOM International, which made an Dollars 8.2bn (Pounds 5.3bn) agreed bid on Sunday for Paramount Communications, has brushed aside speculation that the deal might flush out a rival bid for Paramount from companies associated with Mr John Malone, one of the most powerful figures in the US cable television industry. Mr Sumner Redstone, Viacom chairman, said: 'You may be anticipating a war that doesn't exist.' Viacom, a fast-growing cable television company best known for its MTV pop music video channel, agreed to pay Dollars 69.14 a share in cash and stock for each share in Paramount, the film production and publishing company, based on Friday night's stock market closing quotes. The offer consists of Dollars 9.10 in cash, 0.1 of a share of class A Viacom voting stock and 0.9 of a share of class B non-voting stock. The agreement installs a poison pill to deter rival bids: if the deal is terminated Paramount will pay Viacom Dollars 100m. Viacom's A shares fell Dollars 1 7/8 to close at Dollars 64 1/8 yesterday and its B shares were down Dollars 2 5/8 at Dollars 56 3/4 , reducing the offer to Dollars 66.58 a share and the value of the bid to Dollars 7.9bn. Paramount rose Dollars 3 3/8 to close at Dollars 64 1/2 . There has been speculation on Wall Street that the deal could prompt a rival bid from Mr Malone, who heads both Tele-Communications Inc (TCI), the largest US cable TV service company, and Liberty Media, which has a large interest in QVC Network, the home shopping cable channel. QVC is headed by Mr Barry Diller, a highly regarded film industry figure, who has ambitious expansion plans. Mr Martin Davis, chairman of Paramount, said he had not received, and did not anticipate, any offers from QVC. Mr Redstone said he doubted Mr Malone would consider going to war. 'I respect him but I do not fear him,' he said. Both men praised their deal as a 'marriage made in heaven'. Mr Redstone said that 'a few dollars (from a rival bid) could never match the potential rewards in the future of this combination'. The bid announcement was the culmination of years of on-off merger talks between Viacom and Paramount. These talks had previously broken down over questions of boardroom control. If it goes ahead, the deal will be the biggest takeover in the US media industry since the Dollars 11.6bn merger between Time and Warner Communications in 1989, and marks a new stage in the consolidation of the sector into giant businesses with interests in a diversity of entertainment formats. Viacom is best known for its cable television networks - which Mr Redstone refers to as its crown jewels - which include the rapidly growing pop music channel MTV and Nickelodeon, which produces zany programmes for children. The networks are in the throes of an ambitious international expansion to position Viacom as chief purveyor of entertainment to the world's youth. Nickelodeon, for example, was launched in the UK at the start of this month, where it is now being offered to subscribers to British Sky Broadcasting, along with MTV. Viacom also owns and operates cable television systems serving some 1.1m US subscribers and 5 network affiliated TV stations and 14 radio stations. Paramount's assets include a motion picture production business, with current hits including the thriller The Firm, and a library of 890 films, including The Godfather, Indiana Jones and Beverly Hills Cop; and a TV programming business which includes the comedy Cheers and the science fiction series Star Trek. Viacom, which was acquired by Mr Redstone in 1987, is the smaller of the two companies, with 1992 revenues of Dollars 1.9bn, but its rapid growth has won it a higher stock market rating than Paramount, which had revenues of Dollars 4.3bn in 1992 but has suffered from flat earnings for the past few years. Wall Street analysts yesterday welcomed the deal as reason-ably priced and offering a compelling logic: Paramount will bring to Viacom the creative entertainment production facilities which it lacks, while Viacom's cable network will greatly increase Paramount's distribution muscle. The combined group will have a relatively modest debt burden, compared with many of its rivals, and marriage will better position both companies to compete with two trends transforming the media industry. One is globalisation, as a handful of international companies, such as Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, seek to dominate the world's airwaves, cable networks and publishing outlets. The other is the rapid convergence between the media, computer, electronics and telecommunications industries in the US - often dubbed 'communicopia' - which is expected eventually to create a world of inter-active, multi-media entertainment. These forces lie behind a string of media takeovers in the past few years, including the Time/Warner marriage and a deal earlier this year under which US West, a large local telephone company, will invest Dollars 2.5bn in Time Warner's cable and film entertainment operations. Sony, the Japanese electronics group, acquired Hollywood's Columbia studios in 1989, while Japanese rival Matsushita Electric bought MCA, parent of Universal Pictures. If the Paramount takeover goes ahead, it will leave Walt Disney as the only large Hollywood studio independent of much larger media empires or conglomerates. The deal will leave Mr Redstone firmly in the driving seat. He will be chairman of the merged company - Mr Davis will become chief executive - and will also hold 69.8 per cent of the combined company's voting stock and 38.5 per cent of its common stock. For a man who began his career as owner of a chain of drive-in movie houses, that shows not just tenacity but great business acumen. Lex, Page 18</p>

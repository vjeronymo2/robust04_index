			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Easing of audit requirement backed MORE THAN two thirds of bankers, businesses and accountants support a relaxation of the statutory audit of small companies, a survey by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales shows. The British Bankers Association, Standard Chartered and Barclays, which have traditionally been opposed to removing restrictions, all now support some relaxation of the requirement. The findings come in response to a consultation paper urging that only companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 300,000be required to have an annual audit. There were 188 responses to the paper, of which 44 opposed any form of relaxation. Most called for the retention of some financial information beyond turnover in exempted companies. The results will put renewed pressure on the Department of Trade and Industry, which is expected to issue a consultation document on the auditing of small companies in the next few weeks. The institute last year called for the requirement for an annual audit to be applied only to companies with a turnover of more than Pounds 300,000 a year. Since the 1900 Companies Act all limited liability companies in the UK - now 1.1m - have been required to be audited every year. Most of the professional bodies representing auditors and many small-business organisations have called for a reform of the audit requirement, which is seen as costly and irrelevant. Even the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, which has traditionally opposed relaxation, appears to have softened its attitude in the last few months. Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister for corporate affairs, said late last year that he was in favour of relaxing the requirement. His predecessor, Mr John Redwood, announced a review of the small company audit early in 1992.</p>

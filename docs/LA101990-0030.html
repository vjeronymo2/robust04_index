			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PANAMA SAYS IT HAS BROKEN UP PLOT TO TOPPLE GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> Panamanian authorities said Thursday they have broken up a military ring  plotting against the government and named as a coup leader the man picked as  security chief after last year's U.S. invasion of Panama.  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Rogelio Cruz accused the band of terrorist activities and of  conspiring to seize military installations.  </P> <P> He said former Col. Eduardo Herrera and a brother, Capt. Francisco Herrera,  were implicated.  </P> <P> Eduardo Hererra, who took charge of the newly formed public security forces  after U.S. troops invaded Panama on Dec. 20, 1989, and ousted Gen. Manuel A.  Noriega, was reported out of the country. His brother apparently is not in  custody.  </P> <P> Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon said earlier Thursday that members of the  security forces "could be connected to the explosion of bombs in the province  of Chiriqui and possibly to some bombs that went off in the capital."  </P> <P> He said Capt. Ivan Moreno, subdirector of Public Forces in Chiriqui, divulged  the conspiracy after he was detained. Cruz said two enlisted men are also in  custody.  </P></p>

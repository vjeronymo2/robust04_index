			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (6): For culture, look no further - Tourism and Austria, as a whole, for that matter - possibly do for an encore after celebrating the bicentennial of Mozart's death? The answer, which is already being transmitted round the world by the Austrian National Tourist Office, is to prepare for the millenium of the founding of Austria in 996. While that event in itself is no more likely to excite foreign tourists than did the 700th anniversary of the founding of the Swiss confederation last year, the Austrians are cunningly combining it over the next four years with various significant dates in the long and distinguished history of the Habsburg dynasty. This year, for example, an exhibition of historical materials is being presented in Seville and in Salzburg on Austrian links with Spain at the time of the discovery of America 500 years ago. The discovery coincided with the formation of the Casa de Austria in Spain by King Maximilian I and the subsequent empire of Karl V on which the sun never set. All of this is in aid of what is known as cultural tourism, a field in which Austria - and Vienna, in particular - is one of the world champions. Officials at the Austrian National Tourist Office suspect that about one-fifth of the 25.7m visitors who came to Austria last year had mainly cultural pursuits in mind. Ms Evelyn Miksch at the Vienna Tourist Board says that virtually every tourist who visits the city is coming for culture. Whether it is for the music of the Vienna State Opera and the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra or for the treasures of its 80 museums or for the architectural splendour of the Habsburg palaces, the city has something splendid for virtually everyone. Tourism, as one might expect, is extremely important to the economy of Vienna, although not as important as for the country as a whole. While tourism accounts for 8 per cent of the national product, it yields 6 per cent of Vienna's output. The main trends of the past few years have been surges in tourists from Japan and from eastern Europe. The number of overnight stays in the city by Japanese soared from 95,500 in 1981 to a peak of 318,000 in 1990, making them the fourth largest national group of visitors, after Germans, Italians and Americans. Numbers tumbled last year, however, because of fears arising from the Gulf War and the unrest in Yugoslavia. The Japanese, with their orderly ways and high spending tendencies, are highly prized by the city's tourist operators, and it is no longer uncommon to see theatre programmes, restaurant menus and official tours provided in Japanese. Many hotels also provide Japanese television programmes. Attitudes toward eastern European visitors are less enthusiastic. When the borders with Czechoslovakia and Hungary opened in late 1989, there began a period of flash floods of eastern European tourists. Usually on weekends, this would take the form of caravans of rickety, exhaust-spewing coaches roaring into the city early in the morning. The visitors, who had spent the night in the coach to save the cost of a hotel, poured into the streets, inspected the great imperial palaces and other historic sites and then repaired to parks to eat sandwiches brought with them. At dusk they got back in their coaches and left for home, having spent hardly a schilling. For most of them, it was a first opportunity to see a western city. And it happened to be a city with which they had many historical and family connections. The architecture of Vienna and even the imperial yellow colour of much of it is the same as that found in the eastern countries that were, until 1918, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Also, it is said that nearly half the names in the Vienna telephone book are of Czechoslovak or Hungarian origin. 'We have to be patient with them, and most people understand that,' Ms Miksch says. It must be said that the coach problem is not just restricted to those coming from Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Most days in the summer, there are hundreds of coaches from all over Europe trying to squeeze into small parking lots at the city's most popular tourist sites. Led by the Green party, many citizens would like to severely limit the movement of coaches in the city, and ultimately banish them to depots on the city outskirts. 'We are not hostile, but there are limits,' says Mr Christoph Chorherr, the Greens' member on the Vienna City Council. 'All of our famous sites are served by trams. We should build up our public transit service, with special services for tourists.' The tourist industry says many visitors are elderly and cannot be forced to walk. But Mr Chorherr says they do in Venice and in the centre of Vienna already, so they can do it elsewhere too. With such a highly developed tourist industry, it is fair to ask if the city is reaching its capacity limit. There are times of the year, notably around new year and Easter, when the city is absolutely jammed with tourists, and it becomes quite unpleasant, but tourist industry officials point out that the average hotel occupancy rate is only 60 per cent. The Vienna Tourist Office is trying to promote the idea of visiting the city off-season. Ms Miksch agrees that first-time visitors should come during the late spring or summer so they can walk around freely and get a feel for the city. But anyone who is returning with a view to a serious study of a museum or art collection would be better off doing it in January or February when he is less likely to be distracted by crowds.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                      HOTELS AND PENSIONS IN 1991:                       TOP 10 SOURCES OF TOURISTS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank       Country                              Overnight      % (1990)                                          stays          change 1 (1)      Germany                              1,445,000       +0.5 2 (4)      Austria                                799,000       +14.2 3 (2)      Italy                                  786,000       -16.5 4 (3)      US                                     451,000       -44.1 5 (6)      Spain                                  331,000       +8.8 6 (7)      Switzerland, Liechtenstein             282,000       -6.9 7 (5)      Japan                                  273,000       -14.2 8 (9)      France, Morocco                        257,000       +5.2 9 (8)      UK                                     248,000       -9.3 10 (10)    Netherlands                            126,000       +3.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- All sources                                     6,439,000       -7.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Vienna Tourist Board  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

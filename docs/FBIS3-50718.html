			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Margarita Torres] </F>   [Text] The Eighth Science and Technology Forum was one of  the most brilliant projects conducted in 1993 by the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] and the Interior Ministry  [Minint]. The more than 179,000 grassroots solutions presented  in 1993 confirm that mass participation was a decisive aspect  for both military organizations. However, this did not hamper  quality; on the contrary, it increased it. Technical and  scientific discipline was an indispensable factor in maintaining  the combat-readiness levels the times demand and to  energetically fight crime.    The skillful identification and integration of older and  younger, highly trained specialists made it possible not only to  repair and produce hundreds of pieces of equipment and parts,  but also to remodel and produce new weapons. One of these is the  Mambi, a 12.7-caliber semiautomatic rifle, ideal against  personnel carriers and fire-support helicopters. This powerful  rifle reached the national forum, where its creator, Lieutenant  Colonel Armando Gutierrez, answered Fidel's questions.    [Begin recording] [Castro] Does it pierce the shell of an  armed personnel carrier?    [Gutierrez] The bullet, at a distance of 500 meters, can  penetrate a 20-mm sheet of steel. This was demonstrated in the  test we conducted. We made several test shots with a U.S.  Sherman tank, and it penetrated up to 35 mm. Therefore, it is  possible that it will penetrate all light vehicles, which  generally have an armor thickness no greater than 10 mm.    [Castro] What armor do helicopters normally have?    [Gutierrez] All helicopters, except the new generations  under  production right now, have light armor, which is therefore  pierced by these bullets. All these bullets are  piercing-incendiary bullets, even the tracers. Therefore, even  while it is piercing, it also burns. [end recording]    The results attained by the FAR and Minint in 1993,  motivated  by the science and technology movement, constitute a challenge  for future forums. Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, a  member of the Politburo and chief of the General Staff, spoke  before the plenary of the Eighth Science and Technology Forum.    [Begin recording] I believe that what we can tell the  commander in chief today is that we have unleashed a mass  movement aimed at guaranteeing the defense of the Revolution,  which will provide extraordinary support to the Ninth Forum, not  only in priority tasks, but also by solving small problems  necessary to guarantee the defense of the Revolution. [end  recording]    The science and technology forum movement has entered a new  phase in the FAR and Minint. All that is needed now is to  perfect it as a method and workstyle, and to turn it into  everyone's main duty -- the generals' and the soldiers.'</p>

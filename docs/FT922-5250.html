			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Union backs plan to merge THE LEADERSHIP of the Nupe public-service union yesterday won the backing of its annual conference for plans to merge with the Nalgo and Cohse unions. The proposals, which aim to create Britain's biggest union with 1.5m members, were supported less enthusiastically than expected. The 4,980 to 3,099 vote suggested that the merger, which will be decided in a ballot of all the members of the three unions, is not a foregone conclusion. Some delegates were concerned about the likely resistance of any Nalgo members to affiliating to the Labour party. Nalgo is not affiliated, whereas Cohse and Nupe are. Other delegates said there might be defections to other largely blue-collar unions. The proposals will face a stronger test in a fortnight when Nalgo's annual conference votes on them. The National Union of Journalists was threatened with defections yesterday after one of its largest office branches voted against staying in the organisation. Members of the 288-strong Daily Mirror chapel decided by 94 votes to 76 not to stay in the union. One possibility is that they will join the British Association of Journalists, which is being set up by Mr Steve Turner, a former Daily Mirror journalist who was dismissed as NUJ general secretary last year after clashes with the union's executive.

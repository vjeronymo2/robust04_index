			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Swans to be told of CMN demands Union leaders at Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder which is in receivership, will on Tuesday put to the yard's remaining employees changes in their terms and conditions that would be required by the only potential bidder for the company. French-based Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie has been negotiating with receivers Price Waterhouse over the severance pay obligations CMN would have under existing company agreements if it had to declare redundancies after taking on the yard. A deal will be put to a mass meeting in Wallsend of Swan Hunter's 660 remaining workers and the 238 laid off. Mr Fred Henderson, leader of CMN's bid team for Swan Hunter, said yesterday that if workforce agreement were not forthcoming this could affect the price CMN offered the receiver for Swans and lessen the offer's attractiveness, relative to piecemeal sale of the company's assets. It is understood that the compromise proposal involves a possible waiving of severance entitlements after spring 1995. Mr Henderson said CMN intended to have a core workforce of about 1,000 at Swans. But because of the need for a mixture of skills some of those outfitting the yard's last frigate might not become core workforce members once that order was finished later this year. Yesterday Mr Iskandar Safa, whose Paris-based company Soffia bought CMN in 1992, said prospective markets for Swan Hunter, under his ownership, were the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait in the Gulf, Brunei and Indonesia in south-east Asia, and South Africa. Mr Safa said he had received from the Ministry of Defence 'all the verbal assurances we need' that it would give Swans, under his ownership, the same level of support in chasing export orders as it gave to any other British company. He would not go ahead with the Swans deal with a 'handicap on the political side'.</p>

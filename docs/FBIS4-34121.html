			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez: "According to Cuba, Illegal Entries </F> Into Embassies Are Planned"]    [Text] Havana, 13 Jun (PL) -- The Cuban Government has  characterized the illegal forced entry by 20 people into the  German Embassy in this capital as a carefully planned and  unacceptable action.    The entry took place early in the morning after a truck  crashed through the gate of the embassy's garage. This is the  second violation of embassy territory in the past 15 days.    Only two weeks ago, another aggressive group broke into the  residence of the Belgian ambassador, and although seven of the  occupants have left the installation on their own, the rest have  so far refused to heed requests by the Brussels and Havana  Governments.    Shortly after today's incident, the German ambassador asked  the instigators of this unexpected action to leave the embassy,  but the occupants ignored the will of the diplomat.    The German position in demanding that the occupants leave  the  embassy immediately agrees with Cuba's official position of  rejecting this type of action as a means to travel outside the  country in open disregard for normal procedures now in effect.    One important element to be highlighted in this case,  according to the Cuban Foreign Ministry, is that it has taken  place precisely on the day that Mexican President Carlos Salinas  arrived in the country and on the eve of the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit of heads of state and government.    Some diplomatic sources believe that the main objective  behind these actions is to divert attention from the  increasingly stronger ties now developing between the Caribbean  nation and many countries and international organizations.    The same sources believe that another objective is to  neutralize the international movement -- a movement flourishing  even within the United States -- that opposes Washington's  economic and trade blockade and supports the normalization of  relations with the island.    Cuba has reiterated that there will be no reprisals against  those who voluntarily leave the occupied embassy, just as in the  case of those who have left the Belgian ambassador's residence.</p>

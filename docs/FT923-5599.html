			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / International Company News: German diesel group remains deep in red KLOCKNER-Humboldt-Deutz, the German diesel engine, tractor and engineering group, remained deep in the red in the first half of this year. Net losses of DM29m (Dollars 20.7m) were the same as last time, the company said yesterday. Sales fell 7 per cent to DM1.6bn, and the group started the second half with firm orders 2 per cent lower than at the same time last year. International business developments had been 'more restrained than expected', and no improvement was likely in the second half. The most optimistic projections suggested some upswing at the end of the current quarter. The one bright spot in an interim report littered with minuses was an improvement in incoming orders. Up overall by 6 per cent, the figures were bolstered by a 20 per cent rise in demand for plant, but undermined by a 6 per cent fall in new orders for agricultural equipment. The continuing losses were not unexpected, KHD has been hard hit by international recession and declining demand for farm machinery in the light of agricultural reforms in the European Community. Following a 14 per cent fall in new tractor registrations in Europe last year, the group expected a further 12 per cent fall in 1992, reducing demand for tractors by 150,000 units. Meanwhile, the company increased capital investment by 64 per cent in the first half, to DM90m. Most of this was spent on a new diesel engine factory which is widely seen as the key to KHD's long-term survival.</p>

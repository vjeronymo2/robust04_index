			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: CRADLE COUNT  </P> <P> A New Akroyd/Dixon: It's a girl for actor Dan Aykroyd and his actress-wife,  Donna Dixon. Danielle Alexandra weighed 8 pounds, 13 ounces when she took her  first breath of air at 12:05 p.m. on Nov. 18, said Susan Patricola, publicist  for the couple. The couple wanted to get the baby out of St. John's Hospital  and Health Center and home for Thanksgiving before a birth announcement was  made, Patricola said Monday. "They're thrilled with their new arrival. She's  healthy and beautiful and they're looking forward to parenthood," Patricola  said. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

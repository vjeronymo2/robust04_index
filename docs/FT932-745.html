			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions FOOD retailers have not enjoyed favourable conditions, at least not in the stock market. But Nurdin &amp; Peacock has proved something of an exception. Since late last year the shares have risen from 130p to the current level and deputy chairman David Rowley has sold 110,000 shares at 219p. He has effectively halved his holding to just under 96,000 shares. Although quoted under food retailing, the company has been cushioned from the worst effects of pressure on margins by its operations in the cash and carry business. This is reflected in a trend of increase in earnings which looks set to continue. The chairman and managing director of Dagenham Motors, David Philip, has sold 375,000 shares at 105p for personal reasons. Like all motor dealers Dagenham has enjoyed something of a rally in the share price over the last six months although it is perhaps less pronounced than some of its peers. Shares in Comac Group, the computer consultant, took off when it was announced that Philip Swinstead had bought 1.25m shares and joined the board as chief executive. Swinstead cut his teeth at SD-Scicon and the fact that he had paid a substantial premium to the market price is a positive sign. A few days later two directors took the opportunity to reduce their holdings on the back of the rise in share price. Mike Winsley, managing director, sold his entire holding of 480,000 shares and is retiring from the board while Mr Lambert sold 50,000 shares of which he is the beneficial holder and a further 450,000 in which he has a non-beneficial interest.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              No of Company                   Sector    Shares    Value      directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Blick                      Elns    142,500     698            4 Bodycote Intl              Cong    100,000     282            1 Bradford Prop Trust        Prop      8,000      15            1 Comac Group                BuSe    530,000     382            2 Dagenham Motors Grp        Motr    375,000     394            1 Iceland Group              FdRe    360,000     875            1* Meyer Intl                 BdMa      5,000      18            1 Nurdin &amp; Peacock           FdRe    110,000     241            1 SEP Industrial Hldg        EngG    260,000      82            1 Shell                       O&amp;G     75,000     468            1*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Aerospace Eng              EngA    130,600      27            2 Allied-Lyons               Brew      3,000      16            1 APV                        EngG     11,000      11            2 Clayform Properties        Prop    110,000      26            2 Comac Group                BuSe  1,250,000     750            1 Glaxo                      Hlth      2,772      18            1 Harrington Kilbride         Med      5,000      11            1 Henderson Eurotrust        InTr     15,160      13            1 Lucas Industries           Motr     12,952      18            1 Pegasus                    Elns     25,000      38            1 South Stf Water Wts        Watr      9,500      73            1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

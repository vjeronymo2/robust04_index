			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POPE AND U.S. CATHOLICS  </P> <P> I have been avidly following your coverage of the recent talks of American  Catholic bishops with the Pope and the Roman Curia. In it I seemed to gather  that the focus of it all was supposed to be the evangelization of the average  man or woman in the U.S.  </P> <P> However, it seems to be that Rome's attack on American Catholics as being  pickers and choosers, if pursued with any intensity or vigor, could well bring  instead the de-evangelization of our church here.  </P> <P> For the people they are addressing are the already declining congregations that  are still alive. I wouldn't be surprised that the vast number of baptized  Catholics in this country haven't the foggiest interest in all of this.  </P> <P> So it seems to me what the official church is doing is closing the vise even  tighter on the only ones who have made any kind of a real commitment to the  faith.  </P> <P> I sometimes wonder why the thoughts and actions of spirit-filled Catholics are  so easily considered suspect. Sometimes it looks to me like everything is  coming from the top down and not vice versa.  </P> <P> EDWIN P. SCANLAN  </P> <P> Ojai  </P></p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (32): The appeal of apparel - Profile, Gokaldas Exports SMALL companies contribute substantially to Indian exports of products ranging from garments to leather, semi-precious stones and jewellery. In spite of restrictions and overseas competition, energetic private enterprises have managed to find rack space in chainstores across Europe and the US. Macy's, Sears, C&amp;A, Kaufhof and Banana Republic all have 'Made in India' tags on their labels. According to the Apparel Export Promotion Council, India exported Rs85bn worth of garments in March 1993. It predicted the total would reach Rs100bn in 1995. Exports grew by an average 30 per cent a year, making garments the country's highest net foreign exchange earner. 'Versatility, flexibility and value for money are the three measures on which Indian garments score high marks,' says Dinesh Hinduja, a partner at Gokaldas Exports, the country's top garment exporter. This family-run concern, which employs 13,000 people in its 26 factories in and around the southern city of Bangalore, totted up international sales of Rs1.3bn in the year to March 1993. (The family is not related to the owners of the Hinduja international trading group.) Some 80 per cent of this was picked up by European manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers such as Klaus Steilmann and Camel in Germany, Newman and Galeries Lafayette in France and the C&amp;A retail chain in the UK. Gokaldas Exports also supplies shirts to American jean makers Wrangler and Levi Strauss. Eight out of its 26 factories are exclusive production centres for these clients. Levi Strauss has put Gokaldas on top of the shortlist of possible partners for its proposed manufacturing venture in India. The Hinduja family made its debut in international trade in the 1960s by exporting silk scarves. When demand levelled out, it began to look for other options and hit upon exporting cotton shirts. A family split in 1979 divided the business. Six factories fell to the lot of Jhamandas Hinduja and his three sons, Madanlal, Rajendra and Dinesh. Since then, both branches of the Hinduja family have expanded their businesses and now compete with each other in global and domestic markets. The siblings divided operational responsibilities between them. Madanlal, the weaving expert, buys the fabrics, Rajendra monitors administration and shipments and Dinesh, the youngest, watches over manufacturing and marketing. Gokaldas specialises in outerwear, a quota-free item for which it first secured orders in 1981. Today almost a third of the monthly production of 500,000 garments is outerwear - jackets, coats and rainwear . The fabrics used by the company have to be bought from Hong Kong or Taiwan. The 30 per cent import component pushes up costs. 'We end up being more expensive than our counterparts in China, Pakistan and Bangladesh,' says Dinesh. But in favour of Indian manufacturers is their willingness to take on smaller orders and their dexterity in handling more complicated styles. Procuring linen, viscose and cotton of reliable quality is a persistent problem for Indian garment makers who depend on outdated mills and the unorganised handloom sector for supplies. The odds they face - from collecting yardage from dispersed weaving centres to coping with perennial power cuts - call for tremendous co - ordination to ensure shipments are on time. The Hindujas say that there is only one way to learn: by burning your fingers. Over the years the company has learnt a great deal about quality. Apart from in-house checks, big shipments are certified by technicians from the buying company before being dispatched. It has also invested in importing the latest machines for sewing, buttonholing, fusing and embroidery. German designers help Gokaldas put together its own collection four times a year. Sales growth is now showing signs of a slowdown. This is due largely, says Dinesh, to recession in western markets. 'People don't change their wardrobe as often as they used to,' he says. The Hindujas have identified Russia and South America as potential new markets. Both countries have no quota restrictions. The Hindujas are best known in the country for the 37-store Wearhouse garment chain found in big cities. Their cousins run the rival Weekender stores. Buyers' preferences worldwide are veering towards environmentally friendly garments. The intrepid export house is currently putting together a trial consignment for its newest client, Marks &amp; Spencer.  -------------------------- GOKALDAS' EXPORT SALES  -------------------------- Year         Rs million  -------------------------- 1988-89             280 1989-90             310 1990-91             700 1991-92           1,000 1992-93           1,300  -------------------------- Source: company data  --------------------------</p>

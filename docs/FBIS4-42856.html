			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The Portuguese press reported the  results of polls focusing on the next presidential elections,  the 12 June European Parliament elections, and political  leaders' popularity.    The results of a VISAO/Marktest poll conducted between 26  March and 23 April among 994 residents of the Greater Lisbon and  Greater Porto areas, 18-64 years old, appeared in the 26 May  issue of the Lisbon weekly VISAO. The poll had a margin of error  of plus or minus 4.1 percent. Respondents were asked to express  their preference for president of the Republic. Former President  Ramalho Eanes ran ahead of his potential competitors with 14.6  percent. He was followed by Prime Minister Cavaco Silva with  10.1 percent, Socialist Party (PS) official and Lisbon Mayor  Jorge Sampaio with 8.9 percent, and PS leader Antonio Guterres  with 3.1 percent. "Other candidates" received 15.2 percent,  "none of the above" was chosen by 7.6 percent and a large  majority (40.4 percent) did not know or did not answer.    The results of an EXPRESSO/Euroexpansao poll conducted  nationwide among 1,051 individuals between 11 and 18 May, with a  margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent, appeared in the 21  May Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO. In this poll the PS, with 39.4  percent, led other parties by a wide margin for the  Euroelections. The governing Social Democratic Party (PSD)  obtained 26.2 percent, the Unified Democratic Coalition (CDU)  9.0 percent, and the Center Social Democratic Party-Popular  Party (CDS-PP) 7.4 percent. The undecided vote was 10.8 percent.  Following the PS's victory in the December 1993 municipal  elections, this party is now in a favorable position to run in  next year's parliamentary elections, the EXPRESSO article  contended.

			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> COPTER FIRMS FACE TOXIC-DUMPING SUIT  </P> <P> Ventura County officials have filed a suit in Superior Court alleging that a  group of helicopter crop-dusting companies dumped toxic wastes and abandoned  four leaking underground fuel tanks at Oxnard Airport.  </P> <P> The suit accuses the group -- which includes Evergreen International Aviation  Inc., Evergreen Helicopters, Evergreen Aircraft Sales and Leasing Co., Condor  Helicopters and Aviation Inc. and their executives -- of dumping pesticides at  a helipad there.  </P> <P> The suit also alleges that the defendants abandoned three 2,000-gallon tanks  for aviation fuel and one 1,000-gallon gasoline tank, which leaked fuel into  the ground and polluted ground water.  </P> <P> The alleged dumping took place between 1966 and 1986, when the companies leased  land from Ventura County for a helipad at the airport on Patterson Road near  West 5th Street, according to the suit.  </P> <P> The contamination of the ground and ground water around the helipad reduced the  value of the property and violated state health and safety codes, the suit  alleges.  </P> <P> The county has already spent $90,000 to begin cleaning up the fuel and  chemicals and will have to spend more, the suit contends.  </P> <P> The suit also alleges that the county paid $120,000 in legal fees and a $50,000  settlement in a 1986 lawsuit filed by airport workers who claimed that the  dumping made them ill.  </P> <P> The dumping also could expose the county to lawsuits from people claiming that  it injured them and to prosecution by governmental environmental agencies.  </P> <P> The suit asks the court to order the defendants to pay those damages and any  future damages caused by the dumping, but the Evergreen companies and Condor  Helicopters have already denied any responsibility for the damages.  </P> <P> Evergreen and Condor officials could not be reached Wednesday for comment.

Indeed, such a contract  was signed in full compliance with the existing rules and agreed  with the Russian State Committee for Property.    A Japan firm will be engaged in dismantling Russian  submarines, and they will be delivered to the buyer in a  condition fit only for metal scrap, informed sources from the  Russian Navy told ITAR-TASS today.    Thus, there are no grounds for the allegations that Russian  submarines after necessary repairs can be put into service by  subdivisions of the North Korean Navy.</p>

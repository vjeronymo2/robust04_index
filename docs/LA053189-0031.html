			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SAYS HE LACKS AUTHORITY TO PREVENT REOPENING OF FUEL LINE  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge Tuesday rejected a bid by San Bernardino officials to  block the reopening of a gasoline pipeline that ruptured and sparked a deadly  fuel fire here last week, concluding that he lacked jurisdiction to issue the  order.  </P> <P> The ruling by Judge Ben Kayashima means the Calnev Pipe Line Co. may resume  pumping gasoline through the ravaged Muscoy neighborhood in west San Bernardino  as soon as repairs to the line are completed and approved by federal  inspectors.  </P> <P> "Once we get the green light, we'll flip the switch," said Charles Diamond, an  attorney representing Calnev. Diamond said pumping on the line, which serves  Las Vegas and several Air Force bases, could resume within the week.  </P> <P> Reaction to the judge's decision was swift and angry among the dozen residents  who attended the afternoon hearing. Some left the courtroom in tears while  others accused pipeline company officials of placing their wallets ahead of  their concern for public safety.  </P> <P> "How can this be? How can this be?" Ruby Self, a 26-year resident of the  devastated neighborhood, murmured repeatedly after the hearing. "The powers  that be are more concerned about gasoline than about the lives of citizens."  </P> <P> Like others displaced by the fire and a derailed train that flattened a row of  homes just two weeks earlier, Elizabeth Courtney complained bitterly that she  and her neighbors were being mistreated because of their low-income status.  </P> <P> "If this were Beverly Hills, you know they would shut down that line," Courtney  said. "But since it's just us working people, they figure they can just run the  gas on through again."  </P> <P> City officials vowed to carry on their legal battle and to be back in court  June 14 seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the pumping pending further  litigation. But they concede the odds that they will prevail are slim.  </P> <P> "We are in a heck of a quandary," City Atty. James Penman said. "But we have to  keep fighting because no one will give us assurances that it is safe for our  citizens to return. So what do we do? Keep them out? Where do they go?"  </P> <P> The 14-inch steel fuel line, which parallels the railroad tracks along Duffy  Street and lies four feet underground, ruptured Thursday morning, dousing  surrounding homes in a shower of flaming fuel. Two people were killed and 31  injured in the inferno, and 15 homes were destroyed or damaged.  </P> <P> The eruption occurred 13 days after a runaway Southern Pacific train derailed  at a curve, killing two trainmen and two children and burying a block of homes  in a pile of twisted steel and rubble.  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating both incidents. Among  the key questions is whether the freight train damaged or weakened the gasoline  line, making it vulnerable to the high pressure needed to pump 2.7 million  gallons over Cajon Pass each day.  </P> <P> The city has asked the company to relocate the line to the west side of the  railroad tracks. The realignment would place a 20-foot-high embankment between  the fuel pipe and homes, but Calnev officials have said the relocation would  cause a lengthy interruption of service.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is the line was initially adjudicated to be safe in its  current location, and there is no reason to move it," Diamond said.  </P> <P> In court Tuesday, San Bernardino Assistant City Atty. Diane Brue argued that  the city would suffer irreparable harm if pumping resumed and asked for court  intervention to ensure that Calnev officials complied with safety standards in  repairing the pipe.  </P> <P> But Judge Kayashima ruled that the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979  -- a federal law -- denied the state authority in such matters and preempted  him from intervening.  </P> <P> Residents who attended the hearing were in no mood to listen to the jurist's  legal reasoning.  </P> <P> "How can they do this to us?" said a trembling Mary Madrid, who raised five  children in her Adams Street home and has been prescribed tranquilizers to deal  with stress from the fire. "They say the people in Las Vegas need gasoline.  Well, how about us? We lost our homes, our babies, and now they want to start  that pipeline running again. It's just not fair."  </P> <P> Although San Bernardino fire officials have told 30 families on the outskirts  of the charred neighborhood that they can return home, only 13 had chosen to do  so by midday Tuesday. The remaining 150 or so families are scattered in motels  around the Inland Empire, uncertain of their fate.  </P> <P> Roger Stacker has been living with his family at the Victory Motel since  Thursday. His wife is shaken and cries easily these days, and his children toss  and turn and talk in their sleep.  </P> <P> "We have four kids under 12, and we're all piled into this motel room," Stacker  said. "My 10-year-old daughter is talking in her sleep, saying, 'Get out! Get  out!'  </P> <P> "I don't want to take them back in there. It's not safe."  </P></p>

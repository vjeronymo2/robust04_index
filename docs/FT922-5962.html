			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Banks 'should not put public first' BANKS MUST put the interests of their shareholders and customers above any other considerations, including the interests of the public, the governor of the Bank of England said last night. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton said banks are 'expected to function not only as profit-conscious businesses but also as public-spirited institutions'. There is likely to be a conflict between these different perceptions of banks' roles where the banks are expected to absorb social costs, he said at the City of London Polytechnic. He added: 'One sees evidence of the view of banks as a special part of the community in the local high street branch being the first port of call for those seeking sponsorship for local charitable causes - even though the answer (from the branch) may not nowadays be so regularly supportive as perhaps it was in the past.' Mr Leigh-Pemberton said that 'banks are - and inevitably behave as - bona fide businesses' that seek to earn a profit. Profitable banks, in his view, are in the interests of their customers and the economy. Even so, it may not have been misplaced to expect the banks to act 'pro bono publico' a decade ago, when the banks were sheltered from competition and were therefore in theory able to earn substantial profits relatively easily. That view is less tenable today, he said, given that banks now operate in an 'intensely competitive environment' and that the liberalisation of the banking market was an act of government policy. Banks, then, should not be expected to take on non-commercial activities unless it can be demonstrated that such activity is in the long-term interests of shareholders or customers. Mr Leigh-Pemberton also reiterated the Bank's policy that, in a competitive environment, it would be wrong for the authorities, the Bank and the government, to 'rule out bank failures'.</p>

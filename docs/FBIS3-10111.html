In a communique,  Secretary Ebrane Cadet has expressed the Senate's astonishment  upon reading the letter sent by a group of legislators who went,  informally, to Washington.    Cadet said that he was surprised to see that the legislators  referred to Senator Firmin Jean-Louis as president of the  Senate. The letter was also signed by Senator Yvon Gislain,  calling himself Senate secretary.    The office headed by Sansaricq expressed a number of  reservations regarding this matter, recalling that under a 4  February resolution the former office, headed by Firmin  Jean-Louis, was duly dismissed and replaced by the current  office, headed by Bernard Sansaricq.</p>

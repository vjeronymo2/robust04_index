			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Impact of tax rises appears short-lived The impact of last month's tax increases on discretionary spending may have been immediate but short-lived if figures released by Barclaycard are a guide - and many retailers say the increases have had no impact. Barclaycard's figures suggest spending is beginning to rise again following a slight drop when consumers received monthly pay packets reflecting the April rises in income tax and National Insurance. On April 26, the amount processed by Barclaycard stood at 120 per cent of the amount processed on the equivalent day in 1993. By May 6, the cumulative figure, which covers the period after April 26, had fallen back to just 106 per cent of the 1993 figure for the same number of days. By last Friday, however, this cumulative figure had risen slightly to 109 per cent over the period from late April. Barclaycard estimates that, with some 38 per cent of UK credit card spending, it accounts for between 5 per cent and 6 per cent of UK discretionary spending in total. Mr Gordon Blunt, information and planning manager at Barclaycard, said that he would have expected any fall in spending as a result of the tax rises to have continued for longer. 'It seems to have been a short-term blip,' he said. The effects of the tax increases on retailers have been mixed. Kwik Save, the UK's largest discount food retailer, this week said trade was being damaged. Mr Derek Pretty, finance director, said like-for-like sales, which exclude new store openings, had increased 3.2 per cent in the six months to March 12. But since the tax changes, sales growth had fallen to 1 per cent. But J. Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery group, said on Wednesday that while trading remained tough, like-for-like sales growth had been positive since mid-January. John Lewis Partnership said sales in its 22 department stores in the first week of May - just after many people received their first pay slips after the tax increases - were up 11.8 per cent year-on-year. 'We have been looking at the figures keenly for evidence of any effect and there is none,' the group said. Littlewoods, the chain store and mail-order group, said business had been tough for more than two years. It had not felt any 'discernible difference' in trade since the tax increases. 'We are now into the mid-season of merchandise. If the tax increases were going to be felt it would have been last month,' the group said. The pace of the recovery in sales of new cars has been slowed by recent tax increases, but motor industry leaders believe the impact will be short-lived, writes Kevin Done. Mr Paddy Byrne, sales director of Ford of Britain, said Ford forecasted a year-on-year rise of between 9 per cent and 10 per cent this month in new-car sales compared with April's 5 per cent increase. 'People have been taking a long, hard look at their disposable income,' said Mr Byrne, 'but it is my hunch that the underlying growth trend will soon be resumed.'</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RETHINK DESIGN PLAN  </P> <P> Most San Diegans would agree that our public buildings do a poor job of  expressing our city's character, or inspiring our citizens. Yet, with the  upcoming Civic Center competition, we are losing an unparalleled opportunity to  create a city core of great buildings, since the proposed competition will  emphasize developer "qualifications" instead of quality design.  </P> <P> There are two fundamental problems with the proposed process:  </P> <P> 1. The overall emphasis of the judging is on developer's financial status,  rather than architectural design. This is just the type of "bottom line"  thinking that has helped create our national image as an uncultured city of  cheap buildings.  </P> <P> 2. By emphasizing past architectural experience, young, new design talent will  be eliminated and the number of potential designers severely restricted to  those who are the current media stars.  </P> <P> Instead, I propose a competition format which will deliver both the best design  available and create savings for the city (rather than just a guaranteed  maximum cost, with the builder profiting from any savings). This competition  would be in four stages:  </P> <P> Step 1: An open international, anonymous design competition to be judged on  architectural merit (rather than the proposed statement of qualifications  process, which becomes a political contest instead of a design competition). An  open competition has historically been the best method to discover dynamic and  appropriate design solutions, such as the Sydney Opera House, and to recognize  new talent.  </P> <P> Step 2: From the first-stage design submissions, select five proposals to be  further developed, in conjunction with construction managers, cost estimators  and other technical support, to ensure that the winning design can be built  within budget. The design teams should certify that the proposal can be built  within budget, at risk of redesign, or elimination.  </P> <P> Step 3: Select a winning design and commission the team to create construction  bid sets.  </P> <P> Step 4: Finally, the winning project should be competitively bid among  qualified construction contractors and awarded to the low bidder with the  stipulation that 90% of any savings below the project budget will be returned  to the public and 10% will be awarded to the design team for their cost-saving  effort.  </P> <P> This method is a realistic recognition of the extra work required of a designer  to create a great design within cost limits, rather than by simply  "gold-plating" a project with expensive materials.  </P> <P> The people of San Diego would be the final winners with a combination of  financial savings, and world-class design.  </P> <P> LEE BRYANT PLATT  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

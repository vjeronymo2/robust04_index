			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Gennadiy Kulagin and Georgiy </F> Shmelev]    [Text] Almaty February 9 TASS -- The Russian Minister of  Foreign Affairs, Andrey Kozyrev, held a press conference after  spending two-and-a-half hours in talks behind closed doors with  President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan.    Kozyrev told reporters both sides made clear their desire to  conduct in a business-like manner -- without dragging feet or  making haste -- preparations for the next Commonwealth summit  meeting. "It is time we had such a meeting because many mutual  problems can be resolved only at the presidential level,"  Kozyrev said.    Responding to a question from ITAR-TASS, Kozyrev said that  during his talks with Nazarbayev, they reached an agreement on  focusing preparations on three main points -- the drafting of an  agreement on military cooperation, for which some points of  principle have already been agreed; cooperation in Baykonur,  which Kozyrev is due to visit on Thursday to take a closer look  at the situation in the former Soviet space centre; and aspects  of double citizenship and a humanitarian package.    The Russian minister dwelled in detail on the last point,  because it was given much time and attention during his talks  with Nazarbayev. This problems is most serious since it  concerns very many people in Kazakhstan and Russia. But it  should not be politicized or ideologized, or else viewed as  inter-ethnic, Kozyrev said. Such an approach would play into  the hand of nationalists in all Commonwealth countries. He said  the question was of special concern to ethnic Russian and  Russian-speaking people who found themselves in a very  vulnerable situation as a result of current historical changes.    The big, central treaty to be signed by Russian with  Kazakhstan will contain a package of agreements on these matters  with solutions proposed at a world practice level.    The cardinal solution of the problem consists in giving  every  Russian and Kazakh the opportunity to fully exercise their  rights. When moving from one country to the other, none of them  should feel a foreigner. Other solutions to particular problems  will be found, since the presidents of both countries think it  necessary to speed up their preparation, including the drafting  of the agreement on citizenship, in time for the  Russian-Kazakhstan summit.    All this inspires hope that by the time of the signing of  the  bilateral agreements, all demagoguery will have exhausted its  potential in this respect, Kozyrev said. Kozyrev was evidently  referring to the position of Russian nationalist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy and other fascist-like and nationalist circles,  who, according to Kozyrev, are seeking to fan the issue in order  to aggravate the political struggle and bank on it.    They have no thought for the people when they seek to push  nations to the verge of war. The problem can be solved by  taking into account the interests of different ethnic groups on  the basis of civilized, legal and peaceful approaches, Kozyrev  said.    The Commonwealth is moving towards economic integration but  not towards a split, Kozyrev stressed. This understanding was  made clear to him during his visits to Tashkent and Almaty. "We  reached an agreement with President Nazarbayev on setting up  working groups which will work fast and on a fundamental basis.    Kozyrev resolutely rejected allegations of territorial  claims  between Commonwealth member states.</p>

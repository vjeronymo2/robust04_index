			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Management: A cautious repair strategy for the mistakes of the past - A series on the challenges facing UK banks 'We may be a bank. But we are also a business.' This statement by Lord Alexander, the new chairman of National Westminster Bank, is revealing about attitudes in the UK's second largest clearing bank. The first few words contain a hint of the conservatism - some would say complacency - that people traditionally associate with bankers: a suggestion that banks should somehow be judged by special standards. But the second phrase conveys the new sense of realism that has been forced on NatWest after three traumatic years. Until the latter part of the 1980s, NatWest was widely described as the UK's top clearing bank; it was the largest in asset terms, and its record of profit growth and expansion, domestically and overseas, was impressively consistent. Its top executives - all of them clearing bankers to the core - displayed a cohesiveness and sense of purpose that were envied by its rivals. All this culminated in the golden year of 1988 when the bank made record profits of Pounds 1.4bn before tax. But then things started going badly wrong. The following year profits plunged to Pounds 404m, and last year showed only a modest increase to Pounds 504m. For the current year, analysts are predicting little change. For many observers, this downfall was caused by an uncharacteristic adventurousness, with the clear cautionary message that banks should stick to what they know and do best. 'Self-inflicted wounds,' was how Julian Robins, banking analyst at BZW, described NatWest's pain. Two serious mistakes were compounded by bad luck. One was NatWest's attempt to enter investment banking by creating County NatWest at the time of the Big Bang deregulation of the City in 1986. County not only lost large sums of money in each of the succeeding years, helped by the 1987 market crash, but it plunged NatWest into the Blue Arrow scandal which cost it its chairman and three senior executives. Several ex-County officials are now standing trial, accused of rigging the market to conceal the failure of the Pounds 857m Blue Arrow rights issue which they were managing. NatWest's difficulties in investment banking were not unique: other clearing banks also lost large sums of money. But County's losses have been the largest, and its failure to achieve its ambitions has been the most conspicuous. County was supposed to propel NatWest into the ranks of 'global banks'. Instead, it has ended up performing a limited range of services, and is only a secondary player in places like New York and Tokyo. The second mistake was NatWest's determination to expand in the US despite recent history which suggested it was a high risk strategy. The plan was directed by Tom Frost, the chief executive, who had previously headed NatWest in the US. But last year NatWest Bancorp, which has 263 branches across New York and New Jersey, was hit by the property collapse and lost Pounds 167m - a larger sum in nominal terms than Crocker National Bank lost Midland Bank in the 1980s. Apart from costing NatWest much in the way of money and prestige, both these setbacks had a demoralising impact on the rest of the clearing bank whose 3,000 branches in Britain's high streets were generating the bulk of the group's profits. The losses have also exposed other weaknesses at NatWest, like its expensive cost structure and its relatively poor earnings performance compared with the stronger clearers, Lloyds and Barclays. The test of NatWest's mettle will be its ability to deal with these difficulties. When announcing last year's poor profits, Frost said: 'NatWest's 1990 results require firm action, and we are taking it.' Of the two biggest problems, it looks as if NatWest will try to soldier on with its US operation, but will have to decide whether to cut its losses at County. Lord Alexander has given County two years to show it can make a profit, with the threat that if it does not 'then we must out' of the equities business. The ultimatum set off tremors which appear to have culminated in last night's sudden announcement by Howard Macdonald, County's chief executive, that he was resigning. His departure suggests that there are still serious strains between NatWest and its investment banking arm, and it creates a further disruption to the much-needed healing process. As for the US, NatWest knows that the bank there can make money - it was consistently profitable earlier in the 1980s - and the culture of that business is close to that of the clearing bank. But the road to recovery could be long and painful because the volume of bad debts in the region is still high. This week NatWest Bancorp announced a first quarter loss of Dollars 191m, and required a further Dollars 150m capital infusion. The US and the County problems had two points in common. They both marked major departures from NatWest's mainstream UK banking business, and both were conducted without the sureness of touch which marked NatWest's advance in the early 1980s. After these expensive mistakes, NatWest's fortunes will depend on its success in the domestic UK market which, in a good year, should be able to generate over Pounds 1bn in profits. But it is an increasingly competitive arena in which Frost and his colleagues are trying to galvanise the bank's massive labour force, while at the same time cutting costs. NatWest will be shedding 4,000 people this year, with a total of 15,000 jobs being eliminated over the next two years, about 13 per cent of its staff. Frost has set up a centrally based team to oversee the cost-reduction programme. It reports directly to him and he says it should save the NatWest group Pounds 400m a year by 1993. Part of the cost savings will come from the introduction of labour-saving technology; a data centre in Staffordshire handles nearly half the group's cheque-processing with fewer than 25 people. Frost has also rejigged the senior management. One of the key players is Derek Wanless who heads UK banking at the age of only 43. Wanless is a believer in new techniques; he speaks of the role of technology and machines in delivering products to customers, and of the potential for cross-selling more services to NatWest's enormous but under-exploited customer base in the personal and local business markets. Although this is a familiar banker's theme, Wanless says: 'Banks have barely made a start on the possibilities'. One dilemma NatWest faces is whether to persist with its strategy of being a broker rather than a creator of non-banking products like insurance and investments. (Under UK law, a bank must 'polarise' one way or the other.) NatWest was the only major clearer which chose to polarise as a broker. The strategy has seemed a success. The broking business nearly doubled its profits last year. But Lloyds Bank, which took the opposite extreme and allied itself with Abbey Life, the financial services group, is setting a hot pace which has caused some uncertainty at NatWest and caused analysts to question the wisdom of its policy. Although NatWest's difficulties were compounded by events like the market crash in 1987, and the severity of the recession in the UK and the US north east, analysts say that they have also found the bank wanting in strategic foresight. The County diversification was clearly undertaken to follow the fashion for investment banking - but without a full understanding of the markets into which it would lead the group. The US strategy never took into account the possibility that recession could have such a regionalised impact. All this has made NatWest a more cautious bank. For example, it is taking a very low key approach to Europe and 1992. Since the plan for a single market started, it has only bought out a minority of a small Dutch merchant bank, and a handful of branches in France. But if NatWest has a chastened air, it has not lost all the cultural cohesion which served it well before the crisis. There is an obvious determination among management to restore its self-respect. After a year in the chair, Lord Alexander, a former barrister, has begun to speak out more boldly on banking issues. And he warns people against 'selling the strengths of this group short'.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Israel closes bourse for two days: Government wants market to assess sweeping financial changes Israel will close its stock exchange today and tomorrow after announcing plans yesterday to introduce sweeping financial changes, including a capital gains tax on stock market profits and an easing of foreign exchange controls. The foreign exchange liberalisation will significantly increase the ability of Israeli companies to invest abroad. Foreign companies are also to have the right to issue shares for the first time on the Tel Aviv market. Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, said the Tel Aviv stock exchange would remain closed for two days to give the volatile market, which has plunged about 20 per cent from its peak this year, time to assess the new 10 per cent tax on inflation-adjusted capital gains, due to take effect from January 1 1995. As the market normally closes on Fridays and Saturdays, trading will not resume until Sunday. Government officials said the new capital gains tax, which will not be levied on provident funds, would raise Sh500m (Pounds 106m) allowing the Treasury to cut employers' taxes and stimulate growth. Officials said the move also brought Israel into line with global markets which tax profits on share trading. Market analysts said they expected a wave of selling when the market reopened and said the move could delay the government's privatisation programme and confuse dozens of companies planning new issues. They said they hoped the government would make changes to allow individuals to offset the tax against share losses before implementation In a separate move, the Bank of Israel announced a radical liberalisation of foreign exchange controls. Among the measures are the right of Israeli companies to invest an unlimited amount of their working capital abroad, abolishing a rule limiting such investment to 40 per cent of their capital. Separately, companies will now be able to invest up to 10 per cent of their equity or 5 per cent of sales - whichever amount is the largest - either in foreign stocks or in deposits in foreign banks, both of which have hitherto been off limits. Previously only companies which exported goods could hold a proportion of their export revenues abroad. Foreign companies will now also be allowed to raise capital on the Tel Aviv exchange, but the bank indicated that legislation would be required and that it did not yet have a timetable for the change. Yesterday's liberalisation also permits provident and pension funds to invest up to 2 per cent of their assets on global stock markets. Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the bank, said: 'These steps bring the Israeli shekel very close to becoming an internationally convertible currency and will speed up the integration between Israeli and international capital markets.'

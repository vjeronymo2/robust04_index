			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Australian sector braced for rate rise - International The Australian government bond market is braced for a rise in interest rates  -but then, it has been for the last four months, at least. However, analysts argue that economic forces are now overwhelming any political pressure to delay raising rates. So far, the Australian authorities have been able to fend off pressure to raise rates because the Australian economy has been relatively slow to pull out of recession. 'The Reserve Bank of Australia has made it clear that it agrees with the need to increase interest rates,' said Mr Michael Gallagher, director of research at IDEA, the market analysis specialist, 'but has been concerned about relatively modest growth in business investment.' In addition, high unemployment and a depressed property market have helped fend off rate increases. However, economic growth has now accelerated: in fact, at an estimated 4.5 per cent in 1994, it has overtaken the US. The latest employment data showed a jump of 90,000 jobs in July, compared with an average increase of 17,000 a month over the last six months, and a drop in the unemployment rate to 9 1/2 per cent from 10 per cent. 'We expect a 50 basis point rate hike towards the end of September,' says Mr Paul Donovan, bond analyst at UBS. 'The Reserve Bank is not independent, and politically there have been mixed pressures. It will probably come in reaction to a US hike.' Because the Australian dollar is closely tied to the US dollar, the Australian bond market tends to track the US treasuries market. However, despite a series of interest rate rises by the US authorities, the Australian government bond market has substantially underperformed the US market. The yield differential between the two markets has widened from 80 basis points at the beginning of April to its current level of more than 200 basis points. The Australian market has already discounted a series of rate increases. Overnight cash rates, set by the authorities, are currently 4 3/4 per cent while six-month bill rates have risen to 6.2 per cent. So why is the market so bearish? The answer appears to be that inflationary fears have taken hold, and the country's poor record on inflation has undermined confidence in the bond market. Certainly, with inflation at 1.7 per cent and 10-year bond yields at 9.5 per cent, the market appears to offer attractively high real yields  - among the highest of the developed markets. Only Sweden and Canada offer higher real yields, but they both have high debt to GDP ratios of more than 67 per cent, compared with only 33 per cent for Australia, according to data compiled by Swiss Bank Corporation. The high real yields for long-dated bonds in Australia suggest that the market is expecting inflation to rise sharply. Indeed, factors such as the recovery in the housing market and increases in raw material prices could soon boost inflation, according to some analysts, while the strength of the Australian dollar, supported by strong commodity prices, could fuel imports. However, according to analysts at SBC, wages remain the key to inflation and 'there are few signs of any significant inflation pressures in the economy. The main concern is the legitimacy of the productivity offsets agreed between unions and businesses to support wage increases (which are) generally well above underlying inflation.' For bond investors, most analysts continue to advise caution, in spite of attractive real yields relative to other markets. 'Australia looks like a bear market and that is not going to change, but there is some room to outperform other markets,' says Mr Donovan. 'A rate hike could be supportive.' Australian bonds are largely held by domestic investors, but because of the relatively small size of the market, marginal foreign interest can have a strong impact on prices. One potential source of funds is Japan, where the weakened yen has led Japanese investors to look again at the dollar bloc. However, with the Australian market virtually insisting on a rate rise and 10-year bond yields apparently heading towards double-digit levels, most investors are likely to hold off a while longer. One danger is that they will instead choose the New Zealand market, which has performed well until recent political worries. According to some analysts, international investors may favour New Zealand because of its highly independent central bank and the fact that it is an improving credit, even though 10-year yields, at 8.33 per cent, are substantially lower than in Australia. The outlook for the New Zealand market largely depends on whether the political situation stabilises after the weekend's Selwyn by-election.</p>

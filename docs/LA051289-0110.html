			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UCSD SCIENTISTS TRANSFER 4-COLOR GENETIC BEACONS  </P> <P> Call it Technicolor chemistry.  </P> <P> Take a firefly-like Jamaican beetle, figure out what part of its genetic  structure produces the enzymes that make it light up in various colors, and  stick the genes into bacteria. The goal: Bacteria that glow in four different  colors.  </P> <P> That's just what researchers at UC San Diego and Johns Hopkins University have  achieved, two years after they used a similar technique to produce  glow-in-the-dark tobacco plants, according to a report in today's issue of  Science magazine.  </P> <P> The bacteria glow green, yellow-green, yellow and orange, thanks to the genes  from the luminescent Jamaican click beetle. This 1-inch-long distant relative  of the firefly looks more like a housefly than it does a beetle.  </P> <P> The transfer of the beetle's luminescent genes is more than a genetic  engineer's curiosity, the scientists say.  </P> <P> "These genes are potentially very valuable as research tools for tracking gene  expression -- that is, letting us know when genes are turned on or off -- in  living systems," said Keith V. Wood, a chemistry doctoral student at UCSD and  primary investigator on the project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Biological Beacons  </P> <P> The light-emitting genes, which the scientists say attach readily to other  genes, could serve as biological beacons when scientists want to simultaneously  track the activity of several inserted genes. They also would allow researchers  to track the fate of specific cells in the body or the spreading of genetically  engineered microbes released into the environment.  </P> <P> The click beetle's genes isolated by the UCSD-Johns Hopkins team regulate  </P> <P> the production in its abdominal light organ of an enzyme called luciferase.  Luciferase converts chemical energy into light when it is combined in the light  organ with oxygen, the energy-storage molecule ATP and a substance in the  insects called luciferin.  </P> <P> When inserted into other organisms, the low level of light the luciferase  produces can be detected by X-ray film exposure or sensitive light-detection  devices.  </P> <P> Luciferases in fireflies and the click beetle share only about 48% of the same  protein structure, Wood said.  </P> <P> But the click beetle luciferases, although they produce four different colors,  differ only slightly in structure. As a result, the researchers are now  modifying the luciferase gene and enzyme structures to see if they can produce  other colors of luminescence, said William D. McElroy, emeritus professor of  biology at UCSD and a co-author of the report in Science.  </P> <P> Other authors are Y. Amy Lam, research associate in chemistry there, and Howard  H. Seliger, professor of biology at Johns Hopkins University.  </P> <P> Two years ago, this same team inserted the firefly luciferase gene into tobacco  plants. It sent out about 350 copies of the gene to researchers and  biotechnology companies throughout the country, McElroy said.  </P> <P> The click beetle research grew out of 40 years of study of firefly luciferase  chemistry by McElroy and his late wife, UCSD chemistry professor Marlene  Deluca, McElroy said. They first discovered that they could collect and study  the beetles when the insects, attracted to the light of McElroy's cigar, began  whacking into his face, he recalled Thursday.  </P> <P> "I had a cigar in my mouth, and here we saw something coming at the light from  the cigar, and it was one of these charging click beetles," he said. "They kept  coming right at me."  </P> <P> This habit of the beetles proved useful for collecting them, he said, because  the insects proved virtually impossible to breed in captivity. For the current  research, scientists collected the beetles in Jamaica and froze them for study.  </P></p>

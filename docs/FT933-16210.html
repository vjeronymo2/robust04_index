			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / GEC and BAe dismiss report of defence merger BRITAIN'S General Electric Company and British Aerospace yesterday dismissed as speculation a report that they were holding preliminary talks that could lead to a merger of their defence interests. But officials at both companies did not rule out the long-term possibility of closer links. They are the UK's largest defence suppliers, with combined military sales of about Pounds 7bn. The prospect of a merger with GEC-Marconi is understood not to have been discussed by the board of BAe Defence, the company set up early last year combining the BAe group's military aircraft, missiles, munitions and systems and services divisions. However, ideas on a long-term reshaping of the UK defence industry have been voiced in discussions between the two groups, which have close working connections on projects such as the four-nation Eurofighter. Rumours of GEC plans to launch a complete or partial takeover of BAe have surfaced several times over the past two years. Active contacts between the two companies took place in 1991, with Sir Peter Levene, previously the Ministry of Defence's procurement chief, playing an important role alongside Lord Weinstock, GEC managing director. Further rumours circulated when BAe shares came under heavy pressure last year. GEC focused on BAe's Dynamics division, which makes guided weapons, and on its space activities. But discussions on the sale of the space division to Matra Marconi Space, a joint venture between GEC-Marconi and Matra of France, fell through. The latest report comes while both companies are negotiating other defence deals. GEC is negotiating the purchase of Thorn EMI's defence interests. BAe is discussing details of a planned missile merger with Matra, a venture which could subsequently bring in other European producers. GEC-Marconi supplies electronic equipment for most of the aircraft and missiles produced by BAe, and has sought to establish itself as a prime contractor for top defence projects. Until recently, the Ministry of Defence would have been opposed to a merger between the two, in order to preserve competition. However, it is thought that in today's smaller defence market the MoD would be more likely to accede to such a plan. Since 1989, GEC has already absorbed large parts of its two main UK electronics rivals, Plessey and Ferranti International.</p>

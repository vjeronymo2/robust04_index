			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Japanese restart accident N-plant A Japanese utility yesterday restarted a 22-year-old nuclear reactor which had been shut for three and a half years after a broken pipe caused one of the most serious alerts in the country's civil nuclear programme, Gordon Cramb reports from Tokyo. The pressurised water reactor at Mihama, north of Kyoto, has been overhauled since the February 1991 incident which released 55 tonnes of radioactive water from the primary cooling system into the secondary system which powers its turbine. For the first time in Japan, emergency core-cooling procedures were activated to avoid a potential meltdown. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry concluded an anti-vibration bar had been incorrectly installed. Local residents and Japan's vocal green lobby protested at the decision by Kansai Electric Power, the second largest electric utility, to restart the 500MW facility. Japan draws about 30 per cent of its electricity needs from nuclear power supplied from its 46 reactors. Tokyo department store sales fell 2.9 per cent last month compared with the previous July, a 29th successive monthly fall. The decrease, although less than June's 3.4 per cent fall, came in spite of income tax cuts, summer promotions and good weather.</p>

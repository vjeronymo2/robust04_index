			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (v) The manufacturer may substitute slave tires for the drive wheel tires on the vehicle as specified in paragraph &sect;86.135&hyph;90(e):  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> that the slave tires are the same size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) If the Administrator elects to use the evaporative/refueling canister preconditioning procedure described in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(k), the cold start exhaust emission test described in &sect;86.137&hyph;96 shall follow the heat build procedure described in &sect;86.133&hyph;90 by not more than one hour.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vii) In performing exhaust sample analysis under &sect;86.140&hyph;94.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) When testing diesel vehicles, or methanol-fueled Otto-cycle vehicles, the manufacturer shall allow a minimum of 20 minutes warm-up for the HC analyzer, and for diesel vehicles, a minimum of two hours warm-up for the CO, CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  analyzers. (Power is normally left on infrared and chemiluminescent analyzers. When not in use, the chopper motors of the infrared analyzers are turned off and the phototube high voltage supply to the chemiluminescent analyzers is placed in the standby position.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The manufacturer shall exercise care to prevent moisture from condensing in the sample collection bags.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (viii) The manufacturer need not comply with &sect;86.142&hyph;90 or &sect;86.155&hyph;98, since the records required therein are provided under other provisions of this subpart G.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ix) If a manufacturer elects to perform the background determination procedure described in paragraph (a)(2)(xi) of this section in addition to performing the refueling emissions test procedure, the elapsed time between the initial and final FID readings shall be recorded, rounded to the nearest second rather than minute as described in &sect;86.154&hyph;98(e)(8). In addition, the vehicle soak described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(e) shall be conducted with the windows and luggage compartment of the vehicle open.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) The Administrator may elect to perform a seal test, described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(b), of both integrated and non-integrated systems instead of the full refueling test. When testing non-integrated systems, an manufacturer may conduct the canister purge described in &sect;86.153&hyph;98(b)(1) directly following the preconditioning drive described in &sect;86.132&hyph;96(e) or directly following the exhaust emissions test described in &sect;86.137&hyph;96.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (xi) In addition to the refueling test, a manufacturer may elect to perform the following background emissions determination immediately prior to the refueling measurement procedure described in &sect;86.154&hyph;98, provided EPA is notified of this decision prior to the start of testing in an SEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The SHED shall be purged for several minutes immediately prior to the background determination. Warning: If at any time the concentration of hydrocarbons, of methanol, or of methanol and hydrocarbons exceeds 15,000 ppm C, the enclosure should be immediately purged. This concentration provides a 4:1 safety factor against the lean flammability limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to the background determination. If not already on, the enclosure mixing fan and the spilled fuel mixing blower shall be turned on at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Place the vehicle in the SHED. The ambient temperature level encountered by the test vehicle during the entire background emissions determination shall be 80  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. The windows and luggage compartment of the vehicle must be open and the gas cap must be secured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) Seal the SHED. Immediately analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the initial background hydrocarbon concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) Soak the vehicle for ten minutes  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1 minute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (F) The FID (or HFID) hydrocarbon analyzer shall be zeroed and spanned immediately prior to the end of the background determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (G) Analyze the ambient concentration of hydrocarbons in the SHED and record. This is the final background hydrocarbon concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (H) The total hydrocarbon mass emitted during the background determination is calculated according to &sect;86.156&hyph;98. To obtain a per-minute background emission rate, divide the total hydrocarbon mass calculated in this paragraph by the duration of the soak, rounded to the nearest second, described in paragraph (a)(2)(xi)(G) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (I) The background emission rate is multiplied by the duration of the refueling measurement obtained in paragraph (a)(2)(ix) of this section. This number is then subtracted from the total grams of emissions calculated for the refueling test according to &sect;86.156&hyph;98(a) to obtain the adjusted value for total refueling emissions. The final results for comparison with the refueling emission standard shall be computed by dividing the adjusted value for total refueling mass emissions by the total gallons of fuel dispensed in the refueling test as described in &sect;86.156&hyph;98(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (xii) In addition to the requirements of subpart B of this part, the manufacturer shall prepare gasoline-fueled and methanol-fueled vehicles as follows prior to emission testing:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The manufacturer shall inspect the fuel system to ensure the absence of any leaks of liquid or vapor to the atmosphere by applying a pressure of 14.5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.5 inches of water (3.6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 0.1 Kpa) to the fuel system allowing the pressure to stabilize and isolating the fuel system from the pressure source. Following isolation of the fuel system, pressure must not drop more than 2.0 inches of water (0.5 Kpa) in five minutes. If required, the manufacturer shall perform corrective action in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section and report this action in accordance with &sect;86.609&hyph;98(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) When performing this pressure check, the manufacturer shall exercise care to neither purge nor load the evaporative or refueling emission control systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) The manufacturer may not modify the test vehicle's evaporative or refueling emission control systems by component addition, deletion, or substitution, except to comply with paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section if approved in advance by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

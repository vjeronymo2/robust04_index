			<p>BFN     [Text] The body of the terrorist who perpetrated the  Hadera suicide attack has been identified. He was 23-year-old  'Ammar Salah 'Amarani from the Samaria village of Ya'bad. Our  correspondent Moti Amir reports that the man was a known Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] activist, but he had been never  detained by the security forces.    Hamas has announced in a leaflet in Gaza that members of the  'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam squad carried out the Hadera attack in  revenge for the Hebron massacre.</p>

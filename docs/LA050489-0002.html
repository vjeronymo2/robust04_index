			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MASTERGATE' SEEKS A SUMMER HOME IN D.C.  </P> <P> Washington may yet be the summer home of "Mastergate."  </P> <P> But not at the Kennedy Center, whose general manager of theaters, Drew Murphy,  found himself swimming in a flood of stories this week after the disclosure he  didn't think Larry Gelbart's Iran-Contra satire was for the Kennedy's Terrace  Theater.  </P> <P> At the heart of it was whether, when he said no to producer Eugene V. Wolsk and  "Mastergate," he implied that the show's barbed political content might somehow  jeopardize the Kennedy's future federal funding.  </P> <P> "Good heavens, no!" exclaimed center spokeswoman Tiki Davies.  </P> <P> "No," said producer Wolsk, who plans to bring the play to Broadway this fall.  "He didn't really characterize it. He just said he didn't think it was for  them. It was a very casual thing. The incident has really been overblown."  </P> <P> "It is a bit overblown, and I'm going to leave it overblown," author Gelbart  cheerfully declared, aware that an uproar over a play usually helps to  publicize it. Gelbart co-created the hit CBS version of the movie "M.A.S.H."  and co-authored the hit film comedy, "Tootsie."  </P> <P> Murphy himself was unavailable for an interview on the reasons for his  rejection of "Mastergate." His action first was reported Tuesday by the  Washington Post.  </P> <P> Wolsk said American Rep officials will be talking to representatives of  Washington's Arena Stage to see if they'd like to have the show this summer.  </P> <P> "My interest is in having it on in Washington," producer Wolsk said, calling  the Arena venue "just as good, or maybe better" than the Kennedy.  </P> <P> "Mastergate," one of three theater projects that Gelbart has been working on  for several years, zings the Iran-Contra scandal, Oliver North, and TV coverage  of hearings on the scandal (the ace correspondent here is Merry Chase of the  Total News Network). It includes a plot to funnel $800 million to pro-American  Central American guerrillas through a Vietnam movie epic, "Tet: The Movie." And  it's not particularly reverent toward its genial, dense and fictional President  of the United States, about whom the question is raised: "What does the  President know, and does he have any idea that he knew it?"  </P> <P> "Mastergate" was given its premiere early this year by the American Repertory  Theater in Cambridge, Mass., drawing a rave from the New York Times' Frank  Rich.  </P> <P> Kennedy spokeswoman Davies, speaking by phone from Washington, insisted  Murphy's rejection had nothing to do with the play's content; he has neither  read nor seen it.  </P> <P> "We were rather nonplussed by the reaction," she said. "It was as though we had  scorned the orphan at the door and sent her away."  </P> <P> She pointed out that in 1985 the Kennedy staged Arthur Kopit's "The End of the  World With Symposium to Follow," about nuclear war, generals and the way think  tanks play games with the minds of citizens. The following year, it was home to  Peter Sellars' adaptation of the Greek tragedy, "Ajax," this one set in the  Pentagon and concerning Central America.  </P> <P> "All we care about is artistic merit," she said, adding, "we're not even  passing judgment on ("Mastergate"), because nobody's read a script yet."  </P></p>

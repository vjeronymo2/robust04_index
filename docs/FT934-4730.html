			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: LWT considers making bid for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees London Weekend Television is considering making a bid for Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, the financially-troubled ITV company in which it holds a 14 per cent stake. Following Carlton Communication's agreed conditional bid for Central this week, attention is turning to the future of LWT, the most attractive takeover target after Central. Granada, which early this year bought 20 per cent in LWT, is being put off by the latter's hefty 593p share price and is also reluctant to move before a proposed ITV ownership rule change is approved by parliament. The debate on the rule change, which outside London will allow one ITV company to hold two broadcasting licences, is scheduled for next Wednesday. Granada's results are due on the same day. Sir Christopher Bland, LWT chairman, is believed to be determined not to accept a takeover if he can find an alternative that makes financial sense for shareholders. Every possible target is being analysed at LWT, but despite the obvious difficulties Yorkshire-Tyne Tees has not been ruled out and is still being considered seriously. The main problems include the need to divest Tyne Tees and demonstrate that Yorkshire (in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a 14 per cent stake) could be quickly returned to profit. Uncertainty in the City over a possible bid could lead to a fall in the LWT share price, which could in turn make it easier for Granada to pounce. Senior managers at Tyne Tees would, however, be interested in a buy-out, although it is unclear whether such a deal could be financed. The Yorkshire-Tyne Tees results are expected on December 14 and are likely to show pre-tax losses of about Pounds 5m, mainly because of over-trading and discounting of advertising. The problems are likely to be tackled in the 1992-93 accounts and Lazer, the LWT advertising sales team which formally takes over the Yorkshire sales business on January 1, will be able to sell 100 per cent of the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees airtime. Yorkshire-Tyne Tees is capitalised at only about Pounds 90m, compared with LWT's market capitalisation of some Pounds 600m.</p>

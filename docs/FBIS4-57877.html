			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jaqueline Aponte] </F>   [Text] Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera has said the  country's fiscal deficit is worsening mainly because of the  crisis in the banking sector -- a crisis he says has prompted  irregular, unjustifiable, and perverse pressure on Venezuelan  currency to convert it to foreign currency, which is  impoverishing our nation.    He said the state currently does not have a plethora of  resources as it did in the past when resources were squandered  and used to encourage physical and moral corruption. He said:  "We do not have a great deal of money in our budget; instead, we  have found a tremendous deficit that is getting worse for a  thousand reasons."    Speaking at the Saturday inauguration of a newly built  section of the Trapichito neighborhood in Valencia, President  Caldera noted that although resources are scarce, there still  exists a great deal of hope, desire, and a strong work ethic in  the nation. He added that, through the joint efforts of various  state offices that deal with public housing and slums, the  nation will face these social problems, which it still considers  a priority.    "I feel a special calling to resolve the housing and slum  problems, and the government I head is committed to this and  intends to struggle and open the way to clean up slums  throughout the country and boost housing at every level in  accordance with the economic needs of the dwellers," Caldera  concluded.</p>

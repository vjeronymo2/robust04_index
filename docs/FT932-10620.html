			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (5): Bureaucrats test Japanese patience - Bernard Simon looks at the problems of, and opportunities for, foreign investors The advice to investors in Canada's forestry industry given by Mr Keith Fujieda, president of MC Forest Products of Vancouver, a subsidiary of Japan's Mitsubishi Trading is succinct: 'You have to be patient.' Mitsubishi and its partners, Kanzaki Paper of Japan and Crestbrook Forest Industries of Vancouver (in which Mitsu- bishi has a 25 per cent stake), endured several years of public hearings, private negotiations and loud environmental protests before they were able to start work on a CDollars 1.3bn hardwood pulp mill in nort- hern Alberta. The mill is finally due to come into production later this year, but is unlikely to be prof- itable before 1998. Nonetheless, Mr Fujieda is confident that the time, energy and money spent bringing the project to fruition will eventually be worthwhile: 'It was a very painful two years, but we have come up with the best pulp mill.' Mitsubishi is one of several Japanese companies which began investing heavily in Canada in the late 1980s when capital was cheap and abun- dant. They were especially attracted to Alberta, which was eager to diversify beyond the oil and gas industry, and - unlike British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec - had not allocated the bulk of the timber rights to its forests. Daishowa Paper and Maru- beni are partners in a pulp mill near Peace River, Alberta. Daishowa also bought a saw- mill in the province in 1990. As part of its 1988 purchase of Reed International's North American business, Daishowa took over a newsprint, pulp and paperboard mill near Quebec City. It also owns a nearby sawmill and has built a de-inking plant at the paper mill. The most admired Japanese investment in Canada is Oji Paper's partnership with Can- for in the CDollars 1.3bn expansion of the Howe Sound pulp and paper mill north of Vancouver. The mill, widely viewed as a model for the rest of the indus- try, combines Canfor's exper- tise in pulp with Oji's presence in the newsprint market. Oji helped finance the expansion. According to Statistics Canada, about 44 per cent of Canada's pulp and paper industry was foreign-owned in the late 1980s (the latest figures available). This is roughly on a par with the foreign presence in other resource-based sectors such as mining and energy. Many foreign-held companies are wholly-owned, so they do not have the same high profile as the publicly-traded Canad- ian producers. The biggest US subsidiaries include Stone-Consolidated, Kimberly-Clark, Boise Cascade and Weyerhaeuser. Among European companies, Stora and Bowater have newsprint mills in Nova Scotia. Stora also produces pulp. For some foreign investors however, the drawbacks of doing business in Canada have recently more than offset the benefits. The attractions of the US south compared to the high-cost Canadian industry led several US companies to reduce their exposure to Canada in the 1970s and 1980s. More recently, Fletcher Challenge, the New Zealand company which bought two large British Columbia forestry companies in the mid-1980s, has lightened its Canadian portfolio. It has sold several of the businesses included in the earlier purchases, and has cut its stake in its Canadian subsidiary from 72 to 63 per cent. Mr Doug Whitehead, pres- ident of Fletcher Challenge Canada, ticks off a string of irritants, including a new labour law in British Colum- bia, high taxes and what Mr Whitehead calls 'a lack of clarity' on such issues as aboriginal rights in logging areas, and the size of the allowable cut on provincially owned land. The prevailing mood among most foreign companies is summed up by Ms Patricia Dietz, an official at Stora's Canadian subsidiary: 'It's tough, but we're hanging in there.' Recent investments, whether by foreign-controlled or domestic companies, have mostly been restricted to meeting environmental standards or to modernising existing facilities. For instance, Stora, which has suffered losses for the past three years in Canada, is building a CDollars 60m secondary treatment plant at its Port Hawkesbury newsprint mill to comply with fish protection laws. The Swedish parent will decide later this year whether to spend CDollars 100m on a recycling facility. A few projects are more ambitious. The most notable of these is Oji's involvement in the Howe Sound expansion project. Another is nearing completion at a pulp mill near Castlegar, British Columbia, which is jointly owned by China International Trust and Investment Corp (Citic), Venepal of Venezuela and Chicago-based Stone Container. The CDollars 700m expansion - which took 14 months to wend its way through the govern- ment approval process - will more than double capacity from 535 to 1,200 tonnes a day of bleached northern kraft pulp. Mr Howard Hart, president of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association in Montreal, predicts that as barriers in the international pulp and paper trade fall - as the Canadian industry hopes they will - foreign investment in Canada and Canadian investment abroad are bound to expand still further. Mr Whitehead at Fletcher Challenge says that the Japanese are again taking a close look at Canada. The driving forces this time are the strong yen and fears of a shortage of logs, chips and other wood products. European investors cast a tangible vote of confidence last February by snapping up about a quarter of the 49 per cent of MacMillan Bloedel, which was put on the block by Noranda Forest. Nevertheless, forestry executives are unanimous that foreign interest in Canada would be a lot stronger if politicians and bureaucrats were to show a greater willingness to loosen their leash on the industry.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Canada's main forestry companies (figures in CDollars)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Sales        Net earnings (loss)                                   1992     1991     1992         1991  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Noranda Forest#                   4.5bn    4.1bn     (88m)       (209m) MacMillan Bloedel                 3.0bn    2.7bn   (48.8m)      (93.4m) Domtar                            1.9bn    1.8bn    (159m)       (148m) CP Forest Products                1.8bn    2.0bn    (248m)       (571m) Abitibi-Price                     1.7bn    1.7bn    (219m)      (75.9m) Repap                             1.1bn    1.0bn  (209.9m)       (180m) Canfor                           976.3m   822.5m   (49.9m)        (94m) Fletcher Challenge Canada##       957m     1.1bn   (43.5m)        (25m) Cascades                          902m    806.2m    28.2m        (1.6m) Weldwood                         732.9m   661.7m    17.5m         (33m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- #Prior to Feb 1992 sale of 49% stake in MacMillan Bloedel. ##Year ended June 30.

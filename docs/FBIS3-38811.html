			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Berlin (DDP/ADN) -- Karsten Voigt, the foreign  policy spokesman of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] group in  the Bundestag, has expressed scepticism about possible NATO air  strikes in Bosnia. The consequences of such an air operation  would have to be considered beforehand, Voigt said today on the  radio station Radio Brandenburg. Artillery positions around  Sarajevo could certainly be hit in an attack. However, civilian  casualties might also be expected, the SPD politician said.  Following a possible successful operation in Sarajevo, there  would also be demands for the same to be done in other encircled  towns in Bosnia. This might lead to an escalation, the  consequences of which would be incalculable, Voigt stated.    SPD defense expert Manfred Opel has also criticized NATO and  UN plans to intervene in the Bosnian war using air strikes.  Speaking on Norddeutscher Rundfunk today, Opel described these  ideas as "political actionism." It is to be feared that the war  in the Balkans will escalate if such attacks go ahead. NATO  would become a belligerent, but not one which could intervene  decisively, he asserted. [passage omitted]</p>

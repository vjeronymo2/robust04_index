			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Arts: Matthus's 'Song of Love and Death' - Opera Glyndebourne Touring Opera's production of Cornet Christoph Rilke's Song of Love and Death, the first opera by Siegfried Matthus to be mounted in Britain, completes the repertory of the company's autumn season. Much excitement and many high hopes have been stirred by the project. The experience itself surpasses them all. I know of few things in life more exhilarating than the first encounter with a contemporary operatic 'voice' capable of singing out truly, effectively, involvingly, and with its own clear-cut theatrical identity. In Cornet Rilke Matthus reveals, it seems to me, exactly that sort of voice; I hope the British opera-going public can be enticed to Sadler's Wells - or any of the other sojourn-points on the GTO tour plan - to undertake their own first encounter with it, and to share in the exhilaration. This 59-year-old German (formerly East German) has eight operas to his credit; Cornet Rilke (1985), his fifth, is already his most frequently performed. In these columns last Saturday Andrew Clark charted the progress of Matthus's career (much of it spent as resident creator for the Komische Oper in the former East Berlin) and outlined both the general characteristics of his compositional persona and the particular ones of a 90-minute 'opera vision' drawn from a famous prose-poem by Rainer Maria Rilke and written for bomb-destroyed Dresden. My colleague touched on the marriage of hard practicality, questing imagination and highly personal yet approachable musicality that goes to make up the Matthus persona. GTO's account of Cornet Rilke bears him out in every particular. On the simplest level this is real opera, not a musicked play or some other kind of music-theatre conception inadequately founded on musical vision. At every point the music sets the theatrical agenda, intervenes, sums up, carries the impulse forward; there is no question of the text (a fascinating Rilke adaptation by the composer) existing independently. The score, and therefore the drama, take their tone from Matthus's extraordinarily distinctive and beautiful writing for an 11-person chamber-orchestra and vocally far-flung (but never over-extended) chorus. On paper the choice of instruments may seem quirky or modish - horn (in some ways the protagonist of the whole show), flutes, harps, electric guitars, and a big battery of percussion. Not in the theatre. Animated by tingling metal, punctuated by guitar and harp flourishes, and personalised by ruefully lyrical wind and horn, the scoring lacks the sustaining strength of strings. Intentionally so: as the opera deals with the hallucinatory vitality and disconnectedness of war, the sound embodies the theme. Alternations of fast- and slow-moving stage activity, clothed in a musical language that will alarm no one comfortable with the later Mahler symphonies or the late-Romantic attitudes to tonality of Britten and Shostakovich, possess a comparably picaresque absence of surface logic. Yet, just as the full span of Matthus's scenes is traceable to a single eight-note tone-row, so the diversity of his war-vision is similarly based on a thematic unity. To the opera's stripling hero - played by two Cherubino-like mezzo-sopranos, representing respectively his outer and inner existence - war brings vigorous, courage-testing life but also sudden, meaningless death. For all its late-Romantic musical patina this is an intensely modern work. To that modernity the GTO production team - producer Aidan Lang, designer Lez Brotherston, lighting by Davy Cunningham, movement Stuart Hopps - have responded with enthralling boldness: their staging proves full of kaleidoscopically vivid imagery created by elliptically mobile screens, sudden foreshortenings of physicality in chorus and principals and economically-stated bursts of colour. The flaws, on Monday, were a barrage of stage noise and a shortage of intelligible English words (Bernard Jacobson's translation is used) - but musically there was always sufficient compensation. Conducted by Martin Andre, the show boasts outstanding instrumental and choral delivery, a crisp concentration in pace, and admirable confidence in the solo voice parts. In an ideal world Matthus's laconically sensuous combination of female timbres is probably achieved with voices of more naturally sumptuous quality. That said, the accomplishments of Julie Unwin and Beverly Mills (the two mezzo Rilkes) at the head of a cast including Edith Pritchard, Eirian Davies, Peter Savidge and David Thomas deserve high praise. In sum, and as Don Giovanni might say, 'Bravo, bravo, arcibravo]' to Glyndebourne Touring Opera. And this is the company the Arts Council is threatening with extinction . . .

			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, March 30 (YONHAP) -- China  circulated a draft of the U.N. Security Council president's  statement Wednesday urging North Korea to accept additional  inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    The mildly worded draft statement was being offered by  Beijing, Pyongyang's only remaining major ally, as an  alternative to a U.S.- drafted resolution on the North Korean  nuclear dispute.    Although the contents of the statement and the resolution  are  similar, the Chinese draft does not set a deadline for the IAEA  director-general to report back to the Security Council on the  progress of IAEA inspections.    The Chinese version also modifies a clause in the draft  resolution that says the council will consider follow-up  measures if necessary, changing it to "the council can consider  the North Korean nuclear problem again if necessary."    Meanwhile, the four other permanent members of the Security  Council -- the United States, Britain, France and Russia --  circulated the U.S.-drafted resolution among all council members  after they failed to strike a compromise with China on its  contents.    At Wednesday's meeting, China and such non-aligned members  as  Pakistan, Rwanda, Nigeria, Oman and Djibouti said they preferred  that the Security Council adopt the "consensus" formula, which  calls for the consent of all members.    Since this consensus formula means in effect a presidential  statement, the council was leaning toward adopting the Chinese  version after modification of its wording, according to sources.    The Security Council is expected to hold another informal  closed-door meeting Thursday (local time) and, depending on the  outcome of negotiations on the wording, the council could adopt  a presidential statement the same day.    The Chinese representative at the United Nations, Chen Jian,  told reporters after Wednesday's meeting that an absolute  majority of Security Council members favored the consensus  formula.    "This is a positive signal that the Security Council would  adopt a presidential statement," he added.    Chen also reaffirmed that China would never go along with a  resolution, but he gave no indication that he would veto the  resolution if the council was forced to vote on it.    The council president, Jean-Bernard Merimee of France, said  negotiations between the United States and its allies and China  will continue as their positions remain far apart.</p>

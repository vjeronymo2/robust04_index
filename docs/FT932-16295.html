			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Armed gangs block Papua gold project CRA, the Australian mining group, has abandoned plans to produce gold in the Mount Kare region of Papua New Guinea, drawing renewed attention to the touchy relationship between the government and foreign resources companies. The withdrawal, announced in Port Moresby on Sunday, comes three weeks after CRA evacuated Mount Kare, claiming that staff were being threatened by rival gangs of armed landowners. The group rejected demands for an apology from the government, which claimed that the evacuation was related to a financial dispute between CRA and Kare-Puga Development Corporation (KDC), the landowners company. CRA agreed in October to transfer to KDC its 51 per cent stake in a joint venture which owns an alluvial goldfield in the area around Mount Kare. The remaining shares in the joint venture are owned by KDC. The group had intended to retain the rights to prospect for hard-rock gold deposits, but appears to have given up hope that the security problems in the area can be overcome. CRA said that 'disproportionately high costs,' had been incurred at 'great effort and risk,' in an attempt to stabilise the Mount Kare project in the interests of landowners and the good name of the Papua New Guinea mining industry.</p>

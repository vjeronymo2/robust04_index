			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / US textile industry sees record sales and exports The US textile industry, long among the most protected of US sectors, is emerging from 1993 with record sales, exports, production and capital spending, and a determination to compete in overseas markets. The industry waged a long battle against the 10-year phase-out of the Multifibre Arrangement agreed in the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, but is by no means certain to oppose the Round's implementing legislation in the US Congress. The sector's strategy evolved from insistence on protectionism, to pushing a long phase-out of quotas to acceptance of a shorter phase-out on terms favourable to the industry. Now industry officials talk of the Round's potential for boosting foreign sales and opening foreign markets with the same relish as their counterparts in services, high technology and export manufacturing. 'The changing world of international trade in textiles means we must take advantage of every opportunity to export,' said Mr Henry Truslow, president of the American Textile Manufacturers Institute in a year-end statement. Mr Truslow stressed the positive results of the Uruguay Round and the possibility some of the main textile exporters, Pakistan and India, will agree to significant market openings by April 15 when the final text is to be signed in Morocco. 'If they open up, they will also be trading with each other,' said Mr Jim Morrissey, an ATMI spokesman. 'That will take some of the heat off us.' The ATMI's embrace of freer trade is being met with cynicism among lobbyists who fought its protectionist efforts for years. 'I would be really stunned if the ATMI supported this deal,' said Ms Robin Lanier, for the International Mass Retail Association. Yet ATMI had significant victories in the Round. Quotas will be phased out but tariff protection will remain. The US agreed to cut tariffs by 11 per cent, which brings down average tariffs from 18 to 16 per cent. According to the ATMI officials, 39 countries so far have agreed to open their markets to foreign imports. They say that countries which fail to provide 'effective' market access, a term still to be defined, may be taken to the new dispute settlement mechanism under the World Trade Organisation, where the outcome could be denial of the accelerated quota growth agreed in the Uruguay Round.</p>

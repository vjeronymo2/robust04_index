			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Sport: It's not tennis that's at fault A new think tank has been formed, which will discuss not how to combat federalism or how to house the homeless, but the more immediately pressing problem of how to make tennis more exciting. Those who follow Wimbledon have become possessed with the idea that contemporary players are less interesting than their predecessors. Instead of dismissing this notion with a smart cross-court volley, the tennis authorities have been tossing it back and forth in a pointless, feeble rally. Very few tennis players are regarded as charismatic when they are at the height of their powers. This is true today and has always been true. Only when their talent is in decline, and they start playing in a more 'entertaining' manner, because they have less to lose by doing so; or when they stop playing altogether, and memory makes of them symbols of antique charm - only then do most tennis players acquire charisma. The truth is that when they were playing, Nastase was a petulant pain and McEnroe a hysterical bully; that Borg was regarded as a bore and Connors as a boor. Nostalgia is as strong a force at Wimbledon as a Croatian serve, and it is now creating discontent where none should exist. Who were these great characters who once enthralled us with their charm and style? More to the point, why should they have done so then, and why should they do so now? It is hard to understand this idea that athletes who play tennis should also have to play to the gallery. Last week, at Wimbledon, I watched a match between Patrick Rafter and Sergei Bruguera which surely contained everything that a tennis fan would want: five sets and four hours of toughness and brilliance. But no - this was not enough. The crowd had to care who won, and so from these two apparently equally personable men they painstakingly fashioned for themselves a favourite, turning Rafter's gauche looks into those of a sex symbol, his intense tennis into that of a showman and his every instinctive gesture into an expression of great personality. Incidentally, I think that they have picked a non-starter with Rafter, who at his post-match press conference revealed a personality which could rival Michael Stich's for charmlessness. Perhaps people don't mind that, as long as he is not boring. I, however, ask nothing of my tennis players except that they don't behave badly. I would not have minded if, on court, John McEnroe had failed to shout funny little asides, or perform little jigs, or jump the net, or hug the line judge, as long as he had kept his abysmal temper to himself. I don't expect Alan Shearer to give me a quick tapdance after scoring, or Brian Moore to parade newly-shaved legs before a line-out, and I am quite happy for Pete Sampras to carry on playing without trying at the same time to get himself an Equity card. However, the phenomenon of Wimbledon is embraced by people who don't really like sport, but who simply like Wimbledon. Most of them are women. Wimbledon takes its cue from the flocks of schoolgirls who moon around its sumptuous courts looking for someone to fancy, and from the neat, flowery middle-aged women who sit primly in tea rooms and revel in the tournament's affirmation of Englishness. If sport is, on the whole, a man's world, Wimbledon is a woman's. For two weeks, women are in charge. The men who follow them around those green and sunny alleys look as quenched as the cuckolds in a Restoration comedy. And it is because Wimbledon is a sporting event for people who don't like sport that the entertainment factor carries so much weight. Unless the crowds have someone to prefer, someone to find attractive, someone to amuse them, they are not sufficiently interested in tennis to restrain themselves from nipping off for a cup of tea with every change of ends. But it is quite wrong to take this incipient boredom seriously, and even more wrong to invite suggestions on the non-subject, which incidentally included the ideas that spectators might be allowed to applaud during rallies and to leave their seats whenever they wished. Why should they do so? They are not children, to be given a lollipop to suck when they don't get their own way. There is something irritating and destructive about a sporting crowd which has constantly to be reminded of how grateful the event is for its participation; and something misguidedly humble about a sporting event which thinks its crowd has the right to behave like this. Spectators are important, but they are never more important than the thing they are watching.</p>

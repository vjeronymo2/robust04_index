			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / International Company News: Canadian Pacific plunges into red in first quarter THE NORTH AMERICAN recession, a collapse in resource earnings, and problems with its investment in Laidlaw, hit Canadian Pacific hard in the first quarter. It was the worst quarter for the group since the depth of the 1982 recession. The big holding company posted a loss of CDollars 5.3m, or 2 cents a share, against a profit of CDollars 476.2m (USDollars 410. m), or 24 cents, a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars 2.45bn against CDollars 2.56bn. Operating earnings fell to CDollars 81.9m from CDollars 139.9m. The first-quarter loss had been widely expected, but CP warned that results would continue to be 'disappointing' until the economy turned around. The big forest products subsidiary, depressed by weak newsprint and pulp markets, posted a heavy loss. CP Rail and the other transportation subsidiaries were down sharply, as was the property development subsidiary. Only PanCanadian Petroleum made a higher contribution, while telecommunications and machinery manufacturing were lower. CP included a loss of CDollars 3.9m on its investment in Laidlaw, the big waste management and school bus group, against income of CDollars 8.8m a year earlier. The results included CP's equity share of Laidlaw's write-down in its investment in ADT of Britain. In succeeding quarters, Laidlaw will be making a positive contribution. CP has voting control of Laidlaw and nearly 20 per cent of the total equity. For the rest of 1991, CP will benefit from seasonal upturns in the rail business, hotels and possibly property operations, and also from lower interest rates. But forest products and coal will continue depressed and oil and gas income may decline.</p>

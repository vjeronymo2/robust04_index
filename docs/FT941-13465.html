			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Austrian leader denies he will quit over affair The Austrian president, Mr Thomas Klestil, who is under increasing political pressure over a love affair with an aide, denied yesterday he was considering resignation, Reuter reports from Vienna. 'I will survive this,' Austrian state television quoted Mr Klestil as saying, breaking a 48-hour silence on the growing scandal. In its main news bulletin, the TV station said Mr Klestil's office had confirmed the text of an interview in which the president declared himself 'optimistic' and ruled out any thought of resigning. Mr Klestil's wife of 37 years, Edith, left him earlier this month saying she could no longer bear his close relationship with the aide, Ms Margot Loffler, 39, who like Mr Klestil was a career diplomat. The 61-year-old president promised at the weekend he would act quickly to resolve his personal crisis, but yesterday political friends and media commentators increased pressure on him for a clear choice between mistress and job. Mr Klestil, in the interview due to appear in today's Die Presse newspaper, said he would go ahead with a scheduled speech at the United Nations building in Vienna on the role of family values in bolstering world peace. A polished politician allied to the conservative People's party (OeVP), Mr Klestil was elected president in 1992, replacing Kurt Waldheim, whose term of office was overshadowed by allegations of Nazi wartime crimes. Although largely ceremonial and non-partisan, the office of president is highly respected by Austrians, many of whom defended Mr Waldheim the more he was ostracised abroad. Most commentators believe Mr Klestil can remain in office only if he parts with Ms Loffler. Damage also is great for his party, the junior partner in the coalition government. It has steadily lost ground to the Freedom party of right-wing populist, Mr Joerg Haider. If Mr Klestil decided to resign, the country would face new presidential elections in a political year already booked full with a general election, state polls and a referendum on joining the EU. 'If Klestil wants to show he's fit for office he'll sign the order to send her (Ms Loffler) as special envoy to Finland,' said the Taglich Alles newspaper.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> A RUNAWAY FOR OLYMPIC PROSPECT  </P> <P> After being plagued by various ailments during his career, Olympic Prospect is  feeling good these days.  </P> <P> "He's sounder now than he's ever been," trainer John Sadler said.  </P> <P> Olympic Prospect's improved health is evident on the track. Hardly a slouch  before, the 5-year-old Northern Jove gelding is better than ever right now.  </P> <P> Thirteen days after a 10-length victory over a solid allowance field, Olympic  Prospect turned the $105,200 National Sprint Championship at Hollywood Park on  Saturday into a one-horse race.  </P> <P> The Grade III event was billed as a match between Olympic Prospect and Sam Who,  but Olympic Prospect was a clear winner despite a less-than-alert takeoff.  </P> <P> At the finish, the 6-5 second choice had a bit more than a length on the 4-5  favorite and his 12th victory in 24 lifetime starts.  </P> <P> In the process, he capped a three-winner afternoon for Sadler, who moved into a  tie with David Hofmans atop the trainer standings, and provided Alex Solis with  his fifth stakes victory of the 24-day-old meeting.  </P> <P> "We think he's at his best," Sadler said after Olympic Prospect's 1:08 4/5  journey, which included :21 3/5, :43 3/5 and :55 4/5 fractions.  </P> <P> "He's a lightly-raced horse who's kind of in the middle of his campaign rather  than at the end of a long year. He's doing really well, and I just wish he had  performed a little better on the East Coast (in the Breeders' Cup where he  finished fifth, then was placed fourth on Sam Who's disqualification).  </P> <P> "Being inside of Sam Who didn't bother me, but I was concerned when he stumbled  at the start and then had to run head and head with Ron Bon for about a quarter  of a mile. When he shook him loose, I knew we'd be in pretty good shape."  </P> <P> Being sounder, Olympic Prospect is also more willing to change leads. Reluctant  to do it in the past, he has come through in each of his last two starts.  </P> <P> "That's the difference this year," Solis said. "He used to stay on his left  lead from the three-eighths pole to the wire. Now, he switches, and he's able  to find another gear.  </P> <P> "He was anxious and moving when the gates opened and he stumbled a little bit.  He's a fast horse and was able to get up with that other one right away, then  he finished well. John's done a great job with this horse."  </P> <P> Having ridden Sam Who all year, Laffit Pincay decided to remain with the  Lypheor gelding Saturday, even though he was aboard for Olympic Prospect's 1:08  2/5 allowance win on Dec. 3.  </P> <P> Still, at the top of the stretch in the Sprint Championship, he thought he had  made the right choice.  </P> <P> "I thought I was going to get the other horse," he said. "But Olympic Prospect  didn't come back to me. My horse ran his race and he finished well.  </P> <P> "You have to give the winner credit. He didn't break that good, and when (Ron  Bon) went with him, I thought he'd stop, but he just kept running."  </P> <P> Olympic Prospect could return in two weeks for the six-furlong Palos Verdes at  Santa Anita.  </P> <P> "He's nominated, but (racing secretary) Tom Robbins will decide that for us,"  Sadler said. "It'll depend on the weights."  </P> <P> Olympic Prospect's victory followed wins by Royal Eagle and first-time starter  Devine Force and left Sadler batting .300 for the meeting. His nine victories  have come from 30 starters.  </P> <P> "I've got plenty of horses," he said in regards to a possible run at the local  training title. "I'm going to have to look at a condition book pretty seriously  now."  </P> <P> Heartlight No. One's second foal is already a step ahead of her first.  </P> <P> Several months after his highly touted half-brother, Alyone, bombed in two  starts at Santa Anita, Spotlight No. One won at first asking for trainer Gary  Jones and owners Burt and Carol Bacharach in the sixth race Wednesday.  </P> <P> The 2-year-old son of Cox's Ridge did a lot of things wrong in his debut, but  still managed to beat heavily favored Indian Wind a neck in 1:16 2/5 for the 6  1/2 furlongs, a distance that didn't figure to be his best.  </P> <P> Besides racing greenly, Spotlight No. One got loose and ran off briefly in the  post parade with Chris McCarron.  </P> <P> "It scared the hell out of us when he got loose, the way things have been going  for us," Jones said.  </P> <P> "I thought he was awfully impressive, but he still doesn't know what he's  doing. He looks like a 3-year-old and he thinks he's something special."  </P> <P> McCarron said the colt, the 3-1 second choice, galloped out strongly, and he'll  likely try two turns in his next start. "We'll give him three weeks to a  month," Jones said. "We want to be careful with him."  </P> <P> The victory was especially gratifying for Burt Bacharach in light of what  happened to another of Heartlight No. One's foals.  </P> <P> "This colt's half-sister by Lyphard died on the farm," he said. "She would have  been a yearling. This win takes some of the sting out of that loss."  </P> <P> Tanker Port, who continued Hofmans' hot streak with a win in Friday's feature,  may return in the Native Diver Handicap Saturday.  </P> <P> One of 11 nominees to the 1 1/8-mile event, Tanker Port is now unbeaten in four  appearances on the main track after running seven furlongs in 1:21 2/5 Friday  while defeating Perceive Arrogance by almost three lengths.  </P> <P> "He came out of the race well," Hofmans said. "We're not certain if he'll run.  If the field comes up short, there's more of a chance of him going.  </P> <P> "This horse has changed so much since Del Mar. Maybe he's maturing now. He  loves this track and he likes Santa Anita."  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Ray Seeley, who spent eight years on the California Horse Racing Board, has  retired. He will be replaced by an appointee by the governor. . . . Hollywood  Park linemaker Russ Hudak has established Grand Canyon the solid 6-5 favorite  for today's $1 million Hollywood Futurity. The Ron McAnally entry of Silver  Ending and Single Dawn is next at 4-1, then comes Dominant Dancer and  Individualist I (5-1), Farma Way (6-1), Phantom X. (15-1), Talented Pirate  (20-1) and Elikos (30-1).  </P></p>

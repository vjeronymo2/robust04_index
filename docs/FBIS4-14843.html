			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from Jaba Ioseliani, head of the Georgian delegation </F> at the Geneva negotiations on the Abkhazian conflict, to UN  Security Council Chairman Jean-Bernard Merimee (name as  published); place and date not given: "To Batoni (Georgian  polite form of address) Jean-Bernard Merimee"]    [Text] Dear Mr. Chairman!    First of all, I would like to express my gratitude for the  big contribution that you are making to the matter of the  peaceful settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia.    I note with great satisfaction the extremely objective and  constructive character of your speech. It clearly points out  those counteractions that are hindering the achievement of  substantial progress at the Geneva negotiations, which is the  fault of the Gudauta grouping.    I would like to emphasize that this grouping does not want  to  see a successful conclusion to the Geneva negotiations and,  primarily, the introduction of UN troops into the region, which  should ensure the dignified and safe return of refugees and  displaced persons to their homes. The separatists want to  maintain the existing situation and transform the democratic  structure, which has been changed by force, into an irreversible  phenomenon. I would like to point out also that, if we need UN  troops to ensure the security of the refugees and displaced  persons, the aim of the Gudauta grouping is to use them to  violate the territorial integrity of Georgia and camouflage the  filtration of refugees and displaced persons.    It was pointed out at the session of the Security Council  that the introduction of UN troops into the region and the  return of refugees and displaced persons are interrelated issues  and humanity demands that these problems be resolved in the  shortest period of time. It is also significant that, in its  Resolution 901 of 4 March 1994, the Security Council requests  that the secretary general submit to the Council by 21 March a  report on "any progress" achieved at the Geneva negotiations and  on the existing situation in the area, with particular attention  paid to those circumstances that could be used as a basis for  the deployment of peacekeeping troops, and on the forms for the  creation of these troops (Paragraph 2; there is an English text).    We believe that, in accordance with existing rules, in order  to deploy these troops, both the agreement of the two sides and  the achievement of progress at the talks are necessary.    In the memorandum on mutual understanding and the  communique,  both sides involved in the conflict request that the UN  introduce peacekeeping troops. Thus, the first condition has  been satisfied.    As regards the second condition, the situation here, as you  know, is very complex: What can be considered as "any progress"  on the path toward a full-scale settlement?!    At the third round of negotiations held in Geneva and New  York, two documents were the focus of attention: The joint  statement and the quadrilateral agreement on the voluntary  return of refugees and displaced persons.    We believe that the point that stipulates the creation of a  standing committee for the elaboration of proposals on the  political and legal status of Abkhazia is of particular  significance.    In order to guarantee the preservation of both the  distinctiveness of a small nation and Abkhazia's statehood, we  are ready to give them the following rights:    1. The territorial supremacy of Abkhazia's state power (or  the impossibility of changing the territory of Abkhazia without  its agreement).    2. The right to have its own constitution.    3. The right to have its own state language (or languages).    4. The right to have its own state symbols.    5. Representation in the highest body of state power in the  Republic of Georgia.    6. Respect for the rights of the entire multinational  population of Abkhazia.    7. Broad local self-administration.    Apart from the aforementioned, we are ready to guarantee the  possibility of Abkhazia's self-organization within specific  limits in accordance with the Republic of Georgia Constitution  and the Law on Abkhazia, which implies:    1. The right to determine its own system of supreme and  local state bodies;    2. The right to determine its own administrative and  territorial division;    3. The right to have its own legislation;    4. The right of legislative initiative in the Republic of  Georgia's supreme state bodies;    In order to raise Abkhazia's political and legal status and  impart real and specific substance to its jurisdiction, we are  ready to implement the division of the objects and powers of  administration between the supreme state bodies of the Republic  of Georgia and Abkhazia, for which purpose the following has to  be determined:    1. Abkhazia's exclusive jurisdiction;    2. The Republic of Georgia's exclusive jurisdiction;    3. Joint jurisdiction.    The list of specific objects appertaining to each of these  points will be determined during the course of the negotiations.  We support the maximum expansion of both the jurisdiction of  Abkhazia and the joint jurisdiction of the center and Abkhazia  within the limits established by world constitutional practice.    As regards the mechanism for legitimizing the agreements  adopted on the division of the objects and powers of  administration, I believe this should be implemented by means of  a law on Abkhazia. I think this law should be adopted either by  a special constituent body created by the sides involved in the  conflict or by the whole population of Abkhazia in a referendum  and then approved by the Georgian Parliament.    In order to ensure the protection and implementation of the  adopted agreements, it is desirable to have international  guarantees from the UN and the CSCE.    As regards the agreement on refugees and displaced persons,  the provision that is being proposed to us by the Abkhazian side  is unacceptable since it prohibits a large number of the  refugees from returning home peacefully. Almost all family  members have been fighting with weapons in their hands for the  territorial integrity of their motherland. Many of them belong  to armed formations even today. However, all of them are  awaiting a peaceful settlement of the conflict and are ready to  lay down their weapons and return peacefully to their native  homes.    The groundless demand of the Abkhazian separatists was  rejected by the Security Council that, in its Resolution 896  (1994), recognizes the right of the refugees and displaced  persons to return without "any prior conditions."    Hence, the Geneva negotiations were deadlocked on account of  the position adopted by the Gudauta grouping. In our view, UN  troops should be deployed in Abkhazia immediately and talks on  the organized return of refugees continued. Otherwise, hundreds  of thousands of desperate people will spontaneously enter the  region, which will make it impossible to preserve peace.    The deployment of UN troops in Abkhazia will bring about a  change in the atmosphere of anarchy and terror and will force  the separatists to fulfill the obligations that are recognized  on the basis of the memorandum and communique. All these  formations and people who entered the region to take part in the  armed conflict should be disarmed and expelled.    In this way, taking into account these views, we consider it  possible to return once more to a discussion of both documents  but, if the Abkhazian side again wrecks the conclusion of the  quadrilateral agreement, of the two variants of the joint  statement proposed by us, one should be enough for the adoption  of the decision on the deployment of UN troops by the Security  Council.    As regards the assertion by representatives of the Abkhazian  side that the decree adopted by the Georgian Parliament on 10  March of this year has ostensibly hindered the continuation of  the process of negotiations, this does not correspond to the  truth. I would like to explain that Point 2 of this decree  states that the Supreme Soviet of the Abkhazian Autonomous  Soviet Socialist Republic in its present composition has been  disbanded, without referring to Abkhazia's autonomous statehood  as such. We have always conducted negotiations (and will  continue to do so) with our opponents from Gudauta in their  capacity as a side that is participating de facto in the  conflict and not as the legitimate power in Abkhazia. This  cannot be otherwise as a body of power, in whose work exactly  half (32) of the 64 elected deputies have not been participating  for almost two years now and are resident outside its borders,  cannot be viewed as being legal. All the more so as, owing to  the quotas established by an apartheid electoral law, it is  precisely that half of the deputies who have been banished that  represents the largest part of the Abkhazian population --  300,000 people, whereas the other half can be viewed as  representing at best the 160,000 inhabitants left in Abkhazia  (30 percent of the prewar population).    There is no time to be lost. Mr. Chairman, what is needed is  a swift response. It is now clear to everyone that local hot  spots and aggressive separatism are bringing us to all-out war.  I hope that you will take into account the arguments outlined  above and will do everything to ensure a peaceful end to the  conflict in the shortest possible time.</p>

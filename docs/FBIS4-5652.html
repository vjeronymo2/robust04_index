			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 12 KYODO -- Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba  Corp. have pulled out of the European microwave oven market due  to sluggish demand and will focus on the audiovisual equipment  market there, spokesmen for the companies said Tuesday [12  April].    A spokesman for Hitachi said the company's British  subsidiary  stopped production of microwave ovens last fall and has wiped  out inventories by late March.    Hitachi Consumer Products UK Ltd. began production of  microwave ovens in 1987 for sale in Britain and its output  peaked in 1988 at 100,000 units but fell to 10,000 in 1993, the  spokesman said.    The subsidiary's main products are television sets and  videocassette recorders and it will concentrate on these, he  said.    Sales of microwave ovens account for less than 10 percent of  total sales of the British subsidiary, the spokesman said.    A spokesman for Toshiba said the company in February sold  its  equity stake of some 33 percent in a microwave oven joint  venture in France to its joint venture partners, AEG Hausgerate  AG of Germany and TEM Electromenager of Italy.    The spokesman cited sluggish sales of microwave ovens and a  company strategy in Europe of focusing on the audiovisual  equipment market as factors behind the move.    The French joint venture, Compagnie Europeenne Pour La  Fabrication D'Enceintes a Micro-Onde (CEFEM), was established in  January 1986 under equal equity partnership by Toshiba and the  two other companies.    CEFEM's production peaked in 1988 at some 220,000 units, but  had plunged to some 100,000 by 1993 due to increased  competition, the spokesman said.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Books: Inside a man-of-war - FT Children's Book of the Month CROSS SECTION: MAN OF WAR written by Richard Platt, illustrated by Stephen Biesty Dorling Kindersley Pounds 12, 32 pages CAN children's information books be as attractive, as authoritative and as quick and easy to use as the kinds of information that can be obtained from a computer at the touch of a button? One British publisher that has certainly risen to these challenges is Dorling Kindersley, which specialises in publishing information books, usually in large formats, that integrate text, colour photography, and both traditional and highly sophisticated graphics. This autumn it publishes The Bird Atlas (Pounds 10.99), a continent-by-continent guide to the world's birdlife, the latest in a series of pictorial atlases for children of eight and above, and The Dorling Kindersley Science Encyclopaedia (Pounds 25), which manages to make scientific subjects seem both intellectually challenging and readily intelligible. Again, an excellent array of different kinds of illustration helps to bring life to the subjects under discussion: computer graphics and aerial photography, for example. Neither of these titles, however, quite matches in excellence Stephen Biesty's Cross Section: Man-of-War. Stephen Biesty's first book, Incredible Cross-Sections (Pounds 12.99) was published last year. It was a large-format picture book of a very unusual kind. Having first made careful studies of architectural plans and drawings Biesty sliced through the middle of 18 buildings and machines - the Queen Mary, the Empire State building, the Flying Scotsman, a tank, and Covent Garden's Royal Opera House, for example  -in order to reveal their inner workings. Over a sequence of double-page spreads (two of these spreads had fold-out pages, which meant that the illustration of the cross section of the Queen Mary was almost one metre in width), we see what goes on inside the buildings; we see how the building or machine was made; and we also see how it was used: on board the Flying Scotsman, for example, we glimpse an extraordinarily dignified gentleman in a waistcoat squatting on a tiny lavatory, trousers round his ankles. This method of presentation yields up a mass of fascinating technical information; and, simultaneously, it demonstrates what it must have felt like to travel on the Flying Scotsman in the 1930s. Biesty's new book concentrates on a single subject: a British man-of-war of the late 18th century (it is based on Nelson's flagship, HMS Victory). Spread by spread, he brings to life how the boat functioned as a war machine, what went on in every reeking nook and cranny of it, under such headings as: health at sea; cooking and eating; leisure and supplies; working sea; battle stations; sleeping; the offices; the admiral. He has again taken a slice through the middle of the ship so that we see it from the inside, deck by deck. Every full-page illustration is crammed with the minutest details of life on board with fascinating incidental information on the opposite page, all linked to something that can be glimpsed in the picture. Under 'Navigation and Discipline' we read of 'shot rolling', for example: 'Ships on the verge of mutiny were known in the navy as 'shot rolling ships'. This was because discontented crew members tried to knock unwary officers off their feet by sending cannon balls rolling along the deck.' Biesty and his partner Richard Platt (who contributes the excellent text) has brought the punishing regime on board a 100-gun man-of-war alive in a way that will make history seem as vivid, fascinating and contemporaneous as the latest computer game.</p>

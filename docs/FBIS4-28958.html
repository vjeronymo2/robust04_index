			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The Central Guidance  Committee of the Korean Chondoist Association in a statement  June 13 strongly urged the Japanese authorities to immediately  stop their crackdown on the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) and Koreans in Japan and  apologize for it and punish those responsible for the recent  criminal acts.    "The recent crackdown on the Osaka and Kyoto prefectural  headquarters of Chongnyon was a fascist outrage designed to  totally suppress Chongnyon, part of their premeditated anti-DPRK  moves encouraged by the U.S. manoeuvres to isolate and stifle  the DPRK over its fictitious `nuclear issue', and a grave  challenge to the DPRK, an independent and sovereign state," the  statement says, and goes on:    "The Central Guidance Committee of the Korean Chondoist  Association sternly denounces the Japanese police outrages in  the name of the entire Chondoists of the DPRK, branding them as  rash acts of murderers, fascist maniacs to commit a second Kanto  massacre.    "We will consider any suppression of Chongnyon to be an  encroachment on the dignity and sovereignty of our republic and  decisively counter it.    "If the Japanese authorities persist in their crackdown on  Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan, they would be held wholly  responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom."    The statement expresses the hope that the South Korean  Chondoists and Tangun Taejonggyo believers too would turn out in  the struggle to defend the dignity of their resourceful nation  and check the Japanese reactionaries' suppression of Koreans in  Japan.</p>

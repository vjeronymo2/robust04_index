			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Hambro Countrywide loses Pounds 4.64m - Parent to inject Pounds 9m for 49% stake in legal insurance arm HAMBRO Countrywide, the loss-making estate agency chain and financial services group, is to get Pounds 9m in fresh cash from the Hambro merchant banking group through the sale of a 49 per cent stake in Hambro Legal Protection, its legal insurance arm. News of the purchase came as Hambro Countrywide, one of the UK's top three chains, announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.64m for the six months to June 30, 9 per cent up on last time's Pounds 4.25m. The company has reported losses for the last three and half years and incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 6.48m last year. With the housing market in recession, Hambro Legal Protection has been the star performer in the group, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.8m in 1991. Pre-tax profits in the half year to end-June were Pounds 1.1m, up from Pounds 900,000 a year earlier. The sale is conditional on the approval of Hambro Countrywide shareholders. Under the terms of the deal, Hambro Group Investments will also acquire an option to buy the remaining 51 per cent of Hambro Legal Protection for a minimum contribution of Pounds 9.5m cash. A statement from the banking group yesterday said the purchase this would give the Hambro Group flexibility in the development of its future strategy for its insurance services investments, including the eventual flotation of an insurance services group. The sale comes after seven successive bleak half years for Hambro Countrywide because of the problems of the housing market. In the half year to end-June turnover amounted to Pounds 45.3m, down from Pounds 46.6m. Mr Christopher Sporborg, chairman, said that turnover was likely to remain unsatisfactory until confidence returned to the economy, and especially to the housing market. He warned that a mild market recovery following the general election had been brief and that new business was now dropping because of the end of stamp duty exemption and the continuing recession. 'A government initiative to revive the housing market would greatly assist this return to prosperity,' he said. There was a slight reduction in the number of properties sold by the agency chain and the average house value fell by 7.6 per cent to Pounds 65,600. The chain arranged 7,372 mortgages with a total value of Pounds 339m on total sales of 19,920 properties, and sold 9,045 life assurance policies. Profits from life assurance activities rose from Pounds 2.89m to Pounds 4.43m. Losses per share were 1.41p, (1.3p). As in 1991, a nominal interim dividend of 0.05p is declared to preserve the company's trustee status.</p>

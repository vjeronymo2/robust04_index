			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Arts: Today's Television White Heat on BBC2 is one of the most thoughtful series for a long time. Today's episode considers standardisation and its effects, showing how it has been central to the development of technology in the past century. Babbage was unable to realise his design for a mechanical calculator in 1830, arguably a prototype computer, partly because of disagreements with his engineer but also because of the lack of standardised components. Now that so much has been standardised, and with genetic engineering a reality, the programme asks: 'Will the temptation to standardise human beings be resisted?' (8.00). Happily, GF Newman's dramas always stir things up. He is a radical who sees it as his job to question the accepted and flout authority. He reckons medical science has become 'wholly decadent and self-serving' and his two-part drama The Healer, about a newly-appointed senior house officer, reflects this (9.30 BBC1). Part 2 tomorrow. The X-Files is the latest in that stream of American weirdo-drama which began with 'Twin Peaks'. This time the theme is investigation of the paranormal (9.30 BBC2).</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Brussels warns on EU entry talks The European Commission yesterday hinted that it might not be possible to meet the March 1 deadline for wrapping up negotiations with all four countries seeking to join the European Union. At a briefing in Brussels, an official left open the possibility of leaving behind one or more applicants. This would mean abandoning the 'convoy' principle, whereby Sweden, Finland, Austria and Norway all conclude negotiations at the same time. The March 1 deadline is viewed as crucial if the present European parliament is to have enough time to give a favourable opinion on membership before the June elections. A delay would mean waiting for a new parliament, thus jeopardising the target date for EU entry at the start of 1995. A Brussels official suggested that the warning marked a shot across the bows to the candidate countries as all parties brace themselves for the last lap of negotiations on agriculture, regional policy, fisheries and budget contributions, by far the trickiest dossiers. 'It is a question of who blinks first,' said the official. Sweden has made the most progress, with Norway lagging. The Oslo government opened talks two months later than its fellow candidates, but it is also sticking to a tough line on whaling, agriculture and fisheries. Both Finland and Austria are somewhere in the middle. Austria still has problems with the treatment of transit traffic and secondary homes, and it shares Finland's deep reservations about Commission proposals to align farm prices with EU levels on entry into the Union. Talks are now focusing on the level and duration of compensating income support for farmers, with the bill to be picked up by the applicant countries. This affects, in turn, how much the four rich applicants can put into the EU budget.</p>

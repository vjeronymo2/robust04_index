			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / People: Persimmon splits role Yorkshire-based Persimmon, regarded as one of the best regional housebuilders, is splitting the role of chairman and chief executive. The present incumbent, Duncan Davidson, will continue as executive chairman. John White, 41, becomes group chief executive as part of a reshuffle of board responsibilities. White, who has been with the group since 1979, was formerly executive chairman of the housing division responsible for the Midlands and south east England, and is replaced by Mike Farley. Mike Allen, 48, who has been with the group since 1976, becomes deputy chairman. He retains responsibility for the Yorkshire and north east England markets. Davidson, 51, has ambitious plans to expand the company's size and has decided to strengthen senior management accordingly. 'We would like to double output to about 4,000 homes a year by the mid-1990s,' says Davidson who, with his wife, owns just over a fifth of the company. 'The timing of expansion, however, will depend upon recovery in the housing market.' Davidson says the decision to split the functions of chief executive and chairman is in line with the recommendations of the Cadbury committee. He stresses, however, that the decision was not prompted by that report: 'It is just coincidental that we believe this is the right thing to do for a company of our size and at our stage of development,' he says.</p>

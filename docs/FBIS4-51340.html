			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exchange Square" column by Lulu Yu] </F>   [Text] Business conferences and investors' forums are  becoming increasingly useful and important events for those  doing business in China. Useful and important, that is, for  those who can afford to attend them. If you're not there, too  bad. The views and information passed around in these meetings  are often a closely guarded secret.    Which is really unfortunate. There is a lot of good, solid  information in company presentations at these events which help  investors understand certain companies better, especially  recently listed China-based companies.    Take Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia's investors' forum  which  ended yesterday. It got together 240 fund managers from three  continents, possessing among themselves a global pool of  U.S.$3,000bn-3,500bn (about HK$23,400bn-27,300bn) under  management, and 64 companies from Hong Kong, China and the  region to exchange views in a four-day seminar and workshop.  Attending fund managers said it was useful for the chance to  meet so many company executives from different countries in a  one-stop visit.    The presentations, mixed in quality we were told, helped  analysts write their reports and fund managers make their  investment decisions. The company people said it gave them a  good venue to market themselves to brokers and investors.    Yet, the press was barred from covering the forum. The  reason given was that the participants wanted to speak more  freely without being placed under the spotlight. It's a reason  cited increasingly frequently these days. We heard it before at  a recent business conference in Beijing organised by the  International Herald Tribune, a newspaper whose own journalists  were not given full access.    In a day and age when transparency is encouraged in public  companies, it is disappointing to know that businessmen would  say certain things to analysts and fund managers that they  wouldn't to the press, and in turn, the general investor who,  like the institutional investor, is an owner of the company.    In fact, this veil of secrecy is adopted mainly for the  benefit, or at the demand of Chinese companies and officials,  who don't have a tradition of being open and honest about their  businesses.    Their desire to be as much insulated from public scrutiny as  possible has unfortunately cowed most people who do business  with them, including their brokers, to be equally evasive.    It is for this reason that many brokerages, including Credit  Lyonnais, refuse to share their research and their views on  Chinese companies with the public. A pity really, for a house  ranked tops for its China research. Some say they have no  choice. If some of their reports got into the newspapers, a  number of Chinese companies could see their prices collapse, and  China might come down on the brokerage like a tonne of bricks.    "They have long memories, you know. If you write something  they don't like, they're going to remember it for a long time.  It's one thing to give the information to your clients, it's  another to see it all over newspapers," one Credit Lyonnais  executive said. He is not alone in his paranoia, or should we  say, caution. One person from Smith New Court recently got very  worried when his views on China got published.    We know China runs a blacklist of journalists. Maybe they're  compiling one on analysts, as well.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 17 (CTK) -- New Finance Minister  Rudolf Filkus today spoke about how the government would resolve  the "three suicidal steps" that were forecast for the new  government a few weeks ago.    Filkus said that currency devaluation was a matter for the  Slovak National Bank alone, and that the government should not  interfere.    The second step is the restrictive measures in the social  sphere, upon which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) makes  conditional the provision of credit.    Filkus spoke about the need to show to the outside world  that  the new government's actions would introduce political and  economic stability. Until then it is possible to consider new  discussions with the IMF with the aim of moderating the impact  of the restrictions on the general population.    The third step is to begin discussions about the revision of  the general tripartite agreement, and to look for ways to  augment state income. The notorious 50 billion koruna (about  $1.7 billion) state debt requires enormous interest payments  which worsen the budget deficit still further.    Filkus said he saw income reserves mainly in the control of  taxes and tariffs, adding that he did not yet have the necessary  "prescription."    He also mentioned the hitherto ineffective import surcharge,  which although having "cleansed the market for Slovak producers"  had not succeeded in saturating the market with local products.</p>

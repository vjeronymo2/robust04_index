			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Iraq warns Arabs of retaliation over 'no-fly' zone IRAQ yesterday warned its Arab neighbours they would face reprisals if they helped the allies to impose a 'no-fly zone' south of the 32nd parallel. Employing language reminiscent of the Gulf conflict, Iraq's ruling Revolution Command Council said that Baghdad would pick the best moment to retaliate, indicating that it wanted to avoid an early clash. 'We shall choose the proper way and the proper time to confront this outrageous aggression,' the RCC statement said. The RCC meeting, presided over by President Saddam Hussein, demanded 'clear and firm' Arab opposition to the air exclusion zone which came into force yesterday. Warplanes from the US Britain and France began patrolling the skies over southern Iraq to prevent aerial activity by Iraqi fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. The allied aircraft will be operating from air bases in Saudi Arabia, and from the carrier USS Independence in the Gulf. France has committed 10 Mirage fighter-bombers and Britain six Tornados to police the exclusion zone. The US reportedly has about 200 aircraft in the region, including Stealth fighter-bombers. Among sophisticated 'offensive' aircraft on the Independence are F-14 and F-15 Phantoms and A-6 Intruder bombers. US naval commanders in the Gulf have said they will not hesitate to shoot down Iraqi aircraft that violate the 'no fly zone' rules. Iraq, meanwhile, was reported to have withdrawn its aircraft to positions north of the 32nd parallel. However, Iraqi ground forces, including some Republican Guard divisions, are continuing operations against Shia Moslem rebels in southern Iraq, many of whom have taken refuge in the marshland that straddles the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Arab states, including members of the US-led alliance, which expelled Iraq from Kuwait, reacted nervously to yesterday's implementation of the exclusion zone. Saudi Arabia added its voice to concerns about the possible dismemberment of Iraq. Saudi radio, quoting what it described as a 'responsible source,' reaffirmed the kingdom's 'constant desire for the territorial integrity and non-partitioning of Iraq.' In Baghdad, the RCC statement heaped particular scorn on countries such as Saudi Arabia which are providing facilities for aircraft policing the exclusion zone - although no Arab air forces will take part in the operation itself. The Iraqi leadership said it would hold Arab countries supporting the west 'fully responsible. . .before God, history, the Arab and Islamic nation and their own people.' 'Tomorrow is not far away,' the RCC statement warned. It added that US leaders had become 'so cheap to the extent that they turned the aggression against Iraq into an electioneering ploy.' 'US claims to protect the Iraqi people are false. Most Arab countries have rejected the plan. . .because it threatens Arab national security,' the statement said. Further afield, Malaysia added to criticism of western actions in Iraq, accusing the allies of double standards by enforcing a 'no-fly zone in southern Iraq while being cautious over Serbian attacks on Bosnia. 'It is a double standard, something which makes us all very unhappy,' Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told a news conference at the end of a visit to Bangladesh. In Beijing, Mr Abdullah Bishara, secretary general of the Gulf Co-operation Council, yesterday said Chinese leaders were concerned about the fragmentation of Iraq; but they fully supported UN resolutions against Baghdad. He said China, one of five permanent members of the UN Security Council, was forceful in demanding Baghdad comply with all council resolutions. Mr Bishara was speaking at a news conference after meeting China's premier, foreign minister and other officials.</p>

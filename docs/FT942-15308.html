			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / International Company News: Blockbuster deal 'difficult' Mr Frank Biondi, chief executive of Viacom, the US cable television group, said the company's planned merger with Blockbuster Entertainment would be difficult to close due to current stock market prices, Reuter reports. Despite the uncertainty of the ability to complete the proposed merger, Mr Biondi said Viacom remained happy with its acquisition of Paramount Communications. Although the merger with Blockbuster would provide additional financing for the deal, Mr Biondi said Viacom was capable of handling the Paramount acquisition on its own. Viacom could raise additional funding through the sale of assets if the Blockbuster merger were not completed, Mr Biondi said. 'If in fact Blockbuster is not going to happen, we've had the luxury of having a lot of inquiries about a lot of assets,' Mr Biondi said.</p>

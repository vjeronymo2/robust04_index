			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: Japanese groups face higher cost of raising funds / Examining the impact of the expiry of equity-linked warrant bonds worth Y9,000 bn during the year FEARS that Japanese companies would try to refinance a large part of the Y9,000bn (Dollars 77bn) worth of equity-linked warrant bonds which expire this year by issuing more of the same have subsided, but Japanese industry is being forced to pay higher financing charges as a result. The lacklustre outlook for the Tokyo stock market, as well as resentment among investors who took part in the large round of equity-linked financing at the end of the 1980s, has prompted large, blue-chip companies to redeem the expiring issues by taking out bank loans or by issuing straight bonds in the domestic debt market or in the Eurobond market. They are opting for these methods of financing in spite of the additional borrowing costs of around 2 per cent. According to the Bond Underwriters' Association of Japan, domestic straight bond issuance by Japanese companies rose to Y2,469bn in the last nine months of 1992, slightly higher than the whole amount raised in 1991. 'We have to be responsible towards our investors,' says Nissan Motor. 'We can't issue a warrant bond with a strike price at Y700 when investors are holding old warrants with a strike price of Y1,600.' Nissan will finance its Dollars 1.5bn warrant bond which expires in October through the issue of straight bonds. Toshiba, the electronics company, says it will use bank borrowing and straight bonds to refinance its USDollars 1.2bn warrant bonds expiring in November. According to the Japanese finance ministry, about 70 per cent of the refinancing has already been scheduled. Half will be done through bank borrowings and the rest through mainly straight bonds and commercial paper. Mr David Knee, economist at Daiwa Securities in London, believes that the fall in corporate liquidity in Japan in recent months also suggests that companies are not using their financial resources for investment but rather to pay off debts or shore up reserves. Kleinwort Benson, in Tokyo, calculates that about Y244bn, or 3.6 per cent of pre-tax profits of industrial companies for the current financial year to March, will be absorbed by increases in interest costs and refinancing fees. However, some Japanese companies are once again dipping into equity-linked financing to raise funds. In the last quarter of 1992, Japanese warrant bond issues reached Dollars 5.5bn, the most active period since the middle of 1991, according to IFR Securities Data. The companies' approach has outraged some institutional investors. Critics claim that to help sell warrant bonds, underlying share prices are being artificially lowered before the terms on the warrants are fixed, bringing down the strike price. Mr Kota Nakako, a senior analyst at Quick Research Institute, says that if market forces were really at work, no company would be able to issue equity-linked bonds. 'It's back to the old Japanese ways where everyone is supporting the scheme and making it work,' he says. Indeed, the Bank of Japan warns that, in the long run, equity financing may not be as cheap as it looks at the moment. In a recent report, the bank says that the dilution of earnings per share due to equity-linked financing will lead to an eventual fall in share prices, thus reducing the scope for further equity-linked financing. However, this is a lesson some Japanese companies may not want to learn.</p>

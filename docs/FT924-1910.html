			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Survey of The Baltic Basin States (10): Well-placed to gain  -The port of Rostock recalls its historic role ROSTOCK is shaking off 50 years of central planning and staking a claim to become Germany's commercial gateway to the Baltic region. The ancient Hansa trading city appears well-placed for the role. Rostock is strategically located midway across the German Baltic seacoast, astride the main north-south transport route between Stockholm, Copenhagen, Berlin and Prague. Much to the chagrin of local leaders, however, Rostock's reputation was badly dented last August when young rightwing extremists attacked asylum-seekers in the city. Most Rostockers are now ashamed of what happened, but the damage was done. Shortly after the second world war, Rostock port was built into the then East Germany's main harbour. By 1989 it employed 6,000 people and handled 20m tons of goods. Young people from all over the country were lured to the city by relatively high wages in the harbour and adjacent shipyards. But in 1991, the first full year of German unity, cargo turnover plummeted to 6m tonnes as Rostock lost its function as an overseas port not only for East Germany but for Czechoslovakia and Hungary as well. Hamburg and Bremerhaven were far better suited to handle this international traffic. Rostock turned to its traditional sphere of influence, the Baltic region. New shipping terminals and ferry links to Denmark were inaugurated. More than 80 companies set up shop in the harbour area and by the end of this year the port expects to handle 10m tons of cargo. Two hundred thousand tons of this is military hardware being shipped back to Russia by the CIS army in east Germany. A recent study says that Rostock harbour could regain its 1989 volume by 1996. Much will depend on the overall economic situation in Germany and the rest of Europe. A malting plant owned by a French company in the harbour area is doubling capacity to 160,000 tonnes next year and intends to export brewing barley grown in the region. A new coal-fired electric power station in Rostock is to import all its coal through the harbour. Rostock harbour, employing 800 dockers plus a pool of 400 part-timers, is in fact one of the brighter economic spots in an otherwise gloomy economic picture for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the most rural east German state. Nearly 75,000 people will leave the state this year for west Germany, and only 30,000 people will settle here. Most seriously, many qualified young workers are leaving. Unemployment in Rostock and the state is nearly 14.7 per cent, but is understated by the fact that many workers have been given early retirement while others are employed in job-creation and retraining schemes. But Mr Wiglef Purschel, head of the economic section of the chamber of industry and commerce (IHK) in Rostock, sees hopeful signs in the interest being shown by southern German and Austrian companies in Rostock for trans-shipping their goods to Scandinavia. He foresees that in the longer term Rostock will play an important role in the economic future of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, as their shortest trade route to continental Europe runs through Rostock. Rostock also stands to gain from Poland's westward economic integration, as well as from the planned east-west autobahn across east Germany to Lubeck in the west. Poland, of course, has its own nearby Baltic harbour of Szczecin (formerly Stettin, which served Berlin), which competes with Rostock. But Mr Purschel says that Szczecin's severe infra-structure and administration problems, along with long delays for trucks at the Polish-German border, hamper the region's development. Similarly, cross-border economic co-operation between Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Poland is proving difficult to implement. Decision-making in Poland remains highly centralised, and Szczecin is a long way from Warsaw. The construction industry was to have been the main engine pulling Rostock and the entire region out of its economic misery, but so far private building has been less active than expected. As elsewhere in east Germany, contested property claims are the main barrier, followed by administrative delays in approving building projects. The Rostock area's main shipyard, Warnowwerft in nearby Warnemunde, was recently sold to Kvaerner of Norway, but the smaller Neptun yard in Rostock remains to be privatised. Only a fraction of the 58,000 people who were employed in east German shipbuilding still work in the industry today and 15 ships ordered by the former Soviet Union still remain undelivered and moored at the yards. Predictably, Scandinavian companies have been the main foreign investors in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. One of them, Scanbeton, subsidiary of a Swedish company, has built four cement plants in the Rostock-Stralsund area at a cost of DM15m. While praising the teamwork of Swedes and Rostockers, Mr Peter Michael, the managing director, blames administrative red tape for holding up the the long-awaited building boom in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern as well as the rest of eastern Germany.</p>

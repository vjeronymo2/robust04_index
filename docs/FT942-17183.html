			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Buy-out at Excalibur jewellery subsidiary Excalibur Group, the precision engineering and giftware company, has agreed the sale of Premier Chain, its jewellery chain business, to a management buy-out. The price is Pounds 1m, plus the repayment of a 45kg gold bullion loan, worth Pounds 375,200, and repayment of Pounds 748,000 of inter-company debt. The deal, which is subject to shareholders' approval at a special meeting on April 21, follows the strategy Excalibur outlined at the time of its interim results in January when it said it would focus on its two main businesses and that jewellery was a non-core activity. The sale will cut gearing, which stood at over 100 per cent in the last balance sheet, although net assets will fall slightly, from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 9.4m as the business is being sold slightly below asset value of Pounds 1.23m. As well as the proceeds of the sale, Excalibur will be relieved of funding Premier's working capital, which fluctuated sharply because of the seasonality of the business and moves in the gold price.</p>

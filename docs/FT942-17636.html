			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Fuel groups 'recycle' VAT bonus Banks and building societies that have the regional electricity companies and British Gas as customers will be among the main beneficiaries from the rush to meet the March 31 value added tax deadline. More than 1m householders met the deadline for making advance payments to avoid VAT on domestic fuel. Most of the companies have decided to deposit the advance payments with banks and buildings societies, although they also mentioned money market funds as possible destinations. Manweb and Northern Electric were the only regional electricity companies to say they were still considering what to do with the extra cash. There have been suggestions that the advance payments could total as much as Pounds 1bn. This will not be known until next week because of the holiday weekend. The companies have collected more than Pounds 663m from householders trying to avoid VAT, which was imposed at a rate of 8 per cent from yesterday, rising to 17.5 per cent in April next year. The Pounds 663m figure does not take into account the final rush as Thursday's deadline approached. British Gas reported by noon on Thursday that 2 per cent to 3 per cent of its 18m domestic customers had made advance payments totalling Pounds 230m. Full returns from its national network of gas showrooms will not be available until next week, however. If the intentions to favour banks and building societies materialise, it will mean that much of the money will be 'recycled'. Most consumers withdrew funds from banks or building societies to make the advance payments, which they hope will give them an effective yield greater than the relatively low rates on offer for savings. Seeboard noted that its decision to deposit in building societies the Pounds 64m it received from 115,000 customers by Wednesday night meant that it was 'effectively returning' the capital. Most electricity companies say the extra interest earned will be used to cover the administrative and data processing expenses associated with the imposition of VAT. Scottish Power will donate the extra interest it receives to groups 'who have been disadvantaged by the introduction of VAT on fuel'. Midlands Electricity is to donate Pounds 500,000 to Neighbourhood Energy Action to fund energy-efficiency projects for low-income households in its area.</p>

			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Normand helps European Motor to advance 48% European Motor Holdings, the motor retail and services group, lifted pre-tax profits 48 per cent from Pounds 2.64m to Pounds 3.89m in the six months to September 30. The shares rose 3p to 124p. In July the group bought Normand Motor Group in a deal worth Pounds 11.75m, doubling its size. In two months, the acquisition contributed Pounds 1.2m to group operating profits of Pounds 3.86m (Pounds 2.86m). Mr Richard Palmer, EMH chief executive, said benefits deriving from the integration of the 20 Normand dealerships - including greater management controls, shrinkage in the workforce, the introduction of a used car business and facility improvements - would come through within 18 months to two years. Reorganisation costs of Pounds 425,000 and a Pounds 106,000 provision for a non-core disposal took a large bite from the Pounds 778,000 profit made from the sale of Norman's Mercedes-Benz dealership in Bristol. Growth in the pre-Normand dealerships was modest at Pounds 2.07m (Pounds 1.96m), though Mr Palmer said that August was 'a little better than last year' and had started with a robust order intake, which fell off slightly. He said he was confident of 'the market for the types of cars we sell' - premium and prestige cars - would be moving forward and cited the strong January order book as an indicator of the upturn. Group turnover rose to Pounds 126.2m (Pounds 81.5m) with Normand pitching in Pounds 40.3m. Operating profits on the motor services side slid to Pounds 1.08m (Pounds 1.38m), partly as a result of some customers of Wilcomatic, the automatic car-wash subsidiary, deferring purchases into the next financial year. Earnings grew to 6.6p (4.9p) per share and the interim dividend is raised from 1.725p to 2p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning's CITIZEN newspaper reports a plot to  assassinate Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] leader  Constand Viljoen if he continues his efforts to take the front  into the election. The plot allegedly has its origin in  militant groups within the Volksfront who are violently opposed  to the election. The shock revelations come after a weekend of  drama which saw General Viljoen registering the front without  the go ahead of its executive. The registration was later  withdrawn.</p>

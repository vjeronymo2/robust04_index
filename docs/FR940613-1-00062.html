			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) A holder establishes that the ownership indicia maintained following foreclosure or its equivalents continue to be held primarily to protect a security interest by, within 12 months following foreclosure, listing the UST or UST system or the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located, with a broker, dealer, or agent who deals with the type of property in question, or by advertising the UST or UST system as being for sale or disposition on at least a monthly basis in either a real estate publication or a trade or other publication suitable for the UST or UST system in question, or a newspaper of general circulation (defined as one with a circulation over 10,000, or one suitable under any applicable federal, state, or local rules of court for publication required by court order or rules of civil procedure) covering the area where the UST or UST system is located. For purposes of this provision, the 12-month period begins to run from the time that the holder acquires marketable title, provided that the holder, after the expiration of any redemption or other waiting period provided by law, was acting diligently to acquire marketable title. If the holder fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title, the 12-month period begins to run on the date of foreclosure or its equivalents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A holder that outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system or the facility or property on which the UST or UST system is located establishes by such outbidding, rejection, or failure to act, that the ownership indicia in the secured UST or UST system are not held primarily to protect the security interest, unless the holder is required, in order to avoid liability under federal or state law, to make a higher bid, to obtain a higher offer, or to seek or obtain an offer in a different manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fair consideration,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a senior security interest in the UST or UST system, is the value of the security interest as defined in this section. The value of the security interest is calculated as an amount equal to or in excess of the sum of the outstanding principal (or comparable amount in the case of a lease that constitutes a security interest) owed to the holder immediately preceding the acquisition of full title (or possession in the case of an UST or UST system subject to a lease financing transaction) pursuant to foreclosure or its equivalents, plus any unpaid interest, rent, or penalties (whether arising before or after foreclosure or its equivalents), plus all reasonable and necessary costs, fees, or other charges incurred by the holder incident to work out, foreclosure or its equivalents, retention, preserving, protecting, and preparing the UST or UST system prior to sale, re-lease of an UST or UST system held pursuant to a lease financing transaction (whether by a new lease financing transaction or substitution of the lessee) or other disposition, plus environmental investigation and corrective action costs incurred under &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.67; less any amounts received by the holder in connection with any partial disposition of the property and any amounts paid by the borrower subsequent to the acquisition of full title (or possession in the case of an UST or UST system subject to a lease financing transaction) pursuant to foreclosure or its equivalents. In the case of a holder maintaining indicia of ownership primarily to protect a junior security interest, fair consideration is the value of all outstanding higher priority security interests plus the value of the security interest held by the junior holder, each calculated as set forth in the preceding sentence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon an offer of fair consideration  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means that the holder outbids, rejects, or fails to act upon within 90 days of receipt of a written,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> firm offer of fair consideration for the UST or UST system received at any time after six months following foreclosure or its equivalents. A ``written,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> firm offer'' means a legally enforceable, commercially reasonable, cash offer solely for the foreclosed UST or UST system, including all material terms of the transaction, from a ready, willing, and able purchaser who demonstrates to the holder's satisfaction the ability to perform. For purposes of this provision, the six-month period begins to run from the time that the holder acquires marketable title, provided that the holder, after the expiration of any redemption or other waiting period provided by law, was acting diligently to acquire marketable title. If the holder fails to act diligently to acquire marketable title, the six-month period begins to run on the date of foreclosure or its equivalents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;280.220  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Ownership of an underground storage tank or underground storage tank system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ownership of an UST or UST system for purposes of corrective action.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A holder is not an ``owner'' of a petroleum UST or UST system for purposes of compliance with corrective action requirements under &sect;&sect;280.51 through 280.67, provided the person:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Does not participate in the management of the UST or UST system as defined in &sect;280.210; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Does not engage in petroleum production, refining, and marketing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ownership of an UST or UST system for purposes of the UST technical standards.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A holder is not an ``owner'' of a petroleum UST or UST system for purposes of the UST technical standards provided that the holder:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Does not participate in the management of the UST or UST system as defined in &sect;280.210; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Does not engage in petroleum production, refining, and marketing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

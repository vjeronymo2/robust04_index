			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / International Company News: JR West listing decision this week Japan's transport ministry will decide this week whether to go ahead with the listing of West Japan Railway (JR West) as originally planned, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The government is considering whether to list JR West on Japan's stock exchanges before the end of the current fiscal year next March, transport vice-minister Mr Michihiko Matsuo was quoted by a ministry spokesman as telling a news conference. 'We are in a difficult situation, but we will make a decision soon, probably by the end of this week,' Mr Matsuo was quoted as saying. JR West applied in August to be listed on six Japanese exchanges, including the Tokyo Stock Exchange and Osaka Securities Exchange. Most stock market participants expect the JR West listing to be postponed following the unsuccessful October 27 listing of another government entity, Japan Tobacco.</p>

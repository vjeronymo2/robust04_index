The statement by Basta and an unnamed FBIS officer was  published by the Czech independent daily MLADA FRONTA DNES at  the weekend. According to Basta, the Czechoslovak intelligence  services provided incumbent President George Bush's election  staff with information about Clinton's stay in Prague in 1970  and interviewed his acquaintances in Prague, looking for  information to discredit him.    The unnamed FBIS officer had told the paper that information  was recorded for Bush's staff not only regarding the fact that  Clinton had visited Moscow shortly after the 1968 invasion of  Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact troops, but also regarding details  about Clinton's hosts in Prague, the daughter and son-in-law of  early Czech communist and later reformer and Charter 77  signatory Marie Svermova.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Wates launches Pounds 31m cash call Wates City of London Properties, the only UK property company to hold all its assets in the City of London, yesterday announced a Pounds 31m rights issue to allow it to take advantage of the upturn in the City property market. Wates said the decision to launch the rights, which will help it to carry out developments, retain existing buildings and exploit new opportunities, followed talks with institutional shareholders. 'People take the view that the property cycle is starting again. With these big buildings, you have to start early rather than later,' said Mr John Nettleton, joint managing director. The rights may allow Wates to go ahead with the redevelopment of Winchester House at 100 Old Broad Street, which is expected to start next year. The money will allow Wates to refinance Vintners' Place, a joint venture with Sumitomo Corporation. The 267,000 sq ft building by the River Thames, which is substantially unlet, is likely to need Pounds 10m to Pounds 20m of new funds from Wates in 1995. Wates said that the City rental market has stabilised since the fourth quarter of last year, although 'it still remains difficult to achieve substantial lettings on attractive financial terms'. The 2-for-7 rights issue, which involves the issue of 44m new shares at 73p apiece, follows a Pounds 24m rights issue last September, which was used to cut borrowings. The rights issue, which has been underwritten by Morgan Grenfell, has been sub-underwritten by Mercury Asset Management, whose clients hold 9.3 per cent of the company. Brokers to the issue are Cazenove and Warburgs. The cash call sent Wates' shares down 5p to 75p. It was greeted cautiously by analysts, some of whom are wary about medium term prospects for large new City developments. 'The development wheel is already rolling. A lot of stock already has planning permission. Two years out, we could be heading for another oversupply situation,' said Mr Marc Gilbard of Goldman Sachs. Wates said the valuation of one of its buildings at Queen Victoria Street was 'significantly lower' than thought last December, after a lower-than-expected rent review. See Lex</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Moroccan Finance Minister Mohamed Sagou by </F> special correspondent Blandine Hennion in St. Petersburg; date  not given: "Morocco Intends To Profit From East Europe's  Reconstruction" -- first three paragraphs are LIBERATION  introduction]    [Text] The Moroccan finance minister is one of the 33  governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and  Development [EBRD], the congress of which ended yesterday. He  explained to us why his country is interested in East Europe.    The third annual meeting of EBRD governors closed last night  in St. Petersburg with a general feeling of satisfaction. [EBRD  President] Jacques de Larosiere thanked the 33 governors who had  "given their wholehearted support" for his strategy. He  anticipated that 1994 would not be a highly profitable year for  the bank: "Costs are high because of the new priorities approved  by the shareholders." He added that major investments would be  required for the EBRD to be present in each of the 25 countries  of operation and to finance priority aid to small businesses.    Moroccan Finance Minister Mohamed Sagou came to Russia as an  EBRD governor. Here are the impressions of one of the bank's  few southern representatives.    [Hennion] Why is Morocco a member of the EBRD?    [Sagou] We were asked to take part. Our participation of 0.1  percent is the same as that of Egypt and the countries of the  former socialist bloc. Morocco has close ties with Europe and  does two-thirds of its business with the continent. That is why  we are interested in European aid to help Eastern countries  adapt to the market economy.    [Hennion] Are you pleased with the way the EBRD's operates?    [Sagou] Yes, but we are above all pleased with the business  potential that the transformation of these countries represents  for Morocco. This is the first time I visited St. Petersburg:  They lack a lot here. Morocco has much to offer to Russia, in  particular agro-food products and textiles.    [Hennion] What about the other countries of East Europe?    [Sagou] You cannot provide for everyone.    [Hennion] You have come from Marrakesh, where the GATT trade  agreements were ratified. What will profit Morocco most: The  fact that they were signed in Marrakesh, or the agreements  themselves?    [Sagou] Both. First, this was an historic event that will  improve other countries' awareness of Morocco. In the longer  term, the GATT agreements are going to open up markets. That  will present us with an industrial challenge: Industry has to  be competitive. That is why it is important to maintain our  privileged trading relations with the countries of Europe.    [Hennion] Morocco is often cited as an example by the IMF.  What do you think will happen at the interim committee meeting  to be held in Washington on Friday?    [Sagou] Morocco has successfully implemented an adjustment  policy: Inflation is under control at less than 5 percent, the  budget deficit is less than 2 percent, and our economic growth  rate is 4 percent.    [Hennion] What about unemployment?    [Sagou] That is one of our weak points. It averages around  16-17 percent. It is precisely to reduce unemployment in  southern countries that I hope that the Washington meeting will  decide on a better distribution of financial flows between the  North and the South. Public aid aimed at restructuring  economies or modernizing infrastructures should be redirected to  the South.</p>

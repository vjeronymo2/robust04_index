			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 2 ARRESTED AFTER CONFRONTATION ON MISSION BEACH BOARDWALK  </P> <P> Two San Diego men were taken into custody Sunday night and each booked on five  felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon after a confrontation with others  near the Belmont Park area of Mission Beach, authorities said.  </P> <P> About 6:15 p.m., a group of 10 to 20 black males allegedly attacked a group of  whites on the boardwalk near Belmont Park, according to Sgt. Chuck Peck, a  spokesman for the San Diego Police Department.  </P> <P> A second group of whites was then attacked, but, while fighting back, forced  the suspects onto the beach in the Bonita Cove area, Peck said.  </P> <P> There the assailants armed themselves with barbecue utensils stolen from a  family that was picnicking at the beach, Peck said. They used the utensils to  attack the group they had first confronted, he said.  </P> <P> Peck said one of the suspects announced to the crowd that he had a gun, but  none was displayed. By this time, a sizable crowd had gathered, and the  suspects fled in several cars, Peck said.  </P> <P> Two men who later returned were promptly arrested by police. Because the  assailants "uttered numerous inflammatory racial statements," police are  labeling this a hate crime, Peck said.  </P> <P> Don Alexander, 19, and Richard Maxey, 25, were being held in County Jail  downtown. They were also cited on suspicion of several misdemeanor violations  in addition to the felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon, Peck said.  </P></p>

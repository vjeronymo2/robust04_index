			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program] </F>   [Text] Russia's strategic missiles, which are on combat  alert, will have a zero flight task. This was how Lieutenant  General (Viktor Yesin), the head of the operational department  of the main headquarters of strategic missile forces, explained  the essence of the Russian-U.S. agreement on the nontargeting of  their strategic missiles at one another. According to him,  day-to-day control of nuclear weapons will be carried on the  basis that Russia has no enemies as defined by the Russian  military doctrine. At the same time, the general noted that  under certain circumstances on orders from the Russian  president, the supreme commander of the armed forces, targets  could be introduced into the missiles' control system. This  system still exists and the essence of a combat alert has not  changed.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sawsan al-Jayyar, Ibrahim Khalil, 'Abdallah </F> Kamal, Karim Subhi, and Khalid Dawud]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] The Egyptian State Security  has dealt a strong blow to the terrorists' plans for 1994.  Behind the success was a major general who learned those plans  and tactics by heart and knew how to deal with those who tried  to implement them. As a punishment for his competence, he was  assassinated five days after the killing of 'Adil 'Awad.    Only a few people knew that Major General Ra'uf Khayrat was  the unknown man behind many of the State Security strikes.  [passage omitted]    The biggest beneficiary [from Khayrat's killing] are the  Muslim Brotherhood members, who described the assassination as  the most holy operation since the assassination of President  al-Sadat. We will not be surprised by this if we know that  Major General Khayrat was among the keenest watchers of the  Muslim Brotherhood activities. He considered the group, lying  dormant until the right moment comes, to be responsible for much  of what is happening in Egypt. Khayrat, a former aid of Major  General Fu'ad 'Allam, is of the latter's school, which does not  distinguish between a moderate extremist and a non-moderate  extremist. He believed the Muslim Brotherhood is still very  active, with its secret branches and its members ready for the  moment when weapons can be brought out, especially since the  organization has open channels to the outside world.    That only a few people knew this fact explains why the  Muslim  Brotherhood members were happy at the murder of Ra'uf Khayrat,  who never took his eyes off them.    A few days after the incident, the extremist Islamic Group  began talking once again about mediation, but this time with the  support of the Muslim Brotherhood, and under a program that  included several points:    --Granting the Muslim Brotherhood and the extremist groups  the right to go public.    --Stopping military trials and arranging retrials of cases  in which death sentences were passed.    --Releasing all detainees.    --Revoking the order to arrest 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman.    --Stopping security pursuits against Islamic Group members.    This time, the mediation proposal was carried by lawyer  Muntasir al-Zayyat, and it is said that Mukhtar Nuh, his Muslim  Brotherhood "counterpart" lawyer, will join him, along with  'Isam al-'Aryan, Fahmi Huwaydi, and leftist lawyer Nabil  al-Hilali.    But lawyer Muntasir al-Zayyat denied any knowledge of this.  He said: "Any media coverage of the mediation will spoil it.  There should be no talk about any efforts until results are  attained." He explained his proposals at the lawyers congress  as a "personal view of how to get out of the dark tunnel." In  return, the interior minister, at his press conference, denied  any secret contacts and said: "We will not negotiate with  killers and criminals."    When a source from the extremist groups was told that a  desire for mediation reflects weakness, the source replied:  "Even if this is true, we must realize that this is only a  phase, after which the brothers will continue their activity.  If the request for mediation is understood as a truce, then so  be it."    So, it is indeed an attempt to reach a truce, and it is also  an attempt to recoup from the blow to the major plan worked out  by 'Adil 'Awad's organization, especially since the killing of  Ra'uf Khayrat failed to cause the needed confusion.</p>

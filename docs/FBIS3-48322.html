			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 25 KYODO -- The main opposition Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) agreed Tuesday [25 January] to set up a  joint committee of both houses of the Diet to discuss the fate  of the government-proposed political reform bills that were  rejected by the House of Councillors last week. The LDP made  the decision at a meeting of executives, party officials said.    If two-thirds of the 20 joint panel members agree on a  compromise plan, the four bills can be enacted into law once  they are endorsed by a majority of votes at plenary sessions of  both houses.    The seven-party coalition hopes that the package would be  enacted during the current Diet session by reaching a compromise  with the LDP at the joint committee but the prospect of reaching  an accord before the Saturday closure of the Diet is slim,  political sources said.    The coalition will be forced to take a floor vote on the  package again at a plenary session of the lower chamber, the  sources said.    The legislation, which passed through the lower house last  November, could become a law when passed a second time by the  lower chamber by a majority of two-thirds or more of the members  present. However, the coalition will need about 70 defections  from the LDP to secure a majority of two-thirds in the lower  house and political analysts say such a case is unlikely.    Senior officials from the ruling coalition and the  opposition  of the lower house steering committee will agree later in the  day to set up the committee and the forming of the committee  will be formally endorsed at a lower house plenary session on  Wednesday, Diet sources said. The committee will hold its first  meeting after the two houses elect 10 members each, the sources  said.    Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who has staked his  political career on enacting the legislation before the current  Diet session ends Saturday, is planning to hold a press  conference to call for popular support for enactment of the  package, government sources said.    Hosokawa also hopes to hold a top meeting with LDP president  Yohei Kono to break the deadlock, the sources said. The  Hosokawa government displaced the LDP from power last August for  the first time in nearly 40 years, pledging to clean up Japan's  scandal-tainted political system.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata hinted at the possibility of  dissolution of the lower house for a snap election should the  government-proposed political reform bills be scrapped by the  Diet. But Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Health  and Welfare Minister Keigo Ouchi ruled out such a possibility.</p>

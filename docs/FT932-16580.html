			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / International Company News: Czech government seeks new partner for truck venture THE CZECH government plans to look for another foreign partner for the Avia truck company following last week's decision by Mercedes-Benz to abandon its planned Dollars 250m joint venture with the Prague-based small truckmaker. Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech trade and industry minister, said he wanted to resume negotiations with other potential partners, including Renault Vehicules Industriels, whose bid was rejected in favour of Mercedes 16 months ago. Under the agreement with Mercedes, the German motor company was to have taken an initial 31 per cent stake in the venture with Avia-Praha, and Liaz, a maker of heavy trucks based in Jablonec nad Nisou, in northern Bohemia. Avia was to hold an initial 49 per cent and Liaz 20 per cent in the venture. Mercedes planned to raise its stake later and to invest DM350m (Dollars 218m) over three years to develop and modernise production at the two plants. Avia's production of small trucks under contract from Renault was to be replaced by new models. The aim of the venture was to build up sales in eastern Europe, but the collapse of markets in the region had made the move less attractive, Mercedes said. Access to eastern Europe had also become more difficult because of the break-up of the former Czechoslovakia on January 1 this year. Mr Jaromir Jiricny, Liaz general director, said he was not surprised by Mercedes' decision and added that Liaz would continue to produce its own trucks. Managers at Avia said they would try to buy a majority share in the company, though the government's preferred option is to find a foreign partner. In 1991, Avia made a profit of Kcs25m (Dollars 860,000) on sales of Kcs2.5bn, while Liaz made Kcs128m profit on sales worth Kcs 3.9bn. Avia then employed 4,000 and Liaz 6,650 workers. Both companies need fresh capital and new technology to modernise old production lines and models.</p>

			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Setback at International Paper INTERNATIONAL Paper, the US forest products group, reported a 29.9 per cent downturn in underlying second-quarter earnings, reflecting slow growth in domestic markets and weak overseas economies. The company warned that weakness in European and export markets would probably continue in the second half. Net income for the three months to June 30 was Dollars 77m, or 62 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 3.5bn compared with earnings of Dollars 112m, or 92 cents, on sales of Dollars 3.4bn a year earlier. Interest costs were considerably higher in the 1993 period, and in the 1992 quarter International Paper had benefited from tax-related interest income and higher capitalised interest attributable to two important European projects. Stripping out income taxes, extraordinary items and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, International Paper earned Dollars 122m in the quarter against Dollars 174m a year earlier. For the first six months, net income was Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.14 a share, on sales of Dollars 6.9bn, against profits of Dollars 164m, or Dollars 1.36, on sales of Dollars 6.7bn in the same period of 1992. Packaging operations saw sales decline to Dollars 890m from Dollars 925m, but the company's other leading business segments posted improved sales. Mr John Georges, chairman and chief executive, said demand for printing papers had risen a few percentage points from last year. Increases in reprographic and coated groundwood papers had been made for the third quarter.</p>

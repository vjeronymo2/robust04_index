			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY LINES: NEW WAVES ON RODEO  </P> <P> Designer Ettore Sottsass, a founder of the Milan-based Memphis Group,  internationally acclaimed for its New Wave architecture and furniture designs,  has completed his first project in California, a striking new art gallery on  Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive.  </P> <P> The most distinctive feature of the Mayer-Schwarz gallery is its frontage. A  facade of black Marquina marble is punctured by a dramatic doorway made up of  irregular folds and jagged angles of multicolored terrazzo.  </P> <P> The doorway conveys a sense of mystery, as if giving entry to a hidden cave of  art in the midst of Beverly Hill's opulent Golden Triangle shopping district --  a cave Sottsass decribes as "a metaphysical place."

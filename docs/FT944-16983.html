			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Mark Thatcher a marginal middleman in Pounds 20bn deal: Political manoeuvres behind the sale of fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia It was US politicians rather than middlemen such as Mr Mark Thatcher who gave Britain its first foot in the door for the Pounds 20bn Al Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia. If the strong Jewish lobby had not persuaded Congress to veto the sale of US F-15 fighters to the kingdom Britain would probably never have had the chance to negotiate the deal. Once the veto had been applied Britain was in a very strong position to supply the Saudis with advanced fighter aircraft. The UK had a long-standing defence relationship with Saudi Arabia, stretching back to the supply and maintenance of 46 Lightning aircraft in the 1960s. Baroness Thatcher, visited the kingdom when prime minister and made a strong impact on King Fahd. Personal relationships between leaders are very important in the Gulf. The French, the other potential suppliers, had no such pull. So in 1984-85, with the Gulf war between Iran and Iraq raging near their northern border and concerns about the spread of Islamic fundamentalism growing, the Saudis were keen to improve their defences as quickly as possible. The way was open for the UK to strike a deal. The three main British negotiators for Al Yamamah were Sir Colin Chandler, then head of the government's defence export services organisation (DESO), previously a marketing chief of British Aerospace and now chief executive of Vickers; Mr Dick Evans, the marketing head of British Aerospace and now its chief executive; and Lady Thatcher herself. Lady Thatcher did not have particularly close links to the BAe executives, although all involved were obviously keen to secure the order. It was Lady Thatcher's link to King Fahd which was the motor for the deal. The British team used Mr Wafic Said, a London-based Saudi, as the go-between, and he brought Lady Thatcher's son Mark into the deal. If his intention was to make sure of his mother's support, he need hardly have bothered, as the prime minister was keen on the idea anyway. One official involved at the time said: 'Mark certainly tried to generate the impression that he had influence. He was putting himself around a lot. But in practice I think he didn't have much pull.' A former director of BAe said: 'Mrs Thatcher's intervention was crucial, but she came in at the request of BAe, not as a result of Mark Thatcher's efforts.' The outline Al Yamamah deal was concluded in September 1985, with the full contract signed the following year. It was a government-to-government deal, with BAe nominated as the company primarily responsible for the business. Commissions were paid to middlemen as a result of the deal. Mr Said insists he was not paid a commission, but an ex-BAe director said: 'Commissions would have been paid on the deal. I do not know if Mr Thatcher received money, but I wouldn't rule it out.' Saudi Arabia agreed to buy 72 Tornado aircraft, a mixture of the air defence fighters and ground attack bombers, and 60 Hawk advance trainers and PC9 basic training aircraft. A big package of training and support services was included in the deal - BAe has had about 4,500 personnel in Saudi Arabia working on the Al Yamamah deal ever since. Instead of cash, the Saudis paid in oil - initially set at 400,000 barrels a day, which soon increased to 500,000 as the oil price weakened. The oil was paid into a central fund in the UK, controlled by a Saudi Arabian project office at the ministry of defence. The oil was sold on the market at the project office's discretion, and BAe could draw on the funds as it met milestones in the project. Since the contract was started in 1986 it has brought in more than Pounds 2bn a year to BAe. Because the oil revenues were sometimes insufficient to meet the project costs the fund has twice been topped up with cash - once in 1992 to the tune of Pounds 1.5bn. In 1988 a second contract was negotiated for a further 48 Tornado aircraft and associated training aircraft, as well as a large new airbase at Al Sulayil, which was to cover an area the size of greater London. However, oil prices continued to be weak and the plan for the air base was eventually dropped. As a result of budgetary pressures the second deal was not signed until January 1993, just six months before the Tornado production line was due to close. It was initially for the 48 ground attack Tornado aircraft, with training aircraft to follow. To pay for the extra equipment the daily oil output was increased to 600,000 barrels. The second batch of Tornado aircraft is due to be delivered between 1996 and 1999, and some of the Hawk and PC9 training aircraft to go with them were ordered at the Farnborough Air Show last month. BAe remains confident that Britain will retain a strong defence link to Saudi Arabia. The company even hopes to sell the Saudis its newest Eurofighter in time. Al Yamamah III, however, is still a long way off.</p>

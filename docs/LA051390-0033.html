			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFLUENCING TV  </P> <P> Richard Mahler's "The New Power of TV Advertisers" (May 6) described the  growing influence that Christian Leaders for Responsible Television (CLeaR-TV)  is gaining with TV advertisers. This frightens me far more than any of the junk  on the air.  </P> <P> I strongly object to clergymen of a religion that is not my own trying to  dictate what I will be able to watch by pressuring TV advertisers not to  sponsor certain shows. I hope that both the broadcasters and the companies  mentioned in the article recognize that CLeaR-TV does not speak for all  Christians.  </P> <P> More important, I hope they realize that not all TV viewers and not all  customers for their products are Christians. Some of us are Jews, Muslims,  Sikhs, Buddhists or Bahais. I think even atheists watch TV and buy cars.  </P> <P> DAVID E. ROSS  </P> <P> Agoura  </P></p>

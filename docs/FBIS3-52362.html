A responsible source at the  Ministry of Justice has stated this to an IRAQI NEWS AGENCY  correspondent. The source added that the ministry made efforts  to improve the department's performance in the care of minors  eliminating unnecessary steps in the paperwork. This paperwork  is usually monitored by those guardians who oversee the minors.  The new procedures are meant to facilitate things for the  minors and to assist in processing their application forms as  quickly as possible, he noted.    The source added that this department implements the task of  caring for minors, preserving their rights and funds, and  investing their money in a way that achieves the best revenues.  He pointed out that the minors' balance totals 1.0003 billion  dinars. [passage omitted]</p>

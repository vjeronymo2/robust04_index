			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THORNBURGH TO 'NUDGE' SOVIET REFORMS;  </P> <P> SOVIET UNION: THE U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL INVITES THE KREMLIN TO 'PICK AND  CHOOSE' FROM THE AMERICAN LEGAL SYSTEM IN REVAMPING ITS OWN.  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, making the first visit to the Soviet Union by an  American attorney general in his official capacity, said Sunday that he views  his five-day mission as an "opportunity to give a gentle nudge" to the Soviet  leadership to maintain the "right direction" in restructuring their society.  </P> <P> Assessing Soviet perestroika (restructuring) as "a time of remarkable change  and fluidity," Thornburgh in an interview said its prospects for making  permanent change hinge largely on achieving what Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev calls a law-based society.  </P> <P> Seeking to help the Soviets in their effort to adopt the rule of law,  Thornburgh and a team of Justice Department officials are meeting with top  legal officials here, offering them the opportunity to "pick and choose" from  the U.S. system.  </P> <P> "This is our opportunity," he said, noting that the Soviets "have reached out.  </P> <P> "We're not going to be teaching or preaching -- merely sharing thoughts on our  system, their system, where we go from here," he said of the visit, which is  being made in response to an invitation from Soviet Justice Minister Veniamin  Yakovlev.  </P> <P> "They have a great interest in many elements of our system -- Article I of our  Constitution, the Bill of Rights, subsequent amendments, except perhaps  Prohibition, although they have some problems there," Thornburgh said. "It's a  model they have to examine, because all of these provisions address problems  with counterparts in the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> While he is the latest in a series of ranking U.S. officials to visit the  Soviet Union, as attorney general, Thornburgh faces significant crime problems  at home, chief among them carrying out the war on illicit drugs.  </P> <P> But Thornburgh contended that trying to help the Soviets "reform areas  previously off-limits" to any change is just as important as his domestic  mission. The changes "spell only good for the United States," he said. "A root  of a lot of our (U.S.-Soviet) tension has been our feeling about the oppressive  nature of the Soviet system, its aggressive foreign policy in the past,  resulting partly from a lack of accountability of its leadership to the  people."  </P> <P> "The change of direction (by the Soviet government) has to be all positive for  the United States, world peace and human rights," Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> While carrying a paperback copy of the Federalist Papers in his briefcase and  noting that the Soviet leadership "is obviously grappling with tensions in  their republics," Thornburgh said: "We don't necessarily suggest they adopt our  form of federal government. But there are certainly lessons to be learned."  </P> <P> He said that such U.S. legal guarantees as freedom of speech, due process of  law and the rights of criminal defendants add up to "an appropriate menu from  which wise Soviet leaders can borrow."  </P> <P> After meeting today with Yakovlev, Procurator General Alexander Y. Sukharev and  Minister of Internal Affairs Vadim V. Bakatin, the Americans and their Soviet  counterparts will turn to "nuts and bolts matters," Thornburgh said.  </P> <P> These include battling narcotics trafficking, organized crime and environmental  violations.  </P> <P> John C. Lawn, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will join the group  for the narcotics discussion.  </P> <P> In what some U.S. officials compare to the American surge of marijuana use  during the Vietnam War, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan seemed to have led  to the increased use of heroin, hashish and marijuana here.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union is not a narcotics transshipping country or a source of  illicit drugs consumed in the United States, but this should not prevent "us  from extending a helping hand" to Soviet efforts to counter drugs, Thornburgh  said. The DEA is already training some Soviet narcotics agents in the United  States.  </P> <P> Thornburgh also will be meeting with Soviet immigration officials, prospective  Soviet refugees to the United States and some Jewish-American group  representatives over the ticklish issue of emigration under the new Soviet  policy of allowing thousands to leave.  </P> <P> Thornburgh said he did not feel uneasy about meeting with top Soviet legal  officials even though he oversees the FBI and its counterintelligence  operations as the top U.S. law enforcement officer.  </P> <P> U. S. counterintelligence sources have said the Soviet Union has not lessened  its espionage activities in the United States, and Felix S. Bloch, a veteran  State Department official, is under intense scrutiny by the FBI, which suspects  him of turning government material over to a Soviet agent.  </P> <P> The trip marks Thornburgh's second official visit to the Soviet Union. In 1979,  he came as governor of Pennsylvania in a delegation of governors.  </P></p>

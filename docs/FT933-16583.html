			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc to divide shares in lead-up to float RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals company poised for privatisation by the new centre-right government, will this month divide its shares in a four-for-one split. The share split, scheduled for July 12, will apply to Rhone-Poulenc's preferred investment certificates as well as to its ordinary shares. The nominal value of the shares and certificates will be reduced from FFr100 to FFr25, with investors receiving four new shares for each one already held. Analysts have interpreted the share split as a means of improving the liquidity of Rhone-Poulenc's equity in the approach to privatisation. The company confirmed one of its motives was to make its stock more liquid, but said the main reason was to harmonise the price trading level of its ordinary shares in Paris and American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in New York. French companies have traditionally attached far higher nominal value to their shares than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts. Rhone-Poulenc, quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, gave its ADRs a nominal value of a quarter of its ordinary shares, to make them easier to trade in the US. The share split will ensure that both the ADRs and ordinary shares have the same nominal value. The group has made no secret of its hopes of being one of the first state-controlled companies to be sold in the privatisation drive. The Balladur government, now putting the finishing touches to its privatisation legislation, has identified 21 candidates for sale and plans to include between three and six in the first round of sales due in September. The share split should make Rhone-Poulenc's shares more marketable to international investors. Just over 37 per cent of the group's equity is in public issue, with the state owning 43.4 per cent directly and controlling the rest through public-sector institutions.</p>

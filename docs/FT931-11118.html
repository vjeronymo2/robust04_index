			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Warning on Scots water sell-off THE GOVERNMENT has been advised not to privatise the water industry in Scotland. The Commission for Local Authority Accounts says the industry's direction and regulation should stay in the hands of local authorities with the private sector becoming involved on a franchise basis. The commission, the equivalent of the Audit Commission in England and Wales, is an independent body appointed by the government that watches over local authorities. It was responding to the Scottish Office consultation paper on the Scottish water industry, run by the nine regional councils and three islands authorities. The paper says change is needed because of the planned reorganisation of local government and to pay for increased investment. The options include outright privatisation. The commission says that because water in Scotland is not seen as a 'commercial' commodity, a 'meaningful' partnership between the public and private sectors is more likely to command public support than privatisation. The private sector could be involved in capital construction projects and in day-to-day running of services. But local authorities should control and regulate the industry, keeping it under democratic control and sending out bills with the council tax.</p>

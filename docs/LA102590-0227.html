			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> GLENDALE-MUIR GAME FIGURES TO DECIDE TITLE  </P> <P> The game the Glendale High football team has been waiting for all season is  here.  </P> <P> The unbeaten Dynamiters (7-0, 2-0 in Pacific League play), ranked eighth in the  Southern Section Division II, will play ninth-ranked Muir (5-2, 2-0) Friday  night at Glendale in a game that should decide the league championship.  </P> <P> "They probably have five or six people that are Division I prospects," Glendale  Coach Don Shoemaker said of the Mustangs, who were Division II co-champions  last season. "We have maybe three at best. Person for person, they're a better  team than us. We're not fooling anybody.  </P> <P> "Turnovers are going to be the key. If they don't turn the ball over, we're  going to be in trouble."  </P> <P> Muir is led by quarterback Sedrick Thomas, who has passed for 1,015 yards and  eight touchdowns. Thomas also is the Mustangs' leading rusher with 416 yards  and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> The Mustangs, whose only losses were to powerful Fontana and Bishop Amat, also  feature running back Saladin McCullough, who has gained 302 yards in 45 carries  and scored eight touchdowns. Receiver Demetrice Martin has 11 receptions for  304 yards and five touchdowns.  </P> <P> Muir linebacker Damon Danecker has a team-high 66 tackles for a defensive unit  that also features defensive backs Reggie Reser and Hassan McCullough.  </P> <P> Glendale is led by running back Pathon Rucker, who has rushed for 1,183 yards  and scored 23 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Showdown part II: Bobby Webster continues to lead Glendale College toward a  Western State Conference Northern Division showdown with Moorpark in two weeks.  </P> <P> Glendale (4-2, 4-1 in WSC play) last week defeated winless Ventura (0-6, 0-5)  as Webster rushed for 196 yards and scored three touchdowns.  </P> <P> Glendale will play Compton (0-6, 0-5) this weekend, then at L.A. Harbor (4-2,  3-2) on Nov. 3 before playing host to Moorpark (5-1, 4-1) on Nov. 10.  </P> <P> Glendale Coach John Cicuto hopes to diversify the offense this week in  preparation for Moorpark.  </P> <P> "Our run game has been successful but we have to be able to throw the ball,"  Cicuto said. "A good team like Moorpark will load up on the run."  </P> <P> Alive and kicking: The Occidental College women's soccer team (5-2-2) entered  the week atop the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference  standings.  </P> <P> The Tigers have been led by senior forward Jos Bergmann, who had four goals in  a 7-0 victory over Redlands and four more in a 7-0 win over La Verne in matches  played last week.  </P> <P> Bergmann has 25 goals and seven assists for the Tigers, who conclude their  SCIAC schedule Saturday at Whittier.  </P> <P> Trophy dash: The Occidental College and Glendale College cross-country teams  are both preparing for their respective conference championship meets.  </P> <P> Occidental will race in the SCIAC meet at Bonelli Park in San Dimas on Saturday  and Glendale will run in the WSC finals at Moorpark College on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Glendale, the WSC champion two of the past three seasons, won both WSC meets.  The team champion will be determined by combining the results of the finals,  which count double, and the two conference meets.  </P> <P> Back to the bench: After a two-game run as the Detroit Lions' starting  quarterback, former Hoover High and Glendale College standout Bob Gagliano will  return to his accustomed role as a reserve.  </P> <P> Rodney Peete, who missed the Lions' last two games with a hamstring pull, has  reclaimed his starting job from Gagliano, who is in his eighth season.  </P> <P> Gagliano passed for 229 yards and two touchdowns in a 34-27 win over Minnesota  on Oct. 7, but completed just eight of 17 passes for 156 yards and a touchdown  in a 43-24 loss to Kansas City Oct. 14.  </P> <P> Staff writers Kirby Lee and Steven Herbert contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

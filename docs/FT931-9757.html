			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Net income at CBS up 254% in final period CBS, which owns one of the three US television networks, has reported a 254 per cent surge in fourth-quarter net income, reflecting the network's rise to the top of the prime-time television ratings and a better advertising environment. The group posted fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 33.3m, or Dollars 2.14 a share, against Dollars 9.4m, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 3 per cent to Dollars 968.3m, from Dollars 937.4m. For the whole of 1992, CBS earned Dollars 81m, or Dollars 5.23, compared with a loss of Dollars 85.8m, or Dollars 5.32 in 1991. Income from continuing operations stood at Dollars 162.5m, or Dollars 10.51, against a deficit of Dollars 98.7m, or Dollars 6.11 a year ago. Sales rose 15 per cent in the year to Dollars 2.5bn from Dollars 3.04bn. Mr Laurence Tisch, group chairman and chief executive, said the television network returned to a modest level of profitability in 1992, helped by improved results in entertainment, news and sports programming. He said the company was also 'applying our resources in wiser, more cost-effective ways.' The strong growth in the network's prime-time ratings, which Mr Tisch said was the biggest single-season gain by any network since 1976-77 allowed the group to increase advertisement unit pricing and lifted revenues. 'We presently believe that CBS's 1993 operating earnings may surpass 1992's level as a result of further gains in earnings at the television network,' he said.</p>

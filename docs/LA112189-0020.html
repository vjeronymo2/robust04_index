			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RIVERSIDE;  </P> <P> FOES OF ABORTION DRAW THOUSANDS  </P> <P> Tony Melendez, a man born without arms who touched Pope John Paul II in 1987 by  singing and playing the guitar with his toes, joined a weekend anti-abortion  march in Riverside attended by thousands. "Life is so precious. Because of a  drug, I was denied arms, but I still feel in my heart that my mother would have  had me even if she had known," Melendez said. Melendez, 27, of Chino, was a  thalidomide baby. He joined an estimated 6,000 people who lined the streets  near a mall in a protest organized by the Inland Empire Pro-Life Coalition. A  smaller group of pro-choice advocates waved banners nearby.  </P></p>

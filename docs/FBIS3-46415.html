The source stated that during his stay in Shanghai, Deng will  start working out plans to reshuffle top military personnel.  The military leadership reshuffle was originally expected to  take place in mid- December, but it has now become most likely  that the reshuffle will take place after next February.    Every year, Deng spends the season of the year's end and the  new year as well as the Lunar New Year (which falls on 10  February) in Shanghai partly for the purpose of passing the  winter. Citing as the basis for his observation that Deng has  arrived in Shanghai, the same source points out that the Xijiao  Guesthouse where Deng usually stays and its neighboring area  have been put under stricter guard than usual.    Moreover, an informed source in Hong Kong states that  "Deng's  movements have become slower than before" but that "there are no  problems with his health because his thinking is clear and he  has a nimble mind." At the same time, the same source points  out that because senior military leaders are accompanying him on  his current visit to Shanghai, it can be expected that plans for  the military leadership reshuffle are being worked out now.</p>

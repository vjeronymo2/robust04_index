			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Letter: Voter dilemma Sir, A small clarification to Joe Rogaly's very perceptive piece on the LSE symposium on hung parliaments ('King Kong antics', March 6). The joint organisers of the event, Common Voice, advocate informed voting in the sense that voters are surely entitled to information on the parties' standings in their constituency. Whether voters choose to vote tactically is between them and the ballot box, and not something on which Common Voice gives advice. There is an interesting problem for any informed voter warming to Mr Rogaly's suggestion that a hung parliament could produce the conditions for the ending of single-party government: how to vote for a hung parliament. Gareth Smyth, Common Voice, Garden Studio, 11-15 Betterton Street, London WC2H 9BP.</p>

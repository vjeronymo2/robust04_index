			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean  National Council of Representatives of Trade Unions (Chonnodae)  at a press conference on June 8 declared that should railway  workers go on strike, all the workers affiliated with it would  take joint action, according to a radio report from Seoul.    It also said it will take joint action in all work places of  its affiliates all at once if its demand, such as the withdrawal  of the proposed wage hike this year which was set by the  "government"-subsidized "federation of trade unions," bowing to  the authorities, and the reinstatement of dismissed workers, is  not met.</p>

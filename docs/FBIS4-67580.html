			<p>BFN     [Text] The building of the first waste processing  facilites--dealing with the treatment of solid household and  industrial nontoxic waste--was begun in the village of Barba,  Vetkovskiy Rayon, Gomel Oblast. Construction is to be completed  by late (1994). Then, this processing complex will begin  treating the waste from Gomel enterprises. The cost of  construction is covered by some 100 Gomel enterprises with which  the Gomel Executive Commission signed agreements on sharing  expenditures for this project. Gomel authorities had to make  this decision when Dorofeeva, chairman of the State Committee  for Ecology, and the Belarusian Government refused to earmark  financial assistance to them. According to Alyaksandr Titov,  chairman of the Gomel Office for Ecology and Radiological  Security, he does not understand why the State Committee for  Ecology does not use this unique occasion to work out the  technology of construction and operation of this complex to  eventually free the city from dumping grounds.</p>

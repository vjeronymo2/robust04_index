			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SALVAGE CREWS BEGIN RAISING PRINCESS LOUISE  </P> <P> Salvage crews on Tuesday began the slow, delicate task of raising the 2,400-  ton Princess Louise on Tuesday, nearly seven months after the former cruise  ship and restaurant mysteriously capsized at a San Pedro shipyard.  </P> <P> The salvage effort, which is expected to be completed today, will allow the  330-foot vessel to be towed later this week to waters off the Palos Verdes  Peninsula, where it will be sunk for use as an artificial reef for marine life  and divers.  </P> <P> Once a fixture in the Los Angeles port, the Princess Louise capsized on Oct. 30  as it was being prepared for sale at Southwest Marine of San Pedro.  </P> <P> The salvage effort began two months ago, delayed by insurance claims and a  continuing dispute over the cause of the accident.  </P></p>

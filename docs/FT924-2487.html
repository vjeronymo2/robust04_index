			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Freedom urged for central banks PROGRESS towards European monetary union will be slowed if all 12 central banks are not freed from political ties as soon as possible, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said yesterday. Any further delay will also cast into doubt some governments' declared ambitions for Emu, he said in a speech in Bangkok. He reminded those governments still to cede full control to their state banks, including the British and French, that independence had been promised for the future European central bank. However, he suggested, such an institution needed time to develop the necessary reputation and credibility. 'It is desirable for all national central banks to be given full monetary policy autonomy as soon as possible, and not merely immediately before the transition to the third stage (of Emu, in 1999) when the establishment of the European Central Bank will also have been completed,' he said. Mr Schlesinger, who has recently sharpened his criticism of key elements in the Emu project and weaknesses in its structure, also reviewed his long-standing doubts about the timetable. It was an open question, he said, if more than half the EC members - the necessary quota - would be able to meet the convergence criteria in time for stage two of Emu, due in 1997. At present only two or three countries met the requirements, and 'Germany cannot be counted among them', although 'Germany and some other countries may well be prepared' by 1996. He also showed his unhappiness about obligatory interventions in foreign exchange markets laid down in the rules governing of the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Schlesinger, who recently described the intervention mechanism as an incentive to speculators, added yesterday that it impinged on central banks' independence. 'If the rules of such a system are applied appropriately, undue tensions need not occur. 'Exchange rate adjustments through realignments must be effected in good time and noiselessly,' he said. He blamed recent turbulence, which resulted in the withdrawal of sterling and the lira from the ERM, on the widely held belief 'that we were living in a de facto European monetary union. . . which was not and is not yet the case'.</p>

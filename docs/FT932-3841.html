			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (2): Structural defects in an ailing economy - Apartheid, sanctions, disinvestment, political uncertainty and violence have taken their toll SOUTH AFRICANS have to believe that post-apartheid economic performance will break the post-independence African mould. For many such a belief has to be a triumph of faith over experience and possibly even logic, especially since for the past 20 years, the South African economy itself has performed no better than many in sub-Saharan Africa. By the end of this year, per capita incomes, at 1985 prices, will have slipped below R3,100 to their lowest point since 1970. The South Africa economy is certainly not 'in ruins' as suggested in 1991 by Nelson Mandela, but then neither is it in anything remotely resembling peak condition. Apartheid, sanctions, disinvestment, political uncertainty, violence and mass action have taken their toll on the economy and continue to do so. The skills haemorrhage is resuming on a debilitating scale to be followed, no doubt, by an exodus of experience from the public sector as affirmative action takes off. Structural defects are highlighted in the recently-published Normative Economic Model (NEM) - the work of Pretoria officialdom. A decade of stagnation is blamed on double-digit inflation since the early 1970s, declining investment volumes and efficiency, increased government consumption spending - up to 18 per cent of GDP during the 1985-91 period from 12 per cent in the 1960s - and the juxtaposition of rising real wages and falling formal sector employment. Growth potential has slowed dramatically from an average of 5.5 per cent between 1961 and 1978 to 1.3 per cent in recent years. In narrow macroeconomic terms, this is the result of a decline in net investment to less than 4 per cent of GDP since 1985, falling below 1 per cent last year, while the capital output ratio has widened from 2.1 in the 1960s to 3.0, meaning that more investment rands are needed to increase output. A crucial structural defect, too, is the high level of capital intensity. According to the NEM, a prime goal of a labour-surplus country should be the promotion of labour-intensive techniques, but South Africa has been heading in the opposite direction. Since 1961, the capital-to-labour ratio has virtually doubled with the result that even were the economy to grow at 4.5 per cent annually for the rest of the decade, unemployment would continue to rise. Not everyone agrees with this analysis. Not only does it assume that future relationships between investment and employment will replicate the past - a generic weakness of such models - but it is guilty of what Mr Edward Osborn, chief economist of Nedbank, calls 'a fallacy of aggregation'. The NEM has several explanations for the rise in capital-intensity, including large capital-intensive projects carried out by the state which has left the country with surplus capacity in energy and transport, negative real interest rates which encouraged capital-intensive investments, existing consumption patterns and, of course, relatively high labour costs. Nedbank is more circumspect, pointing out that the growth in capital intensity in manufacturing is traceable to heavy investment in the steel, synthetic fuels and pulp and paper sectors. Whoever is right, the prospects for a reversal of this trend - fundamental to the NEM's aim of employment-generating economic growth - are belied by recent significant investment decisions. The principal commodity-based investment projects now being developed - the Alusaf aluminium smelter, the Oryx and Moab gold mines, the Namakwa Sands mining project, and the Columbus stainless steel complex - are all capital-intensive. This is not to criticise the model's appropriate focus on employment creation. As a supplyside model, the NEM concentrates on fostering a policy environment conducive to export-led, labour-intensive industrial growth. It says little about the demand side of the equation which, if the Alusaf and Columbus projects are any guide, points in the direction of continuing capital intensity. Similarly, the country's existing export portfolio reflects an essentially resource-based pattern of industrialisation with direct mining and agricultural exports accounting for more than 70 per cent of the total, and processed primary products for a further 5 per cent. The balance is dominated by iron and steel products (10 per cent) and chemicals (3.5 per cent). This leaves a little over 10 per cent for manufactured exports - dominated by textiles, machinery and equipment. Even that could well be an overstatement when account is taken of re-exports to the sub-continent. Private sector economists argue that in terms of productivity, labour costs and the cost of capital, South Africa is simply not a world class player in manufacturing. Officials say this is changing, predicting 5 per cent inflation in 1995/6 compared with a forecast 11 per cent this year, and arguing that the NEM's prescriptions of increased market competition and the phasing down of tariff protection and exchange controls will boost international competitiveness. In part, this optimism is based on the moderation in wage demands and awards that has followed four years of recession, and on the restructuring that has already taken place in gold mining where more than 120,000 jobs have been shed and in the state-owned railway system, Transnet, which has halved its workforce to 135,000 from 289,000 in 1982. If narrow economic considerations were all that mattered, such optimism might well be justified. But engineering a sustainable fall in inflation and a significant shift of resources from consumption to investment at a time of wrenching political change, when the majority of the population is expecting a 'liberation dividend' and when the underlying fiscal situation is far from healthy, will be exceptionally difficult. The signs are that the governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Dr Chris Stals, the architect of monetary restraint, will be reappointed, thereby ensuring that monetary discipline is retained. But the planned halving by 1997 of the public sector deficit, from a forecast 6.8 per cent of GDP this year will be extremely difficult to achieve. Even before the transfer of power to a more 'people-oriented' administration, the Reserve Bank says the level of government spending is 'exceptionally high', reaching 31.4 per cent of GDP last year. There will be savings as the apartheid-driven duplication of public services is eradicated, but a significant peace dividend is unlikely given the proposed integration of the ANC's military wing into the armed forces. Spending on job creation, social upliftment and poverty reduction will put an enormous burden on the public purse along with the expansion of public sector employment, the cost of reintegrating the 6.5mpeople from the TBVC (homeland) states, and terminal benefits for many whites in the public sector and the security forces who will want to embark on fresh careers within and outside South Africa. Although South Africa is substantially underborrowed externally, domestically it is teetering on the brink of a debt trap. Interest payments which accounted for a mere 3.9 per cent of the national budget in 1976 will absorb 17.4 per cent this year. Unless government spending  - and the deficit - are tackled decisively, the public debt, currently 53 per cent of GDP, will escalate pushing the country ever deeper into a debt trap where increased borrowing will be needed to finance interest payments. African experience in structural adjustment is less than reassuring. Governments have been unwilling, or unable, to impose fiscal discipline. Why should South Africa be any different ? Possibly because it has excess infrastructural capacity, the strongest private sector and financial infrastructure in the continent, a strong skills base - by African standards - and the advantage of having travelled some distance down the learning curve before having to make hard economic choices. The ANC has moved a long way towards the centre largely dropping nationalisation from its policy agenda, softening its antipathy towards foreign investment and backing away from many of its interventionist ideas. There is a high degree of convergence in economic thinking with economists from the ANC and the labour unions reluctantly accepting that they will not be able to create a brave new world in a matter of a few years, and that wage restraint and fiscal and monetary discipline must remain at the head of the policy agenda for the foreseeable future. One businessman, who works alongside the ANC/Cosatu alliance in the tripartite National Economic Forum, representing business, government and the unions, is confident that the ANC will be 'ruthlessly pragmatic' in economic policy-making. This may well be the present game plan, but it assumes not only that the ANC will abandon much of the ideological baggage accumulated during its years in the political wilderness, but also that its constituencies  - the unions, the students, the peasants and the unemployed - will be willing to forgo butter tomorrow in anticipation of butter and jam in five years' time. The optimists argue that it need not come to this; that the recent surge in the gold price and the forecast world economic recovery will provide a window of opportunity taking the pressure off the balance of payments, the budget deficit and monetary policy. The upbeat scenario has a final agreement on the debt standstill in place before the end of this year, resumed access to IMF and World Bank funding during 1994, the rationalisation of tariffs and partial liberalisation of exchange controls, including abolition of the financial rand, and a significant rand devaluation to boost industrial exports. On this scenario, the four-year-long recession bottoms out in the latter half of 1993, and the economy rebounds on to a 4 per cent growth path from next year. Once devaluation is digested, inflation stabilises at 8 per cent to 10 per cent, and foreign investment resumes in the mid-90s when the international business community is satisfied that the mould really has been broken. For this upbeat scenario to materialise, a formidable array of conditions must be satisfied, most crucially the next government being sufficiently strong-willed to tread the finest of lines between satisfying its disparate constituencies and rebuilding business and investor confidence at home and abroad. A tall order for any administration, and especially one with a built-in mistrust of big business and a naive confidence in the ability of macro-economic policies to restructure an essentially third-world, commodity-dependent economy.  ----------------------------------------- GNP per capita  ----------------------------------------- Year         Rand*  ----------------------------------------- 1960        2,485 1970        3,078 1974        3,894 1980        3,981 1985        3,533 1990        3,345 1991        3,286 1992        3,103 1993**      3,060  ----------------------------------------- * 1985 constant prices; ** Forecast  ----------------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank and FT forecast  -----------------------------------------  -------------------------------------- Investment  -------------------------------------- Year              %  -------------------------------------- 1978           26.2 1980           26.2 1982           27.9 1984           24.4 1986           20.2 1988           19.1 1989           20.8 1990*          20.0 1991           18.0 1992           15.9  -------------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank  --------------------------------------  ----------------------------------- Inflation  ----------------------------------- Year            %  ----------------------------------- 1986         18.5 1987         16.2 1988         12.9 1989         14.7 1990         14.4 1991         15.3 1992         13.9 1993*        11.3  ----------------------------------- * Forecast  ----------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank and FT forecast  -----------------------------------  ----------------------------------- Gross domestic product  ----------------------------------- Year         Growth rates %  ----------------------------------- 1984             5.1 1985            -1.2 1986             0.0 1987             2.1 1988             4.2 1989             2.3 1990            -0.5 1991            -0.4 1992            -2.1 1993*            0.0  ----------------------------------- * Forecast  ----------------------------------- Source: South African Reserve Bank  -----------------------------------</p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Survey of The Principality of Liechtenstein (2): Active ruler joins the fray / Interview of Prince Hans-Adam II These are testing times for His Serene Highness Hans-Adam II, reigning prince of Liechtenstein since 1989 and the last monarch in Europe with any real power. The prince triggered a constitutional crisis two years ago by a rare exercise of that power, threatening to dissolve parliament if it did not endorse his demand that a referendum on joining the European Economic Area (EEA) be held in advance of one in Switzerland on the same issue. In the end, a compromise was worked out, with the prince withdrawing his threat and the government agreeing to promote the EEA cause in the referendum campaign. While the constitution clearly states that the reigning prince has responsibility for foreign affairs, Prince Hans-Adam was really making a more general point. His father, Prince Franz Josef II, who led the formerly poor agricultural principality to undreamed of prosperity in the post war period, had gradually implicitly ceded some princely powers to the parliament and government. The new prince wanted to claw back some of them, making clear in a famous statement during the constitutional crisis that he wanted to be an active monarch. 'If they want someone who will just do representational work, they must look for someone else,' he said. Today, the 49 year old Hans-Adam remains pleased with the outcome of the crisis. Not only did a majority of Liechtensteiners endorse his recommendation to join the EEA, but popular sentiment in favour of an active monarchy was confirmed. 'There is no majority for a figurehead,' he said in an interview in his palace office above Vaduz, a view fully endorsed in interviews with several other Liechtensteiners. However, neither the EEA nor the constitutional issue is yet definitively resolved. Three months ago, the prince made a series of constitutional amendment proposals, mainly to adjust the division of powers and to incorporate a formula enabling the people to oust a disliked prince. The proposals aroused considerable controversy. 'We are still discussing them,' the prince said with a smile. 'But we all agree that we should not push for a solution before we have resolved the EEA question.' Liechtenstein's entry into the EEA has been delayed by the need to work out a system for preserving its customs union with Switzerland, which decided not to join. The prince said arrangements had been agreed among officials and documents were 'ready for signing'. The government has agreed to hold another referendum on the final terms, giving the people another opportunity to endorse or reject entry. The prince said he was 'fairly confident' that the result would be positive again. He believes fervently that the principality's future security and independence depend on closer ties with the rest of Europe. 'If we can progress in this way, with the economy integrated with the EEA, we will be in a much better position than in the past. It also has economic implications - in terms of the inflow of money and exports of industrial goods.' On the other hand, he does not want Liechtenstein to join the European Union. 'The main problem is that we are too small. We would have to open our borders to people and we would have an inflow of thousands of rich people. We could only control it by raising income tax, and our people would not accept that.' He also acknowledges that the principality's main international relationship for the foreseeable future will remain with Switzerland, even if Switzerland remains outside the EEA and EU. The prince is known as a deeply conservative and devout Catholic and his constitutional initiatives might suggest that he was a diehard traditionalist. But he has also worked vigorously in recent years to update the ancient princely family code (Hausgesetz). 'My father thought we should adapt it to the modern world. He started working on it in the 1960s, and I finally got the family's agreement on it last year.' The new code sets out clear criteria for defining who are family members - there are now nearly 120 - and prevents them from exploiting the name for commercial gain. Offenders can have their titles removed. The code also provides for a process for the family to remove a reigning prince if he is not behaving responsibly. Only the nearly 50 males over 18 are allowed to vote. Hans-Adam regrets that his attempt to give women the vote was rejected. He has also been trying to recover the family's immense property holdings in what is now the Czech republic. In all, the family claims 1,600 square kilometres of mostly forested land there, about 10 times the area of the principality itself. After the second world war, Czechoslovakia classified Liechtenstein with Germany as a country from which no demands for recovery of confiscated assets would be accepted even though the principality was neutral during the war. The Czech republic has signed treaties that oblige it to treat Liechtenstein as it treats other countries. But it fears that if it gave way to Liechtenstein, it would also have huge claims from former Sudeten Germans. 'We understand that it is a touchy problem for them,' the prince says. 'There is not much we can do.' Talk has begun in Liechtenstein about the prince's possible retirement. This has become something of a tradition in the family. 'My father retired, and his predecessor too. I will try to turn over the job at the appropriate date. My eldest son is 26. He still has some training to do.'</p>

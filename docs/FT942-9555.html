			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / As They Say in Europe: Stand by your man - in Versace Fashion editors and writers have failed to tackle a significant problem again exercising the minds of well-born ladies across southern Europe. What does she wear on that first, all-important visit to the prison where her husband or lover is held on a charge of corruption or embezzlement? The rules, which had been dictated by Milan's elite San Vittore jail, are under attack from Madrid's Alcala-Meco prison. The Italians turn up in a combination of bella figura and haute couture. But politics plays a role: if your man is a leading socialist you wear Versace, for he is designer to those who formed the once sturdy backbone of Italian socialism: millionaires, media stars and intellectual glitterati. It is Krizia for Communists while Christian Democrats prefer Armani. Spanish scandals have shown that the rules are not as strict as I had assumed. The wives of the former governor of the central bank, Mariano Rubio, and his investment broker, Manuel de la Concha, last weekend made their first visit to Alcala-Meco. For the occasion they wore T-shirts and jeans in one case and a sober little suit in the other. Elisa Rodriguez Lopez, described as the former girlfriend or fiancee of the fleeing ex-boss of the Guardia Civil, Luis Roldan, even though she is married to someone else, chose an interesting anti-paparazzi combination for her appearance before the parliamentary commission investigating the matter. A huge Kelly bag, a crumpled power suit and an Hermes scarf held over her dark glasses. I imagine there is a good deal of telephoning prior to the decisions that are made in such cases. It seems the need to present a defiant image looms large in such cases. My inquiries among French female colleagues elicited the information that something 'fabuleux' for any such occasion would be the correct choice in France - 'St Laurent or Dior, but not Lacroix'. In England, however, it would be well-cut tweeds and a loose cashmere sweater. But enough of this semiotic speculation - we must return to the question of the comparative reaction of Italians and Spaniards to their corruption scandals. The fashion test indicates that the Spanish are individualistic, an impression confirmed by further study. This may be because Italy's blanket approach, kicking out everybody remotely associated with the authorities, is not working well. The new government there will probably turn out to be little better than the old, and, as this week's cabinet list showed, it contains nastier elements than anything thrown up by the old crowd. As the last prime minister, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, pointed out in an interview in la Repubblica, the process of forming a government under Silvio Berlusconi in no way departs from the standards of the long decades of the corrupt ancien regime. Ciampi himself, as a non-politician, had formed a government in a matter of hours and produced what was thought to be the best administration Italy has enjoyed for some time. But that went by the board and tradition has reasserted itself. In Spain, lessons have been learnt, but maybe not by the conservative opposition. The Madrid ABC wants to chase everybody out. It was, however, nice of it to recall a remark of the socialist prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, of two years ago: 'We don't have a problem of corruption that's any worse than that of neighbouring countries. What we have is a problem of public opinion because of the decision of some people to turn this topic into a weapon and an instrument of propaganda.' The paper then argued Gonzalez was corrupt because of the way in which Rubio and De la Concha had been treated - thrown into prison 'in defiance of elementary rights'. El Pais is more friendly to the government and rejected an Italian solution. In a Jesuitical sermon, it argued that many responses to the present 'crisis of confidence' were possible. But it was no use just getting rid of the socialists. 'The socialist Titanic is sinking, but its captain must not abandon ship until the whole voyage, and its crew, have been redeemed: only then can he resign or sack others, now he is hanging on until history absolves him.' In Italy it never crossed anyone's minds to think in terms of absolution or redemption. But there are areas in which tales of corruption among Iberian folk do follow the rules set by others. Those governing the lifestyle of men fleeing justice, and their lady friends, remain remarkably unchanged. The magazine Interviu last Monday carried a traditional picture of the fugitive Luis Roldan on an anonymous beach 'in underpants, accompanied by half-naked women'. One of the compensations of associating with men on the run, rather than those inside, has always been that neither they nor you have to worry about what to wear.

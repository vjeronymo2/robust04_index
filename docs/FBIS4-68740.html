			<p>Legislation   Blamed   <F P=102> 944E0802A Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA in Russian 5 May 94 p 4 </F> <F P=103> 944E0802A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladislav Kuzmichev: "Stock Exchange Operators: </F> Small Investors Will Be Robbed; Chubays Will Fight on Two  Fronts"]    [Text]  <H5>  Privatization </H5>   Immediately after the discussion in parliament on the  activity of Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for Management  of State Property], during which the deputies did not succeed in  working out a common approach to privatization in its current  form, representatives of Russian business circles condemned, in  their turn, the activity of the GKI [State Property Committee]  on the capital market.    At a news conference on 27 April, Director of the Union of  Stock Exchanges Bykov, president of the RFB [Russian Stock  Exchange] Suvorov, Cochairman of the Union of Stock Exchanges  Deryabin, and President of the MTB [Moscow Commodities Exchange]  Milyukov gave journalists a letter from the Union of Stock  Exchanges to President of Russia Boris Yeltsin.    It talks, in particular, about the critical situation that  has developed in the stock market, which "is threatening to grow  into a full wave of scandals and exposures, as a result of which  the Russian people will end up deceived and robbed.    "All of this is occurring first and foremost, because of a  lack of legislation guaranteeing order in the stock market and  protecting small investors. In addition, criminality is  continuously growing in the stock market."    The Commission for Securities and Stock Exchanges and  Goskomimushchestvo, which is behind it, are attempting to take  the stock market into nonexchange operations and then into cash  operations. This will make it possible, in the opinion of the  president of the RFB, to work directly on the laundering of  criminal money. Depriving the stock market of "clarity,"  reliability of information, and publicity will intensify the  chaos that reigns in the market.    The union is calling for order to be brought to bear on the  stock market, to protect the population from the stream of false  advertising and "open deception by unscrupulous joint-stock  companies, and also to create economic conditions for attracting  investment in the economy."    As is known, not much time is left until the end of voucher  privatization. Left without work, Goskomimushchestvo is  attempting to establish a network of new, so-called  "self-regulating organizations," but under the control of the  GKI so that, even at the end of voucher privatization it may  take control of the stock market and, evidently, the investment  market as well.    As the president of the MTB declared, a restoration of state  forces has occurred, which it is now assumed will be directed at  "curtailing private activity." The establishment of control, in  Milyukov's opinion, also threatens the banking system as well.    He proposed the establishment of an opposition to the  Central  Bank of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Finance, and  Goskomimushchestvo, by uniting the efforts of dealers.    "It was not property that Goskomimushchestvo distributed,  but  title," said the MTB president. New stockholders have  practically no influence on the old management. At many  enterprises, despite privatization, the former leadership  remains, and it is incapable of acting under the new conditions.  The GKI is attempting to resolve the problem of the director  corps not with economic principles but with regulation of their  activities. Thus, a concealed transition back to the  command-administrative system is being carried out.    In addition, the main error in the GKI's proposed formation  of a securities market, in the opinion of attendees at the news  conference, is its organization according to the regional  principle. The most promising, as I.V. Suvorov declared, is the  branch principle, inasmuch as enterprises have maintained mainly  only horizontal ties.    "For the benefit of its own political aims, the GKI is  ignoring the organized financial and intellectual potential of a  structure that is already operating on the stock market."  Nevertheless, it is exactly the stock exchanges, with their  openness, that are the superior indicators of the reliability of  one or another security.    "Despite the fact that one and a half years ago, in  accordance with an edict of the president of the Russian  Federation, a Commission on Securities and Stock Exchanges was  established that was entrusted with the functions of regulating  the stock market, this commission was practically idle for the  entire period of its activity. The clause of the president's  edict on including representatives of the stock exchanges on the  staff of the commission has not been implemented to this day."    In connection with what was enumerated above, the Union of  Stock Exchanges submitted a request to the president of the  Russian Federation for a meeting, with the participation of  representatives of the exchanges themselves, and also the  Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of the Economy, and the  Central Bank. The purpose of the meeting--to set forth a program  of immediate actions that would facilitate the prevention of  "the danger that is threatening to turn into serious social  shocks, and to direct the activity of the Committee on  Securities and Stock Exchanges to the creation of favorable  economic conditions for attracting investments in Russia's  industry."    Henceforth, the GKI will fight on two fronts with yet  another  serious opponent who is characterized by a far clearer  formulation of business interests and organizations than the  deputies of the State Duma.</p>

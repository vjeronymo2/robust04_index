			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Business and the Law: Competition on back burner - The UK cannot afford further delays to reforms Long-awaited reform of the UK's competition laws is looking increasingly unlikely during the next parliamentary session. The Department of Trade and Industry, which would shepherd such a bill through Parliament, seems to have its hands full with the prime minister's much vaunted deregulation bill to cut red tape, the privatisation of British Coal and reform of trademarks law. Yet the case for reform of the restrictive trade practices legislation appears to be stronger now than when first promised by the government in 1987. The European Commission is calling on national courts to take over the handling of routine competition cases - a move that would require the convergence of competition rules within Europe as a whole. A timely reminder of the need for change was given to the UK government last week, when the Institute of Economic Affairs published a series of lectures given last year at the London Business School on the most important issues in regulation, and in particular by the lecture by Sir Gordon Borrie, former director-general of fair trading. Sir Gordon's starting point was that UK competition law remains unnecessarily complex. There are four basic statutes: the 1971 Fair Trading Act, the 1976 Restrictive Trade Practices Act, the 1976 Resale Prices Act and the 1980 Competition Act, handling mergers, anti-competitive practices and other forms of monopolistic behaviour, cartels and resale price maintenance. Each of these is dealt with by different procedures involving a combination of four authorities: the director-general of fair trading, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the trade and industry secretary and the Restrictive Practices Court. Only resale price maintenance is automatically prohibited (except in relation to books and pharmaceuticals). Everything else is subject to case-by-case examination, and an anti-competitive practice or situation can only be prohibited or modified if, following investigation, it is found to be against the 'public interest'. This 'nebulous concept', Sir Gordon said, set the UK's competition laws apart from those of most other countries, including those of the European Community. To add to the complex mosaic faced by UK industry, EC competition law - article 85 of the Rome treaty dealing with anti-competitive agreements and article 86 dealing with abuse of market power - is directly applicable in the UK when inter-state trade is affected. Growing levels of international trade and the globalisation of markets mean EC law has an increasing impact in the UK. It also points to the need not only for closer co-operation between competition authorities, but, more importantly, to the need for convergence in national laws and enforcement policies. Sir Gordon argued that the most obvious and urgent need for reform was in the restrictive trade practices legislation. An effective means of controlling price-fixing cartels and market-sharing agreements, bid rigging and collusive tendering was essential, he said, adding: 'Frankly, the restrictive trade practices act is not up to the task.' The defects in the legislation are well known. The act requires parties to any agreement in which two or more of them accept restrictions on their commercial freedom, to provide details of the agreement to the Office of Fair Trading for registration. If they do not, the agreement will be unlawful. But this registration requirement catches a large number of agreements that have no significant effect on competition. The second weakness is that the OFT has inadequate investigatory powers. When the OFT suspects an unregistered agreement is in operation, all it can do is issue a notice requiring details of any registrable agreements. It has virtually no means of proceeding in the face of denials, even where it continues to have strong suspicions. The third defect is that the legislation lacks deterrent effect. There are no financial penalties for failure to comply with the registration requirement. Companies operating anti-competitive agreements do face unlimited fines for contempt of court if they break an order of the Restrictive Practices Court, but in practice fines for contempt in cartel cases have been modest. Having promised reform of the law in its election manifesto six years ago, the government produced a white paper in July 1989 outlining a change in the law. Anti-competitive agreements and concerted practices would be automatically prohibited unless they met specific criteria for an exemption, with heavy fines of up to 10 per cent of turnover for wilful or flagrant breach of the law. The OFT would be given tough new investigatory powers, including the right to enter premises and search for evidence of a suspected agreement. The proposals met with widespread approval - even from industry, which saw advantages in the closer alignment of EC and UK law. But the white paper dealt with only half the problem. As Sir Gordon pointed out, if the OFT was to be given new powers to investigate and tackle restrictive trade agreements, it seemed odd to retain the existing laws and procedures for dealing with abuse by individual companies of their dominance in the marketplace to stifle competition. The problems with the existing law were similar to the defects identified in the restrictive trade practices legislation: weak deterrence, no rights to damages or interim relief and inadequate powers of investigation. The government appeared to accept this argument and, last November, published a consultation paper on reform of the law on abuse of market power. It canvassed views on three options, two of which involved adopting an EC-style article 86 prohibition on abuse of a dominant position, backed by fines. In April this year, however, it opted to retain the existing case-by-case approach for tackling anti-competitive practices. The OFT's investigatory powers are to be strengthened, so that it can decide more quickly whether to launch full-scale inquiries. The government had identified a number of serious defects in UK monopoly controls, and had originally favoured adopting a new system based on article 86 of the Rome treaty while retaining the UK's existing powers to investigate monopolies under the Fair Trading Act. Sir Gordon had also favoured this approach. Its change of mind was ascribed to pressure from industry which was opposed to the idea of fines for practices such as deliberately pricing goods too cheaply and refusing to supply certain outlets. As a result, defects in UK competition laws remain and need to be addressed, if the UK is not to find itself increasingly out of step in Europe. The publication of Sir Gordon's views will remind the government that it cannot afford to let things drift.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank mulls UK move Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, is on the verge of a decisive build-up of its equity business in the City of London. Executives at Deutsche Bank and Morgan Grenfell, its UK merchant banking subsidiary, dismissed reports that a decision on the expansion would be made as early as this week. Deutsche Bank said, nevertheless, that it was in regular discussions on the issue and said: 'Our base for European equities would be London.' Mr Hilmar Kopper, spokesman for the bank's supervisory board, said: 'It would have to be expanded, and I do not think it can be expanded out of Frankfurt.' The main issue to be resolved is the role that Morgan Grenfell, which Deutsche Bank purchased in 1990 for Pounds 950m, will play in the German bank's broader strategy in investment banking. Morgan Grenfell said it would play a major role in helping to build up Deutsche's equity business. 'We can assist in the process,' said Mr Michael Dobson, chief executive of the UK merchant bank. The link would also allow the two entities to use each other's relationships. Nevertheless, senior officials at the UK merchant bank are believed to be jealous of their independence of action and identity. 'Morgan Grenfell is a fantastic name,' said one executive at the firm. 'What would Deutsche Grenfell sound like?' Morgan Grenfell said the success of the existing relationship was attested to by the merchant bank's financial results. The company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 235.8m in 1993, an increase of 194 per cent on the previous year.</p>

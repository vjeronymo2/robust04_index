			<p><P> October 6, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: BUENA PARK;  </P> <P> STUDY TO CONSIDER REDEVELOPMENT FOR MALL  </P> <P> The City Council has ordered a study to determine whether the Buena Park Mall  should be included in a possible redevelopment project.  </P> <P> The council this week approved a resolution calling for a 30-day study to  determine the feasibility of improvements to the 25-year-old mall, owned and  managed by City Freeholds (USA) Inc.  </P> <P> According to May Wong Hui, the city's economic development manager, the study  will be conducted by GRC Redevelopment Consultants, a Claremont firm  specializing in creating project areas. The study will determine what type of  aid the city could offer in accordance with redevelopment guidelines.  </P> <P> David Souers, executive vice president of City Freeholds, expressed interest in  the city's plan but said mall owners are planning to make improvements "one way  or the other." These improvements are expected to begin near the first of the  year.  </P> <P> Buena Park Mall was built in 1962, with Sears &amp; Roebuck becoming the first  big tenant. City Freeholds bought the mall in 1976 and in 1980 added a second  level and 100 more shops. In 1984, eight new theaters and 20 more merchants  were included.  </P> <P> Souers said he expected the city to offer aid in areas such as off-site  improvements but added that possible action is still only being discussed.  </P></p>

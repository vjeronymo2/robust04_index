			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / UNloved, UNwanted: A fitting fate for the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation You may have missed it, but 1980 to 1990 was the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. It had no impact whatsoever on the continent the first time round, but the perpetrator of this exercise in wishful thinking, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido), appears to work on the principle that Pooh Bear applied to his Hums. Pooh, it will be recalled, managed the first line of Hum without difficulty: 'Sing Ho] for the life of a bear.' It sounded splendid, but what came next? Pooh got stuck, until he had a brain wave. He would sing it very fast, in the hope the second line would just pop out. So will you please welcome the Second Industrial Development Decade for Africa. There is not quite the same ring to it, for Unido seems to have been caught napping. The second decade runs from 1993 to 2002. Enough is enough. It is time to abolish a body whose demise would distress only its 1,200 employees and the hundreds of experts and consultants who feed from its Dollars 100m-a-year trough. Unido was introduced to the world on January 1 1967 through General Assembly resolution 2152 (XXI) of November 17 1966. From the start it had ideas above its station, claiming that it had a 'mandate to act as the central co-ordinating body for industrial activities within the UN system'. Like many organisations spawned by the United Nations, Unido has been sustained by pompous jargon and an overriding belief in its own importance. The concept of an Industrial Decade, whatever that means, is given spurious authenticity through the language signalling its creation. The general assembly, we are told, in Resolution 35/668 of December 5 1980, proclaimed the 1980s as the Industrial Development Decade for Africa 'thus giving worldwide recognition to the decade'. Of course, it did nothing of the sort, except for UN bureaucrats. A welter of documents sustained their fantasies, products of seminars and special sessions where the delegates draw their per diems and build nothing more substantial than castles in the air. By 1983 Unido had produced a slim volume of pensees entitled A Programme for the Industrial Development Decade for Africa. The reader is warned that this handbook 'differs in many respects from previous practice, and calls for a firm rejection of isolated piecemeal planning of the past and a clear shift away from over-occupation (sic) with foreign exchange problems external to the region'. So much for Africa's overvalued exchange rates of the era, the single most serious feature of the already evident economic crisis that was destroying the continent. 'The new approach,' the guidelines reveal, 'is also predicated on a decisive move towards the integrated development of the human resources, institutional mechanisms and technological capacities required to assess and utilise the natural resources and raw material endowments of the region, expand local markets, enlarge the range of complementarities and strengthen links between industry and other sectors of the economy.' Of course, these banal exhortations did Africa no service. What they did do was to alert consultants and experts worldwide that here was another UN gravy train. Like the 1970s, the 1980s saw a series of Unido country reports, stupefyingly bland in their analysis, out of date in their statistics, and deferential to autocratic governments and kleptocratic regimes. Like all UN organisations, Unido selects its officers more for their country of origin than their expertise. Thus places were found for assorted econometricians, agronomists and economists, most with dubious credentials. They usually owed their jobs to political patronage, and lived in a world of diplomatic privileges, duty free facilities and hardship allowances. Unlike the World Bank, no one subjects Unido to scrutiny. If anyone cared to assess its policies and proposals over the 1970s and the 1980s, the organisation would emerge deeply discredited. Today Unido has the chutzpah to claim that it 'assists both governments and the public and private sector through technical and investment promotion services, and with policy advice'. The suggestion that this ineffectual agency might assist the private sector, or have any insight into investment, is risible. To be fair, Unido should not be blamed for Africa's crisis. True, it bears the responsibility that attaches to those who stay silent when they should be sounding the alarm. But no one took much notice of Unido and its experts. And that is why no one will miss it.</p>

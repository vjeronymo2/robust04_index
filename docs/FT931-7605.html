			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / UK regions risk losing Pounds 1bn in EC aid dispute BRITAIN'S most depressed industrial regions risk losing about Pounds 1bn in EC aid as a result of a row between the European Commission and the UK government over what Brussels claims is Whitehall's failure to provide matching finance. Mr Bruce Millan, EC regional policy commissioner, has written to the British government seeking talks to resolve the dispute. His move follows complaints from local authorities to Brussels that London is not 'matching' EC regional grants with equivalent funds, as required by the unanimously approved Community rules. Last night the Department of Trade and Industry in London said the EC's funds would be matched but 'final details' on the grants had to be finalised between Whitehall departments. Officials confirmed that a letter had been received by Sir John Kerr, the UK permanent representative, and said a reply had already been sent. The latest row over regional funds for industrially stricken regions such as Merseyside and Strathclyde comes as the government faces pressure to act on unemployment which hit 3m last week. The government agreed last February, after a prolonged row which divided the cabinet, to abide by EC rules from this April. The government also agreed to ensure that adequate 'matching' funds were provided to the regions in the interim in order to secure financing from Brussels. The funds earmarked for UK regions are worth Ecu1.26bn (Pounds 1.04bn) for 1992-93. The Commission had withheld for over a year Ecu160m in regional funding to regenerate British coalmining areas. These were only released when the previous row was settled with Britain shortly before last year's general election. A senior EC regional policy official said there had been 'a slight improvement' since then, but that 'we are getting too many complaints that they are not releasing the money'. He added: 'We are reaching the point when we have to react; they are making fools of us.' Another official said there was 'concern that the UK is not going to be able to take up the (EC) money, and that they will lose it at the end of the year,' when the current regional policy programme is replaced by a seven-year scheme. The Commission has maintained that a significant portion of EC aid to targeted UK regions is leaking out to other local authorities which are ineligible, because it all goes into a single Treasury pot. The UK argued that this was merely an accounting difference but last year pledged greater 'transparency'. Yesterday, however, in a memorandum before today's Commission discussion on the Ecu141.4bn 1994-99 structural aid programme, the regional policy directorate said: 'There is no justification for treating Community resources as being there merely to 'reimburse' national funds which would otherwise have been spent.' Government departments in Whitehall have been engaged in a so far unresolved wrangle over how to highlight in the national accounts EC funds that are additional to normal spending. Opinion has veered towards a system that would mean each department specifying in its annual budget the amount of funds coming from Brussels. But some departments have been reluctant to separate EC from national spending. Whitehall's problem has been complicated by the need to decide the amounts of funds which should pass into the ambit of a specific department. As England has no structure of regional government, EC funds pass through individual departments on their way to individual projects.</p>

			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Citadel Won't Seek Valley Federal: Citadel Holding, the Glendale-based parent  of Fidelity Federal Savings &amp; Loan, decided not to seek the purchase of  struggling Valley Federal Savings, a Van Nuys-based thrift with $3.3 billion in  assets. Citadel, with nearly $5 billion in assets, toyed with the idea of the  merger for more than two years. Valley Federal, which has sold several branches  recently to boost its financial health, said it would continue its  restructuring.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 18 KYODO -- Yohei Kono, president of  the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), has predicted  that governing coalition parties will reveal a contradiction of  basic party policies among them more clearly.    Kono, assuming the top post of the party late last July,  told  KYODO NEWS SERVICE that the governing coalition parties have had  clear-cut differences over the interpretation of the  Constitution and other basic national policies.    Kono said the LDP will not be able to help the governing  coalition of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa with their  simmering political rift.    The Social Democratic Party (SDP) and new party Sakigake  [Harbinger], two of seven coalition parties, have kept their  basic stance of respecting the war-renounced Constitution and  have been hesitant for Japan to participate in the U.N.  peacekeeping forces.    But Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito, two other  coalition parties, envision that Japan should play a more  positive role in world politics by shaking itself off from the  role of an economic player in politics.    The rift among the four main coalition parties has seemingly  deepened since Hosokawa failed to remove chief government  spokesman Masayoshi Takemura from the post in an attempt to  reshuffle his cabinet early this month, political sources said.    Kono turned his topic into a loan dispute involving Hosokawa  and urged the prime minister to clear an allegation over a  receipt of political donation from the scandal-tainted truck  parcel delivery company.    Kono, the first head since the LDP lost the 38-year grip on  power in August, said the prime minister should clear the  suspicion as he has spearheaded political reform resulting from  years of money scandals involving LDP politicians.    The LDP leader also said it is clear that Hosokawa's remarks  in Diet deliberation over the allegation contains a  contradiction of whether he owed 100 million yen to now-defunct  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin Co. which he borrowed to repair his home in  Kumamoto Prefecture and buy a condominium in central Tokyo.    Hosokawa has insisted he borrowed the 100 million yen from  Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin in 1982 to repair the home and buy the  condominium, and fully repaid the money by January 31, 1991,  using part of his retirement allowance as Kumamoto governor.    He served two four-year terms as governor from 1983 until  February 1991.    Hosokawa has rejected an opposition party demand to submit  more documents related to his loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin.    The LDP, which set the submission of additional documents  from Hosokawa as a condition to start deliberations of the  fiscal 1994 state budget in the House of Representatives budget  committee, reacted angrily, with the result that debates on the  budget are likely to be delayed until later this month, Diet  sources said.    "It will be unfortunate for the Japanese people if there is  a  further delay in Diet deliberations on the state budget," Kono  said.    Concerning the possible return to power by the LDP, Kono  said  his party will present its clear-cut policies to the Japanese  people to regain power from the coalition government in an  upcoming general election.</p>

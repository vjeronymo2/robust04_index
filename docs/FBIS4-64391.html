			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- After a four-hour debate, the Social  Democratic Party of Germany's [SPD] executive committee  unanimously adopted the draft government program on Monday [2  May] with only one abstention, SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping  told the press afterwards. Following a comprehensive debate,  various items were added to the part on ecology, but the  controversial wording of the speed limit has remained unaltered.    The passage says that the SPD is aiming at a universal speed  limit throughout Europe, which would be 130 kilometers per hour  for 90 percent of all super highways, Scharping said.    The SPD chairman said that there was no criticism of his  leadership -- "quite the contrary." The withdrawal of traffic  expert Christoph Zoepel from his team was only mentioned  briefly, [Scharping said].</p>

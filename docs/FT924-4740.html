			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / People: Jobs for Northern Ireland Desmond McVeigh has been chosen as the new chief executive of the Industrial Development Board, Northern Ireland's main jobs promotion agency. He replaces Tony Hopkins, who left in March to become a partner with Touche Ross. Since then Frank McCann, formerly an undersecretary in the Department of Environment, has been acting chief executive. He will now be offered 'another senior position' within the organisation, IDB said. The government has spent several months searching for the new chief executive, who takes on one of the most difficult economic development jobs in the UK. It is understood McVeigh, 53, whose career has been in international banking, will be receiving a six figure salary. McVeigh got his early training at Citibank, latterly working in the oil division on the financing of exploration and development projects in the North Sea. From 1974-1977 he was with First National Bank of Dallas where he became vice president, responsible for the bank's credit operations throughout Europe, Africa and the Middle East. After seven years at Saudi International Bank, he moved in 1985 to Lloyds Merchant Bank, and then in 1988 on to found his own independent project development agency. The company operates in the UK, Central Europe and Middle East and its present portfolio includes projects in Poland and Saudi Arabia. McVeigh was born in Ceylon, where his father was a Methodist missionary, and was educated at Methodist College and Queen's University, Belfast.</p>

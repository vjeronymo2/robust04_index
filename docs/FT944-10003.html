			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Speculations): Lottery? You'd be safer at the Halifax - Britain's new national flutter might be exciting but Raymond Snoddy suggests there are better places for a rational person's money The star-spangled hand of fortune in the television advertisements promoting the launch of Britain's national lottery could well descend on a lucky ticket-holder next Saturday night when the numbers are drawn for the first time. But do not hold your breath. The chances of winning an expected jackpot of Pounds 2m with a Pounds 1 ticket - if the jackpot is not rolled over until the following week because no one has managed to chose the right six numbers - are around 14m to 1. Your chances look rather better at roulette, where a bet on a colour has a 50-50 chance and the odds against winning on a single number are a mere 35 to one. But lotteries are in the business of selling dreams rather than mathematical odds - a theme emphasised by the television commercials and their slogan, 'It Could Be You.' It is a dream that sells very effectively around the world. Last year, 165 lotteries - more than 100 playing computerised, on-line Lotto games like that in the UK - had sales totalling Pounds 53.7bn. Camelot, the company granted a licence to operate the UK version for the next seven years, hopes to raise Pounds 32bn during that period, with up to Pounds 9bn going to such 'good causes' as the arts, charities, the national heritage, a millennium fund and sport. Overall, the lottery will be dispensing hundreds of thousands of prizes  - most of them a minimum Pounds 10. But the odds against winning the jackpot by choosing the correct six numbers (in any order) from the 49 balls in the revolving drum actually are 14m:1. Match five balls plus an extra bonus number and the odds fall to 2.3m:1 for a Pounds 100,000 prize. With five main numbers alone, the expected prize will be Pounds 1,500 and the odds 55,000:1. Pick three correct numbers and there is the guaranteed minimum prize of Pounds 10, with a 57:1 chance of winning. By contrast, the Irish lottery works on six balls out of 42, with odds against winning the twice-weekly IPounds 500,000 jackpot of 5.2m:1. What happens to all the money? In the UK lottery, 50p of every Pounds 1 ticket goes in prizes, 12p in tax, 28p to good causes, 5p to the retailer and the rest to Camelot for operator costs and profit. How does the UK lottery compare with other ways of turning a small stake into millions overnight? The two most obvious options are buying premium bonds from National Savings (NS) and playing the football pools. Both organisations, aware of the stiff competition to be expected from the lottery, have changed their rules to produce huge jackpot prizes. Since April, NS has introduced a guaranteed monthly Pounds 1m winner. And, although pools winnings are often shared, Littlewoods was able to announce a record double pay-out this week when 10 London prison officers shared nearly Pounds 1.8m and a couple from Lancashire won just over Pounds 900,000. This followed the Pounds 2.6m shared by 12 regulars at a pub near Wigan, Cheshire, last month. It is, however, difficult to compare the lottery and premium bonds as vehicles for high-odds gambling because they are such different things. 'Ours is a better gamble as a way of saving,' claims NS. This is because the holder keeps his stake, gambles only with the interest, and has an automatic entry in each monthly draw. The odds against winning the Pounds 1m with a single ticket in the monthly draws - Pounds 100 is now the minimum for premium bond sales - are very high at 4bn:1. But such odds have not dampened bond sales: since the introduction of the Pounds 1m top prize, sales have risen from Pounds 50m to Pounds 60m a month last year to more than Pounds 200m a month now. There is, however, a 15,000:1 chance of winning a prize each month, mainly the Pounds 50 minimum. On average, someone holding 1,250 bonds can expect one prize a year. Those with bonds worth Pounds 15,000 can look forward to one prize a month. Pools companies cannot quote odds on winning a big jackpot because there are so many variables from week to week - such as the number of games and the number of lines filled in. The odds against winning clearly are enormous - around 18m:1, according to some estimates. The level of prize money returned by the pools companies is unimpressive, too. The government takes 37.5 per cent in tax and 10 per cent goes towards the Football Trust and the Foundation For Sport. Only between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of the stake is returned in prizes. Thus, a wholly rational person probably would do well to stay away from lotteries, pools and (to a lesser extent) premium bonds and find a safer place for his money. Building societies, perhaps? Other major lotteries include: New York One of the on-line games in the state lottery is called Take Five. This is a 5/39 lottery, meaning you must pick five out of 39 numbers correctly. The odds of winning any prize are 8.77:1. The odds of winning the jackpot are 576,000:1. Rhode Island One of Rhode Island's on-line games is called Powerball where players are required to select five numbers from 1 to 45 and then a sixth number - called the Powerball - from 1 to 45. Overall odds of winning a cash prize are 35:1. The odds of winning the jackpot are 55,000:1. Texas The Texas on-line game, Texas Lotto is a 6/50 game. Therefore, the odds on winning the jackpot are 15,890,700:1. There is a guaranteed minimum jackpot of Dollars 2m. South Dakota Dakota Cash is a 5/35 cash lotto game where the overall odds of winning any prize are 72:1. The odds on winning the jackpot are 325,000:1. The jackpot starts at a minimum of Dollars 20,000 and rolls over until it has been won. Georgia Georgia Lotto, the state's main on-line game, is a 6/46 game. The odds are: six out of six = 9.4m:1; five out of six = 39,000:1; four out of six = 801:1; three out of six = 47:1. Fifty per cent of sales go in prizes. Australia Most of the Australian states - New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia - have 6/45 on-line lotteries. The odds on winning the jackpot in these lotteries is 8.1m:1.</p>

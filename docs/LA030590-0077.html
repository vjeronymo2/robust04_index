			<p><P> March 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHUTTLE ENDS SECRET, FOUR-DAY MILITARY MISSION;  </P> <P> SPACE: THE ATLANTIS LANDS AT EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, BUT THE PUBLIC WAS NOT  INVITED. IT REPORTEDLY PLACED A SPY SATELLITE IN ORBIT.  </P> <P> Although few were on hand to witness it, the space shuttle Atlantis capped a  secret, four-day military mission by swooping out of a windy but blue  California sky Sunday morning to glide into a picturesque landing at this  Mojave Desert base.  </P> <P> The shuttle, which had blasted off early Wednesday from the Kennedy Space  Center in Florida, landed on time at 10:08 a.m. PST.  </P> <P> Sources have said that during its flight, the spacecraft placed in orbit a  sophisticated photo-reconnaissance satellite designed to spy on the Soviet  Union. NASA officials refused to confirm or deny this report.  </P> <P> For the most part, the NASA officials honored a Pentagon-imposed news blackout  concerning the flight. They also refused to allow the public onto Edwards to  view the landing. Only a few hundred NASA workers and invited guests, as well  as reporters, were allowed to watch.  </P> <P> The mission apparently went well. "Congratulations on a great flight, guys, and  welcome back," was the message radioed by NASA officials to the five-man,  all-military crew upon the shuttle's return to Earth. And Atlantis pilot John  H. Casper could be seen waving and giving a thumbs-up sign after the landing.  </P> <P> The 100-ton craft, the youngest of the three shuttles, signaled its arrival  over Edwards with its characteristic twin sonic booms. Approaching from the  northwest, Atlantis nearly circled the base before landing at more than 200  m.p.h. on Runway 23, a 5.2-mile-long clay strip on Rogers Dry Lake Bed.  </P> <P> The bleachers and viewing areas that typically hold thousands of spectators for  open shuttle landings were empty Sunday. The craft appeared in good shape and  the crew exited about 50 minutes after landing.  </P> <P> NASA officials, acknowledging that closed landings for military missions  generate public complaints, said they plan to review that policy with defense  officials. The result could be public viewing of future military shuttle  landings, if the Pentagon agrees.  </P> <P> Adverse weather had threatened to delay Atlantis' return Sunday, as rain was  forecast and winds at times gusted above NASA limits. But no rain fell and,  before the landing, the winds died down to head-wind gusts of 25 m.p.h., just  under NASA's threshold.  </P> <P> "Gorgeous," said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone, after the shuttle, trailing a  cloud of dust, rolled to a stop right on the black center line of the runway,  having traveled 71 orbits around the Earth. NASA clocked the flight at 4 days,  10 hours and 18 minutes from start to touchdown.  </P> <P> Only two minor problems were reported as the shuttle descended toward Edwards.  First, a circuit breaker on the craft was accidentally tripped, and then one of  its hydraulic systems had a temporary drop in pressure. But NASA mission  commentator Billie Deason said neither affected the landing.  </P> <P> The blastoff had not gone so smoothly. NASA had wanted to launch Atlantis on  Feb. 22. But poor weather, a computer problem and a cold that afflicted mission  commander John O. Creighton caused five postponements before Wednesday's launch  at 2:51 a.m. EST.  </P> <P> Atlantis' mission was the 34th flight overall since the first shuttle flight in  April, 1981. The mission was the sixth solely dedicated to a Department of  Defense objective, NASA officials said. And it was the second shuttle flight  this year, with seven more scheduled.  </P> <P> The shuttle Discovery is scheduled for an April 12 launch. Its mission is to  place into orbit a $1.5-billion observatory designed to allow astronomers to  study stars and galaxies so distant that their light has been traveling toward  Earth for 14 billion years.  </P> <P> Along with Creighton, a Navy captain, and Casper, an Air Force colonel, the  crew for the Atlantis flight consisted of mission specialists Marine Lt. Col.  David C. Hilmers, Air Force Col. Richard M. Mullane, and Navy Lt. Cmdr. Pierre  J. Thuot. All but Casper and Thuot had been on previous shuttle flights.  </P></p>

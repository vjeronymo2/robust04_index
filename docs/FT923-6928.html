			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Central banks move to ease strain of the D-Mark: Several European states adjust interest rates as their currencies come under pressure THE mighty D-Mark has created new tensions both inside and outside the European Monetary System this week, forcing several European central banks to change their short-term interest rates. The Swedish central bank yesterday moved to protect the krona by raising its key lending rate from 12 to 13 per cent. This pushed up rates in the Finnish money market, and the Bank of Finland countered by lowering the tender rate used in financing to commercial banks to 15.50 per cent from 16 per cent. Earlier in the week, the Bank of Portugal cut its interest rates by 1 per cent because the differential between the escudo (the strongest currency in the European monetary system) and sterling (the weakest) had widened beyond permitted limits. Investors continue to be attracted by the high yield of the German currency, with the Lombard rate at 9.75 per cent and little prospect of a cut before the end of this year. The D-Mark is also proving to be popular in the run-up to France's referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union next month. Opinion polls published earlier this week suggest the vote will be close. Dealers fear that a French 'No' vote will make a realignment of European currencies more politically acceptable. The Swedish authorities have experienced serious difficulties this week trying to staunch the heavy selling of the krona for D-Marks. Investors find the Swedish currency unappealing for much the same reason that they dislike sterling. Sweden has fundamental economic difficulties, with gross domestic product contracting by 1.4 per cent last year and unemployment standing at a historically high 5.3 per cent. Many investors also consider the krona heavily overvalued against the D-Mark. Sweden's export performance in recent years has been poor and there are no signs of an immediate improvement. But, although this week's interest rate rise risks exacerbating the country's recession, the authorities could not afford to watch their currency fall. The krona is not in the ERM. But Sweden, which is committed to joining the European Community as well as participating in any eventual European monetary union, is shadowing the Ecu. Some analysts consider this policy flawed because Sweden is acting as a member of the EMS without enjoying the support of mutual central bank intervention - hence, the need to raise rates this week. By contrast, the Bank of Portugal had to cut its intervention rate because the currency was too strong. Until the start of this week, the escudo was at the top of the EMS grid, protected by the bank's policy of maintaining high interest rates to reduce inflation, currently running at an annual 9.5 per cent . However, the escudo's strength had created strains in the EMS because of its huge differential against sterling. No two EMS currencies can diverge against each other's central rates by more than 6.18 per cent. But the limits were broken last weekend as investors sold sterling for D-Marks. However the Portuguese cut may turn out to have been excessive. In the immediate aftermath, the escudo slipped from Es85.84 to the D-Mark to Es86.90 and slid two places in the EMS grid. German monetary policy was reflected in other rate changes this week. Ireland's largest bank, Allied Irish, raised its interest rates by  1/2 a percentage point to 13 1/2 per cent. It may have been responding to the upward pressure on European money market rates that followed the Bundesbank's 0.75 percentage point rise in its discount rate last month.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Plunge in copper prices undermines other metals - Market report Sharp falls in COPPER prices weighed on the other base metals contracts at the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon. Copper's three months delivery price plunged through several important chart support points, notably at Dollars 2,510 and Dollars 2,495 a tonne, as fund selling, stop-loss sales and liquidation brushed aside any buying, dealers said. The ALUMINIUM market suffered from heavy liquidation, which emerged when the three months price backed through the Dollars 1,495-Dollars 1,500-a-tonne area, ignoring news of a further fall in LME warehouse stocks. At the London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures recovered some of Monday's big falls as traders waited for Brazil to give a revised official estimate for the 1995-96 crop following the recent frosts. They said rumours that Brazil might cancel the auction of an extra 5m bags of stocks gave further encouragement to speculative buyers. COCOA prices moved higher with coffee and were also aided by concern about dry weather in the Ivory Coast.

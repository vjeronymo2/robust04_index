			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): It's all in the name  -Why Heinz and McVitie's are putting new emphasis on their brands In the coming weeks television viewers will see a subtle shift in the way a number of leading consumer products are advertised in the UK. Instead of emphasising the identities of the products themselves, manufacturers' own names will be far more prominent than in recent years. The move is part of the fightback by brand-owners against retailers' own-label goods. It is also an attempt to consolidate expensive television advertising behind just one message, rather than fragmenting it across the promotion of numerous individual items. Food companies Heinz and McVitie's are taking this route, while also stepping up their direct marketing and promotion activities to reach consumers with details of specific products. Heinz, which currently spends an estimated Pounds 12m a year on television advertising of individual products, including beans, soup and sauces, will switch this money into supporting the main brand on television. The precise nature of the commercials has still to be decided, but it is likely that future campaigns will concentrate on what are seen to be fundamental Heinz 'values'. The company has already used this approach with poster advertising, with an umbrella campaign emphasising high nutritional content, lack of artificial ingredients, and affordability. With 300 products - around twice the number the company had a decade ago - Heinz says it is increasingly difficult to promote individual lines through mainstream advertising. Even tomato ketchup is no longer a straightforward sell, as there are now half a dozen varieties. This is where direct marketing can play its part, says Heinz, which is planning a substantial investment in the direct targeting of particular groups of consumers to promote individual products. Lawrence Balfe, Heinz marketing director, says: 'While we remain totally committed to advertising, with mainstream advertising expenditure staying at current levels, we will be putting additional funds into our direct communication activities. We see the direct link with our loyal consumers as an essential means of developing our consumer franchise.' The approach has already been successful over the last couple of years for baby foods, the company claims, which represent a particularly tough marketing challenge. McVitie's direct contact with consumers will include a big free sample drive, covering about 25 per cent of the UK population, and forms part of a Pounds 20m push this year to strengthen the brand name. For the first time in recent years McVitie's UK, the United Biscuits subsidiary, is concentrating its advertising on the overall brand. An Pounds 8m TV campaign will cover four products: Digestive, Homewheat, Hob Nobs, and Riva biscuits. Together they accounted for about Pounds 140m of McVitie's UK turnover last year. The four brands will feature in the advertisements but will not overshadow the McVitie's name. A further Pounds 10m will be spent on in-store promotions and sampling, while Pounds 1.5m will be spent on redesigning packaging to increase the size of the McVitie's logo. The moves represent 'a fundamental change to the McVitie's strategy,' says Andy Rush, marketing director. 'There is a clear recognition in the business that our strongest asset is the McVitie's brand and therefore all investment will be directed towards it in the future.' United Biscuits, which has 44 per cent of the UK biscuit market, saw profits on UK biscuits fall 10 per cent last year, before exceptionals, to Pounds 83.8m. This is partly attributable to a sharp increase in the cost of raw materials, but the fact that McVitie's has had to trim margins is an indication of the price pressure the company is under. The pressure is coming from rival biscuit brands as well as retailers' own-label products. Rush argues that smaller competitors' only strategic option has been to compete on price. 'The key for us is not to follow them down that route, but to maintain a quality stance in the marketplace,' he says. Ensuring that advertising messages about the brand are not inconsistent or dissipated among a whole range of products is central to that strategy.</p>

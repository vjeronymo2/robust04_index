			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Rallies Held To Denounce Farm Market Opening and Check Its </F> `Parliamentary Approval'" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- People's rallies were  held in Seoul, Pusan, Taegu, Kwangju, Taejon and six other  cities of South Korea from two Saturday afternoon to denounce  the farm market opening and check its "parliamentary approval,"  a radio report from Seoul said.    The rally in Seoul was attended by 15,000 farmers,  dissidents, citizens and students under the South Korean  Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon).    The ralliers said the South Korean countryside would be  ruined by the Uruguay Round of world trade talks in which the  authorities fully accepted the brigandish demands of the United  States.    They urged the "National Assembly" to refuse to "approve"  farm market opening.    In his address at the rally, Yi Ki-taek, president of the  Democratic Party, urged the authorities not to attend the  signing ceremony of the Uruguay Round accord scheduled in  Morocco on April 15, saying that South Korea's agriculture and  countryside were standing on the edge of a cliff due to the  humiliating diplomacy.    After the rally, the participants continued their protests  for a long time in front of the "National Assembly building,"  shouting "check with death the parliamentary endorsement of the  Uruguay Round accord."    Prior to the rally in Seoul, 3,000 students of Seoul  National, Korea and Hanyang Universities under Hanchongnyon held  meetings to check the Uruguay Round at their universities and  dispatched a group of 200 hunger strikers to Myongdong Cathedral  in Seoul.    Hanchongnyon announced that a hunger strike against farm  market opening will be organised from April 9 to 15.    Rallies and demonstrations also took place in ten other  cities including Pusan, Taegu, Kwangju and Taejon, attended by  10,000 people of different strata.    On Friday, 3,000 students held a rally and protests in  Seoul,  shouting "Down with Kim Yong-sam" and "Oppose foreign rice."</p>

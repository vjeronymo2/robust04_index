She, who visited Korea in 1963 and 1993, expressed her  impressions:    What astonished me greatly during my visit was that  wonderful  and great monumental edifices and modern streets such as  Kwangbok Street, Tongil Street and Changgwang Street had been  built like a forest in a matter of a few years. Pyongyang has  been turned into a city of world level with 30-40-storeyed  buildings.    The food, clothing and housing questions have been  completely  solved in Korea.    It is a beautiful trait that everybody lives evenly and  equally in harmony, helping and leading each other forward.    The Korean art has combined what is traditional with what is  modern.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song praised me as a  comrade-in-arms of the Korean people and a revolutionary fighter  when he received me. This cannot but be a great honor to me, an  ordinary woman of Cuba.    Referring to the question of Korea's reunification, she  said:    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song put forward the  "10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for  the reunification of the country" that is acceptable to all  Koreans in the North and the South and overseas.    I am not a politician but I believe that Korea will  certainly  be reunified in the 90s.    The reunification of Korea is a long-cherished desire of the  entire Korean people.    Comrade Kim Il-song and Comrade Fidel Castro are the  outstanding leaders of the world and socialism is sure to win  as long as it is led by the two leaders.    Comrade Kim Chong-il is the successor to the revolutionary  cause of Comrade Kim Il-song.</p>

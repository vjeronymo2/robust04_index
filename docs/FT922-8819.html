			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Survey of Lincolnshire and South Humberside (6): Engineering keeps its place - Lincoln enjoys a splendid site, but a mixed economic landscape THE CATHEDRAL broods over the city. High on the hill, it tells travellers coming in from the surrounding flat lands that their destination is near. For Lincoln is the focal point of the region, a fact recognised as early as the 12th century when the city received its royal charter. 'It is thought of as a small market town with a cathedral. But it is a significant industrial and commercial centre - this is the reality,' said Mr Mike Roberts, of the city's economic development department. Arguably, it is the economic diversity of the city that has enabled it, if not to avoid the recession, at least to escape its most damaging effects. Unemployment in the Lincoln travel-to-work-area is just under 10 per cent and close to the national average. However, in the city itself unemployment is unofficially estimated at up to four percentage points more; and up to half of those without jobs are long-term unemployed. The economic landscape is mixed. Historically, the city has been an engineering centre. Indeed, the tank was devised, developed and built in Lincoln during the first world war. Nationally, engineering has been in the doldrums. But in Lincoln, European Gas Turbines, part of GEC-Alsthom, has a heavy order-book; while rationalisation at GPT, the telecommunications group now managed from Swindon, has caused redundancies. Over the past decade, old names like Ruston Bucyrus, with its earth-moving equipment, have disappeared and emerged in smaller and more specialised form; but new names such as Rose Bearings, the fruit of Japanese takeover and investment, have emerged as more powerful local economic forces. The engineering industry provides about 8,000 jobs in a local economy where there is employment for around 74,000. Engineering employment is more significant than tourism, where, even including the jobs in pubs, the total is about 5000. Tourism is not as important as the dominance of the cathedral might suggest. Lincoln is not, for example, on the American visitor circuit. Although about 1m people may visit the city each year, most only stay for a day. Tourism is an industry awaiting exploitation. While there has been some expansion of hotels, the concern of the Confederation of British Industry remains valid: 'The lack of facilities in Lincoln and Lincolnshire, such as hotels and basics, like cinemas, means that, apart from the summer season at the coast, Lincolnshire does not attract as many tourists as it could accommodate.' For the CBI, there is another possibility: Lincoln could be a tourist base. 'Good hotels, a full and imaginative use made of the Brayford Pool (the harbour built by the Romans) and exploitation of Lincoln's very historical and important Roman and medieval past could help the whole county.' But the thrust of investment in Lincoln is more narrowly based. Development, especially in retail facilities like the Waterside shopping centre, has continued despite the recession. And there will be more. GW Padley is planning a new food-processing plant; Anglian Water is moving some headquarters staff to a refurbished engineering works once owned by Clayton Dewandre and now by Simons, the construction group; the Inland Revenue is establishing its training headquarters in an old bishop's palace. To what extent such development can ease the problem of the long-term unemployed is not clear. The city does not escape the problems of economic and social deprivation that are characteristic of UK cities. For the most part, problems are concentrated in the city's eastern wards. Lincoln is not on the list of the government's 57 Urban Programme authorities, and hence does not receive 75 per cent grant aid for specified economic renewal projects. City leaders noted that, on most indices of deprivation (quality of housing, lack of education facilities, the number of one-parent families) Lincoln's eastern wards were as badly off as most Urban Programme authorities. But what the city does not have, the leaders observed, is a social difficulty with ethnic minorities. Indeed, according to government criteria, it is entitled only to the subsidy of Derelict Land Grant. Efforts to persuade the government to make available more subsidies for regeneration have failed. But the government is more enthusiastic about a joint public-private sector approach to regeneration, on the model of the now superseded Birmingham Heartlands, called Investors In Lincoln. This groups the City Council, the Training and Enterprise Council, the Lincoln Co-operative Society, the Chamber of Commerce and six local development companies, with sponsorship from East Midlands Electricity. How Investors In Lincoln will approach its task will be clearer later this year. By the end of this month, Drivers Jonas, the London chartered surveying consultancy, should produce a study which will include not only an urban regeneration plan, but also a business plan and a series of specific initiatives, long- and short-term, which will provide guidelines for the next 15 years. In Lincoln, the game is played long.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: India approves plan for national stock exchange THE INDIAN government yesterday approved controversial plans for the establishment of a National Stock Exchange, a potential rival for the Bombay Stock Exchange and other provincial exchanges. The plans, advanced by the finance ministry and leading state-owned financial institutions, envisage the creation of a Rs1bn (Dollars 32m) nationwide computer-based trading system for a wide range of financial instruments, including equities, bonds and short-term paper. The proposals are likely to provoke fierce battles in the financial community, with the institutions ranged against stockbrokers who see the plans as a threat to their business. Brokers also doubt whether such an ambitious scheme can be introduced rapidly in India, given the country's chronic shortages of telephone lines and other services vital for a national computer-based market. The government yesterday set out a tight timetable for the new exchange  - saying that money market instruments would be traded by the end of the current financial year in March 1994. Capital market instruments, including equities, would be introduced later. The government said in a statement that its aim was to ensure greater transparency and better protection for investors. 'The exchange will also help in bringing the Indian capital market in line with international markets,' it added. Government officials believe last year's Rs40bn Bombay securities market scandal highlighted many weaknesses in the existing stock markets, including unclear trading practices, poor book-keeping by brokers and late settlements. Even though the affair centred on the inter-bank market and not the stock exchange, stockbrokers played a key role in channelling funds illegally from banks into equity investments. The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the newly-appointed securities market watchdog, has been struggling in its efforts to bring greater discipline to the stock markets. Brokers complain that the authorities have been heavy-handed and have failed to understand the subtleties of stock trading.</p>

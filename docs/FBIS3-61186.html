			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vyacheslav Trubnikov, first deputy director </F> of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service, conducted by Andrey  Poleshchuk: "Vyacheslav Trubnikov: `There Is No Great Difference  Between a Journalist and an Intelligence Agent': The First  Deputy Director of the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service Once  Worked Under a Journalistic Cover"]    [Text] Vyacheslav Trubnikov was born on 25 April 1944  in Irkutsk. However, he does not consider himself Siberian,  because his family, which had been evacuated to Irkutsk,  returned to Moscow six months after he was born. After  graduating from high school Vyacheslav Trubnikov enrolled in the  Institute of International Relations, upon graduation from which  he entered an intelligence school. He regards himself as an  "absolutely professional" intelligence officer: "I have no other  specialty, no other profession. It is my full-time job, and one  that I truly love. I feel that the choice I made has proven to  be 100 percent correct. Despite the difficulties and demands of  this profession. Despite the fact it leaves almost no time for  family. It is a way of life."    V. Trubnikov's wife is also a graduate of the Moscow  State Institute of International Relations. Unfortunately the  Trubnikovs' oldest was killed in 1989. Their daughter is in the  tenth grade.    Vyacheslav Trubnikov speaks English and Hindi. He spent  15 years in South Asia, in India, Bangladesh, Nepal and  Pakistan. He considers himself an Indophile to the core. In his  free time, if his eyes do not hurt too much, he likes to read  and watch movies.    In his opinion, interviewing an intelligence officer is  a thankless task: "Your job is to get as much information as  possible, and mine is to say as little as possible."    [Poleshchuk] The country has just gone through an election,  and what happened, happened. Your service is not directly  involved in domestic affairs. Nevertheless, one would assume  that your officers stationed outside of Russia received  instructions from the Center to keep up with the reaction "over  there" to events here...    [Trubnikov] Of course.    [Poleshchuk] Could you give a summation of what people are  saying about these events? Are there perhaps some nuances of  which not everyone is aware?    [Trubnikov] At this point I would not venture to say that  there is a stable, unambiguous opinion abroad about the things  that have happened here. But the responses and statements that  we are currently collecting tell us one thing: in the opinion of  people abroad the democratic process is taking hold in Russia.  These were genuinely free elections, according to outside  observers; they were democratic and most likely expressed the  will of the people in its most concentrated form, quite aside  from the issue of what that will is. The outside world may or  may not like the outcome of Russia's election, but the most  important thing is that our democratic process is working.    That is what I can tell you at this time. I do not wish to  go  into any more details right now, because the assessments vary  widely. We need to wait for the final results.    [Poleshchuk] Foreign intelligence, like other intelligence  services, is there to protect the interests of the state...    [Trubnikov] National interests...    [Poleshchuk] ...national interests, regardless of current  political factors. But is it really possible for your  organization to remain "above the fray" at this time of  intensive political struggle in Russia? Is political neutrality  and non-participation in the parties and movements that exist in  our country today mandatory for those who work for or want to  work for the Foreign Intelligence Service?    [Trubnikov] It is rather difficult to answer that question.  Why? Because it is impossible to live in a society and attempt  to remain apart from it. Of course, each of us has his own  political sympathies and antipathies. Living among real people,  any intelligence officer is definitely going to have his own  internal guideposts. Otherwise we would probably not go vote.  But the intelligence service did vote.    [Poleshchuk] Am I correct to say that the leadership was not  interested in who voted and how?    [Trubnikov] Not only was it not interested, that is not a  determining factor in the work of an intelligence officer. There  is one determining factor: patriotism. Regardless of one's own  political sympathies or antipathies. An intelligence officer is  a person who guards the state. The current state, no matter what  kind it is. Therefore no one would think of inquiring who voted  or how they voted.    [Poleshchuk] Fine, then here is a question -- one, I hope,  that is purely out of the realm of fantasy -- but here it is:  if, God forbid, the country began to slip back into the past,  something that people fear so much, what position would  intelligence take?    [Trubnikov] That is a hypothesis, and I am not very inclined  to discuss hypothetical scenarios. My absolutely firm conviction  is that a return to the past is impossible. The country has made  its choice. No one wants to go back to the past. Nor does the  intelligence service.    [Poleshchuk] Who receives information from you nowadays?    [Trubnikov] We have a very broad range of recipients and  consumers. From the president on down to structures that work on  our economy. But all of them are, of course, state structures.  We do not provide information to the private sector. We base  that on what is in my opinion a very important principle: we are  living off the taxpayers' money. Taxpayers pay for the state.  Therefore we work for the state. If some private structure wants  to enjoy the fruits of intelligence efforts, then it should  create its own intelligence service, maintain it and pay for it.    [Poleshchuk] Are there any cases of that happening?    [Trubnikov] Well, in any event in the West any more or less  upstanding corporation has its own intelligence service. And  similar structures are being created here. Structures whose job  it is to protect the interests of a specific economic  association, financial group, bank... Incidentally, there are  former members of intelligence and counterintelligence agencies  working for these.    [Poleshchuk] As you are aware, 20 December was Intelligence  Officers' Day. This year state security celebrated its 73rd  birthday -- not a major anniversary, but still a date...    [Trubnikov] That is definitely our holiday, because 73 years  ago a foreign department was established as part of the  All-Russian Cheka.    We are not the kind who forget where we come from. And we  never intend to repudiate our own past. Fighting with  monuments... That is paganism, and we are opposed to that. The  Queen of England, for example, is not bothered by the monument  to Cromwell. And for some reason France continues to celebrate  the day the Bastille fell. Therefore we continue to remember our  holidays and, of course, to celebrate them.    [Poleshchuk] Does your service have any awards, badges or  certificates?    [Trubnikov] Yes, we do have what is, in my opinion, a fairly  limited range of badges and incentive insignias. Currently our  highest award is the badge "For Service in Intelligence." That  is what we award our personnel for actual results. But I should  note that intelligence officers are no strangers to state  awards, either. In 1993 the intelligence service received, if  not ten, then approximately ten state awards. For absolutely  specific cases not connected with any dates or anniversaries. So  the country does notice us. However, we do not proclaim it or  make a big fuss about it, and we present the awards right here  where you and I are sitting now.    [Poleshchuk] It has not been all that long since the Foreign  Intelligence Service became a separate intelligence branch. Has  the Russian intelligence service formulated a new doctrine yet?    [Trubnikov] That is an exceptionally complex question, and  an  exceptionally serious one. Intelligence doctrine cannot be in  the forefront or be "ahead" of foreign policy doctrine or  military doctrine. Therefore we are still formulating it in its  final form, because only now do we have a security doctrine, a  foreign policy doctrine and military doctrine.    I am not inclined to go into great detail about intelligence  doctrine. You can well understand that in a situation when our  country is at a crucial point, when it is going through a  so-called "transition period," doctrine, whether intelligence  doctrine or otherwise, cannot be firmly stated very far in  advance. The situation in the country is changing too rapidly.  Therefore I would put it this way: we have a document that  formulates the basic principles of our operations during the  transition period away from confrontation, which was typical of  the cold war era, toward a doctrine of partnership.    [Poleshchuk] You said that intelligence doctrine lags  somewhat behind other doctrines. We have a military doctrine and  a foreign policy doctrine. However, as you are aware, attitudes  toward them vary. To what degree do you have to accept as a  given things developed by other ministries and agencies?    [Trubnikov] We accept everything that is law as a given.  Intelligence cannot perceive anything that is legitimate in any  other way. We are in the service of a legal government and a  president who was elected by the people. For us legitimacy is  the definitive concept. Regardless of our personal political  leanings. Of course, we can express our thoughts on various  aspects of our foreign policy, and we do so. In any event, the  fact that the intelligence service has made two public reports  is an indicator that we want to be heard. Both on the issue of  the spread of weapons of mass destruction and on the issue of  NATO expansion, and what that could mean to Russia. We express  our point of view as we deem necessary. But that does not mean  that we are casting doubts on various principles of military and  foreign policy doctrine which have been unambiguously approved  by a legitimate authority and are a guide for action.    [Poleshchuk] As you are aware, the first parliamentary  inspection of Foreign Intelligence Service operations was  conducted in the summer of 1993. What is your view of the  outlook for parliamentary monitoring of the intelligence service?    [Trubnikov] The issue of parliamentary monitoring has  remained on the agenda, thank God. That is an absolutely  essential element in the life of today's intelligence service.  For us it was a very serious psychological test, to have  outsiders come into our "house." The intelligence community had  a very mixed reaction to that. We hide from each other things  that have suddenly become the subject of discussion and  investigation by deputies in parliament. At the initial stage we  had a problem getting used to it, but when we tallied up the  results of what had been done, we concluded that the  parliamentary commission's work enabled us to look at ourselves  from the outside. For the first time in the history of our  country's foreign intelligence service. When the KGB existed,  the inspection administration oversaw our expenditure of funds,  etc., but that was our own in-house inspection. This time we for  the first time found ourselves the focus of attention by people  in whom the people's confidence had been placed. I can say that  on the whole the commission proved itself to be a very mature  commission. There was not a single unnecessary question. Every  intelligence officer had an opportunity to go to the commission  in complete anonymity and say whatever he felt needed to be  said. Our deputies were able to obtain exhaustive information  regarding any violations or problems. But there were no such  cases. I hope that the new members of parliament will establish  similar commissions for defense and security, or a subcommittee  on intelligence.    [Poleshchuk] Everyone knows that the Foreign Intelligence  Service has made significant cuts in the number of its stations  abroad. Is the optimization process over? And, in the same  connection, what are your comments on a report by MOSKOVSKIY  KOMSOMOLETS concerning impending deep personnel cuts in the  intelligence service and serious structural changes in the  Foreign Intelligence Service?    [Trubnikov] I want to say one thing. First of all, no  dramatic events are occurring in the intelligence service. No  dramatic cuts are occurring in the intelligence service. Nor  will they. The normal process of retirement and resignation is  occurring, just as in any other state structure. Only one  station was closed in 1993. No targeted cutbacks have been  carried out, nor will they.    As for changes within the intelligence service, they have  occurred, are still occurring and will continue to occur. Some  sections -- due to the fact that we are being given new  assignments -- will be reinforced and assume leadership roles.  Other sections may be cut back.    [Poleshchuk] The information you mention could in principle  have appeared in any other popular newspaper. Would you  characterize it as a classic leak?    [Trubnikov] Everyone has their source of information. If you  believe that source, then by all means go ahead and report it.  But I have become accustomed to repeating and I repeat once  again: anything pertaining to intelligence, if you want to have  authentic, reliable information, can come only from inside the  intelligence service itself. And never in the form of a leak.  Ideally this would mean a legitimately posed question and an  exhaustive answer up to the limits to which intelligence regards  it as essential to reveal itself.    [Poleshchuk] Often journalists, specifically those from our  newspaper, are accused by the authorities of using so-called  "dubious information sources" in our work. I would like to see  the faces of members of the presidential press service or Mr.  Shumeyko's staff if they -- purely hypothetically -- were to  learn the names and the positions of those "dubious sources"  that are providing us with exclusive information. But that is  true, as a matter of fact... I agree that information about  foreign intelligence, like information about any other  intelligence service or any other agency, is best obtained from  an official primary source. But, firstly, not everyone has as  good a press service as you do. Secondly, an overwhelming  majority of our officials were raised on hatred of cunning  journalists and are unwilling to talk to us. Unless, of course,  they get paid good money for it, or if they themselves have a  vital need to do so. Incidentally, of late we have not had any  particular need to seek out "sources." They come to us... And we  know that they are fully competent and well-informed. What are  we supposed to do: refuse to work with them?    [Trubnikov] I can say with absolutely certainty, as I myself  once worked under a journalistic cover: there is no great  difference between a journalist and an intelligence officer when  it comes to getting information. Now, the means and methods that  an intelligence officer can use and the degree to which a  source's reliability are verified and the source studied are a  different matter... In that regard an intelligence officer  stands head and shoulders above a journalist. Because first  there is the process of studying the source. When you do  conclude that a source is reliable, then you can accept  information from that source. Not the other way around.  Intelligence obtains information and makes use of it through  closed channels, without bringing it before the court of public  opinion. Intelligence can make mistakes. But perhaps no one  except the consumer will ever find out. A journalist's mistake  will be public knowledge the next day. He takes a much bigger  risk. I would put it this way: a normal journalist should use  normal information sources.    [Poleshchuk] Good advice, but hard to follow in our  business... Do you personally have enough time and energy to  read newspapers, which, as you are aware, are one of the main  sources of open intelligence information?    [Trubnikov] There is very little time left over for that.    [Poleshchuk] And what do you as a professional see there?    [Trubnikov] Unfortunately, the more I read the more  disillusioned I become by the things I am reading. There is a  great deal of one-day sensationalism, a great deal of half-baked  information, information that does not even answer the questions  of "why?" and "to what end?" People splash something across the  page without the slightest notion whether they have done good or  ill.    I do not envy my Western colleagues, because there is hardly  any point in other countries' intelligence officers looking to  our mass media for information. Much sensation and quite a lot  of unreliable information. Much speculation. But an intelligence  service is used to dealing with facts. And when the press so  rarely provides actual facts it is very difficult for  intelligence to work with it. More likely our press misleads  them and keeps them busy with nonexistent problems.    [Poleshchuk] The Foreign Intelligence Service's operations  are regulated by an appropriate law. Can you tell us whether  that law currently takes into consideration all the nuances in  the operations of such a sensitive organ as foreign  intelligence? Will some passages in the law require revision or  amendment?    [Trubnikov] I am glad that you asked that question. We are  presently discovering that real life is much richer than one  could possibly set forth in any regulating document. And it  seems to me that foreign intelligence is already prepared to ask  our legislators to reconsider some points.    [Poleshchuk] What, specifically?    [Trubnikov] Well, at least the degree to which the law on  military service applies to foreign intelligence. For example, a  person has achieved a certain title and position... He can  easily be dismissed from the army, because younger replacements  are following close on his heels. But how can we take a unique  specialist, say one with unique language knowledge, and dismiss  him simply because he has reached some maximum age?! Most likely  the director of the Foreign Intelligence Service needs to be  given some additional authority and the right to extend the  intelligence service of a unique specialist for several years.  There are also other things that intelligence could recommend as  amendments or additions to the current law.    [Poleshchuk] I have heard that the Foreign Intelligence  Service has established a new administration that will interact  with intelligence services in foreign countries. Is it true that  that administration maintains contacts with the stations of  foreign intelligence services active in Russia?    [Trubnikov] Yes.    [Poleshchuk] Are these direct contacts? Does an agent come  to  you...    [Trubnikov] Yes.    [Poleshchuk] Has that ever been done before?    [Trubnikov] It is a recent phenomenon. Just like the fact  that the heads of some of our stations abroad go to the heads of  local intelligence services. And find things to talk about. The  same thing happens here.    [Poleshchuk] To the man on the street that sounds  incredible...    [Trubnikov] I understand how any interaction with another  intelligence service might sound like treason to the man on the  street. But we regard that interaction as one aspect of our  intelligence efforts. We must get used to the fact that some  things which were inconceivable only two or three years ago are  now possible and are proving their worth. Therefore the  operations of that administration are beneficial to intelligence.    [Poleshchuk] That is most likely one of the most sensitive  administrations, if that is the right way to phrase it...    [Trubnikov] Definitely. Precisely that word "sensitive" is  very appropriate here.    [Poleshchuk] I would have given a lot for the chance to  attend a meeting like that and observe this game...    [Trubnikov] The thing is, there is very little about this  that resembles a game. In this business either you say something  or you say nothing. In contrast to diplomats, whose skill is  being able to say a great deal and yet have said nothing.    [Poleshchuk] But how great the risk is! Suppose you say the  wrong thing, or say too much...    [Trubnikov] Well, that's what common sense is for. And a  clear understanding of who it is that is sitting across the  table from you. In matters like this everything is based on  mutuality. We are not about to bare our souls to a partner who  is not giving us anything.    [Poleshchuk] You have established an economic security  department. Why is it necessary, and with what issues does it  deal?    [Trubnikov] For Russia today the issue of economic security  is, of course, our #1 issue. The anything-goes situation that  exists in our foreign economic relations, the raw materials that  are leaking out, the capital that is fleeing the country -- all  these things have prompted intelligence to address these issues.  We make sure that our foreign partners are not pulling a fast  one on us. Tempting offers and unique contracts are flooding in,  but often we are dealing with con artists. It is foreign  intelligence's job to let state structures know in time that  these are not the people with whom they want to be dealing.    [Poleshchuk] The CIA structures its relations with other  countries on the basis of a so-called "system of concentric  circles." Countries with a place in the "inner circle" enjoy the  greatest trust with regard to access to intelligence  information. Those countries include, for example, England,  Canada and Australia. The CIA reviews countries' positions in  the various "circles" every three years. In your opinion, in  which of those circles does Russia fall today?    [Trubnikov] That's the CIA's business, which circle they put  us in. I am convinced that Russia is the kind of state that  cannot be made to fit in any "circles." In any event, we have  not attempted to make a place for ourselves in any of them. But  it is absolutely clear that we would not be in the closest  "circle."    [Poleshchuk] In late August 1993 IZVESTIYA, citing the  Swedish newspaper SVENSKA DAGBLADET, quoted the head of Sweden's  security police, who said that according to information in his  possession Russia's foreign intelligence service long ago  stopped trying to recruit new agents among Swedish military  personnel or the personnel of state institutions and private  companies. This give him reason to state that Russian foreign  intelligence activity has dropped off in a way not seen since  World War II...    [Trubnikov] Let that be on the conscience of the Swedes and  their counterintelligence service. I think that any smart  intelligence service should make its presence absolutely  invisible. I am not inclined to attempt to dissuade anyone from  believing anything. I can only tell you that nothing unusual is  going on in the Foreign Intelligence Service's work with regard  to any particular country.    [Poleshchuk] A strong response around the world greeted the  Foreign Intelligence Service's open report entitled "The  Prospect of NATO Expansion and Russia's Interests," which was  made public in late November of this year...    [Trubnikov] In any event -- and I say this based on my own  experience and conversations that I have had with our partners  abroad, Europe included -- that report generated interest  because it indicated to our partners in very concentrated form  the necessity of reckoning with Russia's national interests.  That was our main objective.    [Poleshchuk] Will you continue to publish a series of open  Foreign Intelligence Service reports?    [Trubnikov] The series will definitely continue. At this  time  I am not prepared to announce the subject of our next report,  but it is already begging to be published. Anyway, it could  pertain to our economic interests.    [Poleshchuk] How soon might that be?    [Trubnikov] Everything depends on the degree of our  readiness  to express our opinion on a given issue. Information that can  become public knowledge without damaging its source is a very  tricky matter. We could express a very strong opinion on  something tomorrow and thereby put our sources at risk. We are  not going to do that. We are only going to express our opinions  when our sources can be absolutely sure of their safety.    [Poleshchuk] How important is it to ensure a source's  safety?    [Trubnikov] That is the most important issue in any  intelligence service's operations. The reliability of secret  communications and maintenance of the source's cover is the main  thing that guides any source. If he sees that the intelligence  service is not able to keep its secrets, then the source will  quit.    [Poleshchuk] It is no secret that agent recruitment also  involves dirty methods: blackmail, bribery, threats...    [Trubnikov] In the overall picture those methods comprise  only a fairly narrow part of the spectrum of methods and means  utilized by intelligence. Intelligence services prefer to work  with people on an ideological basis. That makes for the most  reliable, high-quality and long-term sources. As for sources  recruited by dirty means, they comprise only a tiny fraction of  the entire agent apparatus.    [Poleshchuk] Last year several Foreign Intelligence Service  officers went over to the other side. The Foreign Intelligence  Service openly acknowledged those cases. This year there has not  been a single report of that nature. Does that mean that there  were no incidents?    [Trubnikov] Yes, that is true. If you are talking about  treason.    [Poleshchuk] That naturally pleases you...    [Trubnikov] That pleases us. But, on the other hand, that  also alarms us. The traitors of 1992 were the end result of  efforts directed against us by Western intelligence services  over a long period of time. These were not people who just  happened to leave. They were mainly agents. These were people  who had been in our ranks and who were recruited a long time  ago. Yet the time chosen to activate them was 1992. They  believed that we were in a very difficult situation, that these  betrayals would make us look bad, and that our intelligence  service could be dealt with easily. Maybe even at the hands of  legislators or the public. These were not incidents, they were a  fully intentional plan to undermine Russian foreign  intelligence. But we survived.    [Poleshchuk] You said that, on the one hand, you are pleased  that there have been no incidents of treason by Foreign  Intelligence Service personnel this year, yet that on the other  hand you find that alarming. Why?    [Trubnikov] It is alarming in the sense that no one has  halted their efforts against Russian intelligence. Therefore our  own security is currently our top concern.</p>

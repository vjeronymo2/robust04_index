This proposal would require installation of a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly, and a new stage one fan shroud. This proposal is prompted by a report of an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which resulted in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which can result in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by February 10, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attn: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;ANE&hyph;04, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299.

Engines without a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly, and a new stage one fan shroud, operate with relatively open stage one fan blade tip clearances. Increased fan rotor vibration occurs when the average tip clearance exceeds the maximum allowable clearance tolerances. This increased vibration increases stresses in the fan blade shank, which leads to cracking and subsequent blade failure. This condition, if not corrected, could result in an uncontained stage one fan blade failure, which can result in an inflight engine shutdown, and damage to the aircraft.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved the technical contents of GE CF6&hyph;50 Service Bulletin (SB) No. 72&hyph;573, Revision 5, dated September 15, 1981, that describes procedures for the installation of the stiffening ring assembly and new stage one fan shroud.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist, or develop, on other engines of this same type design, the proposed AD would require installation of a fan stator case stiffening ring assembly and a new stage one fan shroud, which will result in reduced running clearances, and lower fan blade stresses. The compliance end date of August 31, 1995, ensures timely compliance without forced engine removals based on hardware availability. The actions would be required to be accomplished, in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

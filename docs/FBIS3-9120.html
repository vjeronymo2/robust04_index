			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 18 Mar--Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski  said at a press conference after Friday's meeting with Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak that a team of Solidarity and  government specialists will begin work on 22 March.  Confirmation of this decision by the prime minister is a  precondition for Solidarity suspending the strike.    By the end of next week, the team will prepare "legal  methods  and a decisionmaking process" to facilitate the implementation  of Solidarity's demands. These proposals will then be discussed  at the next government meeting, which will make political  decisions, Krzaklewski explained. He added that this team  should identifiey those decisions that can be implemented later  and controlled by a tripartite commission.    Solidarity expects that the prime minister will confirm  these  decisions during a press conference on Friday. The decision to  continue the strike also depends on a meeting with regional  Solidarity leaders and chairmen of branch secretariats.  Krzaklewski said that this decision will most probably be made  tonight, when, after the prime minister's press conference, the  staff of the National Strike Action Headquarters is to meet.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Asterix birthday celebrations hit by real-life tussle: The infighting in the French companies behind the successful sword-wielding cartoon character Asterix might do well to consider changing his name as he turns thirty-five years old today. Megafrancx would suit the mustachioed, sword-wielding midget well. The once-rebellious cartoon book character has found himself sitting on a goldmine in his native kingdom of Gaul. Celebrations are well in hand for the anniversary of the first edition on 29 October 1959 of Pilote, the French children's magazine in which the village of invincible Gauls resisting their Roman oppressors first appeared, words penned by Albert Goscinny and drawings by Rene Uderzo. 'I'm very happy,' says Mr Uderzo, reflecting on his feelings yesterday. He is also rather surprised, and quite unable to explain the idea's sustained popularity. 'I didn't expect success like this over such a long time at all. It's a mystery.' But not all those involved in creating the Asterix phenomenon will be raising their goblets around the feasting table as they do at the end of each of the books. In real life, unbeknown to millions of fans, a battle is taking place just as vicious as any of the fictional plots. There is no disputing the success of the Asterix bandwagonix. More than 250m copies of the 29 albums have been sold around the world. Editions Albert Rene, which now publishes the books, reported turnover of FFr45m (Pounds 5.4m) last year, while Dargard, the original publisher, still generates almost as much again. There have been six animated Asterix films, with the latest used as the centrepiece for a marketing campaign across Europe by McDonalds. Another is in train, and there are discussions about one starring real actors including Gerard Depardieu as Obelix (who polls show to be even more popular than Asterix). There is even an Asterix theme park on the outskirts of Paris, which has just broken into profits after five years and attracted 1.5m visitors this year. One survey showed that more than half of the French population could spontaneously name Asterix - higher than for either Mickey Mouse or Tintin. Some argue that the success of the books has been to create a series of characters who are uniquely and defiantly French, with stories which work on many different levels with clever wordplays to appeal to adults as well as children. Yet Asterix also appeals in other countries. While more than 94m albums have sold in France, another 82m have been bought by Germans, followed by the British at 19m. Asterix has been printed in 57 languages and dialects, including Latin. The latest interest has come from Slovenia and Croatian companies. 'We work with humourists more than translaters when publishing the books in other languages,' says Mr Claude de Saint Vincent, chairman of Dargaud. He is equally mystified by the obviously contagious effect of the 'magic potion' handed out by the village sorcerer Panoramix. 'If I knew the secret, I would do another one,' he says. 'But it came at a time before TV, videos, computers and video games. There were not so many distractions for readers.' But some of the Asterix magic has now worn off. Mr de Saint Vincent believes the market is now mature, boosted occasionally with the publication of new albums - and perhaps greater penetration in the UK. His company will receive none of the profits from the most recent five books - nor will it from any published in the future. The reason is a bitter dispute which developed between Dargaud, which owned Pilote, and Goscinny and Uderzo. It culminated in a Parisian courtroom, with Uderzo trying to win all the rights to the back titles. He lost on appeal this summer, but retains ownership of the Asterix character and freedom to keep profits from new productions. He has not spoken to Dargaud since, which has had its offers of help in the birthday celebrations ignored. Goscinny, the author, died in 1977 but Uderzo decided to carry on alone, producing both words and drawings. Some readers feel however - though few would dare to say so in public - that the quality of the Asterix books has declined with the end of the old partnership. Uderzo, aged 67, says he has no plans to stop. But his struggles are not confined to the drawing board. In 1979 Uderzo managed to break away from Dargaud to found his own company, Editions Albert Rene. He gave Goscinny's widow 20 per cent of the shares, keeping the rest for himself. She has now also died, and her 26-year old daughter Anne has started legal action against Uderzo, claiming that her family did not receive a fair share of support or profits. 'I am very happy about the success of the character - in the way it was created with my father,' she says.</p>

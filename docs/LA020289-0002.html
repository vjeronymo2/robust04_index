			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTER THAN GRAFT  </P> <P> The implicit deal that had been struck to raise congressional and other top  federal salaries seems to be in some danger of dissolving under a shower of  cold political sweat. Until this week it was expected that the Senate would  vote on and reject the pay raises that had been recommended last year by a  special commission and endorsed by President Ronald Reagan. The House, though,  would delay its vote until after Feb. 8, when the pay increases automatically  are to take effect in the absence of vetoes by both chambers. But now, shaken  by public opposition to the salary increases, a lot of representatives are  having scared second thoughts. It would be too bad if those fears led to the  loss of the pay boosts. Top federal officials deserve increases. And the  American people deserve a Congress that will no longer have an excuse to go on  taking payola from special-interest groups.  </P> <P> Public antipathy to the pay proposal -- 85% oppose it, according to a recent  Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll -- is understandable. The 50% salary increase  would raise congressional pay from $89,500 to $135,000 a year. Cabinet  secretaries, meanwhile, would go to $155,000, Supreme Court justices would be  paid $165,000 ($175,000 for the chief justice), federal district judges would  earn $135,000. This is handsome remuneration, no doubt about it. At $135,000,  members of Congress would be in the top 2% or 3% of all wage earners, making  more than four times the median family income. Americans who look just at those  numbers aren't likely to be impressed by the argument that those who serve in  Congress must bear unusual expenses, including keeping two homes.  </P> <P> What, then, justifies the proposed pay increases? The first thing is equity; in  the last 20 years the real buying power of top federal salaries has fallen by  about 35%. Pay raises to levels that are more realistic and more suitable to  the importance of the work involved are long overdue. Even more pressing in the  case of Congress is the chance -- in fact, the imperative -- to end the scandal  that lets senators and representatives rent themselves out to lobbying and  other interest groups. The so-called honorariums that they collect -- worth $10  million or more a year -- currently let House members get up to $26,000 in  extra income, and senators $35,000. Only the most cynical or naive would  maintain that these payments don't influence legislation and votes.  </P> <P> Once the pay raise took effect, Congress, under the prod of public scrutiny,  would be expected quickly to end this corruption by enacting a ban on outside  income -- not just payments for speeches and appearances but professional fees  and money from directorships as well. In short, or so reform advocates insist,  no more payoffs, no more conflicts of interest, no more legalized corruption.  The chance of getting a more selfless, more honest Congress doesn't come along  every day. The pay raise would put that chance within reach.  </P></p>

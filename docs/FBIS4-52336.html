			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikkei reporters Hiroyuki Maeda, Kenichi </F> Kawahara]    [Text] "Subsidiaries set up for the purpose of tendering  the winning sole bid" are inspiring expectations among financial  institutions facing difficulties with the disposal of bad loans  that "we'll be able to unashamedly place winning bids without  the need to face criticism for concealing losses."    On 11 March the Ministry of Finance [MOF], at its bank  department chief-sponsored "Seminar on Enhancing Liquidity of  Loans," presented detailed plans for use by city bank officials  to facilitate the disposal of real estate used as collateral for  bad loans. The detailed plans involve the disposal of bad loans  through establishment by financial institutions of wholly owned  subsidiaries to specialize in placement of sole bids for  collateralized real estate. According to an attendee at the  seminar, the MOF is expected to approve the first "sole-bidder  subsidiary" as early as May.    Under the MOF plan, this "sole-bidder subsidiary" would use  the sole-bidder system of the courts, hold and administer the  acquired real estate for a specified period and then resell the  property. In addition to enhancing the liquidity of  collateralized real estate, the real estate purchased by the  subsidiary can be redeveloped to prevent a further drop in value  of the collateralized real estate.    The ultimate advantage of establishing a sole-bidder  subsidiary by financial institutions is that any collateral  property placed on auction will be sold. According to a source  at a city bank, "There's a major advantage in being able to  dispose of collateralized real estate on bad loans where claims  are legally complex." Properties purchased by subsidiaries will  be removed from the balance sheets of parent companies and will  result in progress in the disposition of bad loans.    However, it appears that many financial institutions assume  a  cautious posture on the question of actually establishing a  sole-bidder subsidiary, saying, "We will examine the idea  carefully upon issuance of the MOF circular.    An official of a trust bank expresses doubt, saying, "The  process has definite appeal, but disposal through auctions is  too time-consuming." There's also the view that, "if it takes  one or two years to dispose of bad loans which we hope to sell  at an early date, there's the risk of upsetting our plans."    Even if the MOF circular is issued, establishment of  subsidiaries will require a preparatory period and the view is  that subsidiaries will not begin to operate until after summer.  Sources point out that "there is little potential for successful  bids by subsidiaries on property already out for auction, thus  making it impossible to dispose of property in time for the  September midyear accounting reports."    Moreover, the subsidiaries will be allowed to bid for  collateralized real estate of parent banks for a period of only  five years and the subsidiaries will be limited to a lifespan of  10 years.    There's also the problem of limitations in the scope of  activities allowed. In contrast to the MOF plan to approve  activities to facilitate disposal of real property, such as the  purchase of contiguous land, improvement of parcels, and  completion of construction in progress, the Fair Trade  Commission seeks to impose restrictions on the MOF plan in view  of the "need to limit activities of the subsidiaries to clearly  distinguish them from regular real estate businesses."    If the subsidiaries are allowed to redevelop real estate  which they purchased through the sole-bidder process, it would  facilitate the disposal of such properties. If they are not  allowed to redevelop properties, then the result may well be  that "the subsidiaries will not be able to sell properties and  will incur holding costs since they were properties that no one  wanted to begin with."    The question is whether the subsidiaries going to become  major players following the Cooperative Credit Purchasing  Company? The financial institutions are in the process of  considering the MOF-proposed special-purpose company (SPC)  format for the purpose of establishing liquidity in loans on  which interest payments have been eliminated or reduced, but it  appears that all these concepts merely expand the "options" for  bad debt disposal without ensuring any meaningful progress.</p>

There is "great possibility" that a war will break out in  the  Korean peninsula if the U.S. deploys Patriot missiles in South  Korea and the U.S. and South Korea resume the military  exercises, said Kim Kwang-sop, ambassador of the Democratic  People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to Austria.    In a statement published by the AUSTRIAN PRESS AGENCY, Kim  also refuted Western allegations that the DPRK is making  preparations for war.    "The threat is from the South (South Korea), not from the  North (the DPRK)," he said.    The DPRK, which is strong enough to defend itself and  advocates the settlement of conflicts through peaceful means, is  not planning a war, he noted.    The ambassador said the DPRK is capable of making missiles,  but is not engaged in the production of nuclear weapons.    Kim's remarks came amid mounting tension between the DPRK on  the one hand and the U.S. and South Korea on the other over the  issue of nuclear materials in the Korean peninsula.    Earlier this month, the Vienna-based International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) said it still could not prove whether the  DPRK has fissionable nuclear materials after an IAEA team  inspected some nuclear sites in the country.    The IAEA's board of directors, accusing the DPRK of barring  the inspection team from visiting a radioactive chemical  laboratory in Yongbyon, said the agency hopes to send experts to  the DPRK again for further inspection of the nuclear sites.    The DPRK has repeatedly argued its nuclear facilities are  for  peaceful purposes only.    To apply pressure, U.S. President Bill Clinton has ordered  Patriot missiles sent to South Korea. U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher has said he would discuss with South Korean  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu the scheduling of joint U.S.-South  Korean military exercises.    Meanwhile, U.S. State Department Spokesman Michael McCurry  said that "the door is still open" to high-level U.S.-DPRK  talks, but only if the DPRK meets two conditions -- permitting  the inspections and reopening discussions with South Korea about  making the peninsula nuclear-free.    But the DPRK ambassador said that any further IAEA  inspections are conditioned on resumption of high-level  U.S.-DPRK talks.    Commenting on the IAEA's dissatisfaction over the  inspections, Kim said the DPRK had given the IAEA an opportunity  to prove that the country did not possess materials for making  nuclear weapons and that all relevant agreements had been  observed.    Thus, the issues raised by the IAEA are "unnecessary," he  said in the statement.</p>

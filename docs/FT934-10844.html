			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / International Company News: Japanese oil refiners hit by decline in prices REVENUES at Japan's leading oil refiners and distributors were hit by a fall in demand due to the stagnant economy, and a fall in prices. Cosmo Oil, a leading oil wholesaler, reported a 7.3 per cent slide in non-consolidated sales to Y690.9bn (Dollars 6.4bn) for the first six months to September, due to the 3 per cent fall in sales volume. However, the company saw a 19.1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits due to higher profit margins for gasoline and kerosene. A Y1.2bn fall in its financial deficit figure due to repayment of loans, also helped profits. After-tax profits fell 22.5 per cent to Y5.2bn as the previous year's figures were supported by income from land sales. For the full year to March, Cosmo expects continued sluggish demand for oil products, and forecasts a 5.3 per cent fall in sales to Y1,470bn and profits to rise a marginal 0.6 per cent to Y32bn. Nikko Kyodo, a mining and oil refining company which was established last December through the merger of Nippon Mining and Kyodo Oil, saw interim sales fall 8.6 per cent to Y664.2bn due to the fall in oil prices. Pre-tax profits however rose 28 per cent to Y12.3bn, while after-tax profits rose 78 per cent to Y7.2bn. For the full year to March the company expects pre-tax profits of Y34bn on Y1,400bn in sales. After-tax profits are expected to total Y1bn as the company plans to book an extraordinary loss to liquidate Gould, its US unit.</p>

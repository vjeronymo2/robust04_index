			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Antonio Indacochea Alvarez] </F>   [Text] Tingo Maria, 25 Apr -- General Alfredo Rodriguez  Riveros, chief of the Huallaga Front, said the bodies found  yesterday buried in a grave in the Shapingo sector (Moyuna) by  members of the Human Rights Commission of the Democratic  Constituent Congress belong to two Shining Path "commanders" of  a group that operates in this zone. He said this was determined  by the testimony of three repentant Shining Path members who  were under the command of one of them and also from intelligence  information.    Other military chiefs said the dead were known as "Comrade  Mardonio" and "Comrade Abel" of the logistical and military  commands respectively of the so-called 3d Batallion of the  Moena-Moyuno People's Committee.    The body of "Comrade Abel" supposedly belongs to the peasant  Felix Loyola who, according to his wife and relatives, was a  coca grower who had his farm in this sector and was shot by  soldiers when he was leaving the area.    Gen. Rodriguez presumes the bodies belong to some of the six  terrorists killed on 8 April by a militay patrol in a clash in  another sector of Moyuna, about three to four hours by foot into  the jungle. He said all the information will be given to  provincial Prosecutor Carlos Gonzalez Ortiz, who is  investigating this case to obtain more evidence to clarify the  killings.    Regarding the bones found in the Carmen Alto zone (near the  port of Moyuna de Anda), he said that according to preliminary  information, the bones have been there for several years.</p>

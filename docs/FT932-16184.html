			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Jobs: Recruitment - A mysterious matter of life and death / Psychologist's research shows uncanny links between career choice and people's longevity and a lot of readers evidently do - the Jobs column has good news for you. Your chances of living beyond retirement age are high. They are much better than mine as a journalist although, whereas when you go it will most likely be from cancer, in my case the odds are on some external cause such as accidental or deliberate violence, including suicide. My reason for mentioning the point is not gloom occasioned by last week's admission that I'm now within 10 months of retiring from the FT. The stimulus was provided by a fascinating talk at the British Psychological Society's conference the other day by Ben Fletcher of the University of Hertfordshire. In his research into health and employment he has delved deeply into statistics on mortality, and come up with some strange if not uncanny ways in which people's work and their stays on earth are connected. To illustrate, let's return to comparing those of you who are financial managers with me as a journalist. Now of course, being in the better-off tiers of society which typically survive longer than the worse-off, both you and I have a happier outlook than the average for the British population. For instance, if the overall average chance of dying while officially still of working age is taken as 100, my prospect of meeting that sad fate rates at only 87. Yours, however, is a mere 43 - provided you're a male too, that is. Should you also be like me in being married, the statistical record has two messages for our wives. The first is that, although they can both expect to reach a greater age than we do, yours will be apt to outlive mine to much the same degree as you outlast me. Message two is that each of them has a far greater than pure chance probability of dying of the same thing as her husband: yours from cancer, and mine from an accident or the like. In other words, the careers taken up by men are powerfully linked not only with their own lengths of life and causes of death, but also with those of the women who marry them. Or at least that is so if they are British. Since Professor Fletcher has not probed the mortality statistics of other nations, he is unable to say whether or not the same applies in them as well. In Britain, though, he finds that the husband-wife link holds good across all 550 types of work officially listed by the registrar-general. In some of them, the link persists even though the man's prospects change on reaching a particular rank. For example, among public administrators below assistant-secretary level the chances of either them or their better halves dying before retirement age are well under 100. From that rank upwards the chances of the men and their wives alike jump to around 110. What's weirder still is that the connection doesn't hold the other way round, with female bread-winners' typical life prospects being reflected by those of their husbands. If you are a woman financial manager married to a newspaper hack, for instance, then you alas cannot count on the better outlook linked with your own occupation. Your life expectancy will reflect the worse outlook of us journalists. Illegally discriminatory though that may be, Ben Fletcher's studies* indicate that it's the way things are, for the British at any rate. And while there is no point in allowing it to distract us from pressing on with our careers, his research surely faces us with a mystery. After all, even if such links are familiar to and used by the actuarial profession, to know that they exist is not to understand why they should do so. True, it is not the only puzzle underlying our seemingly clear-cut ways of earning our crusts. For a start, how we do skilled let alone innovative things at all is still at best dimly understood. Another puzzle lurks below the use of the term 'motivation' as a purported explanation of variances in people's work. If they do better than the apparent circumstances would lead us to expect, we say their motivation is high; if they do worse, we call it low. But what motivation actually consists of, nobody can be sure. *Work, stress, disease and life expectancy. John Wiley. Pounds 45.50. A few psychologists think it is like tension - until we've built up a certain amount of it, we don't even start moving. But that view is far from accepted. Indeed most shrinks never bother to ask what motivation is, being content with just seeking ways to get creatures to exhibit the supposed effects of the mysterious substance. A further puzzle underlies the use by some recruiters of astrology which in Britain, as distinct from France in particular, is dismissed as a ludicrous way of assessing human ability. There's nevertheless something in it, as witness the research of French psychologist Michel Gauquelin, which the Oxford Companion to the Mind describes as follows: 'Certain professions were chosen - sports champions, actors, scientists - and their birth certificates consulted for the exact time of birth (which is recorded on the Continent though not in England). The subjects were 'famous', to be found in reference books, and their numbers ran into thousands. 'Astrologers believe the rising sign (the sign coming up over the horizon at the moment of birth) and the rising planet are of basic importance in governing a subject's temperament. Gauquelin's analysis seemed to show three other positions were equally important: directly overhead, sinking below the horizon, and directly underfoot - the four quarters of the heavens, as it were. 'The findings were perfectly clear. Sportsmen tended to be born when Mars was in one of these critical positions, actors when Jupiter was there, and scientists and doctors when Saturn was there.' Even so, to this sexagenarian at least, possible influences on birth seem a less pressing issue than what might govern events still ahead. Moreover, while the trends discovered by Gauquelin were too strong to be explained by chance, the statistical links found by Ben Fletcher look to be considerably stronger. What does he think could account for them? While the obvious answer is the varying stress that different jobs impose on their doers, he believes it is the wrong one. Stress is too vague a notion, he says, especially when it is gauged by asking people how far they feel it. Those who say they're overloaded commonly show no ill effects, whereas others who feel stress-free often go under. His theory is that the cause lies in what he calls 'cognitive architecture', by analogy with 'computer architecture'. It might be depicted as the basic 'wiring' which, without our being aware of it, governs our varied ways of thinking and so our career paths. That might at least account for the connections between jobs and the life expectancies of their male doers. As for the husband-wife link, he suspects it may be the product of the historic, if no longer conscionable, belief that women are naturally subordinate. Hence Professor Fletcher is trying to pinpoint the elements of cognitive architecture. If that could be done, he says, people might gain psychological as well as medical means of extending their productive lives. But as he's scarcely likely to do it in time to add much to mine, all I can do is wish him - and everyone else with a realistic hope of profiting - the best of luck.</p>

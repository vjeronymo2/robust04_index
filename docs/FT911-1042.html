			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Saatchi stake reduced VOLUME IN Saatchi &amp; Saatchi expanded as funds controlled by Lord Jacob Rothschild cut their holding in the company. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew placed most of the 75m shares sold by Lord Rothschild and said institutions applied for more shares than were available. The Seaq ticker showed 75m shares changing hands at 19p and another 66m at 19 1/4 p. Traders suggested the difference went at least partly to cover a short position at UBS. Final turnover was 144m and the price eased  1/2 to 19 3/4 p. Lord Rothschild previously held 20 per cent of the Saatchi Euroconvertibles. In the company's rights issue, he opted not to take up the rights after conversion, but instead to underwrite part of the issue at the rights price of 10p a share. After the restructuring of Saatchi, Lord Rothschild held nearly 9 per cent of Saatchi. This stake has now been reduced to around 4 per cent. Rolls-Royce falls Adverse US analysis on Rolls-Royce moved the stock against the market trend yesterday. It closed 3 1/2 down at 163 1/2 p after relatively light turnover of 1.9m shares. In New York, Goldman Sachs analyst Ms Judith L. Comeau lowered her current year profits forecast to Pounds 175m, from Pounds 214m, because of higher research and development (R&amp;D) costs and the lack of recovery in the market for spares. Her views surprised UK analysts, many of whom are beginning to wax more positively over Rolls-Royce. They believe the spares market is showing signs of recovery and that the group's business can support the rise in R&amp;D costs associated with the massive development of the Trent engine. Glaxo recovers Glaxo recovered some of the ground lost in recent days as Kleinwort Benson reiterated its buy recommendation on the stock. Mr Ian White at Kleinwort said the latest independent survey data of doctors showed that the first few months of sales of Glaxo's new asthma drug, Serevent, had broken sales records for a UK drug launch. He estimated annual sales of the drug, currently only approved in the UK, to reach Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m by 1995. Glaxo climbed 15 to close at the day's high of 1114p on good volume of 1.5m. Wellcome rises Wellcome continued last week's strong rise by advancing 25 to 617p. Turnover was high for the stock at 2m. Analysts said there could be good news on the company's Aids treatment Retrovir revealed at an Aids conference next month in Florence, Italy. Trials in the US are indicating that the drug's long-term efficacy - which has been called into question in recent months - is improved when it is mixed with another drug, DDC, made by Swiss-based Roche Holding. Such combination therapy has been pinpointed for some time by bulls of the stock as a means by which the revenue generating life of Retrovir might be extended. Lloyds Abbey down The UBS Phillips &amp; Drew insurance team cited a number of reasons for downgrading its current year profits forecast for Lloyds Abbey Life. The latter's shares came under sustained pressure after the UBS move, closing 7 cheaper at 404p on turnover of 1.3m. Mr Youssef Ziai, life sector specialist at UBS, said he cut his profits estimate by 8.5 per cent to Pounds 357m. He gave three main reasons for the reduction. First, the group was suffering from the same high level of defaults and bad debts at its Bowmaker finance subsidiary that the division had encountered in the last quarter of 1990; and the level of new lending at Bowmaker was down. Second, Abbey Life's new business figures for the current year were running some 10 per cent below those of last year. Third, Mr Ziai said, the recovery in the housing market will be pushed back into 1992 by the rising level of unemployment throughout the UK, and this would adversely effect the group estate agency business. The oil sector was enlivened by suggestions that the long-awaited sale of Elf's 25 per cent stake in Enterprise Oil was about to be undertaken as part of a deal with the UK group involving a joint purchase of Occidental's North Sea oil and gas interests. One of a number of market hints was that Enterprise was about to launch a hefty rights issue to purchase the Elf stake. This would be part of a much bigger swap deal that could also involve Enterprise exchanging a portion of its Nelson oil field for other assets in what is seen by specialists as a tax-efficient move by Enterprise. There was considerable speculation that the Enterprise shares would be bought back at 450p a share, plus a tax credit to allow for advance corporation tax, which would add up to a total price of 600p a share. Analysts said such a deal would remove the overhang of Elf's stake but that a rights issue would inevitably prove unpopular in the short term. Enterprise shares receded 6 to 557p. BP eased marginally to 354p, unmoved by the possibility that it might report its first-ever quarterly deficit tomorrow. 'A first-quarter loss has been in the market since February,' said one analyst. Shell climbed 6 to 532p as First Boston, the US investment bank, upgraded the stock. Allied-Lyons put in one of the better performances of the day among Footsie stocks in response to the confirmation of top management changes. The shares rose 18 to 570p. Printing ink maker Usher Walker jumped 42 to 283p as Mr David Williams, deputy chairman of acquisitive mini-conglomerate Mosaic until last month, took a 10.19 per cent stake in the company. Tate &amp; Lyle rose 6 to 365p as Hoare Govett raised its current year forecast by Pounds 5m to Pounds 232m. With Tate making 60 per cent of its profits in US dollars, the US currency's recent strength will translate into higher sterling profits. Strong interim figures are likely to be reported today and the market is anticipating even larger upgrades than Hoare's. Analysts expect Tate to announce half-time profits of Pounds 92.5m. Booker added 5 at 482p as Nomura issued a buy recommendation which focused on the company's move into food distribution and away from agribusiness since its acquisition of Fitch Lovell and Linfood. United Biscuits dipped 4 to 381p as a broker was reported to have lowered its current year forecast by Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 212m and next year's by Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 242m. BAA put on 8 to 438p following reports it was planning to expand into the US and also that it was attempting to bring Marks and Spencer into Heathrow Airport. Analysts, however, said BAA's US involvement was likely to be small, while it would be at least two years before Marks opened any stores at Heathrow. Brierley Investments advanced 7 to 44p on views that the company's financial position had been secured. It has reduced debt by selling a 30 per cent stake in Mount Charlotte Investments, the UK hotels group, to the Singapore government. Reports that the Office of Fair Trading had confirmed an investigation into the affairs of Eurocopy, and that the company's consumer credit licence could be threatened, lowered shares of the independent photocopier distributor 8 to 88p. A higher dividend distribution combined with a substantially increased net asset valuation compensated for lower annual profits from Ropner. Both classes of shares rose 5, the ordinary closing at 140p and the 'A' at 134p. Smith &amp; Nephew improved 3 1/2 to 127p ahead of tomorrow's first-quarter results. Profits are expected to be lower at around Pounds 27.5m, compared with Pounds 30.7m, and analysts currently hold contrasting views on the stock. Aegis, Europe's biggest media buying group, climbed 20 to 213p after announcing details of a refinancing package including a Pounds 30m placing, at 260p a share, with a US investment house, and the Pounds 23.4m acquisition of the remaining shares in TMD, a UK media buying business. TMD jumped 93 to 340p. The former also owed instalments of Aegis shares to the vendors of Carat, a French media buying business bought last year. Two of these have been paid off early, eliminating a perceived stock overhang. There is one instalment left, due in December 1993 and which may be made in cash.

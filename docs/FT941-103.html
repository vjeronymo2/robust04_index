			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Ferranti receivers agree to sell defence systems to GEC Administrative receivers to Ferranti International have agreed in principle to sell the company's main defence systems businesses to GEC rather than a management buy-out team. Ferranti went into receivership in December after GEC withdrew a 1p a share offer for the company following its due diligence inquiries. The receivers from accountants Arthur Andersen said yesterday that after analysing the indicative bids and 'taking into account a number of important factors' they had decided that GEC was the preferred buyer. GEC is understood to have made a higher bid and the other factors are thought to include its acceptability to the Ministry of Defence. The receivers and GEC expect to conclude negotiations in April. However, Mr Jonathon Wackett, of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which is advising the buy-out team said it was 'still very much in the game'. 'We are now talking to our backers about an increased bid and other ways we could reshape our offer.' The buy-out team is backed by a UK institution and 'a major European defence company', thought to be Thomson of France. The agreement covers Ferranti Defence Systems Integration, which has around 570 employees, and Ferranti Simulation &amp; Training which has a further 540 staff. But the buy-out team is bidding for the whole of Ferranti's systems business, including its civil and satellite operations, which has a turnover of Pounds 130m and 1,750 employees. Mr Geoff Eades, a member of the buy-out team, said: 'We are trying to preserve the greatest part of the systems business as an entity. It is a people business and one of the dangers is that the people start walking away.' GEC is also thought to be negotiating with the receivers over Ferranti's US business and its sonar joint venture with Thomson. The receivers said separate negotiations were continuing with other interested parties over the civil business, based in Wythenshawe near Manchester, and the component making operation, which employs around 515 in Oldham, Lancashire.</p>

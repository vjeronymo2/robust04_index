			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Alija Izetbegovic of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency has sent a letter to EC Chairman  Karolos Papoulias and NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner.    Esteemed gentlemen, in my letter of 5 February, I informed  you about the massacre of civilians that took place that day at  the Sarajevo market. Unfortunately, the statement by the  responsible officials in the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR]  indicates that the revulsion felt by the world and the readiness  for action will again be amortized by a prolonged investigation  as to the origin of the shell [words indistinct], offers for yet  another futile cease-fire, and statements about the necessity of  establishing peace acceptable to both sides, and so on.    I am afraid that the debate will focus on one shell, and  thus  divert the world's attention from the more than 300,000 shells  that have been fired on this city during the 22 months of the  siege. It is not true that over 400 artillery pieces on the  hills around Sarajevo are to serve as the Serb defense against  the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. There are there for blackmail  purposes and to inflict suffering on the civilian population, to  halt the life in the city, and to force us into making  unacceptable concessions to the aggressor.    Of the 9,872 people killed in the shelling of the city, only  164 have been soldiers. Some 1,563 children have been killed  and 278 pregnant women. Some 57,897 civilians have been  wounded, and over 19,000 of those are maimed for live.  Approximately 10,000 apartments and 30,000 places of work have  been destroyed or damaged. The city maternity hospital was set  ablaze with precise and persistent fire, as were the National  Library, the Institute for Oriental Studies, the depot and all  the tramways and city buses. The city hospital has been hit 267  times, and nine doctors and 16 patients have been killed. All  the churches, mosques, and synagogues in the city have suffered  hits and damage. All the Olympic sports facilities have been  destroyed, as have the Assembly and government buildings. There  is not a single building, school, or university building in the  city that has not been hit. Schooling is being conducted in  improvised schoolrooms. All the hotels have been destroyed, and  the Holiday Inn is the only one open, even though it has been  damaged. The UN Protection Force building is a frequent target  for artillery attacks.    Gentlemen, this city has been in hell for over 700 days. It  is time the Serb machine for killing people and destroying  shrines, schools, and hospitals is stopped and removed. I  appeal to you to inform the members of your organizations of the  contents of this letter.    This is said in the letter that President Alija Izetbegovic  sent to Karolos Papoulias and Manfred Woerner.</p>

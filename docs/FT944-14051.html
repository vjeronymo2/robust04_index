			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Blair backs aims of radical proposal for welfare policy The Labour party's social justice commission yesterday sought to distance the party from its 'tax and spend' reputation in welfare policy by setting out a 15-year strategy for reforming the UK's welfare state. Mr Tony Blair, Labour's leader, seized on the long-awaited report of the commission chaired by Sir Gordon Borrie to signal the party's intention to ditch its long-standing commitments to across-the-board increases in social benefits. Backing many of the planks of the report prepared by the commission - an independent group set up by the party two years ago - Mr Blair flatly rejected the emphasis placed by the 'old left' on alleviating poverty by raising benefit levels across the board. Instead he insisted that Labour would craft a manifesto for a second-generation welfare state designed to spur self-improvement rather than increase dependency. Mr Blair's backing for integrating tax and benefits for the elderly to concentrate resources on the poorest, and the possible taxing of the child benefit paid to the affluent, undercut two pledges given by Labour at the 1992 election. Those pledges - to re-establish the link between pensions and child benefit and average earnings - committed Labour to spending an additional Pounds 3.5bn a year on higher benefits. The commission's report proposes to continue the government's policy of raising the basic state pension only in line with prices. A new 'pension guarantee' will ensure higher payments to poorer pensioners on an income-related basis. Speaking at the launch of the report, Mr Blair signalled that it would not be a blueprint for Labour's manifesto. But he indicated that many of its main proposals - on nursery education and on welfare-to-work benefits as well as pensions and child benefits - would help form the basis of Labour's own plans. Sir Gordon, a former director-general of fair trading, presented the report as a strategy of renewal without serious tax implications for middle-income earners. The report proposes a 'maximum tax bill' to limit to 'no more than 50 per cent' the proportion of any individual's total income which could be paid in income tax and national insurance contributions combined. It also proposes a national minimum wage, projects to help lone parents find childcare and wage subsidies to encourage employers to hire long-term unemployed.

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Election 1992: Ready for the worst If last night's polls are right, Mr Neil Kinnock's Labour party is on the way to becoming the undisputed winner on Friday week. A single set of polls in mid-campaign is not, however, conclusive, especially on All Fools day. Yet the election is beginning to run to a pattern, deadly for the Tories. They started with a poor hand and have played it badly. They chose the deepest point of a long recession as voting day and ran a campaign that is the second-worst since Mr Michael Foot's disastrous circus of 1983. On last night's figures, it looks as if only a huge mistake by Labour, or an unpredictable mind-changing event can save them now. We paid-up members of the Hang Parliament party are prepared for the worst. For the one prospect we have all along regarded with about as much foreboding as an overall majority under the control of Mr Neil Kinnock is a renewed overall majority under Mr John Major. Both have done their utmost to bamboozle the electorate. Mr Kinnock pretends that there is such a thing as an egalitarian health system to be had for a mere Pounds 1bn plus a statement of good intentions; Mr Major that pinning name badges on the lapels of civil servants elevates subjects to the status of citizens. The former prevaricates when he presents a manifesto that seems to promise, yet does not guarantee, steadily increasing public expenditure. The latter stretches the boundaries of honest discourse when he talks of annual tax cuts but says he cannot be certain that they will be deliverable every year. Both know that we can afford neither reduced taxation nor additional spending. Mr Kinnock wriggles his way around this by intimating that Labour will stimulate highly unlikely rates of growth; Mr Major does likewise for the Conservatives. I leave aside Mr Paddy Ashdown, for there is no chance of his Liberal Democrats winning any kind of a majority. He is running for the coveted post of elected dictator, but he is certain to come third. That is a blessing. What Hang Parliament supporters dream of is new parties and coalition government. Such a thing is alien to the British parliamentary tradition. That is why, attractive as it may be, genuine electoral reform for the commons is likely to be resisted by both the larger parties, albeit with greater determination by theConservatives than by Labour. It is mere wishful thinking to regard a hung parliament as the inevitable precursor of constitutional reform. Such a parliament would nevertheless be better than one put back to sleep by another overall majority. The House of Commons comes alive when administrations have to trouble themselves to count probable votes for every bill they invent. After 1987 the Tories had a majority of 100-plus. Power went to their heads. They forced the poll tax through. It was nearly emasculated by a backbench revolt. Had there been a hung parliament the attempt might never have been made. Next time it could be different. Absent a Labour landslide, the smaller parties might separate the big two. The assorted Celtic nationalists might account for between 25 and 30 seats; the Liberal Democrats for as many again. The likely performance of Mr Ashdown's candidates is, however, one of the more unpredictable factors in this election campaign. On the bare figures they could lose half a dozen or more of their current total of 22 seats. Our FT poll-of-polls program tracks the moving average of the six most recent polls. The result is weighted by sample size. Six months ago the Liberal Democrats stood at fractionally under 14 per cent; now they are at 18 1/2 per cent. This is an impressive performance for a party that had crumbled barely three years ago, but it is 4 percentage points below the 1987 performance of the then Alliance. Even if you include the most recent polls showing 19 per cent and 20 per cent there are still three points to go. The conventional wisdom has it that simple arithmetic will not accurately predict the number of Liberal Democrat seats. They are adept at hanging on to constituencies where they are already incumbent. They may make some gains, particularly around Devon and Cornwall. If there is a general anti-Tory feeling in the country, tactical voters will favour Mr Ashdown's candidates where they stand the best chance of toppling a sitting Conservative. So they might improve on their present 22. There is a contrary supposition. This is that most of the increase in Liberal Democrat support represents disgruntled Tories registering a protest. There is some evidence for this in recent polls, which show Labour holding steady while the Conservatives fall back and the Liberal Democrats rise. Such ex-Conservative voters may scuttle back home if Labour looks like forming a government. This is what happened in certain key constituencies, including Mr Ashdown's, after 'wobbly Thursday' in 1987. In 1992 Conservatives cannot bank on such a phenomenon. They can only hope that Mr Major's recent return to gutsy street-fighting is working. No, I don't believe it either.</p>

			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Reform politicians lose spirit as old ways die hard in Russia: Yeltsin seems less concerned about the dangers of stoking up inflation Russia's pro-market reformers are under siege and economic change, already a battered concept, is again in doubt. Since last month's election, which saw a surge by ultra-nationalist, communist and communist-inclined parties, the small band of economic radicals around first deputy premier Yegor Gaidar have been fighting to win over President Boris Yeltsin. They have been trying to convince him of one thing: that the parliamentary election results should not mean a change of economic course. To drop reforms before they have been properly tried or even introduced, they argue, would mean to lose everything. But they now fear it has not worked. They are privately preparing for an exit from the political stage. Nothing is yet definite and Mr Yeltsin has in the past surprised everyone with his ability to buck trends and back reform. But they believe the immediate future is bleak. There is ample evidence. Mr Yeltsin, in his pronouncements since the election, has been unclear what he wants. Now he says reform will continue, now he counsels caution. More importantly, he has made decisions that point to a conviction that production must be supported, even if this drives inflation up again. In December inflation was down to around 10 per cent a month, an all-year low. Mr Yeltsin has seen a number of big industrialists and they have all demanded cash. Many, including the giant agricultural equipment maker, Rostelmash, have got it, as has Russia's car industry. The GAZ car plant, whose workers are all temporarily laid off this month, will introduce a new luxury model, the GAZ 3105, within two years. The cash-strapped defence industry has also got some relief. The MiG plant, which has long made Soviet fighters, has produced a prototype MiG110 passenger/cargo aircraft that will go into production in 1998. A new bomber from the Sukhoi plant, the SU-34, will replace the present SU-24 (produced to match the US F-111). Mr Yeltsin has also signed a decree allowing Dollars 500m to be spent on a new parliament - a decision Mr Gaidar criticised, saying it had not come before the government and if it had he would have voted against it. 'All of these decisions point in one direction.' said an economist working for the reformists yesterday. 'It shows he no longer cares for the effect on inflation.' This is largely blamed on the growing power of advisers around him who are much more conservative than his chief of staff, Mr Sergei Filatov. Mr Filatov is linked to Mr Gaidar as both are members of Russia's Choice, the main liberal party. The daily Sevodnya this week ran an apparently well founded report that Mr Filatov has lost a lot of ground after his failure to secure election victory for the reformers. According to the report, Mr Viktor Ilyushin, conservative head of the president's chancellery and an old comrade from Mr Yeltsin's days as Communist Party secretary in Sverdlovsk, now guards access to him and influences his choice of decrees. At the same time, the appointment of ministers and creation of a new programme are the subject of the bitterest struggle behind the scenes. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, has said that the government's size will be cut to just four deputy premiers (the inner cabinet) and 30 ministers. But the decree that would appoint Mr Gaidar as one of two first deputy premiers, with Mr Oleg Soskovets as the other, has twice gone to Mr Yeltsin for signature and twice been blocked. The fate of the other two main reformers - Anatoly Chubais and Boris Fyodorov - hangs in the balance. Both are said to be wary of taking part in the new government, especially if Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, head of the Central Bank, remains in his post. Mr Gerashchenko, who has long advocated re-creating an economic union, appears to have scored a notable victory earlier this week. It came when the prime ministers and central bankers of Russia and Belarus signed an agreement in principle for an economic union. The pact would give Belarus the right to use the Russian rouble and to determine the amount of cash and credits it would get. This would in effect make Minsk, the Belarus capital, a second centre for the emission of roubles and give its ailing industries a credit lifeline to the Russian central bank. This type of agreement - likely to be extended to the Central Asian republic of Tajikistan - is seen by Russian conservatives as a model for preserving industrial and economic links, gravely damaged over the past two years. It is also seen as a model for extending the power of the Russian state, one of the main themes in the successful electoral campaigns of the nationalists and communists. For the reformers, it is a return to the politics of hyperinflation. They thought they had stemmed hyperinflation last year when credits to other former Soviet republics were choked off and inflation fell as a result. Finally, the new parliament is likely to be dominated by nationalist and communist forces and their allies. The pro-market parties - Russia's Choice, the Yabloko group and the Party of Unity and Accord - have failed to agree with each other. Mr Gaidar said on Thursday that Russia's Choice had pulled out of talks aimed at agreeing on a Speaker for the lower house, or State Duma, because the nationalists and communists were now controlling the agenda in talks with Mr Chernomyrdin. Russia this weekend celebrates the orthodox Christmas, and all official business is suspended. Next week sees the convention of the new parliament, and the visit to Moscow of President Bill Clinton. It is still possible a reform course will again be taken. But the reformers say it is more likely that reform will fall victim to popular discontent, conservative pressure and their own inability to unite.</p>

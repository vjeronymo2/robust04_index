			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Call to shake up 'costly' quangos Quangos cost too much and should be reformed drastically, a group of constitutional experts says today. Quangos - or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations - account for nearly a third of all public expenditure, costing Pounds 46.6bn in 1992-93 (Pounds 48.2bn at current prices), according to a report by Charter 88 Trust, which seeks to promote constitutional reform. This is a rise of 24 per cent in real terms since 1979, when 'Mrs Thatcher came to power pledged to reduce their numbers and cost'. The report identifies 5,521 executive quangos. 'This shows that in area after area of public life, elected government is being replaced by appointive government,' it says. People who are appointed rather than elected run some 6,700 bodies of all kinds at national and local level, with the most rapid growth occurring locally, the report says. It adds: 'This hastily erected apparatus of appointive government lacks the essential democratic underpinnings of scrutiny, openness and accountability.' The report - sponsored by the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust - criticises the Citizen's Charter for providing weak and inadequate mechanisms of democratic control and openness. Quangos are under the control of a new 'business-dominated elite' which could be as large as 73,000 appointees. The report calls for a review of which non-elected bodies should become elected bodies, the introduction of a statutory 'right to know', new legal standards of consultation, open decision-making and equitable conduct for all public bodies; and a review of ministerial patronage. Extra-Governmental Organisations and their Accountability. Charter 88 Trust, Exmouth House, 3-11 Pine Street, London EC1R OJH. Pounds 9.95.</p>

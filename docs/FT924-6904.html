			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / France and Taiwan cement Dollars 2.6bn jet fighter contract TAIWAN has obtained a long-awaited agreement from France to buy 60 Mirage 2000-5 multi-role jet fighter aircraft for Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn), according to newspaper and radio reports from Taipei. Neither the Paris government nor Dassault, the French aerospace group which makes the Mirage fighter, would comment on the deal, the latest stage in the island's attempts to boost its defences against a military build-up in China and as such likely to spark a diplomatic row between Beijing and Paris. But they did not deny the report. It comes two months after a US decision to sell up to 150 F-16 jet fighters to Taiwan for Dollars 5.8bn, seen as a factor in resolving French hesitation. If confirmed, this will be the second big recent French defence sale to Taiwan, after last year's Dollars 4.8bn sale of 16 frigates, never officially announced. The Mirage sale would also include 1,500 missiles, bringing the total contract value to Dollars 3.8bn, said Taiwanese press reports. China has objected strongly, causing Paris to pause before jeopardising already strained relations with a powerful ally. The Beijing Foreign Ministry yesterday warned that China was 'firmly against' such a project. However, China took no significant steps against France over the frigate sale, beyond voicing loud objections, and has countenanced recent defence equipment sales to Taiwan from Germany, Belgium and Italy. France is China's second largest aid donor after Japan, with FFr30bn (Pounds 3.7bn) of credits and cheap loans outstanding and an important investor there. The deal would be a godsend to Dassault, which has not had a single military export order for four years and badly needs new business to give a lift to its dwindling profits. Dassault, 46 per cent state-owned, makes nearly three-quarters of its sales to the French military. Like many of its counterparts, the French Defence Ministry has been forced to curb spending, even to the extent of trimming orders for the Rafale, Dassault's future jet fighter due for delivery from 1997. The Taiwan deal would be a boon to the French defence industry generally, at a time when export sales, at FFr34.2bn last year, are stagnating. Other potential beneficiaries are Thomson-CSF, the defence electronics group which supplies radar for the Mirage 2000-5, and Matra, supplier of air-to-air missiles.</p>

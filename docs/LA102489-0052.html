He said  officers had demanded several times that Hedgpeth drop his weapon, a  semiautomatic pistol.  </P> <P> Officers had gone to the apartment building after receiving reports that  Rodriguez had fired a shot in the air and was knocking on apartment doors.  </P> <P> Rodriguez was taken to UCI Medical Center where Hedgpeth said he was in stable  condition Monday.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE FREES PAIR ON KIDNAPING COUNTS;  </P> <P> CULTS: A COUPLE WERE CHARGED WITH ABDUCTING THEIR DAUGHTER IN AN UNSUCCESSFUL  ATTEMPT TO 'DEPROGRAM' HER.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge Friday freed a Santa Cruz couple accused of kidnaping  and falsely imprisoning their adult daughter in an attempt to "deprogram" her  religious beliefs.  </P> <P> Judge David B. Moon Jr. dismissed all charges against Earle and Dorothy Brown,  both 58. They had been charged with illegally abducting their daughter, Ginger,  in an unsuccessful attempt to get her to disavow her allegiance to a group  known as Great Among the Nations.  </P> <P> Moon also dismissed charges against another Brown daughter, Holly, 25, and two  other co-defendants, deprogrammer Clifford Daniels, 35, of Los Angeles, and  Hank Erler, 23, of Escondido for their roles in the case.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Moon's jury had acquitted some of the defendants on lesser  charges, but on Thursday jurors told Moon that they were hopelessly deadlocked  on the kidnaping charges against the elder Browns, their daughter and the  deprogrammer.  </P> <P> The San Diego County district attorney's office charged that Ginger Brown, 22  at the time, had been abducted from an Encinitas parking lot and held against  her will. Ginger Brown was freed five days later, returned to her group and  served as the prosecution's star witness against her own parents and the  others.  </P> <P> The 17-member Coronado-based Great Among the Nations describes itself as a  fundamental Christian Bible study and evangelism ministry. Parents of current  and former members have called it a cult whose members are insidiously  influenced to finance the comfortable life style of its leader, Benjamin  Altschul.  </P> <P> The defendants had not denied their actions, but claimed that they were baited  to kidnap Ginger Brown so she and her leader could sue them for monetary  damages to finance their group.  </P> <P> On Friday -- after Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Rempel said he was ready to retry  the defendants on the hung counts and to continue his prosecution of them on  several yet untried charges of conspiracy -- Moon ruled instead that further  prosecution would be fruitless.  </P> <P> "Perhaps a jury might reach a unanimous not-guilty verdict," Moon said, "but  this judge isn't going to let the people's courtroom, of which we have precious  few, be used to titillate the public's fascination with unusual religious  groups. We have other pressing business to transact in our trial courts."  </P> <P> Earle Brown said afterward that he is still "really concerned about Ginger and  her well-being -- and for other parents with children in this situation."  </P> <P> Ginger Brown, meanwhile, has filed a $2.5-million lawsuit against her parents  and the others involved in the deprogramming attempt.  </P></p>

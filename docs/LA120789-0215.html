			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TIPS ON HOW TO LIGHT UP YOUR LIFE -- SAFELY  </P> <P> Strings of lights can work wonders for those decorating their homes for the  holidays, but they can also be dangerous if not used properly, cautions  Kathleen Cha, Orange County Fire Department spokeswoman.  </P> <P> "But if you've decorated wisely and thought of precautions beforehand, that  will help ensure your safety," Cha says. She offered a checklist for holiday  lighting safety:  </P> <P> * Make sure strings of lights are UL listed. That means they have passed  certain safety tests at Underwriters Laboratories.  </P> <P> * Do not use lights labeled for indoor use outdoors and vice versa. For outdoor  use, make sure lights are labeled "weatherproof."  </P> <P> * When installing exterior strings of lights, never nail or tack through the  wiring. Special brackets are available that can be used to secure the lights.  Install these first, then the lights.  </P> <P> * Check old and new lights for frayed wiring, broken plugs and loose bulb  sockets. Discard strings of lights with any of these conditions because a short  could occur and cause a fire.  </P> <P> * If several lights on a string aren't working, it could be an indication of a  loose connection and it may be time to discard that string before a short  occurs.  </P> <P> * Use extension cords sparingly and do not plug in more than three strings of  lights per single extension cord.  </P> <P> * A grounded outlet strip with an on-and-off switch (available in hardware  stores) is safer than extension cords when you have to plug several strings of  lights into one socket. The grounded strip is set up to redirect current and  avoid circuit overload. And the switch makes it easy to turn lights on and off.  </P> <P> * Bubbling lights are an attraction to children, who may grab them, break them  and drink the fluid. Make sure this type of light is out of the reach of small  children.  </P> <P> * Despite what you might think, even mini-lights generate heat. The more lights  used on a Christmas tree, the faster it will dry out. If a tree becomes very  dry, it may be a good idea to leave lights turned off.  </P> <P> * Never leave holiday lights on when you go to bed or leave the house. There is  a danger that overheating or an electrical short could cause a fire.  </P> <P> * When placing lights on a fresh tree, position bulbs so they are not touching  branches or pine needles. Plastic strips (the kind used to fasten garden plants  to stakes) or pipe cleaners can be used to fasten the cord to the tree. Just  make sure these fasteners are located on the insulated cord, away from the  light itself.  </P> <P> * Never use lights on a metallic tree. A faulty string of lights could cause  the tree to become charged with electricity and create a danger of  electrocution.  </P></p>

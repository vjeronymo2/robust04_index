			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Societies set for long legal battle Two building societies face the prospect of a long legal battle with the Investors Compensation Scheme over damages for investors in home income plans. The scheme confirmed yesterday that it had started legal proceedings against the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and West Bromwich building societies over the plans, which involved money raised by mortgages on investors' houses being invested in bonds. Many home income plan investors have lost money in recent years as a result of fluctuating interest rates and investment returns, and falling house prices. The plans have, in effect, been banned by City regulators. C &amp; G and West Bromwich provided mortgages for the plans. But the writs issued at the High Court late on Friday allege that the societies, in conjunction with the now-defunct financial advisers who recommended the plans, 'devised, operated and marketed' the scheme - an allegation the societies are expected to strongly deny. Writs have also been issued against two firms of solicitors involved in the plans. An early warning that the scheme was likely to take legal action came this month when the organisation rescinded a compensation agreement worth Pounds 545,000 which was struck with the C&amp;G two years ago. The scheme, which offers a rescue fund for private clients of failed authorised investment groups, argued that new information suggested the building society's contribution was insufficient. The scheme said it would pursue the legal proceedings it had started. It may be a year before the case comes to court. So far the ICS has paid Pounds 12m of compensation to 900 clients of financial advisers Fisher Prew-Smith and Pounds 5.5m to 242 clients of advisers Aylesbury Associates.</p>

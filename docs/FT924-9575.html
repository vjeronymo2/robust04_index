			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / International Company News: Komatsu's earnings cut in building slowdown THE slowing of private construction orders and reductions in capital spending by Japanese manufacturers were blamed by Komatsu, the maker of construction machinery, for a 40.9 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y12bn (Dollars 98m) for the first half to the end of September. Sales during the period were down 13.9 per cent to Y259.7bn, with sales of construction equipment down 13.6 per cent to Y200.6bn and those of industrial machinery down 31.9 per cent to Y28.8bn. The figures reflect weak demand from the car and electrical goods industries. Komatsu said the outlook for the rest of this year and next was clouded by 'the lagging recovery in private sector equipment investment and by political and economic uncertainties at home and abroad'. But the company is confident the government's emergency economic package, announced in August, will lead to increased construction equipment orders for public projects, while a 'relatively mild' recovery is expected in the US and Europe. Overseas sales of its construction equipment fell 12.1 per cent, while those of industrial machinery were down 28.5 per cent during the first half. The fall in industrial machinery demand is a setback for the company's plans to broaden machinery production and reduce reliance on the construction market. Komatsu was weakened by the fall in stock prices as the value of its holdings fell from Y349.8bn last September to Y226.8bn this September.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T plans 15,000 job cuts American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecoms group, is to cut 14,000-15,000 jobs, signalling the growing competitive pressures in the market for long-distance telephone services in the US. The job cuts, out of a total of 96,500, are intended to save the company Dollars 900m a year, shoring up the profitability of its long-distance services. Although AT&amp;T's call volumes rose by 5 per cent last year, its telephone services revenue grew by less than 1 per cent, to Dollars 39.9bn. This was due to the increased use of discounts and special promotions to attract business, the company said. US long-distance rivals MCI and Sprint recorded revenue increases of 13 per cent and 7 per cent respectively last year. Some 8,000 managers will lose their jobs in the cuts, which will take place over the next two years. Most individuals to go will be notified by the end of March. AT&amp;T said the costs of the job cuts were covered by a Dollars 1.3bn charge included in its results for the last quarter of 1993. In addition to the job cuts announced yesterday, around 3,500 telephone operators are to lose their jobs by the end of this year under plans announced previously. Despite the low revenue growth, AT&amp;T improved its profit margin from telephone services last year by two percentage points, to 38 per cent, as it cut costs by Dollars 550m.</p>

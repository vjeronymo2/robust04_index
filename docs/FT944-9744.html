			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Economic Diary: Other economic news Monday: The strength of UK producer prices was the main worry cited by the Bank of England in its latest inflation report. Rising raw material prices have increased industry's costs. October's annual rise in producer input prices, announced today, is expected to be 7 per cent. But costs have yet to be fully reflected in output prices (where the annual rise is forecast at 2.5 per cent), let alone in consumer prices. Wednesday: As well as inflation figures, Britain's Department of Employment will release statistics on unemployment and average earnings. The steady drop in unemployment, of 20,000-25,000 a month, is expected to have continued in October, while September's underlying annual average earnings growth is forecast to be stable at 3.75 per cent. The minutes of the September 26 meeting between Kenneth Clarke, chancellor of the exchequer and Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England will be published. Rates have been left unchanged since their meeting. Thursday: Retail sales figures for October will be one of the last indicators of consumer confidence before the November 29 Budget.</p>

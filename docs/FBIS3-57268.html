At present, 35 Kurdish refugees, nine of them children and  11  women, stay at Harku prison near Tallinn, Kravets said. None of  them holds any document, let alone visas, Kravets said while  adding they had arrived in Estonia illegally from either Russia  or Latvia, but Estonia could not send them back without  documents.    The number of Kurdish refugees was the biggest in September  (63), Kravets said. Those who had money and connections left  for Sweden while others just sit and wait, he added.    No solution is near, Kravets said. Finland has hinted at  accepting them, but no formal promises have been made, Kravets  said.    In addition to above-mentioned refugees who had arrived in  Estonia earlier, three Kurds had been detained at the Port of  Tallinn on an attempt to board a ship to Sweden, Kravets said.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Zaire PM suspends national conference MR Nguza Karl-i-Bond, Zaire's prime minister, has ordered the pro-opposition national political conference to be suspended, leading to renewed fears of street protests in the capital, Kinshasa, agencies report. The conference is supposed to chart an end to 27 years of autocratic rule by President Mobutu Sese Seko. In a speech on state radio and television on Sunday, Mr Nguza said that the conference, dominated by opponents of President Mobutu Sese Seko, was contributing to violence in the central African country. Mr Nguza said he decided on the suspension after consultations with President Mobutu. The Belgian government has strongly condemned the conference's suspension. Mr Mark Eyskens, the country's foreign minister, said yesterday that the move was 'in flagrant contradiction with the guarantees given to the Belgian government' during two recent high-level visits. Mr Eyskens said that Mr Nguza, during a visit to Belgium, the former colonial power, had given 'guarantees on the continuation of the democratisation process.' Opposition supporters yesterday set up barricades in several districts of Kinshasa. The city remained tense but calm. Public transport stayed off the road. Schools and offices were closed for fear of recurrence of violence similar to the the army-led looting which killed 250 people and wrecked several Zairean cities last September. The conference has been suspended for much of the time since it opened in August, partly because of the September riots and partly over procedural rows. It had resumed sessions last Friday, despite a boycott by more than 500 delegates loyal to President Mobutu and a cut-off of government funds. Supporting his decision to suspend the conference, Mr Nguza said the conference had made two decisions which he deemed unconstitutional: calling for removal of a magistrate checking delegates' credentials, and demanding that conference delegates check out of expensive hotels to cut costs. Mr Nguza also cited a recent case in which the defence ministry said eight people were killed in a battle between partisans of the prime minister, from the southern Shaba region, and supporters of main opposition leader Etienne Tshisekedi, from Kasai. The opposition denies any such incident occurred and blamed the report on government efforts to portray the conference as inflaming racial hatred.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Microsoft fires shot in PC systems battle MICROSOFT said yesterday it would launch a new version of its widely-used Windows personal computer program next month and expects to sell 1m copies within 30 days. The announcement appears designed to pre-empt International Business Machines' expected introduction, later this month, of a competing operating system for personal computers. The former partners are gearing up for a marketing battle. Microsoft will for the first time use television advertising to promote Windows. IBM is also planning a publicity blitz. Price competition is also expected to be fierce, with Microsoft offering a Windows upgrade package to current users for Dollars 50. At issue is control over the direction of personal computer software. Windows provides personal computer users with a graphical interface, similar to the Apple Macintosh, replacing typed commands with a 'point and click' method of selecting applications and functions. Windows works in conjunction with Microsoft DOS, the operating system used on about 90 per cent of personal computers. The new update to Windows, called Windows 3.1, includes enhancements that make it faster, easier to use and more robust than previous versions, Microsoft said. More than 9m copies of Windows 3.0, the current version, have sold since its introduction in June 1990. Shipments of Windows 3.1 will coincide with IBM's introduction of OS/2 , a competing personal computer operating system. Originally, Microsoft and IBM co-operated in the development of OS/2, but parted ways after a dispute over the direction of future personal computer operating system software. IBM chose to promote OS/2 as a replacement for Microsoft's DOS and Windows. Microsoft has focused on enhancing Windows. IBM aims to break Microsoft's domination of the market with OS/2.</p>

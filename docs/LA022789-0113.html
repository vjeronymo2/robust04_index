			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> POLICE KILL PIT BULL IN WEST HILLS  </P> <P> A police sergeant shot and killed a pit bull Sunday that severely mauled a  German shepherd in a West Hills area home, then charged at officers. A woman  who was not identified called police about 6 p.m. when the pit bull apparently  wandered into her Deer Lick Drive home through an open door, according to Los  Angeles police. When Officer John Futrell and Sgt. Bob Rebhan arrived, the dog  ran from the house and charged at Futrell. Before the dog could attack the  officer, Rebhan shot it to death with a shotgun. Police believe the dog was  wild and lived in the hills behind the Deer Lick Drive neighborhood. The German  shepherd was in critical condition at an animal hospital.  </P></p>

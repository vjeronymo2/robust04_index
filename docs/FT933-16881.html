			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Abdullah brothers resign Starmin executive positions THE ABDULLAH brothers, who built up the Evered aggregates company through acquisitions in the 1980s, yesterday resigned their executive positions at Starmin, the quarry products company where they bought control in 1989. Starmin also announced it had delayed publishing its accounts for last year because the board was reviewing its accounting policies. As a result, the previously recommended final dividend of 0.2p would not now be paid. The company's shares fell 2p to 2 3/4 p. Mr Osman Abdullah resigned as chief executive and has been replaced, on an acting basis, by Mr Owen Rout, former chairman. Lord Parkinson, the former Tory cabinet minister who joined the company in April last year, has been appointed chairman immediately. Mr Raschid Abdullah will remain on the board as a non-executive director. Mr Rout refused to comment on the details of the review before it was completed. But he said it covered technical matters. 'There is no indication there is anything of a fraudulent, malpractise nature involved,' he said. The review is understood to have been prompted by concern among some directors and Samuel Montague, the company's financial advisers, about Starmin's acquisition accounting policy. In a statement yesterday, the company said its review would cover 'the disclosure and accounting treatment of various acquisitions and disposals' made in 1991 and 1992. Previously announced results for these years, which showed a Pounds 1.9m pre-tax profit in 1991 and a loss of Pounds 8.1m last year, may have to be restated. The Abdullahs bought into Starmin, then called SI Group, in 1989 following their departure from Evered, now called Evered Bardon. The brothers launched a string of acquisitions, including eight in 1991, largely financed by three rights issues within two years. But despite an initial rally, Starmin's shares performed poorly and were overshadowed by concern about the company's acquisition strategy and mounting worries about recession in the construction industry.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help lift Sedgwick to Pounds 78.7m Sedgwick, the international insurance broker, yesterday announced increased pre-tax profits of Pounds 78.7m in the first nine months of 1994, buoyed by acquisitions and good growth in its international retail broking business. Pre-tax profits for the first nine months of 1993 were restated at Pounds 66.1m. Earnings per share increased from 8.8p to 9.1p. Total brokerage and fees rose to Pounds 663.3m in the first nine months, against Pounds 551.2m. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, an underlying increase of 1 per cent in brokerage and fees was matched by a underlying increase of 1 per cent in expenses. Mr Sax Riley, chief executive, said underlying growth in retail brokerage and fees had been maintained at an annual rate of 5 per cent or more in North America, Europe and the Asia/Pacific regions. However, overcapacity in the London insurance market and competition from overseas had curbed the performance of Sedgwick Payne, the group's specialist insurance operation. Brokerage and fees at Sedgwick Payne showed only a modest increase to Pounds 134.2m (Pounds 133.9m) in the first nine months. Mr Riley said Sedgwick's attempts to broaden the range of consultancy services it can offer and reduce the proportion of commission-based income were on course. Sedgwick Noble Lowndes, including the employee benefits consultancy the group acquired last year, reported underlying pre-tax profits of Pounds 14m in the first nine months. The group's results were broadly in line with expectations and Sedgwick's shares closed unchanged at 147p. Pre-tax profits in the UK increased to Pounds 37.5m (Pounds 30.1m). Continental Europe also saw an increase to Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 7.5m). There was a slight dip in US profits to Pounds 28.3m (Pounds 29.5m).</p>

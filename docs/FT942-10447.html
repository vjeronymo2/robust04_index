			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: Winterthur lifted by non-life business Winterthur, the Swiss insurance group, has reported a 31.3 per cent jump in 1993 consolidated net income to SFr324.4m (Dollars 231.7m), due to vigorous growth in non-life business and substantial profits on investments. The directors are recommending a 14 per cent rise in the dividend to SFr16 a share. Consolidated gross premiums rose 5.6 per cent to SFr16.4bn in spite of the appreciation of the Swiss franc. Pre-tax profit soared 29.5 per cent to SFr511.3m. In the non-life business, gross premiums grew by 8 per cent and pre-tax profit jumped 30.3 per cent to SFr346.1m. Premiums in the life business advanced only 1.6 per cent, due to the recession and exchange rate effects, but the pre-tax profit surged 27.8 per cent to SFr165.2m, due to an 'excellent financial result' and an improved expense ratio. Swiss Life, a leading Swiss life insurer, said its consolidated surplus income in 1993 rose 1.4 per cent to SFr1.4bn. Earned premiums were up 10.4 per cent to SFr9.3bn and investment income advanced 15.2 per cent to SFr4.2bn. Swiss Life is a co-operative joint stock company and by statute must use its surplus income to improve or reduce the cost of insurance cover. The directors have agreed to raise the dividend on the quoted participation certificates to SFr7 from SFr6.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO MATTER WHO WINS, AMERICA CAN HELP;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: SUNDAY'S VOTE WILL BE HISTORIC, BUT THE ECONOMIC DISASTER WON'T  CHANGE. ONE REAL NEED IS SPEEDY NORMALIZATION OF U.S. RELATIONS WITH THE  VICTOR.  </P> <P> Sunday's election is of historic importance for the future of Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Whether opposition candidate Violeta Chamorro is elected or President Daniel  Ortega reconfirmed, the new government will enjoy the legitimacy conferred by  the vote and by international recognition.  </P> <P> The winner, however, will face two central problems: lingering civil conflict  and economic chaos. Neither the Sandinistas nor the United Nicaraguan  Opposition (UNO) has exhibited the vision necessary to successfully resolve  these problems.  </P> <P> Nicaragua's economy has been reduced to subsistance levels. Exports have  dropped to 20% of 1978 levels, unemployment has reached 30% of the working-age  population and inflation is unmeasurable. These indicators are a formidable  source of political dissatisfaction. But the opposition's message has been lost  in symbolism and it has not been able to to develop an appealing electoral  platform. Its campaign has suffered from divisions and a lack of leadership and  organizational capacity.  </P> <P> During the campaign, UNO has resembled the opposition in South Korea during its  last election, in which divisions in the opposition facilitated the victory of  the governing party. Persistent factionalism in the opposition is making it  probable that Ortega will be reconfirmed, but not because Nicaraguans are  better off after 10 years of revolution or because Sandinism is the most  popular movement.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, dissatisfaction and the search for an alternative have turned out  large crowds for opposition rallies, united in the chant "This time they go."  The spontaneous support of the people seems less the result of the appeal of  UNO's campaign and electoral program than a referendum against Sandinista rule.  If economic issues and the urgency for change carry the election, Chamorro  could win. If nationalism and party organization are the key, Ortega benefits.  </P> <P> Ortega's primary goal is to remain in power. The Sandinista's ideological  project has stalled, and the foreign subsidies that financed their  revolutionary experiments are no longer forthcoming. If he is defeated,  invalidating the election is not a realistic option. Such an act could easily  engender a crisis similar to those that ended the regimes of Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> Beginning the task of reconstruction will require a national accord. If UNO  wins, its 14 constituent parties must form a coherent coalition without  interference from the United States. If the Sandinista front wins, it cannot  continue to treat the opposition as a means of legitimizing its power or  presume that it has been handed a mandate to continue promoting Sandinista  political projects.  </P> <P> My country is exhausted by conflict, and international expectations awakened by  the revolution against Anastasio Somoza in 1979 have been frittered away.  Nicaragua needs political openness, a climate of confidence, management skills  and foreign assistance.  </P> <P> During the long campaign, the Bush Administration acts like an accountant,  letting others take the risks while being content with recording profits and  losses.  </P> <P> Its policy has been to hope for a UNO victory, which would be a cheap solution  to the Nicaragua problem. Now, if the opposition does not win, what are the  alternatives for U.S. policy? Continuation of the war is not a real  possibility, despite the fact that several thousand resistance combatants are  inside Nicaragua. No country in the region is willing to risk getting involved,  given the unreliability of U.S. policy. And given the United States' new  relationship to the Soviet Union, there is simply no political will to re-start  the conflict.  </P> <P> Regardless of who wins this election, the United States has the possibility of  entering a new phase of relations with Nicaragua. Normalization is inevitable.  </P> <P> U.S. policy must be clearly defined to avoid polarization of domestic debate  and enhance the democratic process in Nicaragua. Resolving the trade embargo  would help economic recovery, and providing economic aid for the safe return  and relocation of Nicaraguans would help national reconciliation.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration's foreign policy has been one of impeccable pragmatism.  In the case of Nicaragua, its reluctance to define its policy seems the result  of internal political calculations. Until now, the silence of the  Administration has been justified for reasons of political prudence. Tomorrow  that silence may be a lost opportunity.  </P></p>

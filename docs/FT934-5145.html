			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Gilts rally at PSBR forecast UK gilts rallied sharply on Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget, cheered by news that next year's public sector borrowing requirement will be Pounds 38bn, well below the initial forecast of Pounds 44bn. 'Overall, it's a very, very good Budget for the market,' said Mr Ifty Islam, gilts analyst at Merrill Lynch, who said that the cuts in public-sector spending were particularly encouraging. Gilts jumped by a point during the Budget speech with the long gilt future going on to hit a record high. The December contract rallied from 115 25/32 just before the speech through its previous high of 116 1/4 . In after-hours trading it reached a high of 116 29/32 . It is expected to continue its rally today. 'The gilt market loves it,' said Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist with Midland Global Markets. 'Clarke's done what people wanted - and significantly more.' The Bank of England yesterday announced another Pounds 3bn of 6.75 per cent gilts due 2004 to be auctioned next Wednesday.</p>

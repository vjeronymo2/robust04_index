			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES: SANTA MONICA  </P> <P> Old Master Landscapes: On small, thick pieces of unframed wood, Joan Nelson  paints glorious landscape fragments that look as though they were snipped out  of the backgrounds of Old Master paintings. Dark bumps of trees cluster below a  perfect azure sky, ferny treetops are silhouetted at dusk, a soft yellow light  penetrates a deep brown thicket.  </P> <P> Graced with the delicacy, luminosity and gently abraded surfaces of their  sources, these tiny images in oil are simultaneously old and new.  </P> <P> Nelson quotes the differing visions and terrains of Renaissance and Baroque  painters from the lowlands, France and Italy so pristinely that they conjure up  a great swell of nostalgia for eras when landscape signified no less than an  earthly revelation of divine presence. Yet, without depending on strategies of  "appropriation," the young California artist's approach is squarely up-to-date.  By condensing the painterly vision of nature into such small and distinctive  formats, Nelson replenishes the genre with the sense of delight that repeated  viewings and museum-sore feet may have worn thin. (Michael Kohn Gallery, 920  Colorado Ave., to April 8.) CATHY CURTIS  </P></p>

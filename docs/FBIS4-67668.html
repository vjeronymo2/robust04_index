			<p>BFN     [Text] Lhokseumawe, KOMPAS-- A cholera epidemic which broke  out in Sawang District, North Aceh (39 km west of Lhokseumawe)  over the last two days has claimed six victims. Another 20  cholera victims are currently receiving treatment at the local  health center. The communicable disease which occurred in the  district was reported to have spread to the interior region.  Prior to this, three children died of the disease in Simpang  Kramat.    The North Aceh Health Department chief, Dr. T. Marwan Nusri,  clarified to KOMPAS on 10 Mar that the six victims died in  Sawang after contracting the disease. They were Syaribanun  (50), Aisyah (45), Maneh (40), Abidin (65), Maryam (65), and  Hasan (65).    Four of the victims died in their homes while the other two  died at the health center in Sawang. All of the victims were  from the interior region, which is far away from the health  center.    It was understood that Dr. Marwan had personally visited the  affected Sawang district on Wednesday 9 March. At the same time,  he had distributed medication and taken water samples from  hundreds of wells around the district. He suspected that the  well water was contaminated by the virus. Marwan said: " The  cases which occurred in Sawang were considered as extraordinary."    He said that a temporary test conducted indicated that the  water from a river was unfit for consumption.</p>

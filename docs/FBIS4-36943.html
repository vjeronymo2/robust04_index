			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 15 Jun (INA)--The Autonomous Region in  Iraqi Kurdistan is witnessing fierce battles, chaos, and lack of  security under the alleged protection provided by the 30-state  alliance and the support of the Iranian regime and some regional  and international quarters.    In a report published today, AL-JUMHURIYAH quoted Kurdish  citizens as saying that after the two-week bloody battles, the  groups of Mas'ud Barzani control the areas of Banjwin and Qal'at  Dizah. Iranian helicopters participated in these battles in  accordance with an agreement Barzani concluded with the  so-called Islamic Movement in Iraqi Kurdistan and the so-called  Hizballah Party Shur Shkanri Kurd [name as transliterated] led  by Adham Barzani and Shaykh Muhammad Khalid, son-in-law of  Mas'ud Barzani.    The newspaper said that in these clashes and liquidation  operations 65 people of Talabani's group and 11 armed men of  Barzani's group were killed, in addition to the hundreds who  were injured on both sides. The heavy fighting in Banjwin and  Qal'at Dizah forced citizens to escape the shells that  haphazardly fell on their houses.    The newspaper added that the so-called Democratic Party of  Kurdistan, which controls these two areas, issued a stern  warning to fleeing citizens that their houses will be demolished  and property confiscated if they do not return to their homes  and bow to the orders of his group.    AL-JUMHURIYAH said it has information that a few days ago  Iranian helicopters raided the area of Qahlajulan, where the  headquarters and residence of agent Jalal Talabani are located.  These helicopters also raided Banjwin, Qal'at Dizah, and the  villages of Banqahlah and Ramaw, which are controlled by  Talabani's group.    A huge demonstration was staged from Salah-al-Din University  a few days ago in which thousands of students participated to  protest the crimes of the war of liquidation in which innocent  people are victimized by the hate and vengeance of the Jalal  Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani groups, whose statements show their  inability to reach an understanding.</p>

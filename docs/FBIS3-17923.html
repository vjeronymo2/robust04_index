Elections can be regarded as  valid, if 25 per cent of electors took part in them, but still  the activity of the population can hardly be described as high,  although it is a little higher than during the previous stages  of the electoral campaign.    In eight regions the voter turnout was more than 40 per  cent.  The figure was 63 per cent in the Ust-Ordynsky Autonomous  District of Buryatia, which was the peak of activity. The  population of two other autonomous districts also showed high  activity: The representative bodies of power were fully formed  in the Taymyr Peninsula and in the Evenk Autonomous District.    Activity was the lowest in the Samara and Magadan regions --  23 and 27 per cent respectively. Local dumas were not formed  there.</p>

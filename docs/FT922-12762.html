			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / International Company News: Banc One buys Arizona bank in Dollars 1.2bn stock deal BANC ONE, the Ohio-based commercial banking group that has been aggressively expanding through takeovers, yesterday announced the acquisition of Valley National Bank of Arizona in a stock deal worth Dollars 1.2bn. The acquisition of Valley National will increase Banc One's assets by Dollars 11bn and make the Ohio institution the dominant bank in the Arizona market. This, in turn, will place Banc One in direct competition in the state with the Bank of America. The acquisition, the third by Banc One in the past four months, caused Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating service, to place about Dollars 921m of the bank's debt on credit-watch for a possible downgrade. S&amp;P's concern was mainly about asset quality problems at Valley National. Banc One said it would seek to 'work through the concerns raised by Standard &amp; Poor's'. Banking analysts have generally been less troubled because Banc One is considered an extremely well-run, super-regional institution with strong earnings and a 7.7 per cent common equity-to-assets ratio. Since the start of 1991 Banc One has made 11 acquisitions, including the Dollars 782m purchase last month of Team Bancshares, the sixth largest bank in Texas. While the US banking system has been licking its wounds as a result of heavy commercial property loan losses, Banc One has more than doubled its assets over the past 15 months, from Dollars 30bn to Dollars 72bn. With yesterday's deal, the bank holding company will control 57 separate banks with 1,296 branches in 11 states. Banc One is thus well on its way to becoming one of the most national of US retail banking groups. Last year Banc One out-performed the US industry with a 25 per cent increase in net profits, to Dollars 529.5m. Its success has been based on conservative lending policies and a focus on lucrative business areas in and near the midwest. Among the bank's other acquisitions last year were First Illinois, together with banks in Indiana, Kentucky and Colorado. Wall Street marked Banc One's share price Dollars 1 1/2 lower yesterday, to Dollars 45 5/8 at close of trading.</p>

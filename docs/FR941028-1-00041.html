			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> What guidance, if any, should the Department provide to clarify this provision, particularly in the context of overall school reform envisioned by schoolwide programs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Standards and Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 1111, each State must develop or adopt challenging content standards and student performance standards that will be used by the State, its LEAs, and its schools to carry out Part A programs. These standards must include challenging content standards in academic subjects that specify what children are expected to know and be able to do, contain coherent and rigorous content, and encourage the teaching of advanced skills. The standards must also include challenging student performance standards that are aligned with the State's content standards, describe two levels of high performance_proficient and advanced_to determine how well children are mastering the State's content standards, and describe a third level of performance_partially proficient_to provide complete information about the progress of lower-performing children toward achieving the proficient and advanced levels of performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Each State must also develop or adopt a set of high-quality assessments, including assessments in at least mathematics and reading or language arts, that will be used as the primary means of determining the yearly performance of each Title I LEA and school in enabling children served under Part A and each State and local operating agency under Part C to meet the State's student performance standards. Among other things, these assessments must be the same assessments used to measure the performance of all children if the State measures the performance of all children, be aligned with the State's content and performance standards, be used for purposes for which they are valid and reliable, and assess progress in the academic subjects in which the State has adopted content and performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a State has content and performance standards and assessments for all students developed under the Goals 2000: Educate America Act or another process, the State must use those standards and assessments, modified if necessary, to meet these requirements. If a State has not adopted State content and performance standards or assessments for all students, the State must develop standards and assessments for students served under Part A and, where feasible, Part C (according to section 1304(c)(5)) in subjects determined by the State, but including at least mathematics and reading or language arts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Under section 1111(b)(1), States are not required to submit their content and performance standards to the Secretary. However, a State must demonstrate in its State plan that it has developed challenging content and performance standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What guidance, if any, should the Department provide to clarify what information a State must submit to enable the Secretary to evaluate this portion of the State plan?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Under section 1111(b)(7), a State that does not yet have the required assessments may propose to use a transitional set of yearly Statewide assessments that will measure the performance of complex skills and challenging subject matter. For any year during which a State uses transitional assessments, the State must devise a procedure for identifying LEAs and schools in need of improvement that relies on accurate information about the educational progress of each Title I LEA and school.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What guidance, if any, should the Department clarify the provisions governing transitional assessments?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What guidance, if any, should the Department provide to promote high quality assessment systems?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Under section 1111(b)(3), a State's assessments must be administered at some time during grades 3&hyph;5, grades 6&hyph;9, and grades 10&hyph;12. Under section 1116(c)(1)(B)(ii), a targeted assistance school (i.e., one that is not operating a schoolwide program) may be reviewed for accountability purposes on the progress of those students that have been or are served under Part A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What guidance, if any, is necessary to address accountability provisions for Title I schools that do not serve the grade levels covered by the State's assessments or for schools in which Title I services are not provided at those grade levels?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 1111 requires that States use challenging standards and high-quality assessments in examining the effectiveness of the Part A program at the school, LEA, and State levels. For the MEP, section 1304(c)(5) requires that the effectiveness of State programs and their local projects will be assessed, where feasible, using the same approaches and standards that will be used to assess the performance of students, schools, and LEAs under Part A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What guidance, if any, should the Department provide on how to assess the effectiveness of State Migrant Education programs, their local projects, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LEAs under Part A, that serve children who move across State lines?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Section 1111(b)(2) requires that a State plan demonstrate what constitutes ``adequate yearly progress'' of Title I LEAs and schools toward enabling children to meet the State's performance standards. The statute further specifies that States must define ``adequate yearly progress,'' consistent with guidelines established by the Secretary, that results in continuous and substantial yearly improvement of each LEA and school sufficient to achieve the goal of all children served under Part A meeting the State's proficient and advanced levels of performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What guidelines should the Secretary establish? Should the guidelines be contained in regulations or in nonregulatory guidance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Under section 1111(b)(3)(I), a State's set of student assessments must ``enable results to be disaggregated'' within each State, LEA, and school for several categories of children. Likewise, under section 1114(b)(2)(A)(v), a schoolwide program plan must provide ``for the collection of data on the achievement and assessment results of students'' disaggregated by the same categories. However, a schoolwide program must publicly report disaggregated data only if statistically sound. Finally, section 1116(a)(4) requires an LEA to publicize the results of its annual review of schools served under Part A in individual school performance profiles that include statistically sound disaggregated results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What clarification, if any, should the Department provide on the various provisions in Part A concerning disaggregation of data?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Given the requirement of section 1111(b)(3)(E) that assessments involve multiple measures of student performance, what guidance, if any, should the Department provide to help clarify how schools, LEAs, and SEAs review results to determine whether adequate progress is being made?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26865 Filed 10&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4000&hyph;01&hyph;P <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

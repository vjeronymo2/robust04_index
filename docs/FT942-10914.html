			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Arts: Good times are coming - Off the Wall After years spent rattling the collection tins, in less than nine months the arts, to say nothing of sport and charities, will be enjoying the extraordinary experience of being pelted with cash. By January the National Lottery should be on stream, with good causes receiving around a quarter of its takings, and already the cautious estimates made by Peter Brooke, the heritage secretary, are being increased. With over 20m people viewing the televised Saturday night jackpot ceremonies, the thinking is that instead of the arts sharing Pounds 70m a year the sum could well be over Pounds 100m. Each month the lottery department at the Arts Council will be asking the council to approve cheques totalling around Pounds 10m for dozens of arts organisations around the UK. Jeremy Newton, from Eastern Arts, has been chosen as lottery director and Peter Gummer is to be chairman of the National Lottery Advisory Board. Newton anticipates that the awards will fall into two categories: lots of small sums, from Pounds 1,000 to Pounds 50,000, going to help rebuild a village concert hall, or an inner city video workshop; and Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 10m donations, perhaps announced each quarter, for a regional theatre renovation or an opera house back stage re-vamp. The money must go on capital projects, and the recipient arts organisation must rustle up some matching funding, perhaps only 25 per cent of the total if it is a priority project, but up to 75 per cent for a less essential facelift. No one can doubt that the arts scene in the UK will be totally transformed. But who will actually fund the performances taking place in these smartened venues? The company operating the lottery is likely to become very profitable and will be under pressure to give back some of the excess by sponsoring arts events. If Richard Bransons's syndicate wins, all the surplus will be re-invested. All in all it sounds too good to be true. Surely there must be a catch?                            *      *      * The City of London is finally embracing the arts with enthusiasm. Its Pounds 30m a year budget means that it is actually the third biggest patron of the arts in the UK (after the Arts Council and the BBC) but fears of crass comments by philistine members of the corporation has meant that it has played down its largesse in the past. Not any more. This week it announced that it was putting up Pounds 950,000 over the next four years to give the annual City of London Festival much needed impact. Richard Hickox has been appointed artistic director and he starts next year with a major themed festival, 'Purcell and his successors'. The City's money must be matched by sponsors, but since sponsors have contributed Pounds 1m between them over the past four rather tame years, this is not causing many sleepless nights.                            *      *      * David Puttnam is the natural successor to Lord Attenborough as the advocate and conscience of the British film industry. Taking time off from pointing out to the government how even minimal support could work wonders for the hard pressed British film industry (Ireland is now awash with film crews after introducing a marginal tax incentive), Puttnam this week came out as a supporter of a common sense approach to censorship. He has expressed his approval of the new law on video nasties. But he was careful to distinguish the evil of violence from less reprehensible sex and bad language. Indeed, he revealed, he had to tack on an extra scene for the American version of his first great success Chariots of Fire just to add in the word 'shit'. Without it, the film would have qualified for a family audience certificate, and been characterised as a Disney type production. One swear word meant it needed parental guidance, making it a serious movie, and led to an Oscar.</p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Mortgage lenders raise cost of loans Two of the UK's largest mortgage lenders - Nationwide Building Society and Abbey National - responded to the base rate rise with increases in their variable home loan rates. Many other lenders signalled they would be announcing rises shortly. As they did so, a range of organisations and associations, including estate agents, housebuilders and lenders themselves, expressed anxiety that the increase would damage the uncertain recovery in the housing market. Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest mortgage lender, said an increase in its rates was 'almost inevitable'. It plans to make an announcement within the week. But Woolwich Building Society, the UK's third largest, said the base rate increase should not result in an increase in its mortgage and investment rates. Mr Peter Robinson, Woolwich managing director, described the rises from other lenders as 'a regrettable knee jerk reaction'. Mr Adrian Coles, director-general of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said that at the very least the interest rate rise put back any recovery in the housing market until next year. However, individual organisations within the council, which represents banks, societies and other lenders, were divided about how the rise would affect the housing market. Mr Brian Davis, chief executive of Nationwide, the UK's second - largest society, which raised its basic variable rate by 0.4 per cent, said that as the increase was expected at some point, he hoped it would not have too much impact. At Abbey National, which announced a 0.35 per cent rise in its standard variable rate, Mr Charles Toner, managing director of the group's retail division, similarly sought to play down the effect of the rise. But Halifax said the rate rise would certainly damage confidence, and other lenders said the timing - at the start of the important autumn sales period - was particularly unfortunate. This gloomier view was reflected by Ocea, an organisation representing 26 of the largest corporate estate agency chains. Meanwhile, shares of house builders who had reported a rise in in new house sales in August fell yesterday. Barratt fell 14p to 197, Beazer Homes fell 6p to 139p while Wilson Bowden shares dropped 11p to 397p.</p>

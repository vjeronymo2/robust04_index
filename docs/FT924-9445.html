			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / US Election (World reaction): Old Soviet bloc will demand attention - Washington will not be allowed to forget former communist adversaries THE Cold War ended during President Bush's watch. But with hyper-inflation, economic dislocation and ethnic conflicts now stalking Russia and other former Soviet republics, and central Europe worried about the spread of ethnic conflicts from Yugoslavia, the region is likely to intrude on the priorities of President Clinton. A central question for east Europeans is how far and how fast Mr Clinton will withdraw US troops from Nato, an alliance which leaders of the new post-communist democracies see as an essential element in their own security. Unable to secure a firm timetable for their entry into the EC and denied a formal extension of the Nato umbrella beyond the German border, the states of central Europe in particular see a continuing US military and political presence as a long-term reassurance against possible unpredictable upheavals in the former Soviet Union which could de-stabilise their fragile democracies. In military terms the risks from Russia are seen as minimal even though Russia and Ukraine still have by far the biggest armies on the continent. Soviet troops have withdrawn from Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland and are leaving their bases in former east Germany. But, as the current slowdown in troop withdrawals from the Baltic states indicates, the Russian military could in future resume a more active role. Of greater immediate concern is the rising tide of economic refugees and evidence from Yugoslavia that without direct US political and military involvement the European Nato countries lack the will to tackle the potential ethnic conflicts throughout the area. The danger is that eastern Europe will expect too much from a US which is home to millions of ethnic Poles, Slovaks, Ukrainians and others, and still represents, despite decades of Cold war propaganda, the promised land for millions or ordinary people and a model for governments. The longing for a strong US role in eastern Europe is also present in the economic sphere where US investment, especially by multinational companies, is regarded as doubly valuable. President Walesa of Poland has described US investment as equivalent to having US divisions on Polish soil. Russia too sees a special relationship with the US as crucial. Having been bankrupted by military competition with the US, Russia looks to its former opponent for help in converting military industries to civilian use and restoring order and profit to its farms and oil and gas industries. Russian President Boris Yeltsin was among the first to congratulate Mr Clinton, adding that he hoped the new administration would 'actively support' Russian reforms.</p>

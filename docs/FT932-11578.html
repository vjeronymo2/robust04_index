			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Peace plan may be rejected, warn Bosnian Serbs: Karadzic expects hard struggle in assembly BOSNIAN SERB hardliners yesterday warned that it was far from certain their self-styled parliament would ratify a Bosnian peace agreement, signed under great pressure by their leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, in Athens on Sunday. The fate of the plan, brokered by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the United Nations and European Community mediators, now depends on the outcome of a meeting of the assembly in the Bosnian Serbs' headquarters at Pale, near Sarajevo, tomorrow. Both Lord Owen and President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who played key roles during the hastily convened summit of the Bosnian warring factions in persuading Mr Karadzic to sign the agreement, have expressed confidence that the Bosnian Serb assembly would finally endorse it. Mr Milosevic has even indicated that he would go to Pale to address the assembly. But Mr Karadzic, who has announced that he will resign if the parliament rejects the peace plan for a third time, said yesterday he expected a hard struggle to persuade the parliament to back it. Under the plan, Bosnia would be divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces, largely on ethnic lines, and the Bosnian Serbs would have to give up more than one-third of the territory they now occupy. Even more discouraging were the remarks at the weekend of Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Bosnian Serb assembly, who said Mr Karadzic's signature did not in any way mean actual acceptance of the agreement. 'I believe it must be reworked and cannot be accepted in its present form,' he said. Meanwhile, Nato's offer to take on the peace-keeping task on behalf of the UN, which is already overstretched by its commitments around the world, received a boost yesterday when the White House announced it was prepared to contribute ground troops to such an operation. Nato military experts have estimated that implementing the Vance-Owen peace plan will require at least an extra 60,000 troops, of which the US would be likely to contribute at least a third. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Tory chairman of the House of Commons select committee on defence, said Britain could possibly provide some 10,000 peace-keeping troops. At the same time, the US has made it clear it wants the international community to keep up the pressure on Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs - including the preparation of military options - in case the Bosnian Serbs do not honour the peace agreement. A statement to this effect was issued after five hours of talks in Britain on Sunday between Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, Mr John Major, prime minister, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary. The statement said the US and UK would continue to develop 'a common position with our partners and allies on stronger measures to be taken if the Serbs fail to implement the peace settlement. Several options are under consideration, including military steps'. However, no reference was made to well-publicised British reservations about the desirability of military action. Mr Christopher yesterday met the foreign ministers of Spain and Greece on the second day of a mission aimed at building a consensus among western allies on the need to take military measures if the Bosnian Serbs do not implement the peace plan. He later flew to Paris and was due to visit Nato headquarters in Brussels. In the US, NBC television yesterday reported that US special forces troops were already in Bosnia, gathering intelligence and selecting potential targets for air attacks.

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Observer: Economists' hall of fame How should the Treasury go about picking the members of its new economic panel to improve economic forecasting? The FT has just helpfully drawn up a fame-ranking of economists in the UK which might help the Great George Street mandarins. It is based on the number of articles in heavier, as distinct from tabloid, newspapers, in which a particular dismal scientist is mentioned. Each name is counted only once per article. By that yardstick, Britain's best known economist over the 12 months to mid-October is Gavyn Davies of Goldman Sachs, with 161 mentions. The top 10 also includes Tim Congdon, Patrick Minford, Bill Martin and Peter Warburton  - all members of the 'Liverpool Six' group who've long said the Treasury was over-optimistic about predicting recovery  - plus another vehement opponent of government policies in Neil Mackinnon of Citibank. Three of the four remaining top-tenners are Roger Bootle of Greenwell Montagu, Gerard Lyons of DKB and Peter Spencer of Kleinwort Benson. The other is Adam Smith who's unlikely to be asked to join the panel committee on account of having been dead for 202 years. Fame, however, is not apparently a reliable gauge of quality. For, in several cases, very few mentions were scored by people highly placed in last week's FT ranking of economists for the accuracy of their projections. The leader by that criterion, Paul Turnbull of Smith New Court, came only 37th in the fame league. And the third most accurate, Keith Wade of Schroders, surely deserves better than 46th place in the celebrity list with only a single mention. But there is consolation for the Treasury's chief economic adviser Alan Budd, who has the final say on membership of the panel. Even though his forecasts have not been the best, he performs creditably in the latest test, coming in at number 15.</p>

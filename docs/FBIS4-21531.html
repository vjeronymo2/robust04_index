			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 24 Mar (XINHUA) -- On the floor of the  Conference on Disarmament in Geneva today, Hou Zhitong, head of  the Chinese delegation, reiterated the Chinese Government's  stand and views on nuclear disarmament, nuclear test ban, and  other issues.    Hou Zhitong pointed out: China has never shirked its  responsibility for promoting nuclear disarmament. China has  always stood for the complete prohibition and thorough  destruction of nuclear weapons. Since the first day when it came  into possession of nuclear weapons, the Chinese Government has  solemnly declared to the world its commitment of not being the  first to use nuclear weapons at any time or under any  circumstances. It has also undertaken not to use nuclear  weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-free zones.    He said: In order to promote the process of nuclear  disarmament and realize the goal of preventing nuclear war, the  Chinese Government has recently taken further initiatives. On  December 23 last year, the Chinese Government formally proposed  to the United States, the Russian Federation, and other nuclear  weapon states that negotiations be started among the five  nuclear weapon states to conclude a "Treaty on the Non-First-Use  of Nuclear Weapons." In early March this year, China again  urged the four other nuclear states to give a positive response  to China's initiative, and asked them to send delegations for  talks in Beijing. It is the view of the Chinese Government that  under the present international situation, the condition is ripe  for the five nuclear weapon states to negotiate and conclude  such an international treaty. The Chinese Government believes  the conclusion of this treaty will significantly reduce the risk  of nuclear war and provide security to the five nuclear weapon  states, especially the small and medium-sized ones among them.  It will also improve mutual trust and contribute to the  prevention of nuclear proliferation. Such a treaty will also  play an important role in realizing a comprehensive nuclear test  ban and promoting nuclear disarmament.    Hou Zhitong expressed the hope that countries concerned will  respond positively to China's initiative and start negotiations  with a view to concluding a "Treaty on the Non-First-Use of  Nuclear Weapons" as soon as possible. After that, they should  go one step further by negotiating and concluding an  international treaty on not using or threatening to use nuclear  weapons against non-nuclear weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free  zones, so as to make a decisive contribution to freeing mankind  from the threat of nuclear war.    On the issue of a nuclear test moratorium, Hou Zhitong said:  China has always exercised utmost restraint on nuclear testing  and the number of the nuclear tests it has conducted is  extremely limited. China has the lowest number of nuclear tests  among all nuclear powers. China believes that an early  conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty [CTBT] will  contribute to the realization of the objective of complete  prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. In  view of the above-mentioned considerations, the Chinese  Government issued a statement on 5 October last year in support  of an early conclusion of a CTBT, saying it will join other  countries in the negotiations in an effort to conclude such a  treaty no later than 1996.    Hou Zhitong pointed out: It is our opinion that an  appropriate solution of the issue of security guarantees to the  signatory states ought to be one of the tasks in the CTBT  negotiation. The treaty should contain provisions for the  signatory states with nuclear weapons to undertake not to use or  threaten to use nuclear weapons against signatory states which  do not possess nuclear weapons. At the same time, it should  also provide for the signatory states with nuclear weapons to  undertake not to be the first to use nuclear weapons against  each other. With all nuclear weapon states undertaking the  above-mentioned obligations, it will add to the substance of the  CTBT, further the treaty's universality, and constitute a major  contribution to international peace and security.</p>

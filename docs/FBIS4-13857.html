			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 23, IRNA -- A morning daily here  Saturday [23 April] commented on the "existing spiraling"  inflation in the country and said that there would be no social  justice with a runaway inflation.    Referring to the fact that the uncontrolled inflation in  Iran  was a serious concern for both government and the people,  `KAYHAN INTERNATIONAL' said in its editorial that the officials  are aware that nothing could weaken or erode the achievements of  the Islamic revolution like a runaway inflation.    The damaging aspects of inflation could never be  underestimated, the paper said, adding that, although material  progress was not promised, social justice was, and at the heart  of social justice lies an equitable distribution of resources  and income.    Referring to the measures taken by the government to control  inflation the paper said that more time was required before they  could produce results.    It added that two points should be taken into consideration  if remedy was desired: First, the country's economic problems  "are partially political," secondly, irrespective of the changes  in government policies, the desired economic performance would  not be realized unless Iran's plans on privatization and joint  venture investments have not been materialized.</p>

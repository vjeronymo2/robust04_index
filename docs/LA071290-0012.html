			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRASH, DISCOVERY OF BODY TIE UP FREEWAY  </P> <P> Traffic was disrupted on the Golden State Freeway in Pacoima Wednesday morning  by a three-car crash and the coincidental discovery of a body from an unrelated  accident.  </P> <P> The body of an unidentified Latino woman, age 25 to 30, was discovered in brush  beside the southbound lanes at 9:20 a.m. by a Caltrans worker inspecting a  guardrail bent by a one-car accident Tuesday night.  </P> <P> Police investigating that accident found no driver and had the auto towed, said  California Highway Patrol spokesman Dave Padgett.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of dense brush and the body was lying underneath," Padgett said.  He said the woman may have been ejected when the car hit a guardrail.  </P> <P> CHP officers blocked the Osborne Street on-ramp to the southbound lanes to  investigate. Shortly afterward, a unrelated accident occurred in the northbound  lanes when a vehicle rear-ended another, went out of control and collided with  a third vehicle.  </P> <P> Officers described the injuries in the second accident as minor.  </P></p>

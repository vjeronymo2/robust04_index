			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / UN abandons current ceasefire effort The United Nations yesterday abandoned efforts to start new ceasefire talks among the leaders of Bosnia's warring communities, after a four-day government boycott, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. The Moslem-led Bosnian government had refused to return to the negotiating table in Geneva, in protest against the Serb failure to comply with the 3km UN exclusion zone around Gorazde, the south-eastern Moslem enclave. UN officials yesterday said the bulk of the Serb militia had withdrawn from the zone set up by the UN in April. Also, President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia called for a 100km exclusion zone with its centre in the heart of the country. He told US senators visiting Sarajevo that he would propose the idea to the peace talks in Geneva, in order to create a 'free Bosnia'.</p>

			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUT OF SYNC WITH HONESTY;  </P> <P> CANNED POP MUSIC AT A CONCERT? AT LEAST WARN THE TICKET BUYER  </P> <P> Lip-syncing at a live concert? Canned music? Madonna, say it isn't so! Fans  dish out plenty for a pair of tickets to see their favorites perform live --  not to watch an entertainer mouth the words or sing along to a recorded beat.  </P> <P> Few artists own up to this imitation of life.  </P> <P> But, according to music critics and industry publications, lip-sync  perpetrators include Milli Vanilli, New Kids on the Block, Paula Abdul, Janet  Jackson and Madonna (she is said to "lip sync" at least one song in her current  tour, "Blond Ambition").  </P> <P> We think there ought to be a law. Fortunately, several are in the works.  Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Norwalk) plans to introduce in January a  truth-in-advertising bill that would require public disclosure by artists who  use prerecorded music in concerts. The measure would also require warnings in  radio and newspaper ads promoting artists who use recorded music. Similar  legislation is pending in New York and New Jersey. A disclaimer is only fair.  </P> <P> Some promoters defend such technical sleight of hand. They say fans don't  complain. But if fans really wanted to see lip-syncing they could stay home and  watch music videos and save themselves a bundle. If they wanted to hear  recorded music, they could buy the CD or turn on the radio. Concerts billed as  "live" should be just that -- live.  </P> <P> Maybe we're naive to expect straight-dealing from the concert promotion  business. And maybe some concert-goers don't care if they pay to hear a tape.  But those who buy a "live" concert ticket ought to at least know what they're  buying. Then the consumer can decide whether to beware or be there.  </P></p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Simon finds 'green' profits elusive in a recession - The engineering group's decision last month to axe its environmental arm FOUR YEARS after first touting itself as an environmental stock, a label which lifted its shares to a 40 per cent premium to its sector at one stage, Simon Engineering has decided the grass perhaps is greener elsewhere. Last month the company announced it was putting its main environmental businesses up for sale. These include Simon's waste water treatment business, which makes sewage and industrial effluent treatment equipment, with annual sales of Pounds 65m, and its environmental consultancy business, with sales of Pounds 35m. Several international groups, believed to include SAUR of France and Waste Management of the US, have shown interest. Simon hopes Barings, its advisers, can finalise the disposal before preliminary results are announced in March. The money raised, perhaps as much as Pounds 50m, will be invested in its three remaining core businesses of access equipment, industrial services and process engineering. The announcement, which accompanied news that pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds 6.05m in the six months to June 30, led to a further fall in Simon's shares. They stood last night at 138p, only a few pence above a 12-year low set on Wednesday, and down from a peak of 410p in July 1990. The City felt it had been misled and that Simon's decision to go 'ex-green' suggested it was unsure of its own direction. One analyst, who did not want to be named, said Simon had become a 'corporate magpie'. 'They seem to pick things up, get bored with them, then fly on to something else. It's a valid question to ask if they really know what they are doing,' he said. Institutional shareholders, who include Confederation Life, the Prudential and BAT, were more understanding and said the City was partly to blame. 'The City helped make this into a green stock and pushed it to ludicrous levels. It is partly their fault the company is not what they thought it was,' one large shareholder said. Simon's own view of the disposal lies in its recent history. Under the management since 1988 of Mr Roy Roberts, former chairman of Dowty, and Mr Brian Kemp, chief executive since 1989, Simon has been restructured from a sleepy industrial holding company. Business areas were cut from 16 to four and exports became a priority. In 1990 the company raised Pounds 46m through a rights issue. The money was used on acquisitions and expansion of the four core businesses. Simon Access, which makes powered access equipment such as truck-mounted platforms, made acquisitions in the US and Europe. Industrial services was expanded with last year's takeover of Robertson, a geological consultant. About Pounds 25m was spent developing the environmental division, through smaller takeovers such as Hydro-Search. Mr Kemp said the four-pronged strategy had been scuppered by recession. 'We said at the rights issue we could afford to maintain those four on the back of our increasing earnings. But since then our earnings have halved and the whole economic background is a good deal more pessimistic,' he said. The axe fell on the environmental arm because customer spending and new environmental legislation did not come as quickly as Simon expected. Mr Kemp said UK water companies had invested in large scale infrastructure projects, but spending on sewage treatment equipment was 20 per cent below expectations. 'We have seen in the last 18 months that greenness is not always associated with profitability and results have been poor,' he said. There is sympathy for this view among analysts, who suspect Simon also realised the environmental market would only become more competitive as larger foreign companies moved in, forcing margins down. Mr Kemp agrees Simon was neither big enough nor a niche business. 'We would have had to spend a lot of money getting there. But you cannot, in this climate, proceed on all four fronts at the same time. There are questions of management and financial resources,' he said. The City will probably come round to Simon's reasoning. But it will take longer for the company's shares to be rehabilitated. Stripped of its green tinge, Simon has lost the unifying rationale behind its other divisions. For example, industrial services and process engineering are stand alone businesses yet have an environmental angle which binds them together. Once the binding is removed, Simon is in danger of again being seen as an eclectic industrial holding company. The disposal also raises the question of what else may eventually be sold. Mr Kemp says no further disposals are pending but no division is 'sacred'. 'If you look five years ahead the group's focus will reduce even more. We have to get bigger in fewer businesses to compete internationally,' he said. Simon's second problem, which is more serious, is its financial position. Recession in the construction and paper industries, which hit Simon's access and process engineering divisions respectively, has meant group earnings per share fell from 34.5p in 1989 to 12.5p last year. Borrowings, mainly to fund acquisitions, have risen to Pounds 51m and interest cover has fallen from 17 times to 4.1 times. Last year Simon had to dig into reserves to pay an uncovered dividend. Its shares are yielding more than 12 per cent, implying the market now expects a dividend cut. According to Mr Kemp, this year's dividend could still be covered if some of the process engineering division's more than Pounds 1bn of outstanding quotations are translated into firm orders, and if a 20 per cent year on year order improvement for access equipment is sustained. Selling the environmental division would also give Simon the option of repaying nearly all borrowings, and bringing down gearing, now at 40 per cent. 'If we dispose of the division for about Pounds 50m all our financial ratios would improve, including our ability to maintain the dividend,' said Mr Kemp.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Observer: Dialling up a pop number You may not yet have heard of Edward Belgeonne; but it's not for want of his trying. Belgeonne is a clever 30-year-old who had earlier spotted the 1980s UK boom in mobile phones. He is now about to sell his second mobile phone business for around Pounds 1.5m. The first went for Pounds 2.5m. Belgeonne is tired of mobile communications and is making a bid to become a pop star. Well, actually, he always wanted to be a pop star but thought it more sensible to make a couple of million first to back his talents. His band - Gone Tomorrow - has just splashed out on producing 500 copies of a CD single of the Louis Armstrong classic Wonderful World, his version having what he calls 'the white reggae feel of the band UB40'. Given the parlous state of the recording industry, might his next attempt be a cover version of Who wants to be a millionaire?.</p>

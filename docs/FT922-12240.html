			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Survey of Seattle and Puget Sound (3): Consolidation is a priority - There is little doubt the region is generously banked THE dominant theme in the US banking industry for many months has been consolidation. Mega-mergers between the likes of Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank, Security Pacific and Bank of America, coupled with the relentless growth of 'super-regional' banks, such as Banc One and NCNB, have commanded numerous newspaper headlines. Yet nowhere can the 'micro' effects of this trend be more pronounced than in Washington state, and in Seattle-Tacoma, the region's commercial centre, in particular. The local commercial banking industry may have been spared some of the most horrendous loan loss and ailing real estate problems which have dogged its counterparts on the East Coast, but that has done nothing to halt the marriage whirl. There is little doubt that the region is generously banked. It has been calculated that there are more than 100 commercial banks in Washington state, not to mention an abundant supply of thrifts and credit unions. That compares with, say, 60-odd commercial banks in Canada, and around 500 in the whole of the UK. Consolidation, in itself, is not new. Take Puget Sound Bancorp, which was the last remaining major independent banking company in Washington until it agreed last month to an Dollars 800m takeover by Keycorp, the New York State-based banking group. Since mid-1989, Puget Sound has absorbed four other local financial groups - Family Savings and Loan, First National Bank of Enumclaw, Valley Bank and Puget Sound Securities - and, as of March, had a further three deals pending. The total purchase price of the seven transactions was put at around Dollars 50m. Nevertheless, the pace at which mergers are taking place, and the size of some of the deals, has certainly increased recently - a development attributed to a variety of causes. Most local bankers prefer to stress their desire to push down costs and increase efficiencies. One executive also cites the need to improve competitiveness vis-a-vis large pension funds - including the Washington State employees fund - which, he claims, are stealing part of the banks' traditional customer base. 'Banks need to make more money, they need to get capital up,' says Luke Helms, chairman of Seafirst, the Bank of America subsidiary which is already the largest bank in the state and about to become bigger still via the absorption of many local Security Pacific branches. That said, the merits of these cost-saving claims, especially over long time periods, remain debatable, and the issue of merger-related efficiencies has been argued all the way to Capitol Hill. What is indisputable, however, is that financial weakness and loan loss problems - a second reason for the acceleration of the merger trend - are having a significant effect on the Seattle region. For a start, while the health of the local banks may be relatively good overall, financial pressures have been cited as factors in the demise of Peoples National Bank and Old National Bank, acquired by US Bank of Washington in the late-Eighties, and of Seattle Trust and Savings, taken over by Keycorp. Second, and more significantly, tie-ups between large, troubled out-of-state banks have brought large local upheavals. The merger between Bank of America, and the ailing Security Pacific - both of which have headquarters in California - is the most striking case. Locally, this brings together Seafirst and the Washington offices of SecPac, which had acquired the sizeable Rainier Bancorp in the Eighties. These previously constituted the number one and two groups in the area. Not surprisingly, the impending deal has engendered all sorts of competitive arguments at state level. After much furore, the upshot is an agreement requiring that 86 of the SecPac branches be divested to third parties. This leaves Seafirst to absorb around 82. Even with this reduced number, there is some overlap with existing Seafirst offices. The net gain for Washington's number one bank is likely to be more like 50, says Mr Helms. If so, Seafirst would emerge from the deal with around 262 branches. At the time of writing, the question of who would pick up the remaining 86 SecPac branches was still under negotiation. But whatever the outcome, it seems certain to produce further ripples. In fact, this may already have been a factor in the Keycorp-Puget Sound deal. Keycorp, which has been building up a presence in the Northwest generally, was thought to be extremely interested in the SecPac branches, but to have reckoned that it would do better to pursue the purchase via the clout of Puget Sound. Hence the relatively attractive offer for the Tacoma-based bank last month. Meanwhile, West One, the Idaho-based bank, is understood to be another contender for some of the SecPac branches, as is US Bank of Washington - in turn, owned by US Bancorp of Portland and ranking number three in the state. Few observers think the consolidation trend will end here. Both West One and the Washington offices of the troubled First Interstate bank of Los Angeles, in which New York's Kolhberg, Kravis Roberts, the leveraged buy-out specialist, holds a near-10 per cent stake, are widely viewed as possible takeover candidates somewhere down the road, The question, however, remains. Who gains or loses from this burst of marriage activity? Short-term, there are clearly job losses at stake - executives involved in the Seafirst-SecPac deal estimate around 500 jobs, for example. The real estate market, particularly in downtown Seattle, is scarcely helped by the trend either, since financial institutions are principal occupiers of abundant commercial space. Leading corporate clients are probably unaffected, but more concerns surround the small business community's access to capital. In truth, much probably depends on the policies of the acquiring parent and the extent to which lending decisions remain at local level. 'Consolidation can be bad if the acquiring bank makes its policies too rigid,' concedes Don Vandenheuvel, president and chief financial officer of Puget Sound. 'You need to retain flexibility'. On the upside, there are the bankers' promises of greater efficiency, and more investment in electronic services. The average 'Seattle-ite', meanwhile, can only wait until the dust settles before determining whether services have really improved. Finally, it is worth noting that this shake-out is a purely domestic affair. Overseas banks - particularly from Japan and the Pacific Rim - have come and gone in the past, and their presence today is very limited. The foreigners, says one banker, were competitive pricewise, but at an inevitable disadvantage in terms of customer recognition and speed of decision-making.</p>

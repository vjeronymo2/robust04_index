			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salamah Ni'mat: "King Husayn Expects </F> Washington's Support for Demarcation of Borders With Israel"]    [Excerpt] Amman -- Official political circles attach great  importance to King Husayn's talks in Washington and link success  to the possibility of making quick progress in the negotiations  with Israel over the next three months. The official sources  say that they do not rule out the possibility of several  bilateral agreements on various issues on the agenda, including  demarcation of international borders, water rights, and security  arrangements linked to the border demarcation.    The sources expect a military agreement to be concluded with  Washington committing the United States to supporting Jordan's  security and providing arms and advanced modern equipment for  the Jordnaian security organs and Armed Forces.

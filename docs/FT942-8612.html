			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / International Company News: Canada media groups link in satellite TV venture Several of Canada's biggest broadcast, cable-TV and telecommunications companies have joined forces to develop a satellite-based TV service. The proposed alliance is largely a response to the competitive threat from DirectTv, the fledgling US service, nicknamed Deathstar, which aims to beam as many as 500 TV channels directly into North American homes. The new venture is a defensive move for the cable-TV operators, which have a monopoly in their licence areas. Satellite services are expected to be far more loosely regulated than cable-TV, and can be picked up by any household with a receiving dish. However, the consortium also includes BCE, holding company of Bell Canada, the country's biggest telephone company. BCE has recently begun to broaden its horizons in the multimedia sector. It is also the majority shareholder of Telesat Canada, which operates Canada's communications satellites. The other seven participants include Rogers Cablesystems, Canada's biggest cable-TV operator; WIC Western International Communications, which is the largest private broadcaster; and Cancom Satellite Communications, which distributes TV signals by satellite to 2,500 cable systems, mostly in remote rural areas. The group plans to set up a national 'direct-to-home' (DTH) service within the next 12 months. It will deliver pay-per-view - pay TV and other programming in digitally-compressed form - to cable systems as well as to DTH subscribers. The cost of setting up the service is estimated at CDollars 85m (USDollars 62m). The plans also include a central authorisation facility which will enable small cable-TV systems to offer pay-TV services to their subscribers. A 5 per cent equity stake in the new venture has been left for outside investors.</p>

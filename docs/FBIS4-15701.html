			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tajik Supreme Council Chairman Emomali </F> Rakhmonov by RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent Andrey Pravov in  Islamabad, under the "Diplomacy" rubric; date not given:  "Emomali Rakhmonov: All Constructive Forces in the Region Are  Interested in Peace...." -- first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] A delegation from the Republic of Tajikistan headed  by Supreme Council Chairman Emomali Rakhmonov is visiting  Pakistan in an official capacity. Here we offer our readers an  interview he gave to Andrey Pravov, RIA-NOVOSTI's correspondent  in Islamabad.    [Pravov] In your view, Mr. Chairman, what role could  Pakistan play in resolving the issue of settling the situation  in Tajikistan?    [Rakhmonov] We regard Pakistan as a friendly state.  Islamabad is keen to offer assistance in resolving problems  relating to a peace settlement in Tajikistan. We welcome any  initiatives on this issue, which is of vital importance to us,  wherever they originate -- from the United Nations, Moscow,  Tehran, or Islamabad. We are being offered help and we  gratefully receive it.    Quite apart from anything else, this approach has an  entirely  pragmatic basis. Central Asia, and Tajikistan in particular, is  an inexhaustible market for Pakistani products of every kind,  including industrial goods. Pakistani businesspeople are also  attracted here by the richness and diversity of our raw material  resources. On the geographical level, moreover, Pakistan may be  viewed as an extremely important transit route for shipment of  goods from Central Asian states to the sea.    [Pravov] But, of course, in order to establish such  extensive ties, surely you will have to settle the situation in  Afghanistan first of all?    [Rakhmonov] This is true, of course. The continuing war in  Afghanistan is an extremely serious problem for both our states.  But, as far as a land transit route from Tajikistan to Pakistan  and back is concerned, it may be realizable in the not too  distant future. Basically, our two countries' borders are just  19 km apart in Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Oblast's  Ishkashimskiy Rayon. The most likely route linking our two  countries across Afghanistan is probably the so-called Vakhan  Corridor. This is the gateway to the Karakoram triangle -- the  area where the borders of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India meet.    [Pravov] Do you think that land transit toward the Arabian  Sea could be established even if hostilities continue?    [Rakhmonov] Afghanistan must resolve this problem in any  case. If it does not, we are unlikely to see any trade or  economic projects materializing in the region as a whole.  Moreover, the conflict is also dangerous because the  conflagration of war could spread across state borders, not just  those of Tajikistan. It seems to me that Pakistan is just as  well aware of this as we are.    [Pravov] However, from time to time we see hints in the  press that certain circles in Pakistan are supporting the armed  Tajik opposition in Afghanistan and are even encouraging its  actions on the border. How do you view these reports?    [Rakhmonov] If such circles in Pakistan exist, they are  irresponsible circles. Attacks by detachments of gunmen on our  border posts represent a clear manifestation of terrorist  activity. The problems that exist between various political  forces in Tajikistan cannot be resolved by force of arms. We  are relying on negotiations. This is one of the reasons why we  came to Pakistan and I clearly note that we have found complete  understanding here. Moreover, what is happening in Afghanistan  cannot be approached with double standards. It is clear to  everyone that the groupings of gunmen on this country's  territory answer to nobody. They constitute a real danger not  just for Tajikistan. This sort of behavior is dangerous for  everyone in the region.    [Pravov] Mr. Chairman, since we have already spoken about  the situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, I would like to dwell  on this problem in more detail. Do you think it likely that the  coming spring will bring new and more serious problems for the  border posts guarding this border?    [Rakhmonov] Some time ago the armed opposition spoke about  its intention to launch a spring offensive against our border.  But it seems to me that their plans are unrealistic. The armed  detachments of Tajik oppositionists do not have sufficient  strength for this. And the groupings of Afghan mojahedin that  support them will soon be embroiled in fighting one another --  seizing territory and carving it up into spheres of influence.  Moreover, our border, thanks to the common efforts of certain  CIS countries, has been reliably reinforced; it is also being  defended by military units from other former USSR republics, now  independent states, which rightly understand that the  Tajik-Afghan border remains our common border and that we must  defend it together.    [Pravov] From time to time we see articles in the press  indicating the dangers of Moscow getting "embroiled" in  Tajikistan. It is alleged that in many ways Russia's actions  are a repetition of the former USSR's mistakes in Afghanistan.  Indeed, some points of similarity can already be seen. What do  you think about these parallels?    [Rakhmonov] I see fundamental differences in the two  situations. First and foremost, unlike the USSR and Afghanistan  in the early 1980's, until quite recently Russia and Tajikistan  were part of the same country, and we have extremely close ties  to the Russian people. It is not just a matter of extremely  close economic and cultural ties. There are many mixed  marriages. There are a number of Russians living in Tajikistan.  Our states have now gone their separate ways. But many Tajiks,  and Russians too, continue to believe we are still part of a  whole -- whether it be with Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, or  Uzbekistan. And all of us still have a common southern border  -- that of the former USSR. Another radical difference from the  Afghan situation is this: If you remember, once Soviet troops  had been sent into Afghanistan, neither Kabul nor Moscow showed  any intention of meeting with the leaders of the mojahedin  groupings or holding talks with them. They relied on force.  However, we favor resolving our problems with opposing forces  of a different political orientation by peaceful means. And in  this respect Russia fully supports us.    [Pravov] Do you think the issue of finding a settlement to  the situation in Tajikistan is making any headway?    [Rakhmonov] Undoubtedly. First and foremost, the need for a  peace settlement in the country is accepted by practically all  our neighbors. And they are prepared to help the Tajiks talk to  one another. We realized this once again during our present  visit to Pakistan. It is clear that today everyone in the  region is keen to see peace in Tajikistan, and there is no  military way of resolving our problems.</p>

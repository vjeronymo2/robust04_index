			<p><P> August 15, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARBITRATION  </P> <P> Binding arbitration for firefighters will be considered by the state  Legislature later this month -- a measure, that if approved, would permit  outside arbitrators to make decisions which, in the past, have been reserved  for local elected officials.  </P> <P> Passage of Senate Bill 1127 would allow an arbitrator to decide on  firefighters' salaries, benefits and working conditions and would destroy the  collective bargaining process by which Anaheim and its firefighters have  successfully resolved their differences since 1966.  </P> <P> Under a system which includes binding arbitration, the city and the  firefighters' union could no longer negotiate and compromise in good faith, but  rather posture themselves for the ultimate binding arbitration hearing. Binding  arbitration would discourage the development of long-term relationships based  on mutual trust and good will.  </P> <P> We urge state legislators to let cities and firefighters associations continue  to work collectively on issues that can be resolved by the parties themselves.  The local taxpayers should be able to decide their own priorities and budget  without outside interference.  </P> <P> BOB SIMPSON  </P> <P> City Manager  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P></p>

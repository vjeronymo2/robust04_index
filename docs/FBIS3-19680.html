Speaking after Friday's [18 March] cabinet  meeting, he said that it was better for the war refugees  themselves to be received in Macedonia for example, rather than  in the Netherlands. "After all that is ideal," he said. "The  same language, the same customs."    Lubbers said that the cabinet wanted to make more money  available to expand reception capacity in the region. The prime  minister referred to the reception of East Africans in the  Middle East as a second example of the reception of refugees in  their own region. "It is good that the world is accepting  Somali, but why does that have to happen on humid Netherlands  soil?" he said. "After all, would that not be better in Saudi  Arabia or Yemen? For example they have the same religion there."    On Friday the cabinet agreed with the Justice Ministry plan  to stop and send back asylum-seekers entering the Netherlands  overland as quickly as possible after they cross the border.  These refugees will usually be told that they must apply for  asylum in the so-called first country of reception. This refers  to the first of the 22 member states of the Council of Europe  which the asylum-seeker entered.    The decision copies one of the underlying measures of the  Schengen Treaty. Because the Netherlands is "closed off" by the  Schengen countries Belgium and Germany, asylum-seekers who come  overland are to no longer be granted asylum in the Netherlands.  But because this would put an unfair burden on Germany in  particular, agreements will have to be made in a European  context about a fair distribution, Lubbers said.    Lubbers gave a cautious answer to the question of whether he  thought it was sensible for Housing State Secretary Heerma to  talk in parliament this week about the possibility of perhaps  70,000- 80,000 asylum-seekers coming to the Netherlands this  year. "Mentioning these figures could have a dramatic effect,"  the prime minister said. "But neither could the cabinet walk  away from the facts," he said. "And these facts are that partly  because of tighter asylum policies in Germany, more  asylum-seekers are coming to the Netherlands."</p>

			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Delays at Eurotunnel may cause problems with banks Eurotunnel, the debt-burdened Channel tunnel operator, yesterday said delays to the start of rail services had seriously dented its revenues this year, and could prevent it from meeting conditions for Pounds 700m of fresh borrowing. The Anglo-French group had forecast revenues of Pounds 135m when it launched its Pounds 858m rights issue in May, but yesterday it said it would not earn a quarter of that by the year end. 'We have had a grim and very hard nine months and we have not delivered all the expectations in our (rights issue) prospectus,' said Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's co-chairman. 'But we believe we're are getting into a position of delivering the goods.' The news disappointed city analysts, who had been expecting Eurotunnel to make revenues of more than Pounds 90m. The shares slid 7p to 221p - compounding a 20p fall last week. Healthy revenue forecasts earlier this year helped persuade the group's syndicate of 220 banks to offer Pounds 700m of senior bank debt as part of a Pounds 1.6bn refinancing. Eurotunnel may now have to renegotiate the terms of the new debt, which was due to provide working capital during its first full year of operations. However, the so-called agent banks co-ordinating the lending syndicate - including National Westminster and Midland - remain supportive and are not expected to force a cash crisis ahead of next year's peak holiday season. Mr Graham Corbett, Eurotunnel's chief financial officer, said: 'There is no actual or potential breach of our loan covenants, let alone a default.' Sir Alastair, meanwhile, denied there was any need for another rights issue to boost finances. Next year, Eurotunnel hopes to raise Pounds 200m from warrant holders exercising rights over shares at roughly Pounds 3 each. Analysts are sceptical that the share price will revive sufficiently. Concern over the company's financial health mounted after it reported sharply increased first-half losses of Pounds 47m, against Pounds 1m last time. The company has enjoyed some cost savings following the delay to rail services. Sir Alistair said the deterioration would be limited in its year-end cashflow postion to Pounds 50m worse than forecast. The gloomy revenue picture was brightened slightly by the announcement of the start of high-speed Eurostar passenger services from November 14.

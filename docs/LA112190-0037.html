			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIETS TO GET LEFTOVERS FROM WEST BERLIN'S COLD WAR FOOD  </P> <P> A huge stockpile of food built up by West Berlin in case of a Cold War crisis  will be sent to help the Soviet Union, the power that once blockaded the city.  </P> <P> In one of the ironies of post-Cold War Europe, Berlin said Tuesday that it is  ready to send 300,000 metric tons of food and other supplies worth $480 million  to its former enemy.  </P> <P> The only outstanding question is how to move the goods from 280 warehouses  around the city to their destination.  </P> <P> "The big problem will be transporting it in winter as the cold could destroy  the tinned food," said Juergen Weide, a department head at Berlin's Economics  Senate.  </P> <P> Soviet media reported that severe shortages of meat, potatoes and dairy  products are hitting the nation's industrial heartland and the battered economy  is reeling because of a wave of hoarding, bartering and rationing.  </P> <P> The reports painted a grim picture of what everyone expects to be a long, hard  winter across much of the country, already torn by political and social unrest.  </P> <P> Leningrad, birthplace of the Bolshevik Revolution and the country's  second-largest city, has approved a rationing plan, and Moscow is expected to  follow suit.  </P> <P> Sales in the two cities, and many other regions, are already limited to buyers  with residence permits.  </P> <P> Mounting food problems, sparked by the breakdown of the old distribution system  and the lack of a replacement, pose the most fundamental threat yet to  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform drive, bogged down in its sixth year.  </P> <P> West Berlin established its emergency stockpile in 1953, four years after  enduring a yearlong blockade by the Soviet Union and its East German ally.  </P> <P> The stockpile, which was due to be dismantled following German unification last  month, was large enough to supply the daily needs of West Berliners for up to a  year.  </P> <P> It includes items ranging from 10.9 million cans of sardines to 18 million  toilet rolls.  </P> <P> A German Red Cross delegation will leave today for talks in Moscow on an aid  program.  </P></p>

			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Scots may export water to England SCOTLAND may join other rainy areas of Britain in exporting water to southern England to relieve the water shortage on a long-term basis, a government minister revealed yesterday. Mr Allan Stewart, the Scottish industry minister, said the Scottish Office was examining a scheme drawn up by the construction industry for transporting water from the southern uplands of Scotland. He said the project would cost 'at least four figure millions' - at least Pounds 1bn - and would be an important boost to Scotland's construction industry. This is the first time Scotland has been mentioned as a possible source to boost southern England's water supply. Up to now only Northumbria, Cumbria and Wales have been considered. The issue is politically sensitive in Scotland as it follows an announcement last week by Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, that was widely seen as paving the way for privatisation of water north of the border. Mr Lang said he was appointing consultants to consider 'alternative forms of organisation for water and sewerage services, including ways in which the private sector might contribute enterprise and investment.' Water in Scotland is the responsibility of the regional councils, but with these likely to be abolished in the forthcoming Scottish local government reorganisation the question of how water will be organised in future has to be addressed. It is understood that a Scottish-based construction company has drawn up a scheme to transport water from rivers and existing reservoirs in the southern uplands to England by means of pipelines and tunnels. The plan would not involve the creation of reservoirs - which would require the flooding of valleys. The scheme depends on changes to laws preventing water sale between Scottish regional councils and presumes that Scottish water will be privatised.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Standard Chartered Standard Chartered had prepared the market for its losses in India, though not perhaps for the additional Pounds 50m general provision announced yesterday. But there is a natural temptation to scan its interim results for signs of the next calamity. The bank is now so well marked out as accident prone that it is legitimate to ask whether its management controls are yet tight enough for an organisation with such broad international operations. There must be some risk attached to cumulative loan loss provisions of only 5 per cent of its Dollars 780m South African exposure despite the deteriorating political climate there. Again, it is curious that the first half saw no net provisions at all on Pounds 11bn of assets in the Asia-Pacific region. The bank is also coy about the extent of its dependence on the Hong Kong market, which is presently strong but vulnerable to a turn in US interest rates and any shift in China's political climate. Of course, there may be no further problems in the pipeline. In that case Standard Chartered could look forward to a steady decline in provisions. The 80 per cent tax charge will also fall as the Indian problem works its way through. But there is little sign of growth in operating income. The bank would argue that exchange rate movements mask underlying growth in local currencies, but it cannot have it both ways. If the dollar were not so weak, its tier 1 capital ratio would be much less comfortable than the 4.9 per cent reported yesterday.</p>

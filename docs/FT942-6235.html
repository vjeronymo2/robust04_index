			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / European Elections: A case of mind over doesn't matter To stand, or not to stand? The question is taxing and dividing a group of French intellectuals who had pledged to run in the European parliamentary elections on a ticket which supports Bosnian Moslems. Professor Leon Schwartzenberg, a cancer specialist and the head of the 'Europe begins in Sarajevo' list told RTL radio yesterday that he would press ahead with plans to contest the June 12 vote. His statement followed an announcement on Monday by members of the movement that they would not contest the elections, having already publicised their call to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia. 'We do not have the right to play with institutions,' said Prof Schwartzenberg, referring to the fact that election lists cannot be withdrawn once they have been registered with the Interior Ministry. But he admitted that it was unlikely that there would be ballots for the movement at all polling stations. His comments will cause concern for the Socialist party, which appears most at risk from the Sarajevo candidates' 12 per cent in recent polls. The U-turns of the past few days, however, reveal the divisions among France's intellectuals. Prof Schwartzenberg is at odds with several other members of the movement, including Mr Bernard-Henri Levy, a left-bank Paris philosopher turned film-maker, who has been the driving force behind 'Europe begins in Sarajevo'. His film, Bosna], which was released at the Cannes film festival earlier this month and which dramatises suffering of residents of Sarajevo, prepared the way for the launch of the movement. But Mr Levy and his supporters voted in favour of a withdrawal of the Sarajevo slate at the European elections, arguing that the plight of Bosnia had been raised and that it would continue to campaign for an end to the arms embargo by other means. Mr Schwartzenberg, however, sees it differently. True intellectuals, he said, such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus would not have withdrawn at the last minute. He criticised his opponents within the movement for seeking 'personal publicity' and said that they had never intended to go as far as the elections.</p>

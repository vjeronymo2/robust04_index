			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / IAEA meets on N Korea EFFORTS TO persuade North Korea to allow further nuclear inspections will be stepped up today at a special board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, writes David White, Defence Correspondent. The meeting of the agency's 35 governors follows North Korea's announcement last week of withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and tension over the Team Spirit US-South Korean military exercises. Mr Hans Blix, IAEA director-general, will report on North Korea's refusal last month to allow inspection of two sites near its Yongbyon nuclear complex. Evidence from earlier inspections raised suspicions that the country might have separated more plutonium, usable for nuclear weapons, than the tiny amount it has declared. An IAEA official said a North Korean representative might attend the meeting.</p>

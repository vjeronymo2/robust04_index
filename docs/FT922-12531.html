			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Blue Circle The City used to be pretty sniffy about Blue Circle Industries, but notwithstanding a 13p fall in the share price yesterday the company now enjoys a sizeable fan club. If there is a problem, though, it is not in last year's numbers, which were bang in line with expectations and contained encouraging evidence that margins in the increasingly important home product activities have generally held up. Nor should investors be unduly worried about the widespread profit downgradings for the current year: these appear to have been prompted mainly by news that under new accounting standards profits on the disposal of a major Singapore property will not now be taken above the line. If there are worries, they stem in the short term from the twin price and cost pressures on UK cement margins, and in the long term from nagging doubts about BCI's real talent for home products. After all, it is hard to deny that the company overpaid for its diversification, and that shareholders' funds have been diminished by a string of balance sheet write-downs.</p>

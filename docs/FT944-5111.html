			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / US bank agrees to derivatives controls Bankers Trust, the New York based bank, has agreed to a Federal Reserve direction to impose tighter controls on parts of its derivatives business. The Fed move, in the form of a so-called 'written agreement', is thought to be the most severe regulatory action taken against a big US commercial bank. It follows several big, well-publicised losses on derivatives in the US over the past year by companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble and Metallgesellschaft, and by investors such as Piper Jaffray. Although Wall Street has blamed the losses on the institutions themselves, they have raised concerns in some regulatory quarters about the way in which complex financial instruments are sold to supposedly sophisticated buyers. Under the deal with the Fed, Bankers Trust said it would adopt new procedures for controlling its leveraged derivative operations, financial instruments that have been at the centre of two lawsuits brought against the bank this year. The value of these instruments moves disproportionately with movements in underlying securities or markets, making them among the most volatile and complex of financial instruments. Mr Charles Sanford, the bank's chairman, sought to play down the significance of the accord with regulators. Leveraged derivatives, he said, accounted for less than 5 per cent of the bank's revenues. He said Bankers Trust had already taken steps itself to counter any shortcomings in its controls. A Fed official said regulators would use the agreement to keep a close watch on Bankers Trust's leveraged derivatives business. He said the action signalled the central bank's intention to keep a close watch on the derivatives activities of other US banks. 'You can read this as a red alert for other players,' he said. Bankers Trust last month agreed to a Dollars 14m (Pounds 8.5m) settlement of one dispute over leveraged derivatives it sold to Gibson Greetings, a US greetings card company. The bank is still fighting a legal action brought by Procter &amp; Gamble, which also lost money on a Bankers Trust instrument when US interest rates started to rise this year. The regulatory action requires Bankers Trust to establish better controls over how it assesses the appropriateness of particular derivatives for particular customers; how it markets the instruments; the information it provides on the value of the instruments as underlying markets move; and the way it supervises the business overall. The bank said it had largely put the changes into effect already. The bank is also required to set up a special board-level committee to monitor compliance with the Fed agreement, improve its training programme for sales staff and strengthen its internal auditing. The 'written agreement' is one of the strongest forms of administrative enforcement action available to US bank regulators. Bankers Trust is believed to be under pressure to agree similar actions with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

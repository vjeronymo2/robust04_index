			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UN to review military role in Bosnia The Security Council will need to reconsider the United Nation's military role in Bosnia 'in the next few weeks' because of the threat by several countries - including Britain - to pull out their troops, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary-general, said yesterday. At his first press conference in New York for many months, Mr Boutros Ghali hinted at a possible need for the troops to use force to prevent the conflict from spreading beyond the borders of former Yugoslavia. However, he repeatedly invoked the Security Council, stressing that it, and not he, must decide how to deal with the crisis. Mr Boutros Ghali did, however, declare his firm opposition to waiving the arms embargo for Bosnia, as favoured by the US. That would bring a flood of arms when the important thing was to contain 'the dispute', he maintained. He said negotiations were still the best way forward, with the despatch to Moscow of Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN negotiator, coming as part of an effort to 'obtain a consensus among the major member states to see what could be done'. This latest move was an outcome of talks with Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, on Monday, he said. Speaking in Washington yesterday Mr Hurd again stressed the need for co-operative allied action to bring a negotiated end to the war. On the question of employing air power, Mr Boutros Ghali said that his representative Mr Yasushi Akashi was authorised to request Nato air support for UN troops at Tuzla and Srebrenica at any time. But even if the UN were to 'ask Nato tomorrow' for pre-emptive air strikes a further unanimous decision by the North Atlantic council would still be needed. Carefully differentiating between close air support and air strikes, he also explained that he would 'still have to give the green light'.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Brittan urges role for Gatt in competition regulation WORLDWIDE competition rules covering subsidies, cartels, merger policy and even public monopolies should be drawn up under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, according to Sir Leon Brittan, European commissioner for competition. Sir Leon will tell the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, today that, in the next round of world trade discussions, a strong role should be sought for Gatt in the field of competition law and enforcement. The aim would be to pass the benefits of free trade on to the consumer. Sir Leon considers the speech to be the most important of his career. Without wanting national competition laws to be swept away, Sir Leon, a former minister in Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet, envisages a gradual increase in the scope of Gatt, offsetting its reliance on trade law: Subsidies. Gatt already has the power to rule on the acceptability of state aid to companies, but Sir Leon believes that power should be increased and the system of enforcing Gatt decisions strengthened. Cartels. The first priority should be to draw up clear international definitions of cartels and restrictive practices. Such cartels should be outlawed through the national legislation of Gatt signatories. As a safety net, Gatt's central dispute settlement mechanism should be reinforced. Mergers. Sir Leon concedes that a supranational merger authority - along the lines of the EC's 16-month-old merger control task force - is impracticable at this stage. However, he would like to see a core of common rules on mergers enforced by member states, with Gatt as an international forum for handling deputies. Public monopolies. The European Commission's recent attempts to break up monopolies in telecommunications, energy and postal services, for example, have proved this is the most controversial area of EC competition policy. Nevertheless, Sir Leon will suggest that distortions caused by public monopolies, or exclusive rights granted by public authorities, could also be tackled through Gatt. Sir Leon's speech will be the most forceful expression of his conviction that the Commission is leading the assault on anti-competitive practices and that the rest of the world should follow suit.</p>

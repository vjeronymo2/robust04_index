			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Skills strategy launched for construction sector The construction industry yesterday launched recruitment targets for its new skills training strategy in a move to standardise requirements across the industry. The Construction Industry Training Board said it planned to recruit 10,200 trainees in 1994-1995, rising to 17,000 by 1996-97, in anticipation of a 1 per cent annual growth in construction output. However, Sir Clifford Chetwood, the board's chairman, said this would only cover half the number of construction employees lost from the industry each year through death or retirement. Warwick University's Institute for Employment Research forecast recently that there would be 1.4m employees in the construction industry by 1997. Sir Clifford said half of all construction workers currently had no formal qualifications. The board's strategy for training skilled craftsmen, such as carpenters, bricklayers and joiners, as well as manual labourers provides six alternative 'flexible routes' to training, which accommodate changes in education and the industry itself. Recognising the increasing use of self-employed and labour-only sub-contractors rather than employee craftsmen, the board has introduced grants for contractors to provide work experience or apprenticeships. It will give a Pounds 300 grant per trainee every year to each main contractor which places a candidate with one of its labour-only sub-contractors or self-employed workers.</p>

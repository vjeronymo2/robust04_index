			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Khamrayev report under the "Newly Created Entity" </F> rubric: "Yet Another Movement Wants To Struggle for Accord and  To Restore Russian Peoples to Honor and Dignity"]    [Excerpts] Yet another public-political movement, named  the Assembly of National-Democratic and Patriotic Forces of the  Russian Federation [ANDPF], which came into being last weekend,  will strive for civil peace and interethnic accord, something  only the lazy have not urged.    The Assembly, as designed by its founders, will bring  together ethnic organizations, ethnic-cultural associations,  parties, movements, and individuals, after which it will  coordinate their actions "in the area of ethnic relations,  political and socioeconomic transformations" and will establish  "interethnic communication in civilized forms" upon defining  "the common interests of the peoples of the Russian Federation."    The all-Russian assembly was convened at the initiative of  the Assembly of the North Caucasus Democratic Forces under  general secretary Shmidt Dzoblayev, which has already been  operating as part of the Russian Democratic Reform Movement  [RDRM]. According to the organizing committee, the initiative  was supported by 64 regions. Only 43 credentials, however, were  handed at the constituent congress: not all regional  representatives could put aside their business to make a trip to  Moscow. [passage omitted]    The congress was attended by Mr. Popov [not further  identified], who in his salutary address on behalf of the RDRM  at the very beginning wished the Assembly successful work, and  then left the hall. There were no more well-known politicians  at the congress, nor was there any particular need for their  presence because the Assembly, Shmidt Dzoblayev said, was  created "from the bottom up" and "does not rush to show its  sympathies for one party or another."    Recognizing the protection of individual rights as the new  movement's priority, the founding delegates chartered the  vectors of its political and economic strategy as they  envisioned a possible way "toward interethnic accord through the  revival of national honor and dignity." Pointing out that the  current interethnic conflicts are in reality "conflicts between  regional and federal authorities over the distribution of  property," the delegates set their sights on a "constitutional  federation," in which "national-territorial entities will not  divide citizens into `indigenous' and `non-indigenous,' and the  federal authorities will be entitled to "remove from office a  regional chief if he fails to take measures to stop ethnic  discrimination." If this does not help, "oxygen should be cut  off to the regions by imposing economic sanctions."    The Assembly's economic program has so far been limited to  the recognition of "the need for the state regulation of the  economy" and will be definitively outlined sometime toward next  winter at the movement's first congress.    The hours-long discussion of the plans resulted in the  adoption of a program statement describing regional problems "as  a matter of particular concern for the authorities and the  public," and also amendments and additions to the charter. In  conclusion, the Assembly founders elected a political council --  the ruling body between congresses, which will subsequently  elect from its members a bureau that will govern the  organization between meetings of the political council. The  constituent congress also elected an executive committee and an  auditing commission. Shmidt Dzoblayev was unanimously elected  general secretary of yet another assembly.</p>

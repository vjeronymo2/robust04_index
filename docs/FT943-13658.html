			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Murayama promises a more gentle and humane Japan Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's new socialist prime minister, yesterday sought to improve the weak popularity of his government by promising a more gentle and humane Japan, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo. The fourth administration of the past year will be 'people friendly. . . a government you can feel at ease with' and will strive to make Japan 'not to be a powerful country but a caring country,' Mr Murayama told parliament in his inaugural policy speech. He promised tax cuts, 'trustworthy politics,' no change in defence policy, and a more discreet international profile, in an attempt to assuage popular anxiety over the coherence of the left-right coalition, which seized power in a parliamentary coup three weeks ago. Mr Murayama openly confirmed for the first time yesterday that he would abandon some of his Social Democratic party's more extreme policies, such as seeking to disband the military, so as to fall in line with the dominant coalition partner, the conservative Liberal Democratic party. Policy rows with the left wing helped destroy the previous two centre right-led coalition governments, but Mr Murayama's socialist colleagues appear readier to suppress old ideologies to stay in power now their leader has become prime minister. Mr Murayama took care to avoid controversy yesterday. He made no direct reference to a rise in sales tax, which the finance ministry insists is needed to fund the drop in income tax and pensions. However, Mr Murayama planned to 'seek the understanding of the people' to reform the tax system by the end of the year. He aimed to put government finances, where the state has over Y200,000bn (Pounds 1,310bn) of outstanding bonds, on a 'sound footing.' On the economy, he promised to strive for exchange rate stability and for a 'highly significant decrease' in the current account surplus, which reached a record Dollars 60.01bn (Pounds 38.5bn) in the first half of this year. To that end, Mr Murayama's government will press ahead with deregulation, to cut prices and to dismantle barriers to new businesses. On defence, he promised to uphold the US-Japan security treaty, under which 24,000 US troops are deployed in Japan, and to maintain a minimum defence capability. This will help assuage widespread public anxiety on Japan's readiness to face a threat from North Korea, but implies a steep climbdown by the SDP's left wing when the party holds its next policy conference in September. On foreign affairs, Mr Murayama toned down Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council and said he wanted a 'thorough discussion of the rights and responsibilities' involved. His call for a nation of peace that does not flaunt economic or military power marks a contrast to the previous two governments' desire for a higher world profile. On domestic politics, Mr Murayama confirmed that he would not call an election until after new constituency boundaries have been drawn, the final stage of a five-year campaign to curb corruption and make politics more responsive to the electorate.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Arts: Lucia Popp - Obituary The world of music is mourning the premature loss of one of its most-loved artists, the soprano Lucia Popp, who has died at the age of 54. A particular favourite of British audiences, whether in the opera house (she was a regular feature of Covent Garden casting for 22 years) or concert hall, she made herself known across the globe as one of the warmest and most endearing of musical performers, with a voice, face and stage personality to match. Czech-born, with a full, clean, silvery high soprano that initially allowed her to draw notice as Mozart's Queen of Night, she quickly moved from a youthful debut (1963) at Bratislava to permanent engagement in Vienna, and thence to the most important international stages. As her voice filled out, the coloratura soubrettes were abandoned and it was as an exponent of the Mozartian and Straussian light-lyric roles - Popp was the most delightful of Susannas and Zerlinas - that she won so many hearts. With maturity came a range of more weighty, serious characters (Strauss's Arabella and Marschallin, even Wagner's Eva and Elsa), to whom she responded with the depth and naturalness of feeling that was her special characteristic. Though hampered in the later stages of her stage career by hip problems, her dignity and communicativeness were left unscathed. Popp also blossomed into a recitalist who could grip an audience with her powers of narrative, charm them with a simple lyric or comic portrait, and transport them willingly into territories (Czech, Hungarian and Russian song) beyond the confines of the safe, predictable Liederabend. Many records remain to show the breadth of her range as well as the more familiar qualities of her art.</p>

			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Sweden delays bridge decision Sweden yesterday put off a decision on whether to approve construction of a bridge between Sweden and Denmark after continued wrangling over the project within the coalition government. The decision threatens the cohesion of the government, headed by Moderate (Conservative) party leader Carl Bildt, nine months before a general election. 'We are quite simply not ready,' Mr Bildt said yesterday after a cabinet meeting to discuss the bridge, which would be the first permanent link between Sweden and continental western Europe. 'A decision can probably not be expected before Thursday of next week,' he added. Sweden and Denmark have signed a treaty which commits the two states to build the 17km road-and-rail bridge by the year 2000 at a cost of about SKr12bn (Pounds 975.6m).</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISTRIAL DECLARED IN WIPER PATENT SUIT AGAINST FORD  </P> <P> A federal judge declared a mistrial Wednesday when a jury was unable to agree  on damages that Ford Motor Co. should pay an inventor for infringing on his  patents for a widely used windshield wiper system.  </P> <P> Inventor Robert Kearns, a former engineering professor who lives in  Gaithersburg, Md., was seeking $325 million in damages from the nation's  second-largest auto maker in a case that other car makers have been watching  closely.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn said the jury was hung, and he discharged it.  "The court had determined that there is no useful purpose for them (the jury)  to deliver it," he said.  </P> <P> Cohn said the jury had come to a near-unanimous verdict on a damage award but  that there was one holdout who could not agree on the amount.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 MEN ARRESTED IN RAID INDICTED ON DRUG  CHARGES  </P> <P> Four men arrested in a raid that netted $17.8 million in drug profits -- the  largest such money seizure in the West -- have been indicted on narcotics  charges, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> In addition to cash and money-counting machines, prosecutors said authorities  seized ledgers in the July 24 raid in Sylmar that could shed light on how the  drug network operated.  </P> <P> However, Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen Wolfe said investigators were still  reviewing the ledgers and he could not comment on any links the suspects might  have to major drug cartels.  </P> <P> Two Colombians, Gilberto Saavedra, 41, and his brother, Carlos, 31, allegedly  ran the money-laundering operation, Wolfe said. They bought the house less than  two months before the raid.  </P> <P> Jesus David Salazar, 25, and Gabriel Olguin Gaviria, 37, were also named in the  indictment, returned this week. They allegedly were employed as money couriers  and guards in the operation.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Alliance 90/Greens spokesman Ludger Volmer </F> by Golo Schmidt, place and date not given: "Hope Despite  Refusal"]    [Text] The party congress resolutions of the Alliance  90/Greens were firmly rejected not only by the Union parties  [CDU/CSU--Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union] and  the Free Democrats [FDP--Free Democratic Party]. Criticism was  also voiced immediately after the conclusion of the national  assembly in Mannheim by the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany]. Our correspondent Golo Schmidt spoke with the party  executive spokesman of the Alliance 90/Greens, Ludger  Volmer.    [Schmidt] Herr Volmer, does the flat refusal by the Social  Democrats to enter into a coalition with the Alliance 90/Greens  come as a surprise?    [Volmer] Actually, the only refusal that was "flat" was that  by Herr Rappe, who is also the chairman of the IG Chemie labor  union. But that does not surprise me. Rappe has been on this  tack for ten years. We are, after all, very critical of the  chemical industry, and this naturally also impacts on the  associated labor union.    [Schmidt] But SPD party whip Verheugen also declined  vigorously.    [Volmer] He had to. As long as party boss Scharping wants to  avoid all coalition statements and his course is still headed  more in the direction of the Union and the FDP, his party whip  cannot just get up and say that the Greens are the natural  coalition partner.    [Schmidt] The rejection is linked particularly to the demand  of the Alliance 90/Greens for the abolishment of the Bundeswehr  and NATO. Would this basic position of your party even be  negotiable?    [Volmer] What matters to us is the direction in which we go.  NATO continues to represent a strategy of escalation, while we  want deescalation. We know that the dissolution cannot be  carried out within a coalition period of four years. But there  has to be a party which preserves the vision of an armament-free  foreign policy. And the switches have to be set toward a  demilitarization and a "civilizing" of the foreign policy.    [Schmidt] If the thesis of the Alliance 90/Greens is  correct,  i.e., that the SPD has made a shift to the right: Must radical  demands not virtually force the SPD into a grand coalition?    [Volmer] In the SPD, as well, there are reform forces which  would gladly work together with us. One can speculate on how  strong these are in their party. With our demands, we want in  any case to apply pressure on the SPD to keep its own promises  for reform.    [Schmidt] Do you still believe in a red-green coalition  following the next Bundestag election?    [Volmer] In a purely arithmetic sense, the farther the SPD  goes to the right, the greater the chances for such a majority  become. Since this is currently the case, we are, however, also  faced with the dilemma that the differences in content become  greater. That makes the formation of a coalition more difficult.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ICI decision on split fixed for February SIR DENYS Henderson, chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries, yesterday admitted there had been a deterioration in market conditions since July, when he announced the company's intention to split into two separately quoted entities. A decision whether to go ahead with the split would be made in February and be dependent on market conditions, Sir Denys said. The fall in UK interest rates and decline in sterling would prove beneficial, he pointed out. However, the board would consider the group's trading outlook for next year and the willingness of stock markets to accept a share issue by the bioscience business, yesterday renamed Zeneca, which includes the pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals and most of the specialities divisions. Mr David Barnes, chief executive designate of Zeneca, said the split increased the possibility that Zeneca might make a series of acquisitions. Although the group had a viable base it did not have critical size in a number of markets. There was no detailed master-plan of acquisitions, however. The new ICI executive team will be headed by Mr Ronnie Hampel, as chief executive officer. It will include Mr Colin Short, presently ICI finance director, Mr Chris Hampson and Mr Rob Margetts. Mr Victor White will continue as solicitor and secretary, while Mr Alan Spall will remain general manager of finance and Mr Trevor Harrison general manager of planning. As well as Mr Barnes, the Zeneca board will involve Mr Peter Doyle and Mr Tony Rodgers, together with Mr John Mayo, finance director. Mr Graeme Musker will be secretary and solicitor, Mr Norman Lyle, general manager of finance, and Mr Hugh Donaldson, general manager of corporate resources. Sir Denys, who will be non-executive chairman of both companies, said non-executive directors would be announced when and if Zeneca became a public company. The Zeneca name was one of 1,000 considered with the help of Interbrand, the branding consultancy. Mr Barnes said some non-UK subsidiaries were compelled for legal and commercial reasons to change their name. He refused to detail the costs involved, but said it was a five-figure sum. Zeneca would initially use ICI's Millbank headquarters, but would seek another site in London. Sir Denys said the new ICI would have a number of powerful businesses which were sector leaders.</p>

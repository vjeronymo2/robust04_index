			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Beckett puts emphasis on leadership continuity Mrs Margaret Beckett, the interim Labour leader, yesterday presented herself as the candidate of unity and continuity in Labour's leadership election. In a personal manifesto, Mrs Beckett set out to challenge the widespread view among party members that she is the candidate of the left. She said she believed she could win the leadership, in spite of indications that she is trailing badly behind Mr Tony Blair, the modernist shadow home secretary. Mrs Beckett declined, however, to say whether she was still interested in the deputy leadership, which she is also contesting, or if she would serve in the shadow cabinet under Mr Blair or Mr John Prescott, the third leadership candidate. Mrs Beckett's eight-page glossy manifesto sets out to capitalise on her experience as the interim leader and the only former minister in the race. It pictures her with US President Clinton at the Detroit unemployment summit earlier this year, in a factory, and visiting a school, recalling her three years as a junior education minister in the 1970s. The manifesto offers few insights into the character of a Labour government led by Mrs Beckett, mainly because of the inability of leadership candidates to change established party policy. But it offers strong support to the concept of Labour as 'a very broad church' and promises to unite the party behind an 'honest, straight-forward, inclusive style of leadership'. Launching the manifesto, Mrs Beckett said she knew 'the party and the movement from the bottom up better than anybody else in the race'. She urged the party to challenge the 'myth' that there was no alternative to the Conservatives, who she said were 'stuck in a political and ideological cul-de-sac'. Mrs Beckett said Labour must change the political culture of Britain. 'We must set people free to dream. Then we must build up a programme of how to begin to deliver that vision,' she said. Friends of Mrs Beckett said that the release of the manifesto had been timed to coincide with the despatch of voting papers to the 4.5m members of the party's electoral college. It is designed to raise questions about the electoral appeal of the other candidates, such as the ability of Mr Blair to defend Labour's heartlands, and whether Mr Prescott can win fresh support in the south of England. Mr Prescott is expected to deliver his personal manifesto - the last of the three - early next week. The election result will be declared on July 21.</p>

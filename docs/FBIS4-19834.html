			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "People's Party for Freedom and </F> Democracy Leader Bolkestein Wants To Be Prime Minister"]    [Text] It seems after all that VVD [People's Party for  Freedom and Democracy] leader Bolkestein is ready to take on the  job of prime minister if the liberals are the largest party  following the elections.    Bolkestein believes that the political leader of a party  must  not shirk the responsibility of leading a government.    Four days ago, Bolkestein stated that he attached more  importance to membership in the Chamber than holding ministerial  or prime ministerial office.    At a meeting in Alphen aan den Rijn, he stated yesterday  evening that the VVD would not be bringing "any issues that can  not be negotiated" into the formation of a new government. The  VVD is seeking cutbacks of 17 billion guilders during the next  term of government. If it is less than 15 billion, Bolkestein  states that the VVD would withdraw its support.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Krotkov: "From One Scandal to Another: </F> Farewell to the Voucher"]    [Text] The closer the country is to completion of the  stage of voucher privatization, the more passions heat up around  who will control the privatized property and on what terms.    For instance, a few days ago Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov  issued a directive according to which "all rights with respect  to managing Moscow property in enterprises' conversion to  joint-stock holding and privatization" will be controlled by the  capital city government. In keeping with the same document, the  capital city government may take into trust management for a  period of three years the shares of even those plants and  factories that are federal property but until sold at auction  are under the jurisdiction of the city property fund.    An interesting detail: The Moscow Government is willing to  sell these shares before due time only in the event it finds it  "economically expedient." The latter category, as anybody will  agree, can be interpreted so broadly that the issue of selling  will not arise at all--especially considering that Luzhkov, for  purely political considerations, is afraid of the consequence of  mass bankruptcy of major capital city enterprises, and in order  to avert such a painful process will attempt, in the opinion of  some, to stall the selling of shares through actions.    According to some reports, the head of the State Committee  for Administration of State Property [GKI] reacted to the  decision of the mayor--his old adversary--with extreme  irritation. But an even greater headache for Anatoliy Chubays  may be presented by the draft Law on Regulating Property in the  Russian Federation, officially submitted for State Duma  consideration by the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]  faction.    According to this draft, the overwhelming majority of  already  completed privatization acts in Russia may be invalidated as  illegal. Moreover, in the event of a low economic efficiency of  denationalized enterprises, and "in instances of persistent  noncompliance by the new owner with the terms of the  privatization agreement... the object is to be deprivatized."    Keeping in mind that the production indicators of very many  plants have declined after denationalization, their return to  the state bosom (in the event this draft is approved) appears  quite likely. Radical economists have already nicknamed the LDPR  document the "Law on Deprivatization."    It would be naive, of course, to assume that the Duma, torn  by controversy, will unanimously pass this law. However, the  idea per se--to put privatization in reverse in instances where  its economic effectiveness turned out, as they say, to have a  minus sign, is currently becoming increasingly popular.    Meanwhile, in its blueprint of post-voucher privatization,  Chubays' agency is planning the compulsory sale of the property  of insolvent debtor enterprises at the demand of creditors. Only  the labor collectives of privatized enterprises, which are  vested with sufficient powers in keeping with the current  legislation, can interfere in this process.    Even here, however, there is a surprise ready to be sprung  on  us: Chubays insists on substantially cutting preferences to  labor collectives and, from his standpoint, considers even this  tough approach a compromise--in the first draft of the concept  of post-voucher privatization the wording was "no longer grant  any preferences."    It is hard to judge at this point whose position will win  this time. One thing is clear: The current battles between  supporters and opponents of "privatization according to Chubays"  may turn out to be insignificant compared to what may be coming  in the future.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Pay rise of 1.5% imposed at BBC THE BBC yesterday imposed a 1.5 per cent pay rise without waiting for the result of a union ballot on the issue. The ballot on whether to accept or reject the pay deal will not be completed until August 11. Ms Margaret Salmon, director of personnel, says in a letter to staff: 'We believe there is nothing to be achieved in awaiting the results of the ballot and it is intended to implement the 1.5 per cent increase on August 1 1993.' The BBC points out that pay settlements outside the public sector are falling and that the government has ruled that public-sector settlements should be restricted to a maximum of 1.5 per cent of the pay bill. In her letter Ms Salmon argues that when the BBC is trying to persuade the government to retain the licence fee to fund the corporation 'we must be seen to be responsive to general public policy and voluntarily to adopt the same disciplines that have been imposed on other public-sector organisations'. Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the main broadcasting union, said the BBC should have waited until the result of the ballot was known. He expected the majority of staff would vote to reject the offer. The ballot does not include industrial action and may be used as a stimulus for talks on other issues such as job cuts. There are fears of further job losses next year when new budgets are drawn up. Meanwhile the BBC says it wants to introduce a single contract for fixed-term workers. The 15 per cent pay premium paid to short-term workers will be removed in return for limited pension and redundancy rights.</p>

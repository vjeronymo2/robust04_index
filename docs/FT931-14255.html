			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (24): How foresight saved money - Corporate strategy, long range planning from Japan FOR TOSHIBA, the Japanese electronics group, the removal of most of Western Europe's internal tariff barriers on January 1 was just the latest stage in a long and unhurried series of changes in one of its biggest markets. Almost a decade ago, the company established a task force in Tokyo to study changes taking place in the European Community. Six senior managers from departments such as corporate planning, finance and accounts and personnel spent a year studying the issue. They filed a many-volumed report to top management in May 1985 which recommended, among other things, the creation of a regional co-ordination centre in Europe. In October 1989, a small European co-ordinating office was established in central London. Mr Takeo Fujii, the leader of the team which wrote the 1985 report, became its head. A branch office was soon opened in Brussels. It has just three staff, one Japanese, one local recruit, picked for his knowledge of the European Commission and its directives, and a secretary. One reason for the gentle pace and limited resources given to the project was that Toshiba was growing quickly in Europe's fragmented markets in any case. Individual operating divisions had already set up shop in Europe. The first manufacturing centre, for televisions in Plymouth, Devon, was established in the 1970s. Manufacturing is now spread across Europe, with semiconductors and VCRs made in Germany and microwave ovens and photocopiers in France. There are eight divisions, including finance and basic research, that operate almost entirely independently. Their only point of common contact in Europe is Mr Fujii's London office. Those eight divisions employ more than 5,000 people in 11 European countries. Almost half work at manufacturing subsidiaries and Toshiba Corporation shares are listed on nine European bourses. Sales in Europe are worth Y65bn with Germany and the UK accounting for almost half the total, France taking 17 per cent and Italy 11 per cent. Distribution is strongly based on national borders. Almost all the output is sent to distribution centres in individual countries before going to dealers and shops. The output of office automation equipment, for example, is co-ordinated from Dusseldorf, but products are routed via warehouses in each country. It is a system that is likely to continue for some time, says Mr Fujii. Markets still have national characteristics, especially for products that are retailed. France has its own technical standards for televisions. Germany has ultra-strict rules on the design of microwave ovens, and its consumers have, until very recently, refused to buy flat screen televisions, preferring the older, more rounded screens. Toshiba even had to buy its picture tubes for the German market from European manufacturers Thomson and Phillips. There are exceptions. Some television picture tubes are bought by other manufacturers. Since there are a small number of industrial buyers which each order a lot of units, the tubes are shipped directly to them from plants in the US, Japan or Thailand. Mr Fujii says there will be few changes in procedures in the short term. The company will have to deal with new forms of paperwork, dealing with sales tax and import/export statistics, and is having to set up new systems to cope. 'Once the computers have been set up, I hope costs will be lower,' he says In the longer term, some parts of distribution may be centralised. The company is considering cities such as Hanover or Barcelona for the establishment of a 'distribution logistics' centre, especially to deal with products that are imported from outside Europe. Eventually, it should be possible to distribute directly from, say, Germany, to retailers in Italy or Spain. But Mr Fujii does not believe this will happen soon in spite of a widespread belief among colleagues in Japan that 1993 has ushered in a perfect single market in Europe. 'Most Japanese may dream of a unified (European) market, but personally I see only small changes,' he says. 'For the time being, country-by-country structures will remain. Different markets have different needs. We are not in a hurry.'</p>

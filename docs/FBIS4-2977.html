			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By M.Y. Sung] </F>   [Text] Twenty local deputies to China's National People's  Congress (NPC) have signed a letter requesting the full text of  the verdict against jailed Hong Kong journalist Xi Yang.    They decided to press ahead with the request despite China's  decision earlier this week to issue a statement on the offences  allegedly committed by the Ming Pao reporter.    Eight deputies did not sign the letter.    Xi, a Chinese national living in Hong Kong, was arrested in  Beijing late last year on charges of espionage and stealing  state banking secrets.    He was tried in a closed court and sentenced to 12 years in  prison.    In the past two days, local deputy Peter Wong has collected  20 signatures from the 28 NPC local deputies for a letter to NPC  chairman Qiao Shi requesting a full text of the verdict against  Xi.    Among those who did not sign were Xinhua News Agency  director  Zhou Nan and his assistant Lee Wui-ting.    Surveyor Kan Fook-yee also refused to sign because, he said,  it insinuated China had mishandled the case.    Educator Wong Kwong-hon refused to sign the letter because  he  did not want to be involved in the controversy over the case.    "I believe the verdict is reasonable under the Chinese  judiciary system," he said.</p>

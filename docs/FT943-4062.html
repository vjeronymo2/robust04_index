			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Markets: Industrial shares wilt at the margins - London Few companies are big enough to move the London market single-handed, but BTR certainly achieved that dubious distinction this week. Unexpectedly low interim profits from the industrial conglomerate helped tip the FT-SE 100 back through the 3,200 level it had been hanging on to since the summer rally. This is partly a question of scale: BTR is one of the UK's biggest manufacturing group's, even after Thursday's sell-off cut its market market value by Pounds 1.6bn to Pounds 12.2bn. Analysts estimated that the plunge in BTR's share price alone accounted for nearly 10 points of the FT-SE's 100's 23.9 point decline on the day. The main reason, however, was that a drop in BTR's profit margins confirmed a concern over manufacturing shares which has been increasingly worrying investors in recent weeks. The growth in retail spending and consumer confidence remains subdued, as demonstrated by the confirmation that last month's new car sales fell well short of the industry's hopes and the modest level of new housing starts. The Confederation of British Industry's distributive trades survey suggested that retail sales in August were only slightly up on a year ago. A good summer helped Cadbury Schweppes, the sweets and soft drinks group, lift profits by 23 per cent. But the company, which bottles Coca-Cola, admitted that sales of Coke in J. Sainsbury stores fell by 15 per cent after the UK's largest supermarket chain launched its own-brand of cola. Investors had responded to these pressures on the retail sector by moving out of consumer-oriented companies and into industrial manufacturers, which seemed better placed to benefit from increasing economic growth. The theory was that manufacturers, having reduced their workforces during the downturn, would be able to transform quickly any significant rise in demand into increased profitability. BTR's results highlighted the big flaw in this argument: manufacturers are finding it difficult to pass on rising raw materials prices to their customers, who are themselves struggling to sell goods to unenthusiastic consumers. BTR said the problem was particularly acute in the automotive industry. All the big car groups are taking a leaf out of the book of Volkswagen, where the Spanish executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua has cut costs by putting pressure on suppliers. Alan Jackson, BTR's chief executive, said his group would turn away some of this automotive work, rather than lower its profitability. However, the warning of margin pressure still caused dismay: BTR has a strong position in many markets, and if it cannot resist being caught in this sort of squeeze, then weaker manufacturers will have even less chance. There was, consequently, a large switch of funds out of manufacturing companies and into traditional safe havens such as utilities, which continue to offer high dividend payments. British Gas held its dividend, in spite of a slight drop in profits. The group confirmed that its reorganisation programme was on schedule, and that an additional 3,000 people had been made redundant in the first half, bringing the year-on-year total to 10,000 out of a target total of 25,000 over the next three to four years. Shares in Manweb also rose after the Cheshire-based regional electricity distributor said it would cut 500 jobs, 11 per cent of its workforce. The group is the second in the sector to respond to the regulator's recent price review with job cuts and a wide-ranging restructuring. Most of the Recs are expected to announce similar action to cut costs over the coming weeks. Reducing the workforce seems a foolproof wheeze for making privatised monopoly suppliers more profitable, and increasing their dividend streams, but it also offers one clue as to why the recovery in consumer confidence and retail spending remains fragile. News of the slowdown in retail sales growth, combined with a marked narrowing in Britain's visible trade deficit in June, at least raised hopes that Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, would hold back from an early rise in interest rates. On the most optimistic view, these figures hold out the prospect that UK recovery could be becoming more established without threatening to push inflation higher or trigger a balance of payments crisis. SG Warburg, the investment bank, points out that, in spite of some disappointments this week, most companies reporting in the current interim results season have matched expectations, even if they have failed to justify the upgrades in earnings forecasts which some had looked for. Warburg says: 'In consequence a period of disappointment and nervousness may be inevitable, not least while investors consider how generally applicable BTR's talk of margin pressures as raw materials rise is.' London equities were further unsettled yesterday, when news of unexpectedly high US producer prices startled the bond market with the prospect of another rise in US interest rates. Even if UK interest rates go up later rather than sooner, no one in the market doubts that an increase is coming. As the autumn progresses, we will also see increasing speculation over the contents of the November Budget - particularly regarding the government's intentions on the tax treatment of dividends. One possible source of optimism came from BTR, which said it was on the lookout for a large acquisition. The group's borrowings have fallen below the level they were at before it paid Pounds 1.55bn in 1991 for Hawker Siddeley, the aerospace and engineering group. BTR will certainly not just consider on UK opportunities, but a well-judged large domestic deal could both cheer the market and take the group out of the dog house.</p>

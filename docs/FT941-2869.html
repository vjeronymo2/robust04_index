			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: GGT shares fall 55p on profits warning A second profits warning in five months from Gold Greenlees Trott, the advertising group, yesterday prompted a 55p fall in the company's shares to 184p. GGT also warned that it would be cutting its total dividend from 8.3p to 5.3p for the 12 months ending April 30. The company said it was unlikely that pre-tax profits would exceed Pounds 3m for the year. In October it said profits would exceed 1993's figure of Pounds 4.3m, but warned that City forecasts of around Pounds 6m were optimistic. The company said it had adequate cash balances - averaging about Pounds 20m  -but the directors considered it 'prudent to adjust the dividend in order to revert to a more normal level of dividend cover'. The final pay-out will be cut to 2p. The directors said the balance between the interim and final dividend would be adjusted next year. The warning in October followed lower-than-expected profits in the UK, but GGT said then that it hoped a strong performance from the US would cushion the impact of the shortfall. The company said yesterday: 'It has now become clear that this will now not happen, primarily due to the postponement of a national launch by a major client (Coors Brewing), pending the results of a regional test market, and higher than expected new business-related costs.' GGT added that it remained confident in the underlying strength of its business and had already taken steps to improve growth and profitability, particularly in the UK.</p>

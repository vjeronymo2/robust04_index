It will usher in a  new era of cooperation between the two countries and reflect the  political will to deal firmly with terrorists and those involved  in drug trafficking.    This was told to PTI by the British home secretary, Mr.  Michael Howard, at a dinner hosted by the Indian high  commissioner, Mr. L.N. Singhvi, in honor of the visiting prime  minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, in London last night. The  agreement provides for confiscation of funds in any of the two  countries of those involved in the pursuit of terrorist  activities as also drug trafficking. The agreement for the  purpose, together with the India-British extradition treaty, had  been signed in London in 1992.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S.Z.: "Agreement With Bosniaks Better Than </F> Alternative"]    [Text] Zagreb -- At the HRZ [Croatian Republican Community]  news conference, Mario Ostojic, deputy president, and Boris  Koznjak, representative of the headquarters, stated: "During the  last two years, Croatia made many amateurish moves on the  diplomatic and political scene, especially regarding  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most often there was talk about success,  often in euphoric terms, even though our policy experienced  failure in the domestic and international arena. The present  preliminary agreements on federation and confederation forced on  us by the United States, although arriving quite late, are  better than the alternative -- a formation of some kind of a new  Yugoslavia prepared for us by the Brussels technocrats."    The HRZ welcomes the agreement with the Bosniak Muslims on  federation as well as a future confederation of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. It warns that one should  nevertheless be cautious, particularly when it comes to the  confederation and relations with Serbs. It is necessary to  strengthen the Croatian-Bosnian defense alliance in order to  help neutralize the Serbian offensive wedge pointed toward Zadar  and Sibenik and thwart other Serbian plans in their program for  the creation of a Greater Serbia, which they have never  renounced.</p>

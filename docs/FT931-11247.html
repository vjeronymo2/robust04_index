			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: Exxon chooses new chairman EXXON, the largest US energy group, said yesterday that Mr Lee Raymond, the president, would be named this spring as the new chairman, succeeding Mr Lawrence Rawl, who will reach the mandatory retirement age of 65. Mr Raymond, who is 54 and first joined Exxon as a production research engineer in 1963, will in turn be succeeded as president by Mr Charles Sitter, a senior vice-president and director of Exxon. The retirement of Mr Rawl, to take effect on April 28, the date of Exxon's annual shareholders' meeting, may indicate a change of style at the top of the big US oil and gas company. Mr Rawl is best known in the US as the Exxon leader who was harshly criticised by the media in 1989 for what was considered his arrogant, and even nonchalant, attitude to the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, one of the worst US environmental disasters. Mr Raymond, who is also a director of J. P. Morgan, the blue-chip New York bank, has held a wide variety of positions at Exxon and is active at the Council on Foreign Relations. In the 1960s and 1970s, he worked at Exxon's US company and was later responsible for Exxon's international supply and transportation of petroleum products and crude oil and for running former Exxon affiliates in Aruba and Venezuela. Between 1979 and 1981, Mr Raymond was president of Exxon Nuclear Company. He later presided over Exxon's operations in the Caribbean, central and South America, becoming president of the Exxon group in 1987. Mr Sitter, who is 62, is responsible for Exxon's chemical business as well as the treasury and tax functions of the group.</p>

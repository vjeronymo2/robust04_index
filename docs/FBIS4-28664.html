			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 13 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) President Yohei Kono may not be the logical choice for the  next prime minister to lead a new coalition government joined by  the LDP, a senior LDP member said Monday [13 June].    "President Kono is the LDP's best candidate," said Koichi  Kato, an ex-chief cabinet secretary of a now-deposed LDP  government, at a news conference.    "But it is impossible for the LDP to form a government by  itself and we need to put together a coalition," he said. "We  should therefore seriously weigh the possibility of installing  someone from non-LDP forces (as the next premier)."    Kato, who heads a policy study group within the LDP dubbed,  "Group New Century," is a known archrival of Kono and has been a  staunch critic of the current LDP leadership.    Describing the current administration of Prime Minister  Tsutomu Hata as a weak regime that cannot win trust domestically  or internationally, the vocal lawmaker said the LDP should map  out a clear-cut strategy for creating a new, stable government  and demand Hata's resignation.    To fashion a fresh government with the participation of  broader political forces, the LDP, ousted from power last summer  for the first time in 38 years, needs to discuss with other  major political parties whether they can govern together, Kato  said.    But he took a dim view of the LDP's tie-up with Shinseito  unless Ichiro Ozawa, the ruling coalition's back room deal  maker, gives up the idea of running politics from behind the  scenes.</p>

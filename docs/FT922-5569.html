			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: HK Telecom advances on strong growth in revenue HONG Kong Telecommuni-cations, the colony's biggest company, yesterday met the market's expectations when it announced a 14 per cent increase in net earnings to HKDollars 5.67bn (USDollars 732.5m) in the year to end-March, against HKDollars 4.96bn in the previous 12 months. The profit rise was struck on a 13 per cent advance in turnover to HKDollars 18.37bn from HKDollars 16.26bn. International and local telephone revenues grew by 15 per cent and other telecommunications services, which mainly represent mobile communications, rose 13 per cent. Mr Michael Gale, chief executive, said the results were satisfactory, particularly as profits had been hit this year by a much higher tax rate. The company paid HKDollars 833.4m in tax, 98 per cent higher than the HKDollars 420m paid in 1991. Directors have recommended a final dividend of 20.5 cents a share. With the interim payout of 17.5 cents, the total for the year will be 38 cents, up 15 per cent. Hong Kong Telecom's results continued to underline the importance of the Chinese market to the company's business. Of last year's 1.6bn minutes of international traffic, China accounted for 671m minutes - a 35 per cent increase over the previous year. This business produced revenues of HKDollars 2.77bn last year. For China it produced revenues in excess of HKDollars 500m. The company is developing its relations with Chinese telecommunications authorities, especially in southern China. It will train 600 executives from the Guangdong's telecoms authority this year and has so far given China 1m lines of analogue telecommunications equipment. The company is negotiating with the Hong Kong government over the future of its domestic monopoly, which comes up for renewal in 1995. It is under pressure from government to cut its domestic and international telephone charges. Mr Gale said the company expected to see increased competition in the coming years. He added that the company's negotiations with government were continuing. However, the company appears to have persuaded the government to change its system of regulation from one in which its domestic profits are capped to an allowable return on shareholders funds to a system of regulation of tariffs based on the inflation rate. On international business, which provides more than 60 per cent of revenues, the company is reported to have offered an 8 per cent average reduction in charges, linked to a promise of no average increase in charges over the next five years. Hong Kong Telecom is 58.4 per cent owned by the UK's Cable and Wireless. CITIC, the Beijing investor, holds 20 per cent of the company.</p>

John Major was thrown on to the defensive by the  Chancellor's  admission, in an early morning radio broadcast, that the  increases would "take a bit of the edge off consumer demand."    Mr Clarke's acknowledgment, exploited gleefully by the  Labour  leadership, coincided with a new double warning of the fragility  of the recent economic improvement. Labour was pressing home  its attack in a week when millions of people have received their  new tax codes showing the increases in the past two budgets.    Gordon Brown, the shadow Chancellor, said ministers had  admitted this month that tax rises would slow the recovery.  "Now the Chancellor is going further in admitting that tax  rises will check the recovery. That means they will halt the  recovery for the time being."    Verbal warfare over the economy intensified as a report from  British Chambers of Commerce spoke of a "glass ceiling" holding  growth to less than pre-recession levels. Another survey of  consumer opinion found that households in London and the  Southeast were bracing themselves for a year of austerity.    Mr Clarke and Mr Major brushed aside the latest figures to  maintain that recovery was well under way. Their  counter-offensive came as the Cabinet, in an 80-minute political  session without officials, concluded that the brightening  economic outlook offered the Tories their best hope of averting  disaster in the council and European Parliament elections in the  early summer.    "We have been through some difficulties but the opportunity  to present our case is there and will build up towards the  elections," one minister said. "It comes from growing evidence  that the economic situation is getting better, which will have  its effect."    Mr Clarke insisted that Britain was on course for a "steady  recovery at a sustainable level" and added that it was silly to  judge the economy on the strength of one month's figures.  Appearing to rule out an early cut in interest rates, he said  the important thing was to behave responsibly and keep inflation  down.    He gave a buoyant assessment of the state of the economy.  "We have manufacturing output up. We have unemployment that  has been falling. Retail sales in these figures in December  were 4 percent up on the year before," he said. "Our inflation  record for the last 12 months is the best we have seen since the  1960's. We are plainly on course for a steady recovery at a  sustainable level. We have the chance of keeping inflation  down. It is absolutely silly for people to keep reacting to one  month's figures."    He added: "I want to see the recovery stronger than it is,  but I think the actual position is, we do have the best recovery  of any major economy in Europe."    Mr Major, challenged by John Smith over Mr Clarke's remarks,  said there was "no doubt whatsoever that recovery is under way."  He pointed out that Mr Clarke had also said that the recovery  was now "strong enough not to be stopped." But the Labour  Leader said that tax increases, equivalent to 7 pence on income  tax, were "bound to hit family budgets for six."    As he was taunted by Mr Smith over Mr Clarke's'remarks, the  Prime Minister hit back: "The economy has grown over 2 percent  in 12 months and has risen for six successive quarters. Retail  sales have grown 4 percent in the last year. Car production,  manufacturing output and export volumes are all up. With low  inflation and low interest rates there is no doubt whatsoever  that recovery is under way."    Mr Smith, however, said that people were starting to see the  full impact of tax increases on their standard of living. He  asked: "Do you recall saying during the election campaign that  greater taxation would kill economic recovery stone dead? If it  was true then, why isn't it true now? Or is that one of many  things you find it easy to forget you ever mentioned?"</p>

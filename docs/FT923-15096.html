			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Walker demands tough action to improve standards: 'Lax' approaches attacked SIR DAVID WALKER, who was described by Mr David Coleridge, the chairman of Lloyd's, as 'so white that snow-white looks dirty', has delivered his verdict on the insurance market. Although Sir David's 68-page report clears Lloyd's of any conspiracy or fraud, it provides an extensive list of shortcomings and is seriously critical of the market's professionalism and regulation. It also calls for far-reaching reforms to usher in greater disclosure, more pro-active regulation and more professional business practice. About half the report is devoted to a searching examination of the LMX spiral reinsurance market - in which Lloyd's syndicates and other companies reinsured each others' catastrophe losses. Losses from about a dozen spiral syndicates have left Names facing some of their heaviest losses, but the committee 'did not in its own investigations form a view that there was any fraud or conspiracy to disadvantage particular groups of Names or to advantage others'. Corporate reinsurers also lost substantial sums from spiral business, says the report. The development of the LMX market was not improper and was 'wholly explicable in terms of commercial factors and judgments'. The committee found 'no basis on which LMX spiral business would sensibly be regarded as other than insurance business' and the report rejects allegations of 'churning' - some LMX contracts being agreed merely to generate brokerage commission. 'The committee believe that active underwriters on several of the loss-making syndicates were heavily influenced by LMX brokers. But, in the absence of any evidence of impropriety on the part of these brokers, the committee believes that responsibility rests - and should continue to rest - with active underwriters.' However, the report says the level of brokerage commission is 'quite unrelated to the scale of effort and risk involved'. The report is highly critical of 'standards of professionalism, care and diligence on the part of a number of members' and managing agents and active underwriters' which were 'materially below best practice'. The approach to fiduciary responsibilities, in the case of several members' agents, is described as 'lax, with an unattractive appearance of preferencing of brokers and of members' agents themselves in some cases'. Equally, the report says, 'we were unimpressed by standards of performance achieved by some managing agents and believe that what proved to be seriously flawed underwriting judgments might have been constrained if active underwriters had been subject to more effective control by their managing agents.' The committee found that 'certain aspects of regulatory policies' were 'at any rate with hindsight, insufficient to identify shortcomings in performance and concentrations of exposures in a timely way'. Premium income monitoring - under which Lloyd's places a limit on the amount of premiums a syndicate can underwrite - was inadequate to constrain the high-risk exposures underwritten by spiral syndicates, says the report. Syndicates specialising in catastrophe business became too highly 'geared', with their potential liabilities far outstripping the size of their capital base. The committee found evidence that insiders had obtained better returns than outside Names. Insiders - Names with jobs with agencies and brokers on the market - had 'tended overall to fare better than external Names', though not 'in general and in most years, on an immodest scale given (their) inevitably superior market knowledge'. Working Names, and in particular directors of Lloyd's brokers, have a greater share of the capacity of more profitable syndicates than their share of total Lloyd's capacity, says the report. New capacity has been allocated similarly, in part reflecting the relative ease of access of existing Names on a syndicate to new capacity sought by that syndicate. In contrast, working Names were proportionately under-represented on the 10 LMX syndicates which have suffered the worst losses. Overall, directors of members' agencies have enjoyed better returns - particularly in 1989 - than the external Names represented by their agencies, although this was not the case for all members' agents. Sir David recommends 18 reforms. Among the most important proposals are: Lloyd's should take a pro-active regulatory stance, setting tougher standards for agencies and underwriters and ensuring that regulatory breaches are pursued more vigorously. Compliance standards should be more adequately monitored. In the LMX market in particular, closer regulatory attention should be paid to syndicates that are regarded in the market as writing 'soft' business. Lloyd's should make more use of its powers to register and deregister agencies. There should be tougher registration requirements for members' agents, possibly introducing limited-term registration reviewed annually. Increasing the onus on members' agents to ensure fairness in syndicate allocation and to promote standards of advice and protection for Names comparable with those for private investors under the Financial Services Act. Mandatory provision for peer group review through managing agents of the plans, policies and performance of every active underwriter. It says these proposals 'go with the grain' of existing best practice to be found in the market. 'The challenge for Lloyd's is to ensure that the standards of the rest are consistently brought much closer to the standards of the best'. Improvement in the quality of information held centrally by Lloyd's, with data published annually on syndicate performance and changes in syndicate capacity by category of Name 'on the following minimum breakdowns' - directors of group boards and managing agents; directors of members' agents; directors of brokers; other active working Names, retired working Names; relations of Names in all these categories and non-working Names. Syndicates to publish annually changes in participations by directors of agencies. Members' agents should not accept offers of new capacity to them or to any of their Names unless that capacity is to allocated equally among all their Names. New ways to assess the risk. 'We believe there is room for Lloyd's to develop techniques in this respect in line with developing management practice among leading corporate reinsurers.' Limits on the proportion of high-risk business a Name can write. Lloyd's should commission a 'volatility analysis and risk assessment aimed at the development of a set of risk weights for different categories of business'. An upper limit on the proportion of the total capacity of individual Names that might be written in specified high-risk categories.

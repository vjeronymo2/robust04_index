			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 21 Jan (TANJUG) -- The Federal Ministry of  Foreign Affairs today expressed concern in connection with the  recent arrest and expulsion of two priests of the Serbian  Orthodox Church from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  The priests were accused of having "conducted religious rites  in several villages in the municipality of Kumanovo without the  permission of the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Macedonian  Ministry of Internal Affairs, and thus instigated national  hatred and intolerance."    Recalling that this is not the first occasion on which the  authorities of the former Yugoslav republic have shown  intolerance toward the clergy of the Serbian Orthodox Church,  the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs stresses that by such  behavior Skopje is depriving the Serbian people living in  Macedonia of their religious rights. This is in contravention  of international norms and documents that the Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia has accepted, the statement, which was  forwarded to TANJUG today, goes on to say.    "This incites an atmosphere of insecurity and fear among the  Serbs in Macedonia, whose status, despite the promises and  alleged readiness of the relevant authorities, has not as yet  been defined in the Constitution. In addition to the existing  discrimination regarding the use of their mother tongue,  employment, education, and information, this behaviour by the  Macedonian authorities makes Serbs feel like second rate  citizens," the statement says.    The Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs expects the  Macedonian side to take all necessary measures so that there  should be no recurrence of such incidents. The ministry expects  the Macedonian side to start resolving the issue of the  constitutional status of the Serbian people living in Macedonia  in the near future, in accordance with highest CSCE and UN  standards.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yang Guojun (2799 0948 6874)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 2 Jun (XINHUA) -- Vice President Rong Yiren  met with John Chalsty, president of the Donaldson, Lufkin, and  Jenrette Securities Corporation, and his party in the Great Hall  of the People today. He expressed the hope that more business  people from U.S. securities circles will become involved in  China's infrastructure construction and invest in more sectors.    Rong Yiren said: The Chinese and U.S. economies are mutually  complementary to a great extent. China has a huge market, and  its investment environment is improving. From both the present  and long-term points of view, the prospects for trade and  cooperation in the economy and technology between the two  countries is promising.    Rong Yiren expressed his belief that President Clinton was  wise to recently declare the extension of China's MFN  [most-favored nation] status and the termination of linking the  MFN issue to human rights, saying that this decision is in line  with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is  beneficial to promoting Sino-U.S. trade and improving and  developing the two countries' relations. Rong Yiren expressed  his thanks for the work that the Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette  Securities Corporation had done in extending China's MFN status.    Briefing the visitors on the situation of China's reform and  opening up in the last decade and more, Rong Yiren said: During  the course of accelerating the establishment of a socialist  market economic structure this year, the measures that China has  adopted in reforming finance, taxes, planning, investment, and  foreign trade are going smoothly. The state's revenues have  increased, and the currency exchange rate is stable. Although  prices have risen, the government has taken effective measures  to control prices. Rong Yiren pointed out: We are very prudent  in the implementation of various concrete reform measures, and  prudence is conducive to bringing about an even more coordinated  type of economic development. He said: The current work of the  government remains to focus on handling well the relations  between reform, development, and stability.    Chalsty said that because of his firm's extremely great  interest in the Chinese market, they held successful talks with  the State Planning Commission and other relevant Chinese  departments on strengthening Sino-U.S. cooperation in various  fields.    To our knowledge, the Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette  Securities Corporation is one of the powerful securities and  investment firms in the United States. The current visit is  mainly for the purpose of seeking the opportunity of promoting  or expanding cooperation in the power, chemical,  telecommunications, iron and steel, aviation, and automobile  industries.</p>

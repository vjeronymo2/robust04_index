			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Observer: Chickens feed The UK prime minister, John Major, will soon be getting an extra Pounds 70 a week (before tax), thanks to the 4.7 per cent pay rise British MPs recently awarded themselves, taking the prime minister from Pounds 78,292 to Pounds 81,971. Pretty paltry. His co-celebrant in yesterday's historic Ulster developments, Irish prime minister Albert Reynolds, is getting a 16.9 per cent increase - from IRPounds 82,020 to IRPounds 95,920. Irish President Mary Robinson's salary will rise by 10 per cent to IRPounds 105,512, while ministers and judges will have to get by with an increase of 17.1 per cent. Not bad. Mind you, ordinary TDs (Irish MPs), will have to make do with just 3.8 per cent more, taking their annual whack to IRPounds 32,700. Hardly enough to stand a round in Dublin these days . . .</p>

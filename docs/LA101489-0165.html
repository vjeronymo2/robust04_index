			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 8 CABLE STATIONS CARRYING GAYS' 'SPECTRUM NEWS'  </P> <P> "Spectrum News," a 30-minute television program devoted to homosexual issues,  is now carried on eight cable stations in 14 Orange County cities.  </P> <P> "We've handled a range of things, from the Gay Pride Festival in Santa Ana to  federal protests in favor of gay rights," said "Spectrum" producer Brad Hudson.  </P> <P> Hudson said "Spectrum" has been broadcasting since February when it produced a  10-minute show for public-access channel KYOU in Santa Ana. The expanded,  30-minute format began in May and includes entertainment, news items and  coverage especially related to the county but sometimes focusing on national  and statewide issues, he noted.  </P> <P> The goal of "Spectrum" is to overcome perceptions that homosexuals only "live  in closets, lay on the beach and drive to Los Angeles for fun."  </P> <P> The program can be seen in Santa Ana (KYOU Channel 26 on Tuesdays at 5 p.m.),  Mission Viejo, San Juan Capistrano and Laguna Beach (Dimension Cable, Channel  33 on Fridays at 10 p.m.), Irvine (Community Cablevision, Channel 3 on  alternating Wednesdays at 10:30 p.m.), Anaheim (Multivision, Channel 22 on  Mondays at 6 p.m.) and Costa Mesa (Copley-Colony, Channel 61 on Mondays at 7  p.m.).  </P> <P> It is also aired in Orange (Cablevision of Orange, Channel 21, Mondays at 9  p.m. and Thursdays at 6 p.m.), Fullerton and Placentia (Channel 51 on Mondays  and Fridays at 8:30 p.m.), Buena Park (Channel 55 on Mondays and Fridays at  8:30 p.m.), Huntington Beach, Garden Grove and Westminster (Rogers  Cablesystems, Channel 3, air times to be announced).  </P> <P> Hudson said Spectrum is in the process of developing a steady audience. He  added that the program, which operates on a budget of $150 per episode, is  searching for volunteers and donations. MARK CHALON SMITH  </P></p>

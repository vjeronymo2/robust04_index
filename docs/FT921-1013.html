			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Canada sells 53% of Telesat CANADA'S public telecommunications companies are buying the federal government's 53 per cent interest in Telesat, the communications satellite operator, for CDollars 155m (USDollars 130.2m). The companies have formed a consortium, known as Alouette, to carry out the deal. The group is to be led by Bell Canada. The government earlier rejected a bid by Mr Charles Sirois, a Montreal entrepreneur, and his National Telesystem. Mr Sirois recently bought a sizeable equity interest in Teleglobe, Canada's sole overseas telecommunications company, whose mandate was extended for another five years. The telephone companies already owned 41 per cent of Telesat, which had been set up in 1969 as Canada's first commercial satellite communications company. The Alouette group said it would expand Telesat's services and begin a CDollars 200m research programme. Telesat will continue operating as a separate entity based in Ottawa.</p>

He was speaking after talks between the Czech and U.S.  delegations at Prague Castle tonight.    Clinton said that individual admission of new members to  NATO  was theoretically possible, but stressed that Partnership for  Peace was giving individual countries immediate opportunities  for military cooperation with NATO.    "In the talks, we stressed our will to cooperate with our  neighbours, we noted closeness of our and our neighbours'  stands, and stressed that we attach great importance to regional  cooperation as well," Havel said.    He said he was exceptionally pleased by the fact that the  President of the United States had visited the Czech Republic  and that Prague had been chosen as the place to meet with  representatives from neighbouring countries. He said that a  number of other topics, including U.S.-Czech economic  cooperation were discussed.    Clinton thanked for the warm reception in Prague and  recalled  that he was coming to Prague for the second time in his life,  after 24 years, in the same week, but in a very different role.  He visited Prague in January 1970 as a student. He said the  progress made by the Czech Republic since his first visit had  greatly impressed him just as his meeting with Havel and the  Czech delegation.    Clinton reaffirmed that the security of the Czech Republic  and other Central and Eastern European countries was important  for the security of the United States, the whole of Europe and  the Atlantic Alliance.    He said that Partnership for Peace was the beginning of a  real security relationship which can lead to fully-fledged NATO  membership. Clinton stressed that the economic dimension of  security had to be taken into consideration as well.    The U.S. delegation also included Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, White House Chief Thomas Mc Larty, Presidential  National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, the President's special  envoys Madeleine Albright and John Shalikashvili, and others.    The Czech delegation comprised Premier Vaclav Klaus, Foreign  Minister Josef Zieleniec, Defence Minister Antonin Baudys, Trade  and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy, Economics Minister Karel  Dyba and others.</p>

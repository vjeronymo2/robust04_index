			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Italy takes advantage of strong demand THE Republic of Italy took advantage of continuing strong international demand for the D-Mark by increasing the amount of its five-year Eurobond to DM5bn yesterday. Investors were attracted by the high coupons available and the currency's strength, say bankers. Italy, which priced the bonds near the bottom end of the indicated range at 47 basis points over German government bonds, increased the amount from DM4bn. Professor Alberto Giovannini, an adviser to the Italian Treasury, said he was delighted with preliminary information on the geographic spread of investors. Italy wanted to attract international investors rather than rely on purely German demand. Lead-manager Deutsche Bank, which took half of the paper on to its books, said it sold only one-third into Germany, and that there was particularly strong demand from UK institutions and central banks. The spread tightened to 45 to 46 basis points by the end of the day, it said. The most recent nearly comparable sovereign borrowing was the DM3bn seven-year issue from the Republic of Finland, also rated AA+ by Standard &amp; Poor's but one notch higher than Italy by Moody's, at AA2. Launched with a spread of 53 basis points, it was increased from the original DM2bn at a lower spread of 50 basis points. By yesterday, Finland's spread had widened again to 53 basis points, said traders. Of the five-year issues by Finland, Sweden and the UK last autumn, only the UK's spread has widened while the others have narrowed. Traders say that in retrospect the UK's launch spread of 10 basis points was too tight for a DM5.5bn deal. Deutsche Bank's active start to the year as a lead manager continued yesterday, with two other new issues in dollars and D-Marks. Set for pricing today is Credit Foncier de France's DM1.5bn 10-year issue, also led by Deutsche Bank. The indicated spread is 20 basis points over German government bonds. DG Bank described the DM100m 10-year reverse floating rate notes it led for Nordic Investment Bank as a speculative product targeted at retail investors who believe German interest rates are set to be cut. It offers a coupon of 10 per cent for the first year and 19 1/2 per cent less two times six-month Libor thereafter. While some bankers say that the D-Mark market now needs time to absorb the recent heavy supply, others say there is no sign of indigestion yet. In the dollar sector, Deutsche Bank admitted that KfW's Dollars 500m five-year issue was tightly priced at a launch spread of 18 basis points over comparable US Treasuries, but said a shortage of quality paper at that maturity helped the bonds sell well. European Investment Bank's latest borrowing came in two tranches from S. G. Warburg Securities, one for Dollars 400m over three years, the other for Dollars 300m over seven years. Bankers thought it was wrong to give both the same spread of 15 basis points over Libor. Interest, they said, was much stronger in the three-year slice, which was fairly priced, than in the seven-year, which was seen as expensive. Goldman Sachs said the spread on the Province of Ontario's Dollars 3bn 10-year global issue tightened to 72 basis points, after being set at 76, the bottom end of the indicated range. Goldman said that the deal was oversubscribed, and confirmed that demand for around 60 per cent of the paper came from the US market. Yesterday saw the year's first batch of equity-related issues by Japanese borrowers this year, the biggest of which was for Dollars 180m over four years by Tokyo Construction Co. The cost of such issues is very low in yen terms, say bankers, and many more are planned in the Japanese domestic market and the Euromarkets to refinance the Dollars 75bn or so of warrant bonds arranged in the late 1980s and maturing this year.</p>

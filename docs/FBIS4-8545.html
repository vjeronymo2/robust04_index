			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Pawel Wronski: "Leaving Because of Iryda? SLD </F> Sejm Deputies Want Dismissal of MON Chief"]    [Text] Roman Nowicki and Stanislaw Janas, Sejm  deputies for the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], announced  during a news conference yesterday that a motion will be  prepared to have the chief of the Defense Ministry [MON], Piotr  Kolodziejczyk, recalled from his post. According to Nowicki and  Janas, the minister humiliates the Sejm and acts against the  interests of the Polish defense industry.    In Nowicki's view, he will have no problem finding 15  members  of parliament ready to support such a motion.    The affair began when Sejm deputies made a decision to  include a provision in the budget that MON will have to purchase  Iryda aircraft costing 300 million zlotys [Z] each.    "I have a copy of a letter addressed to the Mesko plant in  which the minister justifies a decrease of orders with a  decision by the Sejm Budget Commission regarding the purchase of  Iryda," Nowicki displayed a pile of documents. These were  confidential expert opinions from which it could be concluded  that the Iryda is a good aircraft. Nowicki complained that, in  his recent statements, Minister Kolodziejczyk "made fools of the  Sejm deputies."    The Sejm deputies also pointed out that, under the  "Expenditures" section of the MON budget, a sum of Z400 billion  is listed as being devoted to the purchase of 152 passenger  cars, 150 terrain-passenger cars, and 10 buses, among other  things. "Perhaps the ministers would like to be driven around  in Mercedes cars. But they have no right to complain they have  no money for equipment," Nowicki concluded.    Through the president, Minister Kolodziejczyk has addressed  the Constitutional Tribunal with a question of whether forcing  MON to make these kinds of purchases is in accordance with the  legal system. He also voiced the reservation that, even if the  Tribunal disagrees with him, he will not buy the Iryda aircraft  in the version proposed by the Mielec-based plant.    "We want to purchase about 40 pieces, but they must be the  kind of equipment that would present combat value. For the  moment, Iryda is just a training and educational type of  aircraft," said Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki, MON spokesman, in a  determined manner.    General Henryk Mika, the director of MON's department for  arms and military equipment supplies, was surprised by the Sejm  deputies' accusations. "We are devoting Z120 billion for cars,  and these are financial means that the Army itself has come up  with. The only Western-made vehicles we have are the 16 Peugeot  405's that were manufactured in Lublin and are being tested now  because, in general, we purchase [Polish-made] Polonez cars," he  explained to GAZETA WYBORCZA.    According to a high-ranking MON official, the confusion  caused by the SLD Sejm deputies is "the communists' revenge for  the failure of Zbigniew Siemiatkowski's candidacy for the post  of deputy minister in MON."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by A. Quintal] </F>   [Text] Cape Town April 24 SAPA -- State President F W de  Klerk on Sunday [24 April] expressed shock and outrage at  Sunday's car bomb explosion in Johannesburg, saying crimes of  this nature would not stop the election. Nine people died and 92  others were injured when the car bomb ripped through several  streets in downtown Johannesburg shortly before 10AM on Sunday.    Reacting to the incident, Mr de Klerk said there was no  possibility that radical minorities would be allowed to  frustrate the will of the vast majority of the South African  people. "All they will achieve will be to add to the unnecessary  suffering of innocent citizens who have already suffered enough."    Mr de Klerk said the SA Police would do everything in their  power to bring the perpetrators to justice. Those responsible  for the blast would be tracked down relentlessly and punished  with the full rigour of the law.    President de Klerk also condemned the attack on African  National Congress members and Independent Electoral Commission  monitors in Ulundi on Saturday in which at least three people  were killed.</p>

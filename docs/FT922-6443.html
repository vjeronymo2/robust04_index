			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Sport: Luxury courses find themselves in the rough - Golf DO YOU remember when you could drive a VW Golf GTI without paying a four-figure sum in insurance and you were considered improperly dressed unless you carried a mobile phone? In those days, the late 1980s, it seemed that lavish golf course projects were being announced or opened every week. In England, Wisley, next to the Royal Horticultural Society's gardens, and Mill Ride, near Ascot, were just two, both set inside the golden circle of the M25 London orbital motorway. Each thought it was the acme of 21st century golf clubs. Another was East Sussex, near Gatwick airport. Nothing was too fanciful for the Pounds 32.5m project. It was modelled on the Augusta National golf course in Georgia, site of the US Masters. A special type of bent grass, common in the US but little-known in Britain, was sown on the two courses and more than 40 greenkeepers were employed to tend it. The announcement about East Sussex was made by Brian Turner, a Canadian entrepreneur, who was the driving force behind the lavish project that was going to have a 200-bedroom hotel, a 35,000 sq ft clubhouse and a pro's shop selling the best clothes and offering a hemming and tailoring service. Soon, East Sussex was competing for attention with a Pounds 52m venture comprising two championship courses and a luxury hotel to be built on the shores of Loch Lomond. The courses were to be designed by Tom Weiskopf and named the High Road and the Low Road. The clubhouse was to be the 200-year-old former family home of the Colquhoun family. There were at least two similarities between Loch Lomond and East Sussex. Both bid for the 1993 Ryder Cup on the principle that 'if you don't ask, you don't get'; and both were created by ambitious golf enthusiasts. Not to be left out, north-east England joined in with Slaley Hall, a Pounds 20m golf and country club 20 miles from Newcastle, in Northumberland. In those days, money - and dreams - were plentiful. Wherever you looked, golf courses were being planned or built. By the end of 1990, more than 1,000 applications to build courses had been made to local authorities in England alone. International Resort Holdings developed Collingtree Park in Northampton. In Essex, near Maldon, plans for a Pounds 20m leisure complex were laid. Quietwaters was to have the largest luxury hotel and leisure complex in Europe. The PGA European Tour were shareholders in the project and the renowned golfteacher, David Leadbetter, chose it as his UK teaching base. Then Britain's economy began to falter. At clubs like Wisley and Mill Ride, the supply of prospective members, who were being asked to buy debentures, dried up. 'The Japanese stock market has gone to hell and there are very few people of high net worth around these days,' says one developer with a sigh. Wisley and Mill Ride survived but one that did not was Loch Lomond. Receivers were called in late in 1990 and though one course has been completed and is open, no buyers are in sight. Weiskopf is cooling his heels in Arizona, anxious to get on with the second 18 holes. He has said that if he is unable to conclude his work at Loch Lomond it would be the biggest disappointment of his career. Then the bad news started to arrive from all quarters. Slaley Hall, described in its brochure as 'The Ultimate Dream,' went into receivership last summer with debts of more than Pounds 20m. Two months ago Broome Park, a club near Canterbury, Kent, went under and was quickly followed by Quietwaters. Last month shares in International Resort Holdings were suspended and the receivers were appointed eight days ago. East Sussex looked as though it might suffer a similar fate. Instead, Turner's extravagant dream has been given a new lease of life by new owners. Work on a Pounds 5m clubhouse began last month and will be completed by the end of May 1993. There are no longer 40 greenkeeping staff. A new chief executive has been appointed, the Hon John Sinclair, formerly operations director of the company operating Cliveden, the stately home hotel. 'Others may have failed but we have not,' says Ian Jones, chairman of Granfel and Thornbrook Properties, the companies that own East Sussex. 'We are continuing to invest and develop and in the Kuwaiti Investment Office we have one of the strongest financial backers in the City behind us.' I asked Jones why he thought so many projets had failed. 'Some were too ambitious and clearly over-extended themselves,' he said. 'Then came the report by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews calling for 700 new courses to be built by the end of the century. That got people going. Then there was some extra money around. I think people don't realise that golf itself doesn't bring in much money. What it does is bring associated capital developments on stream.' East Sussex's brighter future was emphasised on May 21 when it was announced it will host next year's European Open. The membership target has been revised to 500. 'We won't reach it in the immediate future,' said Jones. 'Last summer we gave money back to anyone who wanted to leave the club. There were about 10 per cent redemptions. But this was marked by a new take-up of debentures and annual membership. 'I don't know how long it will take for the price of golf in the UK to equate with other countries. At the moment some golfers pay more for one day's pheasant shooting than they do for one year's golf subscription.' On the other hand, he reckons that there seems to be demand for an 'extra special sort of club.' 'Still?' I asked? 'Yes, still,' he said. 'East Sussex is situated in the heart of the Sussex is the only major course in such a setting. It has natural rather than artificial features. It is being kept in good condition. Our golf revenue is up 50 per cent this year on last.' Perhaps mobile phones will make a comeback.</p>

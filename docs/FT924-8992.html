			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Fashion: Posing for the piste - It doesn't matter whether you are a ski bunny or a ski bum these days WAY BACK when, before there were triple chair lifts and rear-entry plastic boots, before automatic bindings and microfibre fabrics, dressing for the slopes was simple. What made it so was that there was hardly any choice - black (or possibly navy blue) ski pants and an assortment of anoraks that today would have them falling about with laughter in Blackburn was about all there was. Alas, for the simplicities of yesterday. Today you can choose your image - ski bunny, piste-basher, moody rebel, off-piste loner, kamikaze, ski-bum, Total Design Concept, Yuppie - and know there will be an outfit to match. What you wear is a reflection of who you are. The pistes and lift-queues are the fashion runways of the snows: what makes choosing difficult is that you do not get to see the shows until you have bought the clothes. Ski fashions, more than any other, are made by being seen, not on the fashion pages of glossy magazines. Most regular skiers will already have a reasonably functional set of clothing, and those who have been cautious will probably need to do little to update it. The big news (good for those like me who still have a pair lurking in the back of their wardrobe) is that one of the most prevalent looks takes its cue from street-fashion and focuses on the lean ski-pant - the snow version, if you like, of the legging. There is no need to spend a great deal of money on these - at C &amp; A, for example, they are selling for Pounds 49.99 - just make sure they are properly wind and waterproof. The silhouette is all: lean and long - tough, I know, if like me you are female and standard British height of 5 ft 2 in - and topped by a blouson. Given that most fashionable silhouettes will be skinny and black it is the blouson that will really catch the eye. Ralph Lauren, for instance, has some stunning military style jackets (see one sketched here below) reminiscent of last year's sell-out mainline collection. In black or white, trimmed with gold buttons, piping and epaulettes, they combine chic with utility - an amazingly difficult double to score. I vote them tops for this year's dernier cri award. You may - or may not - be sorry to hear that Ralph Lauren's gold leather ski jacket, which would otherwise have been my nomination, is sold out. Pounds 1,100 is not too much to pay, it seems, to create a stir on the ski slopes. You could, though, if you hurried, part with Pounds 800 for a gold sleeveless hooded ski jacket. Be sure, though, to wear it over something warm and waterproof. If you feel you are just a little too pear-shaped for itsy-bitsy blousons topping skintight ski-pants, then you will be relieved to hear that parka jackets are perfectly OK. They may lack the ultimate panache of a gold bomber jacket but they are capacious and they cover the rear most comfortingly. If you still have some of those fluorescent skisuits that were so fashionable an eye-blink ago, take my advice and confine them to the back of the cupboard. Muted colours are part of the new recession chic and this is as true on the ski slope as anywhere else. When it comes to colour there is, however, one curious exception: pink, it seems, is a classic of the snow set  -the little black dress, if you like, of the piste. Otherwise, Jacquard or changeant effects will be much in evidence - and if you are wondering what that that means, it is a now-you-see-it-now-you-don't two-colour effect. Set foot inside any ski-shop and you will see it everywhere - all the big manufacturers, from Luhta and Nevica to Degre 7 and Killy, have used it in some of their lines. If you are into heli-skiing, or are liable to find yourself on the top of windswept backbowls in the Rockies, you will need to consider the matter of function seriously. Degre 7 is a name to look out for. For about Pounds 595 (I am afraid if you want to be fashionable and comfortable you have to pay for it) you get what amounts to two suits in one. The Gore-Tex suit comes with a polar fleece lining which is detachable, a fantastic hood that really buttons-down, is wind-proof and has detachable sleeves. Bogner has a catsuit for those who are so sure of their technique (or possibly their silhouette) that they do not mind making sure that all eyes are upon them. Based on the skintight catsuit worn by the German team ski (remember them on television's Ski Sunday?) it has black and white legs and a black and red striped top (yours for Pounds 325). top In colder weather an over-the-head jacket picks up the black and white theme (Pounds 395). Alternatively there is Emmegi's champagne ski-suit, all washed elegance, perfect for ski bunnies heading up the mountain for nothing more taxing than a gluhwein and a yodel: Pounds 625, from Lillywhite's sports store in London. Ski-bunny's companion could fittingly escort her in some of Signor Giorgio Armani's latest numbers - for the first time the masterly Italian has come up with what he calls 'ski-inspired' clothing (the inspired indicating that they may look as if they are for skiing in but they are not really, because they are not waterproof). There are salopettes (nice in denim) at Pounds 250 a time, hooded jackets at Pounds 225, blousons at Pounds 195 and hooded parkas at Pounds 295. Finally, if there is one fabric that will be everywhere, it has to be polar fleece. Started by Patagonia, the eco-chic provider of rugged clothing to climbers, skiers and wilderness wanderers, it is now available at many prices and in many forms in all good ski shops. The Patagonia catalogue, incidentally, has a marvellously informative section on the art of layer dressing and weatherproofing. It is available from 24 Wilkinson Street, Sheffield, South Yorkshire S10 2GB. Tel: 0742-756-361.</p>

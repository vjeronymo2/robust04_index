			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia misses US grain loan repayment NEWS THAT Russia has again been suspended from a US grain credit guarantee programme because it had missed a payment deadline depressed grain prices slightly in Chicago yesterday morning, although traders did not yet believe that Russia's credit problems would reduce US grain exports. 'We see this as an ongoing saga. The USDA (US Department of Agriculture) is painting this as an operational problem that is based on Russia's lack of hard currency and the unfavourable dollar/rouble exchange rate,' said Mr Daniel Basse, grain analyst for Chicago-based AgResources. 'It's a pothole for the market.' For the second time in as many weeks, a US bank notified the USDA that Russia was behind on payment of US-backed agricultural loans. A missed payment automatically suspends Russia from the programme. The cash-poor country is dependent on credit guarantees for further grain purchases from the US. Russian officials in Moscow said yesterday payments would be made as quickly as possible, but did not suggest a payment date. The Dollars 4.5m payment from Russia was due on Monday. Last week, Russia was late on Dollars 10.9m in payment to four different banks. It was suspended from the USDA programme for one and a half days, until payment was forwarded. The problem is expected to intensify as payments in the three-year commercial loan programme fall due almost daily. Russia's has borrowed about Dollars 4.9bn in guaranteed loans since the programme started in January, 1991. Russia has already used most of its available loan guarantees. From this year's allocation the country has just Dollars 81m in credits for wheat and Dollars 30m for pork remaining. A second tranche of Dollars 275m in credit guarantees is expected to be allocated on January 1. Some lower-profile countries in the USDA food credit programme routinely miss payments and undergo temporary suspensions. Traders believe Russia's struggling economy may put that country on the same footing. Chicago wheat futures prices were hardest hit by the news, with wheat for December delivery closing down 4 1/2 cents at Dollars 3.75 1/4 a bushel. December maize futures closed 1 3/4 cents lower at Dollars 2.10 3/4 a bushel and January soyabeans closed down 4 cents at Dollars 5.59.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Government borrowing rises by 34% THE GOVERNMENT needed to borrow Pounds 4.69bn last month to finance public spending. This highlights the prospect of high deficits later in the year as a result of the economic slowdown. The high level of borrowing for April - which was up 34 per cent from the Pounds 3.49bn figure for the corresponding month last year - came about after allowing for higher-than-expected privatisation proceeds of Pounds 1.4bn. Of the total borrowing requirement, central government needed to find Pounds 3.25bn last month to cover the gap between spending and revenues. Local authorities borrowed Pounds 963m while public corporations took on an extra Pounds 396m of debt. In the three months to the end of April the total government deficit was more than Pounds 19bn, indicating how the recession has eaten into tax income. Government and private-sector economists expect a deficit of about Pounds 50bn for the financial year ending next March, up from a revised Pounds 36.7bn for the 1992-93 financial year. Central government receipts in April came to Pounds 17.88bn, with spending totalling Pounds 21.22bn. In the corresponding month last year the figures were Pounds 16.82bn and Pounds 19.66bn respectively. Without the contribution from privatisation proceeds the deficit for last month would have come to Pounds 6.06bn, after corresponding figures of Pounds 10.94bn in March and Pounds 5.90bn in February. About half of the Pounds 1.4bn privatisation proceeds in April came from the third call in the sale of shares in Scottish electricity companies.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-AIDE TOOK CAMPAIGN FUNDS, DYSON SAYS  </P> <P> Rep. Roy Dyson (D-Md.) said Monday that he has made "mistakes in judgment"  while in office and that his former top aide who committed suicide had  improperly pocketed campaign funds.  </P> <P> Dyson also said he was returning $18,000 in campaign contributions made by  officials connected to Unisys Corp., one of several defense contractors under  investigation for suspected violations of contract procurement regulations.  </P> <P> Dyson said his former top aide and campaign manager, Tom Pappas, improperly  pocketed nearly $7,300 in campaign funds. Pappas wrote $7,275 in checks to  other Dyson staff members and told them to give him the cash, Dyson said.  </P> <P> "I must accept ultimate responsibility for these errors in judgment because Tom  Pappas was my campaign manager," Dyson said. "I was not aware . . . . "  </P> <P> Pappas committed suicide in May, 1988, by jumping from a New York hotel after  newspaper reports that were highly critical of his management of Dyson's  congressional office.  </P></p>

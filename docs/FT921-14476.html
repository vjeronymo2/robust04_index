			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Brisk business on Beijing's back streets: Russian and Polish traders bartering with Chinese entrepreneurs FROM inside the heavy coat of a burly Russian the nose of a small Pekinese dog sniffs the cold air. The dog is worth Dollars 300 to the Russian who is hunting for a buyer among the Chinese stall-holders. He may trade it for silk jackets or heavy down-filled coats of many colours to sell in Moscow at a handsome profit to his fellow Russians, hungry for consumer goods of any kind. To a Chinese trader making thousands of yuan a month, a dog like this represents status, convincing evidence that he has made it. In the narrow alley in Beijing's diplomatic quarter, the silk market is lined with stalls, packed with Russian and Polish 'businessmen' and alive with tourists. Business is brisk and much of it is barter. From the Republic of Mongolia, adrift without Soviet aid and struggling to make the painful transition to a market economy, a middle-aged couple has arrived with a large Mongolian carpet, folded onto a suitcase trolley. They are asking only 500 yuan (Dollars 125). The stallholders, who each paid 3,000 yuan (Dollars 750) a few years back for their three-square-metre wooden shelters, small protection against the biting cold, shoo them away. They can't sell that here. Along the alley two blonde Russians trade telescopes, cameras, costume jewellery and watches. The Chinese stallholder who sells the goods on to the tourists displays hundreds of Soviet watches, their faces a pictorial history of recent events across the border. There is the perestroika watch, the George Bush meets Mikhail Gorbachev watch, the Boris Yeltsin timepiece and the Gorbachev, 'President of the USSR', watch. Already an antique, the stallholder claims, slicing his hand across his throat. The price is 520 yuan (Dollars 130). There won't be any more. He does not go into detail about the watch mechanisms. Here everything is for sale. A young woman in a stylish black fur hat bought in Hong Kong is repeatedly asked if she will sell it. Would I sell my tape-recorder? Russians and Poles are the market's main foreign customers. Many of them are regulars, flying in from the Russian Republic with dogs, watches or US dollars, and flying out again with up to 20 sacks of goods. In the early days the Yugoslavs were top dealers but their numbers have tailed off with the civil war. Some of them would fly in twice a month, the return fare of Dollars 800 from Belgrade easily recouped from the sales of the Chinese goods ferried back home. The stallholders are cagey about their business. A young man with permanent waved hair said business had slowed down since Christmas but he admitted to making Y2,000 to Y3,000 a month. The likelihood is a great deal more. In the murky interiors of the little wooden 'shops', screened by 'curtains' of multi-coloured jackets, the real business for many people is money changing - US dollars into renminbi, the non-convertible 'people's money'. The rate was up to 5.95 rmb to the dollar recently, but at the turn of the year was falling back to 5.9. The bargaining is hard. On the northern Sino-Soviet border it is a similar story. At Heihe the two-way flow of trade across the frozen Amur river suffered scarcely a hiccup through the turmoil of the Soviet coup attempt. The Russians swap watches, toys and garlic presses for Chinese tracksuits, sneakers, shampoo and bubble gum. As in Beijing's silk alley the consequences of communism's collapse in the former USSR is of little moment to the Chinese residents of Heihe. 'They leave us alone', the Beijing stallholder with the permanent wave said of the always watchful authorities. He used to be a factory worker earning Y150 a month. At the next stall two women, the younger one heavily made up, are shy about questions. 'Take me to America and I will tell you all the secrets of the business,' says the younger one, grinning broadly.</p>

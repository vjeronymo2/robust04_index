			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Labour council chief warms to contracting-out A MARKED shift in Labour's attitude to the contracting-out of services to the private sector was signalled yesterday by one of the party's senior local government leaders. Mr Jeremy Beecham, head of the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan Authorities and leader of Newcastle upon Tyne council, said that quality of service, not the identity of its provider, should be Labour's prime concern. Mr Beecham told the the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy's annual conference that he conceded 'pressure on the competitive tendering front will continue'. He added: 'Local government has to recognise that the public is not intrinsically interested in who is providing a service but in what kind of service they receive.' Labour fought the election committed to ending compulsory competitive tendering (CCT), a policy bitterly opposed by unions in local government. Instead, on Mr Beecham's initiative, it proposed to establish a quality commission charged with monitoring and spreading best practice. The commission would have been empowered to enforce tendering only as a last resort. Mr Beecham's endorsement of CCT yesterday was far from grudging. Pointing to the division it necessitated between a council's roles as purchaser and provider of services, he claimed it had 'caused a re-examination of performance, with generally beneficial results'. The emphasis, he said, ought to be on quality. 'The promotion of quality should assist local authorities in the competitive process, providing we ensure that quality is written into contract specifications, (and) that we are equipped to monitor performance whether of our own workforce or the private sector.' A report last week by the Institute of Public Finance revealed that a majority of local authorities now contract out at least one of their main services to the private sector. A fifth of them were found to contract out three or more services. It also showed private-sector competition to be intensifying. Mr Beecham's remarks will have wide ramifications, both among Labour councillors and the party's soon-to-be-elected leadership.</p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Brussels probes CD 'dumping' by Japanese SEVERAL Japanese electronics manufacturers are facing an investigation by the European Commission into allegations that they have been dumping compact disc (CD) players in European markets. European consumer electronics makers, including Philips and Grundig, have complained to the Commission that the dumping has been going on throughout Europe and anti-dumping duties have been circumvented by routing CD player imports through Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. The CD players being dumped into European markets were 40 per cent cheaper than comparable models shipped from Japan, according to a Philips representative. One Japanese manufacturer expressed surprise at the allegations. It claimed Philips itself had shown a CD player at a trade show in April priced at Pounds 99, which it said was 29 per cent cheaper than its cheapest model. 'We were flabbergasted. I think it is an example of a non-competitive industry unable to compete and therefore fighting in another way,' the manufacturer declared. The European market for CD players has been dominated by Japanese makers. Rankings in the home audio market in Europe by BIS Strategic Decisions, the market consultancy, place Sony at the top followed by Panasonic/Technics and Pioneer, with Philips fourth.</p>

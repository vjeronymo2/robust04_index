			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / US forces stage Haiti invasion exercise The Pentagon yesterday confirmed reports that more than 1,000 elite special forces troops staged exercises two weeks ago in the south-east US and Gulf of Mexico designed to simulate an invasion of Haiti, writes Jeremy Kahn from Washington. Similar rehearsals were conducted before the US invasion of Panama in 1989. The White House insists it is still pursuing economic sanctions against Haiti's military junta and that armed intervention is not imminent. A Navy amphibious assault group carrying 2,000 Marines meanwhile, set sail yesterday for Haiti's waters, where it will be on station in the event US citizens or other foreigners need to be evacuated from the troubled country.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The high-handed  Japanese police crackdown upon organizations of the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) has been  protested unremittingly by Chongnyon organizations and Korean  residents across Japan and Japanese political party and  organizations, the Tokyo-based Korean news service reported.    Officials and Korean residents under the Kyoto prefectural  headquarters of Chongnyon went to the prefectural police on June  8 to express their resentment at the authorities' refusal to  make an apology. They strongly urged the police to make an  apology in a responsible manner and show sincere attitude and  action.    The Japan Social-democratic Party [JSDP] has conducted  positive activities to investigate the truth behind the police  crackdown on the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and  lodge a strong protest with it.    It decided at the Tuesday meeting of its leading officials  and at the Wednesday general meeting of its Dietmen to send a  fact-finding team to Kyoto and actively call the authorities to  account for it at the Diet.    Inquiries were made at the judicial affairs committee of the  Japanese Diet on June 7 by Tomio Sakagami and, on June 8, at  the Budget Committee by Sekisuke Nakanishi and at the Judicial  Affairs Committee by Tatsukuni Komori, accusing the authorities  of their unjust and illegal search.    The JSDP Nagano prefectural headquarters, prefectural  government centre and prefectural people's council, in joint  name, and the chief of the JSDP Miyagi prefectural headquarters  made public protest statements and sent them to the Kyoto  prefectural police authorities. The 67th regular meeting of the  Fukuoka prefectural Teachers' Union adopted a special  resolution, and decided that all its branch organizations should  take an emergency act of sending protest telegrams to the prime  minister and the chief of the Kyoto prefectural police  headquarters.    Korean residents under Higashiosaka and Minamiosaka branches  of the Chongnyon Osaka prefectural headquarters staged protests  against the Osaka prefectural police headquarters and the  Higashi police station. Delegates of the Federation of Korean  Traders and Industrialists in Japan and the League of Korean  Youth in Japan joined in the struggle, encouraging compatriots  in Osaka prefecture.    The chairman of the Higashiosaka Council for Japan-Korea  Friendship, a representative of the Nishigobe Society for the  Study of Korean Affairs and delegates of the Amagasaki Society  for the Study of Japanese-Korean affairs in their respective  protest messages published in front of the Osaka prefectural  police headquarters condemned the unjustifiable police search  and encouraged Korean residents.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 27 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton announced top level shakeups of the White House this  afternoon, appointing White House management and budget director  Leon Panetta to replace Mack McLarty as the White House chief of  staff.    Announcing the shakeups in his Oval Office at the White  House, Clinton named Ms. Alice Rivlin, deputy director of the  White House Office of Management and Budget, to succeed Panetta,  becoming the first woman to head the White House Office of  Management and Budget.    David Gergen, a White House senior adviser, would move to  the  U.S. State Department as a special adviser to both President  Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.    McLarty, Clinton's lifelong friend, has been widely  criticized as "too nice" to be effective.    Speaking from his Oval Office, Clinton said the shakeups  were  first suggested by McLarty who would remain a senior counselor  to the President.    Clinton said McLarty "has been and will continue to be most  closest and most trusted personal adviser," taking greater  responsibility in promoting the administration's agenda on  capital hill.    No one in Washington has a better understanding of both ends  of Pennsylvania Avenue (the White House and Congress) than Leon  Panetta, Clinton said of his new chief of staff.    In his brief remarks at the announcement, Panetta known as a  deficit hawk signaled a wider shakeups, saying that "changes  will be made in consultation with the President."    David Gergen, a former Republican adviser who joined the  White House staff a year ago to help deal with a spate of  negative publicity, made clear, however, that he doesn't intend  to remain long in the administration.    Clinton made the changes as debate heated up on his health  care proposal and as the dollar came under intense pressure on  world currency markets, observers here said.    The changes also come at a time when Clinton's approval  ratings are declining. A recent poll said only 42 percent of  Americans gave the President a positive rating, they noted.</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Unit trust sales remain strong - At a Glance Net unit trust sales fell last month to Pounds 976m but this was still the second highest monthly figure this year and the best April figure on record. Strong sales of unit trust personal equity plans (Peps) had contributed to making March the best month ever, with net sales of Pounds 1.37bn. But April 5 signalled the end of the rush to buy tax-free Peps for the last financial year. Private investors accounted for 73 per cent of net sales last month. UK equity income and international growth were the most popular sectors for private investors, while institutions preferred the fund-of-funds and UK growth sectors.</p>

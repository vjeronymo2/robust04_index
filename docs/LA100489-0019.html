			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> A museum devoted to the art, films and archives of Andy Warhol will be  established in an old industrial building in the late artist's native  Pittsburgh, it was announced Tuesday by the Carnegie Institute, whose Carnegie  Museum of Art will operate the facility. The museum is scheduled to open in  1992 and will be one of the first in the United States to exhibit the work of a  single artist on the scale of the Picasso Museum in Paris. The core of the  museum's collection -- more than 700 paintings, prints, drawings, sculptural  works, films and videotapes -- will be donated by the Andy Warhol Foundation  for the Visual Arts and the Dia Art Foundation, both of New York.

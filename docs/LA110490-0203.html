			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUTUAL FUNDS: CLOSED-END FUNDS ARE A BARGAIN DURING SLUMP  </P> <P> There's something inherently gratifying about getting a bargain, whether it's a  knickknack for the house or an investment. Among mutual funds, the red-tag  sales are being held in the closed-end department.  </P> <P> Even in normal times, most closed-end funds sell below their "net asset value,"  or NAV -- the per-share worth of the securities held. At the moment, with the  stock and bond markets in a slump, there are more potential bargains than  usual. "We're seeing some of the best buying opportunities in years," declares  Thomas J. Herzfeld, head of Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, a closed-end money  management and research firm based in Miami.  </P> <P> Closed-end funds are diversified, professionally managed portfolios that invest  in stocks, bonds and, occasionally, other assets. Unlike regular, open-end  mutual funds, they don't routinely sell new shares to investors at the current  NAV (plus a load, if applicable), nor do they buy them back.  </P> <P> Instead, the number of shares in a closed-end fund stays more or less fixed and  the prices of these shares fluctuate on the open market, like an individual  stock or bond. This creates the possibility of a closed-end portfolio selling  above or below its NAV -- at a premium or discount, respectively.  </P> <P> Closed-end funds number more than 250, with most trading on the New York or  American stock exchanges. When shopping, examine a fund's dividend policy,  management, expense ratio, performance and other factors. "But if you had to  pick one variable . . . it would have to be the discount or premium," Herzfeld  says.  </P> <P> Barron's tracks discounts and premiums weekly, as does the Wall Street Journal  on Mondays (stock funds) and Wednesdays (bond funds). Prices are listed daily  in the stock tables of The Times and other newspapers.  </P> <P> As noted, most closed-end portfolios tend to trade at discounts. This in itself  doesn't guarantee a profit, because the markdown could widen or the value of  the underlying holdings could drop.  </P> <P> But if you buy a closed-end fund well below its NAV, you increase your chances  for long-term success. "A wide discount provides some cushion," says Douglas  Dent, editor of Cappiello's Closed-End Fund Digest, a newsletter based in Santa  Barbara. Currently, closed-end bond and foreign stock funds appear to offer  some of the better buys. Several fixed-income selections are selling at  double-digit discounts, with yields in the 12% to 15% range, Dent says.  </P> <P> Portfolios with large concentrations of junk bonds have fared especially poorly  and thus could offer good returns if the market stabilizes. "The pure junk bond  funds are totally out of favor. Some are selling at discounts of 40% to 50%,  and their yields are as high as 25%," says Roger Wilson, president of Northwest  Quadrant, a money management firm in Newport Beach. At such steep markdowns,  several of these funds will probably prove to be good investments over the long  haul, he says, even if some of their junk holdings default, which is probable.  </P> <P> More appealing in Wilson's view are medium-quality portfolios that typically  hold combinations of U.S. government bonds, foreign government bonds and junk.  Some lately have traded at discounts as high as 20%, with yields of about 15%,  he adds.  </P> <P> If interest rates decline, that would push up the prices of good-quality bonds,  although junk issues could stay depressed, at least until the economy  strengthens.  </P> <P> Money managers and researchers who follow closed-end funds believe that the  market for these securities is relatively inefficient, which might explain why  discounts sometimes widen so drastically. Individuals, not institutions,  account for most of the buying and selling. As a result, many closed-end funds  are less well-researched than, say, blue chip stocks or highly rated corporate  bonds.  </P> <P> Observers blame Wall Street, at least in part, for the current wide discounts  on equity and bond funds. Brokers earn more selling closed-end investments as  new issues rather than in the after-market and thus tend to neglect the  securities after they come out, Dent says. In fact, the price of a new  closed-end portfolio will generally drop by the amount that goes to brokers as  compensation. For this reason, it's often wise to avoid the funds when they  debut.  </P> <P> Many closed-end selections, including the foreign stock portfolios, are managed  by U.S. firms that also run regular, open-end mutual funds, often with a  similar investment slant. This entails some interesting implications.  </P> <P> For example, if you find a closed-end selection managed by a company you like,  you can buy the firm's expertise at a discount to what you might pay for a  similar open-end fund.  </P> <P> In addition, you can avoid the sales fee that many fund groups charge.  Alliance, American Capital, Colonial, Massachusetts Financial Services (MFS),  John Nuveen, Putnam, Templeton and Van Kampen Merritt are among the many load  companies that also manage closed-end portfolios.  </P> <P> Of course, you must still pay a broker's commission when buying or selling a  closed-end fund as you would on a stock transaction.  </P> <P> It's important to emphasize that even if you buy a fund at a discount, you  won't necessarily make money. That discount can always widen, and the value of  the underlying holdings can decline. Wilson expects to see lower prices -- and  potentially better buys -- during the next several weeks as disheartened  investors dump their closed-end funds to lock in tax losses before year-end.  </P> <P> On the other hand, some closed-end managers plan to convert their funds to  open-end status, which would eliminate discounts. Sometimes the firm will  voluntarily put the question up to a shareholder vote; in other cases a  corporate raider may force the issue.  </P> <P> "Either managements on their own are taking what might be viewed as drastic  measures to narrow the discounts, or shareholders are giving them a push," says  Herzfeld, who adds that the number of conversions has increased this year as  discounts have widened.  </P> <P> FUNDS AT A DISCOUNT  </P> <P> Closed-end portfolios offer the diversification and professional management of  mutual funds, yet they trade like stocks, with prices determined by investors  in the open market. At the moment, scores of closed-end funds are trading at  substantial discounts to their "net asset value," or per-share worth of the  underlying holdings. The following funds, all of which trade on the New York  Stock Exchange, are among those favored by the advisers quoted in the  accompanying column.  </P> <P> FOREIGN STOCK FUNDS  </P> <TABLE

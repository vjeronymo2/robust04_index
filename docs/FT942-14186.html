			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Observer: Preaching and practising Shouldn't MBA students take a few courses in anthropology? Tram-line thinking and peer pressure are the sins of business these days, reckons Robert Waterman, in London to push his latest book, The Frontiers of Excellence. Waterman argues that companies which look after staff and customers also do shareholders a power of good. Commonsense stuff, surely? 'Not really. Management theory is still largely predicated on 18th century principles, that is 'be nice to the workers because they're really dumb, it's the boss's function to be smart'.' A former McKinsey executive, Waterman, 57, himself exemplifies the kind of individual creativity - he turns out excellent watercolour and oil paintings  -he says companies should relish. In the 1970s he took a lengthy sabbatical from McKinsey to go back-packing round the world with wife and two adolescent children - very odd by McKinsey standards of the time. 'We used to say you could be weird on one dimension and get away with it; but be weird on two and you'd get fired.' Still, the theorist now has his work cut out trying to turn round the fortunes of the US software producer ASK, on whose board Waterman sits. ASK has recently narrowly avoided going under - ironically and depressingly, Waterman admits, by having to deploy some of the tough cost-cutting tactics his book deplores. 'We've got to be fairly ruthless or the whole thing might go down - that's how I defend myself to my wife, anyway.'</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Property companies Investment property companies have vigorously resisted the new FRS3 accounting standard, arguing it makes a mockery of their reported figures. Profits from investment companies should reflect the revenue earned from letting space, they say. It should not include capital gains and losses generated from churning portfolios. Having failed to persuade the Accounting Standards Board, property companies have now adopted another tack. Both MEPC and British Land have simply continued to report headline profits, ignoring capital items. The FRS3 numbers are included but given far less prominence. The property companies' case is compelling. There is even a danger that FRS3 widens the scope for abuse. Given that profits or losses on disposals are calculated on carrying values, this makes it possible to massage stated profits by manipulating the timing of valuations and sales. As the Queens Moat Houses episode has shown, property valuation is a tricky business. That said, it is dangerous to view revenue profits in isolation. The values a property company realises from disposals is clearly a critical financial indicator and may reflect on the quality of its remaining portfolio.</p>

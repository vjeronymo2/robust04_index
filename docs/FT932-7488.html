			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Call for EMS warning system: EC finance ministers back tighter surveillance to aid realignments EUROPEAN Community finance ministers yesterday backed a call by central bank governors for the creation of an 'early warning system' to avoid a repetition of last September's crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. The idea is to tighten surveillance of exchange rates and strengthen the consensus among members in favour of timely realignments. It came at an informal meeting in Kolding, Denmark, at the weekend which ended with a ringing endorsement of the European Monetary System. The UK found no support for its argument that the EMS's exchange rate mechanism contains 'fault-lines' which were responsible for the forced exit of sterling and the Italian lira last September. Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, said in Kolding it would be 'two, three years, and possibly even longer' before the UK re-entered the ERM, mainly because of the distorting effects on interest rates of German unification. A senior Italian official suggested that the lira would re-enter the ERM after electoral reform was in place and a new government came to power. At the meeting, Mr Lamont repeated a call for lower interest rates in Europe and criticised Germany for its tight monetary policy. 'There are growing fears about the direction of policy in Europe. We are heading for a recession,' he said. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, agreed interest rates were 'unnecessarily high'. But he appeared satisfied after EC finance ministers gave him a mandate for putting the growth and employment debate at the top of the EC summit in Copenhagen next month. Two reports on the EMS - one by the committee of central bank governors and one by the EC's monetary committee, which comprises central bankers and senior national treasury officials - both concluded that the system was fundamentally sound. They seek to reaffirm collective discipline, noting that in last year's crisis individual member states failed to take the initiative to defend their currencies or take part in a realignment. The reports blame the crisis on significant economic divergence between members, a development exacerbated by the shock of German unification which led to an 'unbalanced mix' between German monetary and fiscal policy. However, they make clear that member states failed to heed fundamental economic indicators and take the initiative in realigning their currencies. A central recommendation, therefore, is to create new, confidential procedures to make a persuasive case that a central rate is out of line. The central bank governors offered to play a role in this surveillance exercise, but the EC monetary committee also put itself forward. It suggested creating a set of confidential economic indicators which member states could then use to put the case for a change in central rates.

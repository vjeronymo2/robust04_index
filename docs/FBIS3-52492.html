			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Clashes Between Turks and Kurds </F> in Brussels"]    [Text] Dear listeners, hundreds of Turks attacked a group  of Kurds in Brussels early on 2 January. The Kurds were  preparing for a demonstration. Reports said that the Turks  tried to obstruct some 200 Kurds from organizing a demonstration  in the northern part of the city. A clash broke out and 11  people were hurt.    According to political circles, one of the reasons for the  recent clashes between the Turks and the pro-Kurdish Workers  Party [PKK] supporters in Germany is the continuation of the  pro-PKK activities in that country. Although the German  Government banned the activities of the PKK and the  organizations affiliated with it in November 1993, the PKK  supporters have maintained their activities to a certain degree.  Most probably, that state of affairs has made the Turkish  Government uneasy.    Considering their political relations with Turkey, Germany  and several other countries in Europe decided to obstruct the  PKK's activities toward the end of 1993. However, the measures  they took were not enough to completely obstruct the PKK.  Several experts on Turkey are convinced that the supporters of  the Turkish Government in Europe are trying to help Turkey  obstruct the PKK activities, regardless of the effective  measures Ankara has taken against that organization. In view of  that, the incidents in Brussels can be assessed from that  viewpoint as well. Needless to say, similar incidents may occur  in various parts of Europe in the future.    The Turkish Government is trying to get PKK's activities  under control by improving diplomatic relations with Western  countries, particularly those in which that organization is  active. Furthermore, it uses its military forces to crush the  PKK in Turkey. However, intellectual circles are convinced that  both Turkey and the PKK must adopt a moderate approach and make  a more serious effort to hold talks to resolve their problem.</p>

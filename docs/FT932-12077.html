			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Guardian likely to take over Observer THE FUTURE of the Observer, Britain's oldest Sunday newspaper, looked secure last night after an agreement in principle to sell it to the Guardian. Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, said it had received an 'acceptable' offer from the Guardian and Manchester Evening News for the paper which was founded on December 4 1791. The offer will be put to the Observer board on Tuesday. The board is likely to accept the deal, believed to be worth around Pounds 25m. It will then be put to Lonrho's board. Newspaper Publishing, which publishes the rival Independent and its Sunday stablemate, was informed that its attempts to buy the paper had failed. Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, chief executive, said that negotiations between the two companies broke down on Wednesday. Mr Donald Trelford said yesterday that he would continue as editor and chief executive of the Observer until the transfer to new ownership had been completed. Last night, Mr Jonathan Fenby, deputy editor of the Guardian, was being tipped as a strong candidate to succeed him. Mr Peter Preston, editor of the Guardian, said the paper would take over the Observer fully at the end of August. The deal represents a compromise between Lonrho's two joint chief executives, Mr Dieter Bock, who was determined to sell the Observer, and Mr Tiny Rowland, who has twice blocked attempts to sell it in the past year. Lonrho's share price yesterday rose by 5 1/2 p to 93 1/2 p, reflecting the fact that the group's biggest lossmaking asset is to be sold. Last year, the Observer made a loss of Pounds 14.9m and was expected to lose at least Pounds 9m this year. The Guardian's business plan envisages that the Observer could break even in the first year because of the savings involved in the operation. It is expected to take on between 60 and 65 of the Observer's 80 journalists. Asked whether it would be a seven-day operation, Mr Preston said: 'It will have a more distinct voice than that.' Mr Preston, quoted in today's Guardian, said: 'Our overriding aim is clear: to help publish an editorially-independent and vibrant Observer.' Mr Whittam Smith said: 'A false impression of the nature of discussions between Newspaper Publishing and Lonrho has been allowed to develop unchallenged.' He said his intention never was to close the Observer. Guardian of tradition, Page 16</p>

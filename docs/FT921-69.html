			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Structural flaws put cracks in the surveying business: David Barchard and Neil Buckley find smaller companies are struggling for survival CRACKS are appearing in a profession better known for detecting structural flaws for its clients. Surveying and valuation, the business that lives off the housing market, is threatening to split apart as the recession depresses property demand. With the British housing market going through what is generally held to be its worst depression this century, many small surveyors and valuers feel they are in a desperate battle for survival against the larger firms. One Scottish surveyor and valuer says: 'When I set up on my own, I didn't realise that, unlike the big surveyor firms, it would be practically impossible for me to get on the lenders' panels. And unless you are on the panel, you can really forget about doing much residential business.' Similar complaints from smaller surveyors have already prodded the Office of Fair Trading into making a preliminary inquiry, although an official at the OFT says privately that there have been few, if any, complaints from the public. The main grouse of smaller surveyors is that mortgage lenders, meaning mostly the high street building societies, deliberately restrict access to their panels. 'It seems to be very hard to get on to these panels,' the same Scottish surveyor says. 'And of course you lose face if you have to tell your customer that some banks and most large building societies will not accept you.' Larger surveyors and valuers seem generally to be included on the panels of most large UK mortgage lenders. Yet, is size what determines eligibility for joining a panel? There is a widespread suspicion that the large lenders want only surveyors who can put mortgage business their way. One small surveyor says: 'They (the building societies) say 'You must be on our panel', so you say to them 'Fine, how do I get on to your panel?' and they say 'We expect reciprocal business'.' Mr Paul Wisbey of Wisbey Associates at Ware, Hertfordshire, says: 'Quite honestly, it will not be very long before there are few sole traders left in surveying because, if you are not on the panel and cannot get the valuation as a result, then the instructions walk away from you.' Providing reciprocal business is supposed not to be a precondition for membership of a panel, although some large surveyors say that passing on mortgage business is quite natural once a firm gets on to a panel. Building Societies are in theory subject to instructions issued by the Building Societies Association in 1979 telling them that reciprocal business should not be a 'driving condition' for selecting a valuer for a panel. Halifax and Abbey National deny that they make finding mortgages a prerequisite of accepting a surveyor on to a panel. Surveyors claim the practice may be imposed by individual managers rather than laid down by head office. Either way, building societies seem committed to operating through panels of surveyors. Abbey National says: 'There are considerable advantages to confining our surveys to surveyors that we know, and who understand our training and reporting methods. With a known panel of surveyors, we can ensure that we get high quality.' Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's chief surveyor agrees. Many large lenders go a step further and try to handle surveys and valuations themselves where they can, and some say they are already doing more than half their business that way. Another reason widely given by lenders for not working with small surveyors is that in the past some small surveyors have colluded with solicitors in mortgage fraud. House buyers who chose their own surveyor may end up paying substantially more, because they are instructed by a building society to use another firm for the valuation. The buyer may also be at risk from conflicts of interest. With estate agencies in many cases owned by lenders, different arms of the same organisation may find themselves acting for the vendor and offering the buyer a surveyor. To avoid that, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is considering a scheme under which purchasers would receive a letter warning of the possible conflict. The buyer would then give consent for the work to go ahead. That solution is criticised by the small firms outside the panels. They claim that the rules over conflict of interest cannot be changed without consumers suffering. 'The purchaser is not going to get genuinely independent advice,' says one surveyor. 'He will be caught up in a cartel.' Mr Robin Shipton, of Associated Surveyors of Swindon, Wilts, sums up the views of smaller surveyors. 'The business is being concentrated in the hands of fewer and fewer players. But it is very hard to see how it can be stopped.'</p>

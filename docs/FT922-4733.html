			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / People: Prentice to bond boutique Sheldon Prentice, one of a diminishing group of bankers to have stayed the course in the Eurobond market since its early days, has been appointed non-executive chairman of Luthy Baillie Dowsett Pethick &amp; Co, a London-based firm which specialises in trading illiquid Eurobonds. The firm was set up two years ago by four other old hands of the Euromarket, Peter Luthy, Iain Baillie, John Dowsett and Jan Pethick. Prentice left Salomon Brothers last December after a career spanning nearly 20 years. He joined the firm in New York in 1973, then moved to London in 1977, where he ran the new issues business of Salomon Brothers International for close to 15 years, latterly as a managing director of the company. He was also on the board of the International Primary Markets Association, a trade association for banks and securities firms active as arrangers of Eurobond issues. He succeeds Andrew Large who resigned to take up the chairmanship of the Securities and Investments Board.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Tyssovskiy: </F> "Meeting in the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation"]    [Text] Moscow, 29 Apr--Minister of Defense of the Russian  Federation Pavel Grachev emphasized a significant congruence of  the Russian and Israeli military doctrines after talks with  Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister and minister of defense of Israel.  The meeting lasted more than an hour.    Pavel Grachev noted the importance of comprehensive  cooperation, including military, between Russia and Israel. Of  course, he said, after the first meeting we could not examine in  detail the possibilities that are opening up to us. But there is  already a mechanism to put these plans into effect: An Israeli  military attache has begun to operate in Moscow and the staff of  the Russian military attache in Israel will go to work in Israel  at the end of April or beginning of May. We will entrust them  with the elaboration of the corresponding program. As minister  of defense, our guest asked me to make an official visit to  Israel and there we will sketch the outline of our future  bilateral relations in the military area.    The prime minister of Israel declared that the Russian  leadership and above all President of Russia Boris Yeltsin  assured him of Russia's striving to achieve peace in the Middle  East. That same striving is something that we share, I. Rabin  said, although we have different ties and relations with third  countries. But when the goals are identical, the corresponding  interests arise, which, I hope, will lead to the successful  conclusion of Arab-Israeli negotiations.</p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Sharp fall in Canadian inflation Canada recorded a year-on-year inflation rate of just 1.6 per cent in January, the smallest rise in 21 years, Statistics Canada reported yesterday, Bernard Simon reports from Toronto. The sharp drop from the 3.8 per cent rise in the consumer price index registered last December and a peak of 6.8 per cent in January 1991 were mainly due to elimination from year-on-year calculations of the one-off impact of the 7 per cent goods and services tax, imposed in at the beginning of last year.</p>

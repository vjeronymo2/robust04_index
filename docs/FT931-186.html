			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Management: Are you driving a good bargain? - John Griffiths answers questions on company cars raised by tax changes in this month's UK Budget Q: A new system for taxing company cars comes into effect from April 6 1994. What are its most significant features? A: The most significant is that the amount of tax paid by individuals on their company car will be based wholly on a percentage of the manufacturer's 'list' price, or recommended retail price. The current system comprises five scale charge bands, at the lower end of which are three determined by engine size with the other two - for executive and luxury cars - defined by the original market value of the car. These will remain in place during the financial year 1993-94. As a result of the change there will no longer be any benefit to an employee if his or her company negotiates a discount with the manufacturer (a common practice at the moment which can help put the car into a cheaper scale charge band). Under the new rules an individual will pay tax on 35 per cent, 23.3 per cent or 11.2 per cent of a car's list price, depending on whether he or she covers less than 2,500 business miles, 2,500 to 18,000, or more than 18,000 miles respectively. This plays havoc with the tax bills of distinct categories of drivers who are clearly under-taxed at the moment. Most notable are executives driving well-equipped cars with prices deliberately pitched just below the current price band thresholds of Pounds 19,250 and Pounds 29,000, above which the scale charge rises significantly. There are estimated to be several hundred thousand drivers of these 'tax break specials'. Currently they pay the same scale charge as someone driving a basic, 1.6 litre 'sales rep' car costing Pounds 7,000 less. This is because the lower bands - under 1.4 litres, 1.4 to 2 litres and over 2 litres - are based solely on engine size. It is these drivers who face scale charge increases of up to 60 per cent under the list price system and for whom, says Brian Friedman, managing director of Stoy Benefit Consulting, 'a cash alternative will now be a lot more attractive'. Q: We have delayed replacing our company cars because of recession but many are now high mileage and will have to be changed during 1993-94, when the current banded scale charge system will still apply. What pitfalls should we look out for in replacing these cars? Are there some cars which, though currently tax effective, would incur significant penalties - for employer or employee - under the new system? A: Executives driving 'tax break specials' should think hard about whether the perceived status of their existing cars is worth the substantial extra tax penalty involved from next year. What these charges will be can be seen in the two right-hand graphs, which plot the incoming list price system against 1993-94 scale charge bands for drivers in the 'perk' car category (under 2,500 business miles) and for the majority of company car drivers, namely those covering between 2,500 and 18,000 business miles. (Mileage bands will be carried over from the current system.) For example, a driver who runs a Pounds 19,000 car, under 2 litres, will have to trade down to a car costing around Pounds 12,500 if he wishes to avoid an increased tax bill. Companies should clearly encourage this sort of reassessment, because the lower the list price the lower the company's own costs, including pro rata National Insurance Contribution reductions. There is, incidentally, no tax advantage in buying a nearly new car of high specification instead of a cheaper new one; the new legislation taxes cars up to four years old in the same way as new ones. Nor is there much point in hoping for change in succeeding Budgets. A basic requirement of the new system was that it should be self-adjusting, thus ending for the motor industry those traditional pre-Budget sales droughts caused by uncertainty. As list prices drift up post-1994, percentage scale charges will automatically drift up with them. At the top of the market - cars above Pounds 40,000 - there is nothing but misery in store for drivers and manufacturers. Rolls-Royce is already appealing to the government to 'cap' the scale charge above a certain price level. It is not hard to see why: the scale charge for 1993-94 on a 'perk' user of a car costing more than Pounds 29,000 will be Pounds 15,060, no matter how expensive it is. From 1994-95 the scale charge on a Pounds 100,000 Rolls will be Pounds 35,000. Critics say the new system could destroy the 'supercar' market embodied by vehicles such as Jaguar's Pounds 415,000 XJ220, which will incur a scale charge of nearly Pounds 150,000 as a 'perk'. Q: Is the new system likely to affect the structure of the new car market, in particular prices and their rate of increase? A: According to Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, the new system could strike 'a bigger blow for the convergence of car prices in Europe than anything the EC has done'. Under the current banding system, whether the employer has obtained a discount on car purchases has not mattered much to drivers of cheaper company car drivers because their tax scale charge is determined by engine capacity. 'Tax break special' drivers have usually benefited, in that a discount may have helped squeeze a car into a lower tax band. But because the 1994 scheme will be based strictly on published list prices, ignoring all discounts, employees and employers will for the first time have a united interest in seeing list prices kept as low as possible. Inevitably this will strengthen the current trend towards lower dealer margins - Vauxhall, Peugeot, Rover and latterly Ford have cut their dealers' margins to 10 per cent on some models, from the usual 16-17 per cent. Their scope for haggling will be reduced. But analysts such as Stewart Whyte, director of the Fleet Audits Consultancy and spokesman for the 500-member Association of Car Fleet Operators, are united in thinking it will also change the structure of manufacturers' product offerings and mark the return of cheap 'no-frills' cars, devoid of any extras, which were once the hallmark of the UK 'reps' car market of the 1960s. Q: We are considering 'buying out' our company cars with the offer of a cash alternative. What factors need to be taken into account in arriving at a fair valuation? Are there general guidelines or does each employee's circumstances need to be taken into account? A: The main cost ingredients of running a car, for both company and private motorist, are set out in the top left-hand chart. The buy-out decision requires complex calculations involving variables such as the mix of business mileage to private, cost of finance, foregone interest, mileage rate for use of private car on business. Just how difficult even some of the most sophisticated companies have found it to calculate cash compensation can be seen in the wide variation in valuations contained in the other table. A number of tax consultancies have recently developed complex computer models for making these evaluations. But the cost of running a company's entire fleet through them could be substantial. Q: This has been a harsh recession in which thousands of companies have closed and nearly 2m jobs lost. Our employees are lucky to be in work. Why shouldn't we get rid of 'perk' cars with no, or only partial, compensation? A: In most cases, the right to a car of a certain specification is likely to be contained in contracts of employment. Its withdrawal without agreed compensation would represent a change in terms and conditions of employment tantamount to constructive dismissal. Receivers remain bemused by how many companies are still going under with uncut, self-indulgent car fleets.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- THE HIGH COST OF RUNNING A CAR  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TO COMPANY Over 3 years              Lower           Upper           Executive and 45,000 miles      range car       range car           range car                        (Pounds)        (Pounds)            (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Depreciation              5,500           8,000              12,750 Funding                   2,175           2,850               3,788 Fuel*                     2,550           2,879               3,432 Maintenance*                945           1,200               1,675 NIC                         240             325                 325 VED/Admin                   675             675                 675 Insurance                 1,650           1,650               1,650  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                    13,735          17,579              24,295  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TO PRIVATE MOTORIST Over 3 years              Lower           Upper           Executive and 45,000 miles      range car       range car           range car                        (Pounds)        (Pounds)            (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Depreciation              5,250           7,500              12,325 Funding                   2,434           3,218               4,236 Fuel*                     2,688           3,084               3,616 Maintenance*                993           1,052               1,616 NIC                           -               -                   - VED/Admin                   420             420                 420 Insurance                 1,500           2,100               3,000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                    13,285          17,374              25,213  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Company can reclaim VAT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Top Pay Unit, Fleet Audits  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

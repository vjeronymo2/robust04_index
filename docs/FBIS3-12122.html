This coalition, regrouping MDN [Mobilization For  National Development], FRAPH [Front for Haitian Advancement and  Progress], CARENA [Action Committee for National  Reconciliation], and CCGN [Group of Citizens of the Greater  North] chose the seventh anniversary of the Constitution to  submit its resolution bill for parliamentary approval. It should  also be pointed out that the Chamber of Deputies vice president  presented his reflections on the 1987 Constitution to the press.  Edner Jean filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Jean] On Constitution Day, very few  legislators responded to the invitation from the office of the  Chamber of Deputies. The parliament's commemoration of the  seventh anniversary of our fundamental charter could have been  as dull as the rest of the country's except for this reflection  by Vice President Mac-Ferl Morquette on the importance of the  Constitution. Today more than ever, the Constitution remains the  only compass for legislators in conducting state affairs, said  the PANPRA [Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of  Haiti] deputy. Mac-Ferl Morquette explains that despite the  jolts of national political life, this Constitution, guardian of  our republican institutions, was able to stand the test of time.    Reflecting on the concept of democracy, the vice president  of  the lower chamber recalled the ambiguous attitude of those  elected on 16 December in the face of the Constitution's  provisions. At the same time, he denounced the totalitarianist  tradition, which had always characterized the practice of power  in Haiti. Lack of tolerance and resistance to consensus are the  main causes for our misfortunes, deplored Vice President  Mac-Ferl Morquette. [passage omitted].    The political opponents of President Aristide chose  precisely  this 29 March to defend their political interests and draw the  sheets to their side of the bed, launching a new initiative in  their search for power. Indeed, in a joint resolution, CCGN,  CARENA, FRAPH, MDN, and the Coordination Committee for National  Mobilization invited senators and deputies to acknowledge the  deliberate refusal of the president of the Republic to fill the  presidential vacuum by applying Article 149 of the Constitution,  creating a provisional ad hoc government within three days of  the official presentation of this resolution on 29 March. Let us  listen, successively, to statements by Hubert DeRonceray of MDN,  Herve Leveille from CCGN, and Rony Durand from CARENA.    [DeRonceray] "This resolution represents the united front we  created so the political crisis could find national support.  There are two important points in this resolution: First, we are  asking the Chamber to take a stand on Article 149 of the  Constitution in facilitating the formation of a provisional ad  hoc government. We are saying that in case the Chamber does not  take action concerning that point, there will be a national  mobilization. Popular power will take on its responsibility to  install an ad hoc government.    [Leveille] ``I believe all Haitians will agree to find a  national solution to this crisis.    [Unidentified reporter] ``What kind of reaction did you get  from the president of the lower chamber?    [Leveille] ``The president is very concerned about the  resolution. He promised to begin working on it this afternoon  with the other presidents within the chamber.''    [Durand] [Words indistinct] mostly autonomy that we are  making some proposals. That is how to understand it. The  international community has its position. The national community  has its own proposal.    [Jean] It should be noted that in case it is not carried out  by the deadline set by these political groups, they say the  nation will fill the institutional vacuum by an act of public  power and take measures to establish an ad hoc government. Its  message is clear: We will move to option zero, the clean sweep.  [end recording]</p>

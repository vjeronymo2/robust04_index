			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE STRONG demand in the derivatives market of the recent sessions ran out of steam on Thursday after dealers chose to take profits, writes Joel kibazo. In stock index futures, trading in the June contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,715. This proved to be the high point of the session as a spate of selling orders soon caused a retreat in June. Several of the largest orders during the session were seen to have come from some of the leading institutions eager to cash in on the recent advances. A weak Wall Street only served to cause further selling and June eventually closed at 2,675, a premium of 37 and around 15 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 22. Turnover reached 7,167. Business in the traded options market also returned to lower levels. Total turnover at 37,388 contracts was down on Wednesday's figure of 49,737 lots though the volume in the FT-SE option, at 10,856 lots, was only a shade lighter than the previous session. BTR was the busiest stock option. It traded 2,451 contracts. It was followed by Asda in which 2,147 lots were dealt. The Euro FT-SE option was also busy at 2,108 contracts, while Tesco traded 1896 lots.</p>

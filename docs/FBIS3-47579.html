			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo Asahi Television Network in  Japanese at 0148 GMT on 9 January, in its 105-minute "Sunday  Project" talk show which begins at 0100 GMT, carries a 26-minute  live interview with Akira Yamagishi, chairman of Rengo (Japanese  Trade Union Confederation). He answers questions from economic  commentator Soichiro Tawara at the Asahi Television studio in  Tokyo.    Yamagishi is first asked how he rates the performance so far  of the coalition government.    He says: "I would give it 70 percent." To get higher marks,  he adds, the need for the government to discontinue  bureaucrat-led politics.    He says: "At this juncture, the ruling coalition has no  choice but to implement large-scale income tax cuts. But they  should not carry out both the cuts and a consumption tax hike at  the same time as one package, as the Ministry of Finance (MOF)  proposes."    He believes, like the leaders of the ruling coalition  parties, that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa also hopes to  separate the income tax cuts from the consumption tax rise and  implement large-scale income tax cuts.    He notes, however: "Bureaucrats in the MOF are preventing  the government from doing so."    He thinks differences within the ruling coalition on tax  reform are also hampering Hosokawa's attempts to make a decision.    Tawara points out that disunity among members of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) is an obstacle to the formation  of a consensus on political reform within the ruling coalition  and asks Yamagishi how the party should act.    He refers to speculation the SDPJ might split or leave the  ruling coalition following its party convention on 11 and 12  January.    Yamagishi says: "I do not think this will happen. I do not  think the SDPJ would do anything so ridiculous."    Asked what he thinks of moves to form new groups within the  SDPJ, Yamagishi says: "I think that would be acceptable. The  party will not be able to cope with the second phase of  political realignment if it sticks to its current organization."    Yamagishi then begins to discuss his idea of a two-party  system composed of a conservative party and an non-conservative  party and notes the need for the SDPJ to lead the  non-conservative forces.    Tawara asks Yamagishi what he discussed with Hokkaido  Governor Yokomichi when he met him on 20 December. Yokomichi is  considered likely to play a pivotal role in strengthening the  unity of the SDPJ in the future.    Yamagishi says: "We shared the same views on the idea of  realizing a two-party system composed of a conservative party  and an non-conservative force, not a two-party system composed  of two conservative parties. We agreed that the SDPJ, as a  non-conservative party, should join with centrist, liberal, and  other forces to form a large political party."    Asked whether Yokomichi intended to enter the national  political arena, Yamagishi says: "I feel he will be ready to  return to the national political scene once his tenure as  governor expires in April 1995. This was only an impression,  though, because he did not say so."    During discussions on Rengo's hopes for the non-conservative  force Yamagishi is asked about tax reform.    Yamagishi says: "I strongly oppose the idea of implementing  income tax cuts and a consumption tax hike as one package, but I  do not oppose raising the consumption tax. It is just that I do  not see it as necessary to have a timetable for its  implementation.    Turning to the issue of economic recovery, Tawara asks  Yamagishi what he thinks the government should do to stimulate  the economy.    Yamagishi says: "I think the government has no alternative  but to implement large-scale tax cuts worth about 10 trillion  yen separately from raising consumption tax."    Yamagishi is then asked to comment on Nikkeiren (Japan  Federation of Employers' Associations) Chairman Nagano's remarks  that his group would this year try to secure employment by not  pushing for wage rises.    Yamagishi approves of the idea of securing employment, but  notes the need for Nikkeiren to try to increase wages as well as  secure employment.    The interview ends at 0214 GMT.</p>

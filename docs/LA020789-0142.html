			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: WHEN DELIVERY RATES INCREASE, SO DOES THE INCOME OF MICRO GENERAL;  </P> <P> SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> Most businesses frown on the idea of higher shipping and mailing costs, but the  folks over at Micro General Corp. in Irvine smile at such news.  </P> <P> Micro General's business benefits when delivery rates change, as they did  Monday when general rate increases by United Parcel Service went into effect.  </P> <P> The Irvine company makes computerized shipping systems and postal scales for  use in shipping departments and office mail rooms. Every time a major shipping  company, such as UPS or the Postal Service, changes its rates, Micro General  enjoys a windfall.  </P> <P> The reason is this: The heart of every Micro General product is a tiny computer  chip on which is stored information about shipping company rates. The  computerized shipping systems enable a company's mail room, for example, to  comparison shop among different shipping firms to find the least costly way to  send a package.  </P> <P> Each time there is a rate change, the microchip must be replaced. In the case  of the UPS increase, most of Micro General's 15,000 customers will have to pay  the Irvine firm $115 to order the new chip.  </P> <P> The result, Micro General says, will be a 25% windfall in its revenue for the  current quarter ending in March. A company spokesman, Charles Ramsey, says the  firm is not forecasting what its total revenue will be for the period.  </P> <P> Micro General had earnings of $202,668 on revenue of $4.4 million for the 9  months ended last September.  </P></p>

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Grundig to shed 3,000 German jobs GRUNDIG, the German electronics group, is to reduce its workforce by 3,000 because of a severe decline in the home entertainment market. Most of the job losses are expected to be incurred in Germany, where rising labour costs are hampering efforts to remain competitive in the face of overseas competition. The television factory and components works in Nuremberg and Furth are likely to bear the brunt. At the end of last year about 60 per cent of the company's 21,000 workforce was employed in Germany. However, employment has been rising in subsidiaries in Portugal and Malaysia, where pay is lower. Grundig, minority-owned by Philips of the Netherlands and managed by a Dutch team, announced in March that it planned wide-ranging rationalisation measures to regain competitiveness. The two companies' video recorder businesses are to be merged and Grundig's manufacture switched from Nuremberg to a Philips plant in Vienna. The Grundig television factory in Barcelona has already been closed.</p>

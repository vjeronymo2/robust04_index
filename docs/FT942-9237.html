			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Observer: Tunnel vision What with all the Channel tunnel pomp and the D-day landings razzmatazz, it is perhaps to be expected that another little marker in the history of Anglo-French merry-making has been allowed to slip by virtually unnoticed. Last month was the 90th anniversary of the entente cordiale, an 'understanding' cobbled together by Lord Lansdowne, Britain's foreign secretary, and Paul Cambon, the French ambassador in London. Roughly speaking, the French conceded that the lobster was a fish, in return for control of various small corners of west Africa. Although Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, and Alain Juppe, his opposite number, had a spot of dinner to mark the occasion, the anniversary had been otherwise ignored. Step forward the British Business Lunch Club in Copenhagen. It has invited French businessmen to a celebratory lunch on May 28 (50 days late, but who's counting?) where the British commercial attache, Anthony Layden, and his French counterpart, Bruno Caron, will debate to what extent the hole under la Manche threatens to destabilise the entente cordiale.</p>

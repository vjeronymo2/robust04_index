What is important in increasing the might of the NAM is to  maintain the fundamental principles and idea of this movement,  the paper notes, and stresses:    To regard independence against imperialism as its idea, stay  outside all blocs and pursue an independent policy is the  fundamental principles of the NAM.    Only when the NAM adheres to the fundamental principles, the  source of its viability, can it further enhance its might and  role and successfully realise the noble idea of independence  against imperialism.    It is also important in increasing the might of the NAM to  keep the movement pure and cement its unity.    Any attempt to open its door in an unprincipled manner must  not be allowed. Whether a country can be a member nation of the  NAM or join it with any other qualification depends on whether  it pursues a policy according with the basic idea and principle  of the NAM or aspires after and sympathizes with it.    If the non-aligned nations unite with each other closely on  the basis of independence and wage a common struggle, they can  check and frustrate the moves of the dominationist forces and  carry into effect the idea of the NAM.    Now the NAM is faced with tasks to struggle to achieve  democracy and independence of the whole world, reject the policy  of strength and arbitrariness of the dominationist forces and  establish a new international political and economic order on  the basis of equality, justice and impartiality.    What is important in this is to activate the work for the  reform and democratization of the United Nations so that the  non-aligned nations can take part in the solution of  international issues with equal responsibility and rights. The  non-aligned nations must work out a common strategy for the  reform of the United Nations, take a joint action and make  concerted efforts to put an end to pressure, sanctions and  interference in other's internal affairs based on the abuse of  the authority of the United Nations. It is one of the main  duties of the NAM to oppose all manner of domination and  subjugation, aggression and interference, achieve disarmament  and safeguard the world peace and security.    The non-aligned nations must reject any attempt seeking a  political purpose in a military way and actively struggle to  resolve all the disputes on the principle of mutual respect and  non-interference in other's internal affairs.    They must make strenuous efforts to free themselves from the  economic yoke of the imperialists and establish a new  international economic order on the basis of independence,  equality and impartiality by establishing a South-South economic  order on the principle of collective self-reliance.    The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  and the Korean people will, as in the past, so in the future,  too, steadfastly defend the basic idea and purpose of the NAM,  remain faithful to it and make every possible effort to enhance  its role.</p>

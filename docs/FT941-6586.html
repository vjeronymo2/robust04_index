			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Share issue for NM Smaller Australian NM Smaller Australian Companies investment trust is planning a conversion share issue to increase its size. The fund was launched last December, less than three months ago, raising Pounds 25.8m with its initial placing. By the end of January, the trust's assets had grown by about 21 per cent to approximately Pounds 29m, and it is now capitalised at just over Pounds 30m. Shares in the trust have traded at a premium for most of its life. Full details of the C share issue are not yet available, but it is likely to take the form of a placing and open offer to existing share and warrant holders, rather than a public offer. The placing stage is expected to be completed by Easter, and the open offer to close by the end of April. NM Funds Management is a subsidiary of the National Mutual Life Association of Australasia, Australia's second largest life office. NM says the timing of the C share issue is due to shareholder demand, and favourable economic conditions for investment in Australia.</p>

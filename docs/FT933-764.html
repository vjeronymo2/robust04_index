			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / UK 'unlikely' to raise developing country lending MR Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, yesterday signalled that the UK would probably refuse to add to the pool of concessional lending for the poorest developing countries that is managed by the International Monetary Fund. Citing the squeeze on public spending in the UK, he said Britain was 'unlikely' to contribute to an extension of the IMF's enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF), which provides loans at interest rates of only 0.5 per cent to developing countries carrying out market based reforms. The creation of a proposed SDR 5bn (Pounds 4.66bn) successor to ESAF, which expires at the end of November, has been one of the main IMF-related issues under discussion at this year's IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Washington. While IMF member countries have achieved a consensus on the desirability of a new facility, its financing remains in doubt. The ESAF has been able to provide loans with subsidised interest rates with the help of donations from countries such as Britain, which has been a big contributor. Although Mr Clarke made a final British decision on ESAF contingent on discussions in the public spending round, he made clear he would prefer the IMF itself to provide the cash through such means as the sale of some of its gold holdings. He also repeated his call for other industrialised nations to support UK demands for increased debt relief for the poorest developing nations under the so-called Trinidad terms. Mr Clarke said the idea was gaining support and singled out Japan as 'virtually isolated' in resisting UK calls to grant immediate debt relief and raise the rate of debt relief to two-thirds or even 80 per cent in some cases from 50 per cent at present. In his speech to the IMF-World Bank Development Committee yesterday Mr Clarke said energetic action on debt would make a radical difference to the prospects of many of the poorest countries in the world. This would be 'at no practical cost to the creditor countries, who will never see these old debts repaid in any event.' Mr Clarke insisted that aid should be directed to countries with sensible economic and social policies and 'where there is a clear political commitment to a market economy and a free society'.</p>

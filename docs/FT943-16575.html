			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Telecoms look for an outside edge Amid the hype about multimedia and superhighways, one quiet but genuine revolution stands out in the telecommunications industry - the gradual transformation of the large national telecoms operators from utility-minded monopolies to market-minded service providers. The revolution is everywhere incomplete; in some cases it has barely started. 'We discovered marketing last year, and can't get over the excitement,' quips a senior executive of British Telecommunications, one of Europe's more go-ahead operators. What are the tell-tale signs? Flashy logos, more and better marketing and advertising, ambitious joint ventures at home and abroad. But a less obvious, and perhaps more fundamental, change is the wholesale replacement of the senior management of the large telecoms companies. It is not just a change of personnel: the type is changing too. Out goes the engineer and career posts and telecoms bureaucrat; in comes the financial services or consumer goods executive, hired to turn telecoms into a brand and to fire a large proportion of the existing staff, not excepting the senior engineers. Last month's FT conference on European telecommunications highlighted the trend. The heads of six large telecoms companies were on the programme. Only one was a career telecoms engineer; the other five were outsiders who joined their companies within the last six years. Bessel Kok, chief executive of Belgacom, was chief executive of Swift, a dedicated financial data processaing operator, prior to his appointment in 1992. His main occupation is bullying Belgium's politicians to get his state monopoly into the private sector. Wim Dik, chief executive of KPN, the recently privatised Dutch posts and telecoms monopoly, went to the job in 1988 from Unilever. He boasts of not having spent a day in the public sector prior to KPN, and still serves on the board of ABN Amro, the Dutch bank. Michael Hepher, BT's managing director, trained as an actuary, and was managing director of Abbey Life, the UK group, before moving to BT in 1991. Candido Velazquez-Gaztelu Ruiz, chairman of Telefonica, the private sector Spanish monopoly, was director general of Tabacanarias, the Spanish tobacco group, until 1989. The fifth speaker, Mike Harris, chief executive of the UK's Mercury, is a union of old and new. He came to Mercury two years ago, fresh from masterminding the launch of the UK's first telephone bank, First Direct. Cable &amp; Wireless, Mercury's parent company, is the model revolutionary, having dispatched its entire ancien regime. Its chairman, Lord Young, is a former politician and construction tycoon. James Ross, chief executive, was until two years ago managing director of British Petroleum. Linus Cheung, chief executive of Hongkong Telecom, C&amp;W's largest business, was recruited last year from Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong airline. Oil, construction, airlines, banking - C&amp;W has everything but telecoms experience among its senior management. For advice on the widgets, the management board relies on Sydney O'Hara. Even he is a new arrival - from BT, where he was deputy director of the company's research labs. The sixth executive at the conference was, perhaps, the exception which proves the rule. Charles Rozmaryn, chief executive of France Telecom, is every inch the telecoms careerist: a graduate of the Ecole Superieure des Telecommunications, who held a succession of posts in the Direction Generale des Telecommunications before his current post. Yet France Telecom defies all the maxims about state control equalling inefficiency and a dynamism deficit. What next, if it becomes Europe's only telecoms operator run by people who know what they are talking about?</p>

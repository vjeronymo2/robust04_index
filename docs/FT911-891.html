			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Watchdog seeks to stop rivers running dry A PRIORITY programme to save some of England's most attractive rivers from drying up was launched yesterday by the National Rivers Authority, the water industry's environmental regulator, writes Richard Evans. Over-exploitation by industry, landowners and water companies, together with a succession of dry winters and hot summers, has led to unacceptably low flow levels in some of the country's best fishing rivers. The NRA warned yesterday that there were no 'quick fix' solutions, and that the cost of reversing the decline might be as high as Pounds 20m. Among options being considered are revoking or varying existing licences, building new river channels to feed drying rivers and lining river beds. Among the 20 targeted rivers are the Darent, Pang, Wey and Ver in the Thames region; the upper Waveney, the Hiz and Slea in East Anglia; the Wharfe in Yorkshire; and the Piddle in the west country. Mr Jerry Sherriff, NRA head of water resources, said: 'It is not acceptable for rivers that once enjoyed healthy flows all year round to become, in some cases, no more than dry gullies in the summer months.' Money for the work will have to come initially from the fees levied by the NRA for extraction licences.</p>

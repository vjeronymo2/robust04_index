			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, Apr 6 (ANTARA) -- Dutch Foreign Minister  P.H. Kooijmans stated that the early return of the visiting  Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers was caused by an emerging conflict  in the country's parliament.    "It has nothing to do with Indonesia. Our country is busy  with political campaigns in the run up to a general election.  Prime Minister Lubbers' return before scheduled time was due to  a conflict between two members of parliament of our country's  two coalition parties," he told the press here Wednesday.    He was speaking to reporters after signing -- together with  Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas -- a memorandum of  understanding on the improvement and protection over investments  between Indonesia and the Netherlands.    The conflict, he said, is very sensitive as it involves two  ministers, members of the two coalition parties: Democratic  Christian Party and Labour Party. The two ministers took an  issue of office and attorney problems.    "As the issue is very important, the Dutch parliament's  lower  house asked the visiting Prime Minister Lubbers to return early  to his country. We regret his (Lubbers) returning home before  the schedule time," said Kooijmans who will continue his visit  as scheduled until Thursday afternoon.    Prime Minister Lubbers arrived here on Monday for a four-day  official visit until Thursday. He left Jakarta on Wednesday  afternoon after visiting the ship industry, PT [Company Limited]  Pal in Surabaya and attending the ground breaking ceremony for  the development of Philip Ralins plant in the East Java capital  city.    He said, however, that although Prime Minister Lubbers cut  short his visit to Indonesia, the Dutch leader's visit is very  important and the two countries' bilateral relations are  improving.    Minister Kooijmans was scheduled to hold meetings with 15  non-governmental organizations [NGO's] in Jakarta's Dutch  Embassy on Thursday.    When asked by reporters on the purpose of his meeting with  the NGOs, he said that such a meeting has become his tradition  every time he make a visit to foreign countries.</p>

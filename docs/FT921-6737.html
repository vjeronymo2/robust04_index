			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Union threat over leaked Ford relocation proposal UNION leaders at Ford UK yesterday promised 'a major reaction' if the company goes ahead with a plan to slim down two research and development centres at Dunton and Aveley in Essex and concentrate R&amp;D work in Germany. A document leaked to the AEU engineering union talks of shrinking Dunton, Ford's biggest R&amp;D centre in Europe, and Aveley, as an 'option' which 'does not represent company policy'. If the plan did go ahead it would mean transferring to Germany about 1,200 of the 4,000 jobs at the two centres. The AEU believes that it could quickly lead to the closure of all R&amp;D facilities in the UK and the loss of 12,000 jobs. Union officials are convinced that even if the company shelves the option under discussion it will want to shift more R&amp;D work to Germany. Mr Jimmy Airlie, the AEU's senior Ford official, said: 'Dunton and Aveley provide core services for Ford. If they are removed, the writing is on the wall for Ford as a major manufacturer in Britain.' Ford said the document was part of 'an ongoing study into engineering activities in Europe'. The company denied any immediate plans for a major job transfer to Germany, but pointed out that other big car manufacturers have only one important R&amp;D centre in Europe. Merkenich, near Cologne, where most of the Dunton jobs would go, is almost the same size as Dunton. Mr Lindsey Halstead, Ford of Europe chairman, recently denied that Dunton would be closed, pointing out that the company had just invested Pounds 156m there.</p>

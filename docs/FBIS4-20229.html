			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Anguita Calls On Prime Minister To </F> Take Responsibility and Go"]    [Text] Madrid -- United Left leader Julio Anguita endorsed  [People's Party Chairman] Jose Maria Aznar's proposal [issued 19  April during the Congress of Deputies state of nation debate],  which explicitly called on Felipe Gonzalez to resign as prime  minister. Anguita also enlarged on the idea already expressed  by him on other occasions of demanding a policy of democratic  economic planning, and asserted the need to meet the challenge  of transforming Spain into a federal state.    The United Left-Initiative for Catalonia leader asserted  that  the current situation necessitates "making a decision," and  added that he is convinced that on the Socialist benches "there  will be somebody capable of taking up the mandate which his  political force received in the polls last 6 June." In  Anguita's opinion, Gonzalez's resignation, which he demanded  "quite calmly but with complete responsibility," "is necessary."    Anguita described a scene marked by "economic disorder,  social disorder, political disorder, moral disorder, and ethical  disorder." From there he leapt to the demand for Gonzalez's  resignation, and immediately asserted that his group calls for  "hope" and "optimism." Anguita continued in that tone, openly  addressing the public, not just the house, in dwelling on his  call "for courage."    He then tackled the problem of the reform of economic  policy,  and, taking as his basis Article 128 of the Constitution ("All  the country's wealth in its various forms, regardless of its  ownership, is subordinate to the general interest"), he  proceeded to explain the need to get under way the democratic  planning of the economy. In Anguita's opinion, this means "the  management of collective demand, meeting basic needs in housing,  public transport, health, and education," and performing, he  said, "the task of a compass and guide for private enterprise."  <H5>  Public Sector </H5>   So that no doubts would be left about his overall view of  the  economy through planning, he deemed it essential to link to this  "a boost for a strong democratized public sector." In this  field he took specific steps in saying that a strong public  sector is also necessary for the financial system, and "would  begin with an immediate halt to the privatization of Argentaria,  making it the financial driving force for the small- and  medium-sized enterprises and cooperatives."    He took yet another step in spelling out his economic  proposals in asserting from the rostrum the need for "the  Argentaria corporation to purchase Banesto [Credit Bank of  Spain]," and rejecting independence for the Bank of Spain, a  bill approved by parliament.    The last feature of his economic policy was to demand "the  workers full participation in business decisions which affect  them, especially with respect to setting up compulsory  investment funds to channel part of business profits into job  creation."    Anguita did not abandon his stance of radical reforms, and  tackled the need to build a federal state, convinced, he said,  "that building that state on the basis of the existing  constitutional situation is a matter of acceptance, commitment,  and supportive action."    The United Left leader admitted that that federal state  would  entail, among other things, an extensive reorganization of local  administration and turning the Senate into a house of  territorial representation, and he added the concomitant of  "Armed Forces based on the professional status of all their  members."    Anguita delved into Europe, with new proposals for complete  change. He himself asserted that "a radical change" is needed  in the building of Europe.    He concluded with a number of proposals for transforming  current political conduct, the "obscure foundations of which  underpin corruption." Anguita said it is necessary to reform  the electoral system, the Congress and the Senate, Justice, the  National Audit Office and parliamentary oversight of public  expenditure, the election of the institutions' bodies, the  Economic and Social Council, the Spanish Radio and Television  System charter, the public administrations, and the funding of  parties.</p>

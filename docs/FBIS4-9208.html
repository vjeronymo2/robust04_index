			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with General Staff Colonel Vaclav Prazak, </F> commander of the 2d Mechanized Brigade, by Vlastimil Stana;  place and date not given: "On the Difficult Road Toward  Perfection"]    [Text] The very first unit of the Czech Army, which  came into being on the basis of the new principles, is the 2d  Mechanized Brigade. The preceding months were not overly calm  ones, but nevertheless it was possible to create a military  formation that is viable. Without exaggerating, the changes had  an impact not only on the organization itself, but significantly  on the lives of people. We spoke about it last week with General  Staff Colonel Vaclav Prazak, who commands the brigade.    [Stana] What developments immediately preceded the  establishment of the brigade?    [Prazak] We did not build our organization from scratch. We  made use of a portion of our experiences and proven methods of  work dating back to the time of the 2d Mechanized Division. But  in no case was the introduction of changes a mere paper war  involving numbers of soldiers and equipment. We attempted to  create a body that will be far more flexible and viable. I  believe that we succeeded. Some formations and units  disappeared, particularly the larger groupings of troops at  Klatovy and Vimperk. Currently, the brigade is deployed in the  regions of western and southern Bohemia, specifically within the  garrisons at Susice, Janovice nad Uhlavou, Strasice, Klatovy,  and Vimperk.    [Stana] It is frequently said that the best people have left  the Army. Do you hold the same opinion?    [Prazak] I would not agree that the best people have left  our  units. But I also do not claim that we are not concerned about  some of those who did leave. There are enough people who, even  though they have stopped wearing the uniform, are continuing to  work at jobs set aside for civil servants. A lot of people also  had to leave on the basis of the results of the extraordinary  evaluations. But I say again--the overwhelming majority of those  who are serving in our units today are good professionals who  were afforded the opportunity to show their capabilities.    [Stana] Did senior commanders have the opportunity to decide  with whom they wished to cooperate, who would be assigned to  functions, let us say, at staff levels and at company levels?    [Prazak] This rule was one of the basic principles governing  the work of commanders. I can say with a clear conscience that  the General Staff truly gave us a certain amount of freedom of  action in that direction and that we attempted to make the best  use of it. After a long period of the most varied notions and  verbal assurances, we were given the opportunity at the brigade  level to work independently. I would like to see us have a  similar opportunity even with respect to the preparation of  training, in the everyday command and control of units.    [Stana] Does the same rule also apply to you with respect to  the battalions?    [Prazak] Anyone who, as a commander, had experienced the  previously constant controls and so-called assistance, which,  however, did not benefit anyone in any manner, cannot act  otherwise. Yes, people at battalion level enjoy the confidence  of the brigade command, and our mutual professional  relationships have an appropriate form. In my opinion, this is  one of the significant and substantial changes. A number of  commanders are already saying today that it is far more  complicated. But it is one of the first and essential steps  along the difficult road to perfection and professionalism.    [Stana] What do you expect of the new organizational  structure at brigade level?    [Prazak] People in all positions, beginning with the brigade  commander and ending with the soldiers at company level, should  be closer to each other. This could exert a decisive influence  not only on mutual relationships, but also on the level of  training and, last but not least, on one of the most problematic  areas, which is behavior or, if you like, discipline. An  improvement in command and control would then follow as a matter  of fact. While we have already experienced a little of the  command and control in practice, we have a lot more to learn  with respect to discipline.    [Stana] If the Army lacks anything, it is undoubtedly a  professional corps of noncommissioned officers, so-called career  soldiers. The situation is not even favorable with respect to  platoon commanders. Are you thinking, at brigade level, how to  change the currently unfavorable situation?    [Prazak] We have a long way to go before we reach the ideal  situation, and, in the immediate future, I do not believe that  much will change in this direction. We are badly in need of good  noncommissioned officers, but interest in service as a  noncommissioned officer is minimal for several reasons. One of  these is the fact that, even if we have an interested  individual, we have nothing specific we can offer him. In brief,  appropriate legislation is lacking. And no one will swallow the  bait of mere words. For the most part, people ask what is in it  for them. It is true that we also have a shortage of platoon  commanders. For the present, we will have to staff these  positions precisely with the best noncommissioned officers. We  are also getting ready to visit military schools to offer future  military professionals the prospects of service in our brigade.  We would like to have them come to visit our garrisons even  before they make a decision.    [Stana] Naturally, systems changes also call for certain  financial expenditures. Do you have sufficient resources to  realize your intentions?    [Prazak] We are not bad off. The only thing we are short of  are resources for construction and housing services. For  example, there is a shortage of funds to complete the facilities  at Janovice--the mess hall, the military enterprise kitchen, the  dispensary.... The other limits are adequate for the brigade.    [Stana] What kind of equipment does the brigade have?    [Prazak] Our battalions have T-72 tanks, Models 1 and 2  infantry combat vehicles, and the artillery has D-30 howitzers.  The combined arms formations are, of course, equipped with  special equipment.</p>

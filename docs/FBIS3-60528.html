			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [IRNA report: ``Tomorrow Will Be Too Late; Let's Prevent </F> AIDS Today'']    [Excerpt] [passage omitted on history of AIDS] The first  case of AIDS in Iran was reported in 1986 when a six-year-old  hemophiliac child contracted it as a result of imported blood,  after which the Ministry of Health, Treatment, and Medical  Education set up a department known as the National Committee  for Combating AIDS.    According to Dr. Malek Afzali, the deputy minister for  health, as of the month of Aban [23 October-21 November] this  year, 219 people have been affected by the AIDS virus in Iran.  Of these, 85 have contracted the disease, and 62 have died.    The National Committee for Combating AIDS warns that if  serious preventive measures are not instituted by the officials  and the people in general, this disease could appear on a more  extensive scale in the country.    At present, one can state: The best treatment for AIDS and  one of the most important means of controlling this destructive  disease--as recommended by the World Health Organization  [WHO]--is adherence to religion and family values and  familiarizing people with the ways the virus is transmitted and  measures to prevent it.    Doctors, experts, specialists, and officials at the Blood  Transfusion Center and the Health Ministry believe that in order  to combat AIDS and its spread on a national level, necessary and  adequate training about AIDS and other infectious diseases  should be imparted to the people by means of various  organizations, such as the Ministry of Culture and Islamic  Guidance, Ministry of Education and Training, Ministry of  Culture and Higher Education, the mass media, and the Friday  imams. Special clinics to provide medical services to those who  have already been infected by the AIDS virus should be  established.</p>

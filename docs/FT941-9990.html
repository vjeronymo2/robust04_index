			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: BT BT's third-quarter profits show that the cash generator continues to purr away. What is perhaps more interesting is the way in which the marketing battle is hotting up between BT, Mercury and the other new competitors. The RPI-7.5 per cent price cap which BT now endures means substantial price cuts. BT seems to have decided to turn necessity into virtue by making price cut a marketing weapon. This week's abolition of peak rate tariffs is aimed at business users. But the weekend low rates and 'family and friends' promotion is aimed at domestic users, implying that Mercury and the cable television companies are having some impact. The fight will intensify as new services and products are launched, and next year BT must come up with further price initiatives. Cable television, which has plumbed in its own lines, has substantial flexibility over how it structures its marketing push. Mercury, by contrast, operates primarily through BT's own system and pays for this through a price structure which mirrors the retail tariffs. That makes it difficult to offer radically different options, such as free evening calls. Mercury is legally challenging that structure. If it succeeds, marketing expertise is going to change the nature of the retail telecoms battle.</p>

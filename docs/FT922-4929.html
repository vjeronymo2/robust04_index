			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: De La Rue jumps to Pounds 76.2m - Cost cuts, productivity gains and acquisitions boost performance DE LA RUE, the bank note printing and cash handling machine group, reported a 29 per cent jump in profits after another year of cut-ting costs and productivity gains. Pre-tax profits in the year to March jumped from Pounds 58.9m to Pounds 76.2m on sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 415m. Only Pounds 2.3m of profit contribution came from the acquisition last year of Inter Innovation, its Swedish-based competitor. Despite the jump in profits, De La Rue's share price fell 12p to 592p. Earnings per share rose 17.7 per cent to 30.6p and the company is to increase the full year dividend by 9.1 per cent to 15p. After a year of strong cash flow from operations, De La Rue's year-end net cash rose to Pounds 112m and led to interest earned of Pounds 3.9m, compared with an interest charge of Pounds 2.1m. The group was left with Pounds 51m from the Pounds 162m rights issue after the acquisition of Inter Innovation and an increase in the stake in Garny, the German manufacturer of banking automation and physical security equipment. Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, emphasised that De La Rue was interested in further acquisitions but was in no hurry and would not buy anything that would dilute earnings. The security printing division increased operating profit by 21 per cent to Pounds 41.7m. While the comparable figure last year was depressed by an exceptional charge and above the line rationalisation costs, the division benefited from increased productivity. Volumes in traditional markets fell by 4 per cent. Sales would have fallen further but for new markets that are opening in the Baltics, the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Africa. De La Rue has a 60 per cent market share of the 120 large countries that do not print their own notes but Mr Marshall recognises the market is relatively mature. The acquisition of Inter Innovation would, however, make De La Rue's payment Systems sector of equal importance within the group in terms of sales but was an area of greater growth potential. With only four months of the new acquisition, the division increased operating profit by 41.2 per cent to Pounds 23.3m on a similar increase in sales. Sales at Garny, where De La Rue now holds a 93 per cent stake, increased by 48 per cent. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I watched what I thought was the season premiere of "Wiseguy."  </P> <P> What I saw was a slow-moving, grossly mutated version of "Miami Vice." From the  deaths of Sonny and Father Pete to the McPike/moose face-off in the Volchek  family crypt, the series had never been dull. Until now. We don't need another  "Miami Vice." What we need is Ken Wahl as Vincenzo Michael Terranova.  </P> <P> Anthony Alborini, Valencia  </P></p>

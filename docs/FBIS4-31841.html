			<p>BFN     [Text] Vlasenica, June 15 (TANJUG) -- After a comparative  lull on Tuesday [14 June], Bosnian Moslem forces on Wednesday  violated the latest ceasefire on the Kladanj front east of  Sarajevo by shelling Bosnian Serb positions from mortars. The  local Bosnian Serb army command said that the Moslems fired 21  shells on the Serb Army positions, and eight shells on civilian  targets in the villages of Doli and Trnovo in eastern Bosnia.  The Serb forces did not return fire, and the attacks caused  damage, but no casualties, the command said.    The Bosnian Serb Army is not responding to attacks, adhering  to the letter and spirit of the latest one-month truce, signed  in Geneva on June 8 by representatives of the Moslem-Croat  Federation in Bosnia and the Bosnian Serb Republic. The Serb  Army further reported Moslem attacks on military and civilian  targets in the past 24 hours in most sectors of the Doboj front  in northern Bosnia.    On the Teslic front south of Doboj, the Moslems launched a  strong infantry assault in an effort to break through the Serb  lines, but were beaten back, the Serb source said. A Moslem  sabotage and reconnaissance team was neutralised in the  southeastern sector of the Doboj front, the source said.</p>

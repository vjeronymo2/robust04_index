			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Canary Wharf profit 'in 4 years' CANARY WHARF, the property development in London's Docklands, should be making a profit within four years, its professional advisers predict. Canary Wharf reached an arrangement at the end of last month with its creditors to remove it from administration. Mr Alan Bloom, a joint administrator to Canary Wharf at accountants Ernst &amp; Young, said he expected income to exceed expenditure by 1997-98. The forecasts are based on occupancy of 80 per cent to 90 per cent, and follow big write-offs of liabilities and restructuring of debt. Mr Bloom would not disclose the present rental income on the project, but said annual operating expenses were expected to be Pounds 12m-Pounds 15m a year. There are outstanding construction costs of Pounds 5m-Pounds 7m. Unsecured creditors can expect a maximum payment of 15p in the pound, with a further 25p in the pound to 130 contractors willing to provide warranties on existing work. A big proportion will be paid by the end of January, and the remainder once disputes over contested debts of about Pounds 25m have been resolved. The details emerged shortly before the accounts for the restructured businesses for the year to October 31 1992 are due to be filed at Companies House. Price Waterhouse, the auditor, has signed the figures in the past few days. It has not qualified the accounts, but has drawn attention to an accounting note which highlights the 'uncertainty' of debts restructured until 2007. The consolidated accounts for 1992 are expected to show a net loss of Pounds 1.2bn on the group, which reflects its acceptance of costs of restructuring the debts. Total bank loans on the balance sheet as long-term liabilities will be Pounds 152m, reflecting the net present value of the Pounds 573m in debts owing to the banks at the time of insolvency. An additional Pounds 98m facility has been made available to fund the Jubilee Line extension. The 12 banks which now own Canary Wharf through a company called Sylvester Investments have also made available up to Pounds 180m in other facilities.</p>

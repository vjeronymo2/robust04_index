			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN BOY'S SLAYING FACES MULTIPLE CHARGES  </P> <P> Ventura County prosecutors filed murder, kidnaping and arson charges Monday  against Gregory Scott Smith in the death of 8-year-old Paul Bailly, whose  gagged and burned body was found 10 days ago near Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Prosecutors also filed special circumstances allegations -- murder in the  course of a kidnaping -- which could result in Smith, 21, of Canoga Park,  facing the death penalty.  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Michael Bradbury said "There's no question in my mind" that Smith  was responsible for Paul's death. "If there was, we wouldn't file charges," he  said.  </P> <P> Paul died within four hours of his disappearance from a child-care program at  Darby Avenue Elementary School in Northridge, where his mother had dropped him  on the morning of March 23.  </P> <P> The boy's body was found about noon the same day by firefighters who were  called to extinguish a brush fire in the Santa Susana Knolls area south of Simi  Valley.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Ventura County Coroner Dr. F. Warren Lovell ruled that Paul choked  to death on his own vomit while his mouth was taped shut. Lovell said Paul's  body was set on fire after he died, and it did not appear that he had been  sexually assaulted.  </P> <P> However, Bradbury said investigators are awaiting the results of tests to  determine whether the youth was molested.  </P> <P> Smith appeared for arraignment Monday but agreed to have the proceeding  postponed until April 16 because his attorney had not had time to read the  police report. He will continue to be held without bail.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Barry F. Hammond received a copy of the report, which Bradbury  called "voluminous," on Monday.  </P> <P> Smith appeared in jail blues with his head bowed before Ventura Municipal Judge  Thomas Hutchins.  </P> <P> Hammond asked Hutchins for permission to appoint a co-counsel and an  investigator to help him defend Smith, but Hutchins said he would let a  Superior Court judge handle such matters.  </P> <P> Bradbury said a search warrant report and affidavits containing facts about the  case will be sealed until further notice.  </P> <P> He said the postponement will allow investigators time to finish compiling  results from evidence tests and to interview more potential witnesses.  </P> <P> Bradbury said that members of both Paul and Smith's families have been  interviewed by deputy district attorneys.  </P> <P> "We feel it's a good case, for reasons that will be clear at the time of the  preliminary (hearing)." Bradbury said. "We're tying down a lot of leads we  have."  </P></p>

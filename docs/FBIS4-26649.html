			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Beijing Denies WEN WEI PO Report on </F> Deng Xiaoping's Visit to Qingdao"]    [Text] A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman openly denied  the news about Deng Xiaoping's recent visit to Qingdao,  Shandong, carried in Hong Kong's pro-China WEN WEI PO yesterday.  Regarding the news, spokesman Wu Jianmin said at the press  briefing yesterday: "The news is not true. There is no such a  thing."    To prove the inaccuracy of the report, Wu stressed in  English: "It is not true."    When a reporter further inquired about the whereabouts of  Deng Xiaoping and asked whether Deng was recuperating somewhere  around Qingdao, Wu Jianmin did not answer the question directly.  He simply said: "Mr. Deng Xiaoping is wherever he is."    Yesterday, WEN WEI PO front-paged a report which said:  "During a recent tour of Qingdao, Deng Xiaoping discussed three  major issues concerning China's development: First, the  principle of taking economic development as the center must  never change; second, it is necessary to sum up the lesson of  the former Soviet Union and properly handle the relationship  between the center and the localities; and third, uphold party  leadership and do not practice a multiparty system."    However, a Qingdao government official yesterday denied the  report about Deng Xiaoping's recent inspection tour of the city.  In response to an inquiry from a MING PAO reporter, the  official said there was no such thing.    In a telephone inquiry FROM MING PAO reporter Zhang Qingyun,  the first deputy editor-in-chief of WEN WEI PO, refused to make  any comment on the paper's response to the matter.</p>

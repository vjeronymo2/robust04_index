			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE RELINQUISHES FRAUD CASE  </P> <P> A Harbor Municipal Court judge agreed Friday to transfer control of a case  involving a man accused of impersonating a lawyer and fleecing unsuspecting  clients, after learning that she had presided over another matter earlier this  year in which the defendant was the defense counsel.  </P> <P> Judge Susanne S. Shaw transferred control of the pretrial phase of the case to  another judge at the conclusion of a hearing punctuated by a shouting match  between her and the defendant, a man whose identity remains uncertain.  </P> <P> When Shaw did not agree automatically to transfer control of the case, the  defendant, who identifies himself as Christopher Kennedy, shouted:  </P> <P> "You're involved in the case. . . . You are the judge who took a plea in a  particular case that's at issue here."  </P> <P> To which Shaw responded: "Yeah, great. Shut up and sit down. . . . We're going  to send you back downstairs (to jail), get out of here."  </P></p>

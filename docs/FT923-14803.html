			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / International Company News: A mixture of luck and hard decisions - The reasons behind the resurgence of Dickson Concepts DICKSON Concepts, the wholesaler and retailer of designer luxury goods which last year paid Pounds 57m for Harvey Nichols, the fashionable London department store, appears to be staging a come back after its recent unfavourable showing on the Hong Kong stock market After virtually no growth in either sales or profits for 18 months, it sprang a HKDollars 1bn rights issue on shareholders at the time of the Harvey Nichols purchase. Both takeover and funding were poorly received. However, following a strong second half, profits for the year ended March 1992 rose 27 per cent to HKDollars 281.8m on revenues 9 per cent higher at HKDollars 2.4bn. The turnround has been a combination of good luck and hard decision making. First the luck. In Hong Kong rents for retail space have fallen 30 per cent over the past year and Dickson Concepts, which operates 33 retail outlets in the colony, has benefited from those market conditions, if not by the full amount. Hard decisions have been made in Taiwan and the UK with Harvey Nichols. Both have paid off and Dickson Concepts now expects both operations to make significant contributions to profits in the coming years. A department store in Taiwan - located in an area of Taipei where a mass transit railway is being built - was sold and the seven boutiques which it once housed were placed in less congested areas of the city. This occurred at a time when consumer spending was recovering. According to Mr Dickson Poon, the chairman of the company and its 51 per cent controlling shareholder, the combination of relocation of outlets and the surge in consumer spending resulted 'in a direct reduction in overheads and a substantial increase in sales.' In London, the Harvey Nichols store presented a different set of problems. A three-pronged plan to get a firmer financial control of the property and develop the store and the brand name has been embarked upon. Mr Poon says successes have already been achieved and that Harvey Nichols is now showing a profit after providing for financing charges. The first decision was to relocate offices to a nearby building. This, together with a reconfiguration of the lower floor of the store, freed up to 20,000 extra square feet of retail space. This was completed in April and has begun to make a positive contribution to revenues. In parallel, management set about regaining control over stocks. When Dickson Concepts acquired Harvey Nicholls the store's stock/loss ratio was in excess of 10 per cent. That has been cut to 3 per cent, and Mr Poon says that when real time information technology designed to control stock better is introduced, that ratio should drop to 1.5 per cent or lower. Technology will also bring other benefits. 'We will get improved efficiencies from the information it will provide,' he says. 'We will be able immediately to identify which lines are selling fastest and this will be invaluable for the buyers and merchandisers.' The third prong of the plan is to develop Harvey Nichols as a reputable brand name. In September a new line of womens wear will be launched and, at the same time, a Harvey Nichols boutique will be opened in Hong Kong. 'It is not easy to develop a new brand,' Mr Poon conceded. 'But Harvey Nichols has an owner which has the information and has the management that fully understands consumer taste and demands and distribution.' It remains to be seen whether these skills extend to food retailing - another leg of the development plans. Dickson Concepts plans to open a food hall at Harvey Nichols in September or October, and is considering replicating that in other parts of the UK. Whatever the success of the food retailing idea, in the short to medium term analysts and the company expect Harvey Nichols to account for up to 10 per cent of Dickson Concepts' profits, or Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m a year by 1993. For more than a year Dickson Concepts has been researching the China market. Shortly it will announce a joint venture with a mainland partner to develop, make and market a range of up-market apparel and accessories. The company has already identified manufacturers throughout China. According to Crosby Securities, a local broker, there are 4m individuals who earn more than Yn30,000 a year (compared with an average annual income per head of around Yn2,000) located mainly in Shenzhen, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shanghai. Mr Poon feels that his company's expertise in marketing, product development and fashion gives it an edge in developing sophisticated but affordable products for the Chinese market. He is aiming to offer these consumers a total head to toe 'lifestyle'. Whether he can develop China as one of Dickson Concepts core businesses is open to question, given the difficulties of distribution and the mainland bureaucracy. But, as one analysts noted: 'Dickson is one for stretching the bounds of credibility and then proving people wrong.'</p>

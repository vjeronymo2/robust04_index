			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (1): Toiling in the rubble - The atmosphere is so gloomy in Japanese financial markets that bad news has lost the capacity to surprise. There was hardly a ripple of reaction when the Nikkei index hit its lowest point in five years. But there are a few glimmers of hope amid the recession JAPAN'S financial companies are labouring among the ruins after the collapse of the boom of the 1980s. Some are being crushed by the weight of the debt and over-priced assets they bear. Others are trying to forage in the rubble. Many more are keeping their heads low, hiding in the cellars waiting for the day when it is once more safe to venture out. The atmosphere is so gloomy that bad news has lost the capacity to surprise. Financial scandals barely raise eyebrows. There was hardly a ripple of reaction when the Nikkei index this month fell through the 20,000 level and hit its lowest point in five years. 'There are no buyers in the market right now, only sellers. This year will be tough, just like last year. The next few years will also be tough,' says Mr Koji Hoshi, a research director at Daiichi Life, the life insurer. The main hope is that the authorities will lower interest rates and increase public spending to stimulate the sagging economy and bring back confidence into the markets. But, while the real economy might well respond to such treatment, it is not clear that the financial markets would also spring back to life. Bankers and brokers are haunted by the shades of the 1960s when the stock markets fell into a deep recession even though the economy grew at a record rate. The effects of the financial slump are not altogether bad - companies are being forced to restructure to achieve greater profits from core businesses, instead of relying on capital gains to bail them out. They need time to restore their scandal-tainted public reputations. Also, businessmen must come to terms with 10 years of financial deregulation. Moreover, Japanese financial companies' international competitors also face severe problems, particularly in the property market. As Mr Yoh Kurosawa, the president of the Industrial Bank of Japan, says: 'The situation in the Japanese property market is serious, but it is much better than New York, or London, or Melbourne. ' But many executives are too preoccupied with the short-term to look far ahead. The biggest problem is dealing with those investors who bought high-priced assets - chiefly stocks and land - they can no longer afford to keep. Bankruptcies are mounting - companies which went bust last year left debts totalling Y8,000bn, four times higher than in 1990, according to Teikoku Databank, a credit research agency. It estimates 1992 could see a further 100 per cent increase. Published bankruptcies are the tip of the iceberg. The largest among them - Ms Nui Onoue, an Osaka restaurateur and stock investor, who was arrested for forging deposit certificates - owes Y410bn. This is dwarfed by a contingent of over-extended international property groups - including Shuwa, EIE International which each owe over Y1,000bn. Among lenders, the most exposed are financial companies, which were often prepared to grant credit to borrowers rejected by banks. Teikoku estimates that some Y30,000-Y40,000bn of finance company debt to property companies may be hard to recover. This does not put the banks in the clear, since many of the most aggressive finance companies are bank affiliates, such as Kogin Lease, which is tied to the Industrial Bank of Japan. The burden is already pushing smaller banks into forced marriages with big groups. The Bank of Japan is doing its utmost to arrange mergers to prevent even a single bank failure. It denies categorically that the health of the financial system is in doubt. But even if the survival of large institutions is not in question their ability to serve borrowers is. Dealing with bad debts is absorbing capital and management time, leaving less aside for new opportunities. Also, since Japanese banks count part of their stock holdings as capital, the decline in equities is also eroding their capital. They have successfully boosted their reserves by raising subordinated debt but this is a temporary solution. The only long-term answer is to improve the profitability of the basic business, for example, by increasing loans spreads. Stockbroking companies are in an even worse position. Banks at least have some good new businesses to develop, such as consumer lending. But the collapse in equity trading has robbed the securities industry of its main revenues. The settlement of post-boom disputes with investment clients has also brought brokers heavy losses. For the year to the end of this month, 10 of the top 14 brokers have forecast pre-tax losses, including a Y34bn loss at Yamaichi Securities, the weakest of the Big Four companies. Smaller houses are already being taken over in rescue deals. The longer the recession lasts, the more likely it is that some larger companies will suffer the same fate. Financial companies are cutting costs. Advertising and entertainment budgets were the first to suffer. Next, came computer investment bills. Now, smaller companies are closing offices, including high-cost foreign outposts. Stockbrokers, the worst-hit businesses, are slashing recruitment - even Nomura Securities, the strongest group, is reducing its graduate intake - from 1,525 last year to 1,000 in 1992 and possibly as few as 500 in 1992. For the moment, Japanese industry does not feel starved of funds. With the economy slowing, inventories are being run down and investments postponed. Companies are running down the cash reserves they accumulated in the 1980s but the levels are still high by past standards - according to the Bank of Japan, the ratio of corporate liquid reserves to monthly sales stood near the end of last year at 1.7, down from a peak of 2.0 but well above the average of the early 1980s of 1.2. Where companies are cutting capital investment it is usually not because of fund-raising problems, but because of their gloomy views of product markets. It follows that further cuts in interest rates could have less impact on the real economy than the Bank of Japan might hope. As Mr Masashi Kojima, the president of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's largest company, says: 'Interest rates coming down will not stimulate the economy because there is an underlying lack of demand.' Slow growth would prolong the recession in the financial markets. Financial institutions have always in the past relied on growth to pull them out of trouble by creating opportunities for even bad assets to be sold off. This time, the stock and property markets seem so weak that the possibility of large-scale asset sales seem remote. Yet, there are are a few glimmers of hope. Even though the stock market has fallen through the 20,000 level, it has not dropped far below its range of the past 18 months. Even though few stockbrokers predict a strong recovery from these levels, prices might, perhaps, fall no further. Similarly, parts of the property market show signs of life. After falling 30 per cent or so, prices may have stabilised in areas where there is real demand from users. Estate agents are reporting interest from potential buyers of small flats. The other positive sign, is that the authorities have, so far, done very little to prop up the markets. At the ministry of finance, officials insist that market forces must be allowed to rule. They remain committed to a programme of further financial liberalisation - which includes lowering the barriers between banking and stockbroking and more interest rate deregulation. Meanwhile, at the Bank of Japan, Mr Yasushi Mieno, the governor, refuses to accelerate his plans to cut interest rates. There is an element of bluff in the authorities' position. To prevent others from panicking, they must stay ultra-calm themselves. But, it is worth remembering that these are officials brought up in a strong interventionist tradition. The fact that they have so far resisted the temptation to act, indicates they hope financial companies can cope with the problems themselves. This hope may prove to be misplaced. For example, the authorities are finding it difficult to persuade big banks to bail out Toyo Shinkin, the small Osaka bank which was involved with Ms Onoue. A rescue package will almost certainly have to be topped up with public funds. However, it is a long way from one or two rescues, or even 10, to a more general crisis of confidence in Japan's financial markets. Whether the current financial recession might turn into such a crisis is impossible to say. But for the moment it seems unlikely.</p>

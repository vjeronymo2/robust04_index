			<p>BFN     [Text] Rustenburg April 28 SAPA -- Afrikaner  Weerstandsbeweging [AWB, Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader  Eugene Terreblanche said on Thursday he thought there would be  more explosions if the government ignored the Afrikaner's claim  to land. Speaking at a house where Transvaal Republic President  Paul Kruger once resided outside Rustenburg in the Western  Transvaal, Mr Terreblanche said South Africa was heading for  revolution and war, but from this chaos would rise a "third Boer  republic".    "Long live the third Boer republic which is already  emerging!" he exclaimed in front of about 200 AWB supporters.  The group was escorted to the venue by security forces, and  defence force Ratel panzer vehicles lined the route.    About 50 armed awb members gathered around a sole black  journalist at the rally in front of the house and racially  abused and forcibly expelled him, fists flying in the melee.    Reacting to reports that some Ystergarde [Iron Guard]  members  had been arrested in connection with bomb blasts on the reef, Mr  Terreblanche said that while AWB executive had not given  instructions for the placement of bombs, he would never turn his  back on the suspects and would support them in court.    Speaking on the stoep of the house while his followers  sought  shade beneath thorn trees, Mr Terreblanche made a vow, asking  God to protect his nation and saying: "The struggle our fathers  have started will continue until we died or won."    Once the Zulu nation had lost the elections and then  realised  they were "the biggest nation" in South Africa, the "hell and  terror will go on where it left off a day or two ago".    Afrikaners would not be crushed in this struggle, but would  emerge as the third, civilised, stronger force. From next week  the awb would resist the radical black communist government  "whom we know are trying to destroy us".    AWB spokesman Fred Rundle called on the media at the rally  not to perpetuate the "farce" of there being free and fair  elections.</p>

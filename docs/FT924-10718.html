			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Occupancy rates up at London's top hotels OCCUPANCY at London's higher-priced hotels is rising, but business elsewhere in England is flat and the outlook remains depressed, according to a survey by Horwath, the leisure consultancy, Michael Skapinker writes. London hotels which charge more than Pounds 85 a night saw room occupancy rise from 60 per cent in July last year to 69 per cent in July this year. However, the capital's luxury hotels yesterday warned against reading too much into July's improved figures. Mr Ramon Pajares, general-manager of the Inn on the Park, said the market was too volatile for any hotel to say it could see an improving trend. He added that September had been a good month because of the Farnborough Air Show, but October had been worse than last year. However, he said the weakening of the pound against the dollar could result in an upturn in US business after the presidential election. The Savoy Group agreed it was too early to say the market had revived: 'To say that we are cautiously optimistic would be jumping the gun.' Medium-priced and cheap London hotels showed only marginal improvement. Overall, room occupancy in London was 67 per cent in July, compared with 65 per cent last year. Room occupancy for the whole of England fell 2 percentage points to 60 per cent. Hoteliers saw little prospect of improvement. Respondents describing themselves as pessimistic or very pessimistic rose to 47 per cent, compared with 34.1 per cent three months previously. Asked if the downturn in the industry had ended, 87 per cent said no, against 61.8 per cent three months previously. Only 6 per cent believed the industry would recover fully over the next year.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Bureaucrats assume policy role: Business as usual claimed as important economic talks loom THE UNRAVELLING of Japan's political structure over the past few days has raised concerns about the country's ability to deal with some of the most thorny trade and economic issues it has faced in its post-war history. The fear is that a lame duck government in Japan will stymie progress in important negotiations from the Uruguay Round talks to the Group of Seven summit next month. Japanese authorities are hard-pressed to convince the outside world that it is business as usual. 'Basically there will be no impact on policy,' says Mr Toru Aizawa, director of the Gatt Affairs Office of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, no matter who wins in the elections. Japanese bureaucrats cherish the role they play in forming and implementing policy. The view from the ministries is that Japan has seen prime ministers come and go and has lived with coalition governments in the past, while the bureaucrats have worked away behind the scenes. 'No matter what kind of government is formed, it is possible to continue building on the work that has been done (in trade relations) in a businesslike way,' says an official at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Foreigners who have watched Japan closely agree the political turmoil is unlikely to upset the basic trend toward more open markets. 'Policymaking is usually not at the level of politicians. I think Japan has the ability to carry on,' says Mr Michael Graham, counsellor for trade and industry at the European Community delegation in Tokyo. Trade representatives of the US, EC and Canada are gathering in Tokyo for so-called Quad discussions with their Japanese counterparts tomorrow and Thursday ahead of the G7 summit. There is no doubt the political upheavals will provide a distraction. 'In issues like the US-Japan relationship which are so complicated that they require a political push, things may be difficult,' admitted an official at Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Such issues include the liberalisation of Japan's rice market, the abolition of tariffs on imported spirits which the US and the EC are demanding, and possibly the debate with the US over a new framework for negotiations on trade and economic issues, including a US request to set benchmarks to measure progress in opening Japan's markets. 'Not having a political power-broker in the LDP will make concessions (from Japan) difficult,' says Mr Stephen Anderson, visiting research fellow at Asian Forum Japan, a think tank. In the past when there was a Japanese concession it has often come from the dominant faction in the ruling Liberal Democratic party.</p>

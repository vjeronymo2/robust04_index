			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Plamen Kulinski commentary: "Beware the Fire"] </F>   [Text] Despite the sharp criticism of Athens' decision to  close the port of Thessaloniki for goods from and for Greece,  the Greek Government decided to sharpen its punitive measures.  Furthermore, Greece has even threatened that it will prevent  other neighboring states from helping the former Yugoslav  republic. Indeed, Athens even wanted Bulgaria to join its  punitive measures.    Greece's desire to force Skopje to accept its conditions is  understandable. One can also understand the Papandreou  government's efforts to please radical nationalists, who accuse  him of feebleness toward the former Yugoslav republic. However,  why should other states that have good relations with Macedonia  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] be involved  in all this? The answer might be that the end justifies the  means. Greece, however, seems to forget that one means of  resolving problems is dialogue. Nevertheless, it appears that  the dialogue will not be resumed soon, because Skopje has made  resuming the dialogue with Greece conditional on the lifting of  the embargo.    Until then, as was the case with last year's blockade of the  oil barges in Thessaloniki, Sofia will try to alleviate  Macedonia's economic problems. Sofia will do this regardless of  Athens' displeasure. After all, Greece still cannot forgive  Bulgaria for being the first state to recognize Macedonia's  independence. Naturally, Greece has the right to try to  incorporate Bulgaria in its plans. On the other hand, Sofia  also has the right to refuse to participate in those plans.  Having been burned by fire in past because of other people's  sins, however, Sofia should beware the new fire.</p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Baltic oil terminal agreed Latvia and Lithuania have agreed to build a new Baltic Sea oil terminal in the Latvian port of Liepaja, Reuter reports from Moscow. Agreement was reached at talks between the prime ministers of the two former Soviet republics, Latvian radio said. Interfax news agency said last month that Latvia and Lithuania were planning to form a joint venture to build the terminal, 51 per cent owned by Lithuania and 49 per cent by Latvia. Latvia had previously proposed a joint terminal at its Ventspils port, but Lithuania rejected the site. Lithuania wants the terminal to help diversify supplies for its Mazeikiai refinery, at present dependent on Russian supplies.</p>

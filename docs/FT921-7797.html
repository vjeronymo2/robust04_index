			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Food and drink sector leads rise of 0.4% in retail sales INCREASED food and drink sales led to a modest rise in high-street sales last month, although the volume of sales in other sectors remained flat or fell. Figures released yesterday by the Central Statistical Office showed that retail sales volumes in January rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent compared with December last year, following a 0.9 per cent monthly decline in December. The latest figure gives a year-on-year increase of 0.9 per cent. But against a background of weak sales at the end of last year, and the inability of any retail sector to sustain an upturn in sales, the latest monthly improvement was greeted cautiously. Food sales rose by 3.5 per cent on the month, but the volume of clothing and footwear sales fell by 0.9 per cent and household goods sales, which had improved in December, fell by 4.3 per cent. 'People should not read too much into the figures,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, the Japanese-owned bank. 'If the pick-up in household goods in December had continued into January, then I think we could have become more confident about prospects for a recovery.' The British Retail Consortium said the good performance of the food and drink sector could be attributed to promotional prices during the month and some benefit from Sunday trading. Overall the volume of sales in the three months to January also rose 0.4 per cent compared with the previous quarter. Sales in November to January by food retailers rose 0.2 per cent, compared with the previous three months, while sales by mixed-retail businesses fell 0.6 per cent. The sales of non-food retailers rose 1 per cent in the quarter compared with the previous three-month period. The latest slight improvement follows a report by the Confederation of British Industry earlier this week indicating an increase in sales volumes in the distribution industry. Some economists believe lower mortgage rates - combined with rises in real disposable incomes for those in employment over the past year - will help spending recover this year. However, stock-building figures also released yesterday showed continuing gloom. Stocks held by manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers fell by Pounds 969m in the fourth quarter of last year compared with a Pounds 229m reduction in the three months to September. Manufacturers cut stocks by Pounds 767m following the previous quarter's Pounds 145m reduction, while wholesalers' stocks were down Pounds 80m compared with a previous quarterly fall of Pounds 167m. Retailers' stocks fell Pounds 122m after an increase of Pounds 83m in the third quarter.</p>

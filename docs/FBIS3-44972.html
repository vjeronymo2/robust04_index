Former state president Yang Shangkun arrived in Shenzhen  from Beijing by plane for a visit and inspection.    The last time Yang Shangkun came he was with Deng on an  inspection tour of the south, and he arrived in Shenzhen at the  beginning of 1992. After a year, Yang Shangkun, seeing more and  greater changes in Shenzhen, was happy beyond description.    During his stay in Shenzhen, Yang Shangkun met Li Youwei,  secretary of the Shenzhen CPC Committee and mayor of the city;  Yuan Geng, former executive vice chairman of the board of  directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company  Limited; Wang Ju, member of the Shenzhen CPC Committee Standing  Committee; and Xi Zhongxun, who is resting in Shenzhen.    On the day of his arrival, Yang Shangkun inspected the  Shekou  Industrial Zone. While walking with Yuan Geng, he said that in  the past decade or so Shekou had advanced by leaps and bounds  and tremendous changes had taken place. It was no longer the  small fishing village of 10 years or more before, but an urban  district of a modern city. The reform and opening up policy  advocated by Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of reform and  opening up, was also proved in every way in Shekou to be  entirely correct!    Yuan Geng said that its past appearance had gone for ever!    However, Yuan Geng also said that several dilapidated houses  from those days had been preserved and suggested seeing them on  another day.    Yang Shangkun said they were historical evidence!    On Sunday, 9 January, the Sihai Park in Shekou was full of  people. Yang Shangkun and his party came to the park. They saw  whole families of residents visiting the park. Some were  pushing their babies in buggies and children were playing  happily everywhere. Yang Shangkun was greatly interested in the  place and walked around for more than half an hour. He praised  Shekou once more saying that it was like a park and was full of  life.</p>

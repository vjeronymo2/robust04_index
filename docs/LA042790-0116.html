			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JANITORS THREATEN CENTURY CITY STRIKE  </P> <P> Representatives of 113 janitors employed by a major cleaning company at nine  Century City office buildings said at a demonstration Thursday that they have  authorized the Service Employees International Union to call a strike if the  cleaning firm does not recognize the union as the bargaining agent for the  janitors.  </P> <P> The union's national "Justice for Janitors" campaign has won union recognition  for janitors at a number of office buildings in downtown Los Angeles. But the  union has yet to make any headway in its 7-month-old campaign to organize  workers employed in Century City by non-union International Service System Inc.  </P></p>

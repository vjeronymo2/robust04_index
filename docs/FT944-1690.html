			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Trafalgar may launch Northern bid today Trafalgar House executives were meeting advisers last night amid expectations that the conglomerate will launch a bid today for Northern Electric, the regional power company. With a final decision on timing to be taken early this morning, it was still possible that the conglomerate would wait until the New Year to bid. However that seemed unlikely last night. Any takeover attempt will be fiercely contested by Northern Electric and will probably face a forceful political lobby in the north-east of England where the company is based. Trafalgar is expected to pitch its opening offer at a relatively low premium to the 985p share price at the close of business on Friday, when the company was valued at about Pounds 1.1bn. The company may leave the publication of a formal offer document and the opening price until the new year. Last week the government said it would not waive its 'golden share' in each of the 12 regional electricity companies before the end of March. This effectively ruled out the completion of a deal before then. Trafalgar is likely to offer Northern shareholders either cash or convertible preference shares. Hongkong Land, the Jardine Matheson arm which owns 25 per cent of Trafalgar, is likely to underwrite some of the issue. Trafalgar last week reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 45.6m for 1993-94, against a loss of Pounds 347m the previous year. Northern on Monday announced a 20.5 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 63.4m. The 30 per cent dividend increase was one of the highest reported by regional electricity companies in the current results season. Trafalgar is thought to be undecided about the fate of Northern's management should its takeover attempt succeed. Trafalgar's potential bid has intensified speculation that the structure of the electricity industry will be transformed in the next few years either by more takeovers or friendly mergers. It is also possible that other companies will enter the fray for Northern or other regional electricity companies. Hanson and Tomkins have been suggested as candidates.</p>

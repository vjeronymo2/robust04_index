			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 30 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik today said he considered accelerating economic reforms  to be the priority of his cabinet's six-month activity until the  elections.    "We would like to speed up economic transformation," he told  reporters. "There are provisional governments which manage to do  much more than those which have more time, because they have  enough courage to take resolute steps," Moravcik said, adding  that "it would be good if we could lay down irreversible  elements for the future of Slovakia."    The government's policy statement is to be discussed by  Parliament on April 12.    Moravcik confirmed his intention to secure a stand-by loan  from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to support Slovakia's  payments balance. The IMF's condition for the loan is that  Slovakia keep its budget deficit below the four percent mark.    He denied speculations that his cabinet was preparing to  devalue the Slovak currency. The government intends to gain  additional budget revenue from privatization income and by  fighting against tax and customs duty evasions, Moravcik said.  Nevertheless, he said "certain restrictions will be necessary"  and will have an effect on the social sphere. He indicated the  possibility of cutting state subsidies and liberalizing prices  to a greater extent, which, he said, should not affect the  poorer strata of the population.    Moravcik said the decision of the former Meciar cabinet to  sell part of the shares of the steel producer Vychodoslovenske  zieleziarne [East Slovak Iron Works] VSZ in Kosice to a private  company, headed by ex-finance minister Julius Toth, for  one-fifth of their nominal price was an example of the  impoverishment of the state.    "The (Meciar) cabinet actually decided to pour one billion  crowns from the state into the private sphere for free," said  Moravcik. He added that no offense had been committed from the  legal point of view, but members of the former cabinet who  approved of the sale ought to bear political responsibility. He  said the possibility of canceling the transaction was being  considered.</p>

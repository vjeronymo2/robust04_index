			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Nuclear Weapon, Indian Designs and the </F> U.S. Strategy"]    [Text] The United States -- the world's sole superpower --  claims to be the greatest champion of nuclear nonproliferation.  Assigning itself the role of world watchman, it has adopted a  very strong policy to check nuclear proliferation in Korea,  South Asia, and the Middle East. Reports, however, come in  occasionally which make it easy for anyone to understand that  the U.S. policy on the nuclear nonproliferation issue is to a  great extent discriminatory and subservient to its own specific  considerations. According to the latest report released in the  United States, which was prepared in accordance with the  instructions of the upper house of the Congress, the United  States since 1988 gave permission for 1,500 export consignments  which could be used for the manufacture of nuclear weapons.  They included very complicated high-speed computers, lasers,  furnaces, and machine parts. At least half of these 1,500  export consignments were destined to companies and organizations  which were involved with and working for the Israeli nuclear  weapon program. During this period, 33 items were exported to  India which could be used for the manufacture of nuclear  weapons. All of these export items were sent to the Bhabha  Atomic Research Center in Bombay where, according to the CIA,  India is now engaged in producing a hydrogen bomb. The report  says that a very limited quantity of exports also was made  available to Brazil, Argentina, Iraq, South Africa, Iran, and  Pakistan, but it was very negligible compared to what was  supplied to Israel and India. Israel, in particular, was  supplied 238 computers which were very useful in the manufacture  of nuclear weapons.    It is not at all difficult to understand from this report  that the U.S. policy of pressure on the nuclear weapons issue is  not only unfair and inequitable, but also aimed at helping the  countries of its choice with their nuclear programs. It is  unfortunate that despite pursuing such a policy, the United  States is claiming that it is treating all countries in a  nondiscriminatory manner on the nuclear nonproliferation issue.  With direct U.S. help, Israel has become so advanced in the  manufacture of nuclear weapons and missiles that if, God forbid,  a situation occurs when it is forced to display and use its  weapons then the world will remained stunned to see the height  of advancement Israel has achieved in the production of nuclear  weapons. Similarly, India, with the U.S. help and with its own  resources has developed its nuclear program, turning itself into  a significant nuclear power. Also, it is fast accelerating its  missile program.    India had temporarily halted its Prithvi missile test during  Prime Minister Narasimha Rao's recent visit to the United  States. Preparations, however, are under way now to resume the  tests and Indian scientists have reached the test venue in  Orissa. It has also been reported that these missiles will be  deployed along Pakistan's border adjoining Indian Punjab and  Rajasthan states. Later, they will be extended to the state of  Jammu and Kashmir.    The United States is fully aware of India's nuclear program  and its implications. During his recent visit to the United  States, the Indian prime minister had made it clear that India  was not ready to accept any U.S. suggestion about its nuclear  program. The Indian stand now is that it is not ready to accept  any restriction on its nuclear program even if Pakistan signs  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty unilaterally and India will  accept a restriction only when a program to abolish the nuclear  weapon is implemented on a global basis. It is not realistic  if, after knowing the Indian stand, the United States still  feels that it can succeed in checking nuclear proliferation.  Given this situation, there is no justification for the United  States to exert any pressure on Pakistan.    In view of the U.S. and Indian attitude, a school of thought  in Pakistan is suggesting that we should also declare that we  are not prepared to accept any restriction even if India accepts  one on its nuclear program. If the U.S. and Indian attitude  remains as it is now, then a time will come when it will not be  possible to prevent this school of thought in Pakistan from  becoming more powerful and popular. The U.S. Government now is  realistic to the extent that it is not asking Pakistan to  unilaterally roll back its nuclear program. Implementing the  Pressler Amendment against us, however, is totally unjustified.  In view of Indian designs and the policy of the United States  itself, the United States has no justification for putting  pressure on Pakistan. The whole nation supports the Government  of Pakistan's stand that we will not accept any unilateral  restriction on our nuclear program.</p>

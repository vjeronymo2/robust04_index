Speaking at a news conference here, Gaviria said he asked  for  the loan earlier in the day when he met with Mitsuhide  Yamaguchi, governor of the government-financed bank.    Gaviria quoted Yamaguchi as expressing interest in  cooperating with Colombia in promoting a 6 billion dollar  project to develop the Cusiana oil field, believed to have oil  deposits of some 1.5 billion barrels.    Gaviria, who arrived in Tokyo Saturday for a five-day visit,  said he expects an Ex-Im Bank loan to help encourage Japanese  banks and companies to join the project.    On other topics, Gaviria said his country will make a formal  application soon for membership in the Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum.</p>

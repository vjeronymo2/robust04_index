			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The voice of Judy Jetson in the full-length animated feature "Jetsons: The  Movie" will be that of pop singing star Tiffany, not Janet Waldo, who was  Judy's original voice. Tiffany also performs three new songs on the sound track  of the Hanna-Barbera film. Joseph Barbera said through a spokesman that  "Tiffany's voice is so promiment in the musical segments of the film that we  decided to feature her in the spoken part as well." A fully recorded sound  track with Waldo was thrown out. Speculation that Tiffany was brought in to  attract a teen audience could not be confirmed. Hanna-Barbera said that the  decision was made by Universal, the film's distributor. Universal could not be  reached for comment at press time. The picture is due to be released at  Christmas.  </P></p>

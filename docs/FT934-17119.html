			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Scottish TV shares fall despite rise AN INCREASE in programme sale and services was behind a 42 per cent rise in pre-tax profits at Scottish Television, the independent television contractor. On turnover up 12 per cent at Pounds 64m (Pounds 57.1m), including Pounds 22m (Pounds 9.5m) from programme sales and services, pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993 were Pounds 3.13m (Pounds 2.2m). However the shares lost 42p to close at 436p. Competition from Channel Four for advertising had contributed to the company's share of ITV advertising revenue falling from 5.5 per cent to 5.2 per cent. Among its subsidiaries the programme production company had an excellent year but Pauline Hyde and Associates saw profits all but eliminated while maintaining turnover. There were also losses at GMTV, the breakfast station. While the station was trying to ensure there was no further significant loss in the second half, STV said it was providing for its expected share of losses over the year. It said the full year would be affected by losses at GMTV and Pauline Hyde but the strength of the core television business should enable profits to continue rising. Earnings were 5.84p (2.88p). The interim dividend is being raised to 2.1563p (1.725p).</p>

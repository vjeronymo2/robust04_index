			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: The hardest part of managing funds Sir, I must take issue with Mr Alan Greenhorn's somewhat odd and perhaps disingenuous statement in your Risk and Reward column of October 4 ('Setback for active quantitative fund management sector') that 'performance measurement is the most difficult aspect of fund management'. Is not generating performance the most difficult - not to mention important - aspect of fund management? The mutual funds industry (unit trusts in your parlance) learnt long ago how to measure quite accurately its performance, even with the complications due to large daily cash flows in and out from many thousands, if not millions, of customers. One hopes that Mr Greenhorn in fact is confusing performance measurement with performance attribution and benchmarking. On this we do agree that 'new forms of measurement are needed' when it comes to relative, as opposed to absolute, performance, particularly for non-traditional types of funds.

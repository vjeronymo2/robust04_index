			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Welsh Office accounts queried The National Audit Office has qualified the Welsh Office accounts on roads expenditure for the fifth successive year. It has also qualified its accounts on training programmes, where it estimates payment errors of Pounds 5.96m, and on the community charge. Sir John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, says in a report published today: 'Significant amounts of advances (to local highways authorities) made before March 1991 are the subject either of overdue claims or of claims bearing qualified audit certificates.' He concluded there was 'material uncertainty as to the final amounts properly chargeable'. Sir John said he was encouraged by Welsh Office systems improvements which meant advances were now being recorded satisfactorily. The Welsh Office responded by saying there had never been any suggestion of misappropriation of funds in any NAO report on roads. It said that only Pounds 4m of claims out of over Pounds 430m paid between 1974 and 1990 were still to be resolved. Responsibility for training in Wales transferred from the Department of Employment to the Welsh Office in April last year. Mr Bourn said weaknesses in financial control by the employment department in previous years had largely continued in Wales in 1992-93. 'Erroneous payments to Training and Enterprise Councils continue at significant levels,' he said. The main problems included lack of documentary evidence by the Tecs to support claims and arithmetic errors. The Welsh Office said it had set up a team to monitor improved controls. On the community charge, Mr Bourn said the Welsh Office had made erroneous overpayments in March 1993 to four authorities totalling Pounds 963,000. The Welsh Office said the money had since been recovered.</p>

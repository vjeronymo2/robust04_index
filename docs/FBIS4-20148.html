			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference held by Romanian President Ion Iliescu at </F> the Palais Marigny, in Paris on 15 April: "News Conference by  President Ion Iliescu in Paris"]    [Text]  <H5>  Statement Before the News Conference </H5>   [Iliescu] I would like to say just a few words. The  political part of the visit is drawing to its end. I would like  to say that the entire visit, my talks with politicians, the  prime minister, the foreign minister, and the presidents of the  two chambers of parliament, and my meetings with the  representatives of the employers have been very open and  friendly. First, we wanted to convey our message of friendship  toward France, on this, my first visit here at this level --  that is, my first state visit to France, as I have been to  France on several other occasions in the past, for various  international conferences or on private visits, about a year and  a half ago, but this is my first state visit here -- and I  believe that it marks an important political moment in the  development of political relations between our two countries.  This visit is also a response to President Mitterrand's visit  to Romania. Second, the political discussions that I have  conducted here offered an opportunity to draw up a balance sheet  of the state of our relations. We came to the joint conclusion  that political, scientific, and human relations are developing  very favorably. We can ascertain, both in Romania and France,  that regardless of the political differences in terms of  government, a constant atmosphere of good relations between our  countries is being maintained at the bilateral level. We want  to emphasize and underscore this. Another very important aspect  stressed during the visit is the joint interest in developing  our economic relations. In my political discussions as well as  in the talks with the representatives from business, I pointed  out the need to develop bilateral ties in this sphere and  France's role in our economic relations. We noted that there  are many positive examples of mutually advantageous relations,  but we also noted that the situation in this field is pretty  modest, hence we should jointly make further efforts to  capitalize on the overall positive climate in the economic  sphere, as well. Of course, there are problems in our country,  since we are in a time of transition. There is a lot of  inertia, inertia of the state apparatus and economic units, as  well as disruption caused by the abolition of the old  structures and decentralization. All these phenomena are linked  to the transition and are causing problems. However, we must  overcome these difficulties. We have a joint interest in  economic integration into Europe. France must ratify Romania's  association accord with the European Community, a procedure  which will take place next week; the Senate will ratify the  accord at the beginning of May. Thus, Romania will be  integrated into this system of relations. We also talked about  the political problems of the continent -- the Yugoslav  conflict, security problems, and the French initiative regarding  a European framework of stability. Generally speaking, I would  like to point out that all the talks that I have held here have  been positive and that I found a platform for cooperation and  for expanding our bilateral ties. We also had a festive moment  at the Paris City Hall and I took that opportunity to convey our  sentiments to the citizens of Paris as well as the intention to  develop our relations at this level, too, that is between our  local administrations.  <H5>  The Dialogue With Journalists </H5>   [Correspondent] Are any agreements going to be signed during  your visit here?    [Iliescu] It is not the object of our state visit to sign  economic agreements. We just reviewed all aspects of political  and other relations between our countries and emphasized the  joint will and desire to capitalize on the very favorable  framework of the relations between our countries, to consolidate  it, to facilitate the expansion of bilateral relations, and to  take joint steps at various European levels to promote stability  and security on the continent as well as the process of  all-European integration.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, a Paris daily has today  published an article by Doina Cornea [leader of Romania's  opposition Group for Social Dialogue], who, instead of welcoming  you to France, actually criticizes the authorities in Romania  for hesitation -- and I would like you to clarify this for the  French press -- for hesitation over Romania's policy between  East and West and the results of this hesitation.    [Iliescu] We are not surprised about Mrs. Cornea's opinions.  She constantly says "no" to everything; therefore her statements  always have an emotional connotation for electoral purposes.  Therefore, I believe one should not attach too much importance  to her assessments. Regarding our foreign policy, I do not  think one can talk about vacillation, but, on the contrary,  there is a constant element in our foreign policy that, I could  say, enjoys an unanimous backing, regardless of Romania's  internal controversies and problems, which are natural in any  political struggle. I believe that there is a very broad  understanding, as far as the political language and consensus  are concerned, on the major points of our foreign policy. We  have been able to ascertain this at various times when Romania  had to adopt certain positions and I have noticed that there is  a common platform of understanding on these issues.    What does "oscillation between East and West" mean? All  the West European countries are interested in and are promoting  an active policy toward Central and East Europe and toward  Russia, in particular. What Mrs. Cornea wants, s what she is  aiming at and the ideas that she is advocating, is that Romania  should promote a policy designed to create tension in relations  with Russia. However, this is not in Romania's national  interest. Neither the United States nor the European countries  think that it is in their interest to promote such a policy. I  emphasized a special aspect of the issue, which I believe I even  told our French partners about, namely that France is  represented in Chisinau by its embassy in Moscow, not by the  French ambassador in Bucharest. Hence, you can see how far  sensitivity toward relations with Russia goes. Therefore, what  are we supposed to show? Such a thing is totally unwise. I  believe that last night's statements by President Mitterrand on  the balanced nature of Romanian policy are a commensurate  assessment of an experienced politician, who shows greater  understanding for Romania's national interests than certain  Romanians, who have no political feeling toward the problems of  concern for Romania.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, you have conducted a steady  diplomatic activity in the Balkans. What is Romania's mediating  role in the region?    [Iliescu] Of course Romania, as well as the close neighbors  of former Yugoslavia and of Serbia, is very concerned with the  events in the former Yugoslavia. Romania is directly affected  by the embargo. But the conflict as such, which can pose a great  danger for the entire region, directly affects and concerns us.  There is no doubt that our means are very modest.  Nevertheless, despite all this, we have made and continue to  make efforts to contribute to creating a favorable climate for a  political solution. We conducted talks on the issue with  important French politicians yesterday and today. We found a  common platform on the conclusion that military methods cannot  help solve the problem. Generally speaking, military means  cannot offer solutions. On the contrary, they create  complications and exacerbate tensions. That is why I believe  that we should promote only political solutions and all efforts  should focus in this direction. We appreciate all the efforts  made by the European Community, the United States, and Russia to  contribute to a rapprochement and a proper climate for helping  the parties directly involved to find political solutions. Of  course, when conflicts break out -- and it is always easy to  trigger a conflict -- it is much more difficult to stop them.  When the conflicts have already taken on proportions and people  have been killed, then the vendetta exacerbates the situation.  This is how the situation has evolved in the former Yugoslavia:  First the conflict broke out between the Serbs and the Croats  and later on it extended to Bosnia; well, it is much more  difficult now to find an acceptable solution for all sides. We  have also witnessed certain contradictory developments, since  there are times when there is hope for a solution. In the last  few days, I have witnessed quite a few contradictory moments.  We hope that a solution will finally be found. In this case,  as far as Bosnia is concerned, it is clear that we cannot  resolve the problem without the Serbs and that solutions must be  found to facilitate the dialogue among all sides in Bosnia --  the Croats, the Muslims, and the Serbs -- together. I cannot  make any comments on the raids. Anyhow, I consider the resort to  force and military means -- we have proof of it before us -- as  ineffective in solving problems. One should make further  efforts to support political dialogue and solutions.    [Correspondent] You have often said that France is one of  the  most friendly countries toward Romania. I would like to know to  what extent this visit to Paris will help overcome the  reservations that certain European countries still have toward  Romania.    [Iliescu] I would say that, from this viewpoint, things have  improved and the evolution has been quite positive in recent  years within the Council of Europe and the European Union.  There has also been a change in the position of various  countries in Europe vis-a- vis Romania and Romania's admission  to these European institutions. This means that there is a  positive evolution in general. France has helped us throughout  this period in direct talks and in other negotiations within  these European bodies and I hope that this visit will make a new  contribution to improving the overall climate for our  integration into Europe and for our direct relations with the  other states in West Europe.    [Correspondent] I would like to ask you, Mr. President,  whether the problem of the minorities, and especially the  Hungarian minority, was mentioned during the talks? In a  broader sense, do you think that Hungary and Romania are very  far from signing a friendship agreement?    [Iliescu] We have not particularly focussed on these  matters,  but, of course, in talking about a stability pact in Europe and  in Central and East Europe, we tackled the issue of relations  between neighboring countries and mentioned our position of  openness toward everything concerned with relations with all our  neighbors, and particularly Hungary.    I believe that others have problems in accepting Romanian  tradition and legislation, particularly with regard to the  Hungarian minority, since we are talking about it. In talks  held with Hungary's representatives -- not here, of course -- we  have noted that it is more difficult for Hungary accept Romanian  policy regarding legislation and constitutional provisions on  the parliamentary representation of all minorities; various  studies; teaching and education in the mother tongue; and  communication and cultural institutions in the mother tongue.  These apply not to the Hungarian minority, which is the largest  and has these possibilities, but also for the smaller ones, too.  In this respect, we have no difficulty in discussing and  adjusting ourselves to European norms. I believe that others  have more difficulty in adjusting to these norms than we have.  However, I think that on this issue of good understanding with  the neighbors, it is not only the problem of the minorities that  counts, but also the whole range of issues linked to relations  of good understanding among the neighbors. We would also like  to create such a climate. We believe that we have good relations  with our neighbors, even with Hungary. There is some  controversy regarding various aspects, even with regard to the  basic political treaty between our countries, but I hope that  after the elections [in Hungary], when things quiet down, we  will find a common solution to create a legal basis for good  neighborliness between our countries. There is no reason for us  not to maintain normal relations between our countries. We have  a common interest in promoting relations of good neighborliness.  We can say that, even now, we have better economic relations  with Hungary than with the other neighboring countries and that  all the conditions exist for good communications between our  countries and the citizens of our countries. Therefore, I hope  that the climate will improve after the electoral campaign,  which generally affects the people's thinking.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, what answer will you give to  King Mihai's request to spend the Orthodox Easter in Timisoara?  Maybe you will change your attitude, in view of the evolution  toward a calmer situation in your country?    [Iliescu] I have openly stated my attitude vis-a-vis this  visit. Former King Mihai was already in Romania for the Easter  holiday in 1992. Last October, he made a similar request. I  asked him to regard his visit to Romania as private, not as the  sovereign, as he put it. In this respect, we asked him to adopt  a clear position regarding his attitude toward the existing  constitutional form of the Romanian state. We asked him to  respect this choice of the Romanian people and the private  character of his visit. However, this problem will be resolved  by the Romanian Government, through direct communications with  him. This is not necessarily the way for him to give an answer,  but he must make a clear commitment if he wants to receive a  visa. You know that the members of the Bourbon family were not  allowed to visit France for a whole century. The first Bourbon  was allowed to set foot in France only during de Gaulle's time.  You know that in Italy no representative of the royal family  has been allowed in the country since 1947. You also know the  Greek Government's position vis-a-vis the former king. We do  not want to take similar measures, but we want to have clear-cut  relations in this respect.    [Correspondent] Romania is member of the Francophonie [group  of countries]. The French Parliament is currently holding a  debate on the French language. What are your feelings in this  respect and what can you say in this connection?    [Iliescu] Romania participated in the last meetings in Paris  and Mauritius as a full member of the organization. We belong  to several Francophonie commissions. Therefore, we are already  an active member and are concretely participating in the  activities of this organization. We even suggested that a  Francophonie meeting should be organized in our country. The  matter is still under discussion. The next meeting will held in  Benin. As for 1997, there is a proposal from Vietnam in this  respect, which will be accepted. Consequently, Romania will  offer to host the meeting in 1999.    [Correspondent] What are your results regarding the  encouragement of foreign investment in Romania? Are there  pressures from abroad for further political reforms to be  promoted?    [Iliescu] I believe that we have very liberal legal and  juridical provisions for stimulating foreign investment and  there is already an active presence of the foreign capital in  our economy. We have some 30,000 joint companies with foreign  capital. However, the level of investment is still very modest,  since the invested capital amounts to $1 billion. Therefore,  we expect proposals for larger investment. We have a new  government initiative, which is now being discussed in  parliament, for new incentives to be granted to large investment  projects in excess of $50 million. Similarly, we are also  discussing a law on setting up free trade zones. We are now  organizing free-trade zones near Constanta and we hope that  these new facilities will encourage the participation of large  investors. Investors from all over Europe are operating in our  country, from France, Italy -- Italy ranks third in investment,  while France is in the second place -- Germany, England, and the  Netherlands. These states have already made sizable investment.  The Japanese and South Koreans will follow suit. Therefore, we  have accumulated some experience and we hope to develop it  further in the near future.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, you said that France would  be the best investor for Romania. If my information is correct,  the sum total of the capital invested is $80 million. This is  no small amount, but then again, it is no big sum either. On  the other hand, you realize that France is going through a  rather difficult economic period right now. Under these  circumstances, do you think that your visit will mark the start  of overcoming reticence? What are your hopes after this visit?    [Iliescu] I discussed this subject particularly with Premier  Edouard Balladur and the representative of the French employers.  On the one hand, we praised the positive French presence and  certain interesting and efficient experiments. For instance,  there is the ALCATEL company, which has set up a joint company  in Timisoara to produce telephone exchanges, as an integral part  of a strategic program to modernize the central urban telephone  network in Romania. There are two companies participating in  this program, which thus ensures a proper competitive framework.  There is AlcateL, with a joint company set up in Timisoara, and  Siemens, with a joint company in Bucharest called  Electromagnetica. Together with the Ministry of Communications,  all sides have divided their assignments among themselves and  are competing to cover the entire territory with new equipment.  We have had three stages in the development of the telephone  network in Romania. The first stage -- 60 years ago -- was  based on mechanical technology and is still operational today in  Bucharest, at the Telephone Palace. The second stage began in  the 1960's, with technology assimilated from domestic  production. The first step was made by Electromagnetica in this  respect. Now we are entering the third stage, based on the  computerization of telephone communications. Therefore, this is  a good experience, properly appreciated by both the French and  Romanian sides. A second experience that I would like to  mention is linked to my recent visits and talks with the  Bouygues company. This is one of the strongest and  internationally known companies in construction. It is building  the most important project currently under construction in  Bucharest, namely the World Trade Center, as an institution that  will be integrated into the global computerized communication  network in international trade, with its center at the World  Trade Center in New York. The complex will include a Star  Jument Hotel, shops, exhibition halls, and office space for  commercial companies. This also represents an interesting  experiment. Bouygues has cooperated with Romanian designers,  experts, and engineers, hence it has been a good experience.  Bouygues plans to expand this kind of activity in Romania.  Similarly, there are cooperation ventures in electronics, the  start of cooperation with companies from Lorraine, and there are  interesting projects in agriculture; in this respect, I recently  visited a seed-producing joint company. I would also note a  three-year-old joint experiment in sugar beet growing and  processing. I visited the Urziceni factory, which has joined  the project and has shown good and profitable results, including  for our French partner. There are quite a few projects that  prove the use and mutual benefit of cooperation. Both of our  sides assessed the volume of this participation as still rather  modest. However, despite certain difficulties, we believe that  it is possible to expand it. I have examined this matter with  the representatives of the French employers and with Prime  Minister Balladur, who promised to examine certain aspects  directly linked to credits, so as to ensure the appropriate  facilities. Therefore, I believe that my visit and talks have  made an important contribution to stimulating common interests  along these lines.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, since I suspect you of being  an emotional man, I would like to suggest the following  scenario: Suppose that you had just arrived in Paris now, not in  your capacity as president, but as simple Romanian citizen, and  had discovered Paris adorned with Romanian and French flags.  The question is: What kind of thoughts would spring to your  mind? Then, I would like you to tell me whether you can give us  some details about the continuation of the French-Romanian  dialogue at high or other levels.    [Iliescu] Regarding the emotional aspect, I would obviously  feel very pleased with such an expression of mutual sentiments  of friendship, which are but a continuation of a very rich  tradition throughout our history. Regarding the prospects for  continued dialogue, this is very clear. We are talking about  determination to continue this dialogue. We are expecting the  visit of the French foreign minister to Bucharest at the  beginning of next autumn. Similarly, we have invited Prime  Minister Balladur to visit Romania at the end of the year, and  Mr. Balladur has accepted. We have also invited the president  of France, Mr. Francois Mitterrand, to pay another visit to  Romania. We also expect a number of visits at the ministerial  level this year, in order to work out the concrete details of  the joint projects in various fields, including the economic one.</p>

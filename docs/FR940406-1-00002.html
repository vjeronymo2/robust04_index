Consistent with that legislation, this rulemaking would add homelessness and migrancy to the predisposing nutritional risk conditions for the WIC Program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule would also alter the current WIC nutritional risk priority system by placing individuals certified for WIC due solely to homelessness or migrancy in Priority VII, along with previously certified participants who might regress in nutritional status without continued provision of supplemental foods. The use of Priority VII for this latter group of individuals would remain a State agency option. However, State agencies would be required to use Priority VII for homeless or migrant individuals who are certified solely due to their homelessness or migrancy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The intended effect of this proposed rule is to allow categorical and income-eligible homeless or migrant individuals, who lack any other documented nutritional or medical condition, to receive WIC Program assistance.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  To be assured of consideration, written comments must be received on or before June 6, 1994.

Pursuant to that review, William E. Ludwig, Administrator of the Food and Nutrition Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. WIC local agency participant caseloads may potentially increase and thereby affect demand on local food vendor business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

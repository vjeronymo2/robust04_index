He said figures of "10%, 15% and 20% were all mentioned."  </P> <P> "Another possible scenario is management paying attention to some areas to cut  costs," Cook said. "I have mentioned that to Checchi."  </P> <P> Northwest employs about 44,000 workers, about 16,500 in Minnesota. A 15% cut  would amount to 6,600 jobs.  </P></p>

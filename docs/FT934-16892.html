			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Clarke hints at Pounds 6bn tax rises MR Kenneth Clarke yesterday fuelled expectations among ministerial colleagues that he is considering Budget tax increases of between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 6bn by flatly rejecting further cuts in public spending. Speaking on the eve of the Conservative party conference, the chancellor said the Treasury's existing targets had already produced the 'bloodiest' spending round since the Conservatives took office in 1979. His comments came as Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, said the Blackpool conference would mark the beginning of the government's political recovery. In an interview with the FT, Mr Hurd also dismissed suggestions of a crisis surrounding Mr John Major's leadership. Mr Clarke, however, predicted that the public spending details when publicised would cause 'howls of rage' and hinted at cutbacks in the civil service, a fresh round of defence cuts and restrictions on a range of welfare benefits. Other ministers said the government's housing, roads and public transport budgets were among the main victims. Mr Clarke has summoned his Treasury team to a planning session at his Dorneywood country house in mid-October to agree the broad framework for his November 30 Budget. But although he has taken no firm decisions yet on the scale and distribution of tax increases, colleagues said that a 'significant' rise now looked inevitable to curb public borrowing. Mr Clarke's blunt assessment of the outlook for borrowing and spending reinforced fears in the Conservative party hierarchy of a stormy mood at a conference seen as critical to Mr Major's hold on the premiership. The chancellor insisted that the threat of a grass roots rebellion would not force a retreat from the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel. Speaking on independent television's Walden programme, he said the Treasury would retain the timetable for an 8 per cent levy next April, moving up to the full 17.5 per cent in 1995. The chancellor also gave a clear hint that he was sticking to his plans to secure a faster reduction in the government's Pounds 50bn annual borrowing requirement. With the Treasury warning that a pick-up in the rate of economic growth has yet to make any significant dent in the borrowing requirement, senior ministers said the mood in the cabinet pointed to a net increase in tax of between Pounds 4bn and Pounds 6bn. That would be in addition to the Pounds 6bn of tax increases for 1994-95 and the Pounds 10bn for 1995-96 already put in place by Mr Lamont. Mr Clarke hinted that tax increases should fall on those items currently zero-rated for VAT. Some of the chancellor's colleagues expect that he may seek to get the bulk of the additional revenue by restricting income tax allowances to the 20p lower rate of income tax.

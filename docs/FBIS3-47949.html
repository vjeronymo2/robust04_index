			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Friday [21 January] he will pursue to the very end  of the current Diet session on January 29 enactment of the  political reform bills rejected by the upper house earlier in  the day.    At a press conference following the rejection of the  government-sponsored package of four bills by the House of  Councillors, Hosokawa said he will do his utmost during the  remaining days of the Diet session to have the package passed.    Hosokawa said he has no plans to dissolve the House of  Representative for a snap general election or resign over his  failure to have the bills clear the Diet.    The premier has repeatedly suggested he would step down or  dissolve the lower house if he failed to get the political  reform bills enacted.    Hosokawa said he will seek the enactment of the reform bills  through a joint meeting of representatives from both chambers.    Under Article 59 of the Constitution, the lower house can  call such a joint meeting to reach a compromise on bills  rejected by the upper house.    The 252-member upper chamber voted down the bills aimed at  introducing a election system combining single-seat  constituencies and proportional representation in the lower  house and changing the system of political fund-raising. The  bills cleared the lower house on November 18.    A total of 17 upper house members of the Social Democratic  Party [of Japan], the largest force in the coalition government,  voted against the bills in defiance of the party line.</p>

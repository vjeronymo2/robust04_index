			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 6 Apr (XINHUA) -- Our country has made new  headway in judicial administrative work. Last year, it achieved  new results in improving legal and legal protection services, as  well as in serving the needs for deepening reform, opening wider  to the outside world, and developing the socialist market  economy.    It has been disclosed that by the end of 1993, more than  66,700 people were engaged in law-related work across the  nation, up 46.3 percent from 1992. Of these, more than 30,400  were full-time lawyers, a 37.4-percent increase over 1992 which  represented the fastest growth since the counsel system was  reinstituted in 1980. Law organizations have also proliferated.  By the end of 1993, the number of law offices across the  country exceeded 5,100, a 22.8- percent increase over 1992 which  represented the largest growth in years. Of these, 502 law  offices were not covered by state staffing and funding plans, a  150-percent increase over 1992.    Lawyers' workload in providing legal services to clients and  in serving as intermediaries in the market also increased  significantly in 1993. By the end of 1993, lawyers across the  country served as regular legal consultants to more than 185,800  organizations, enterprises, institutions, and citizens, up 22.6  percent from 1992. Lawyers represented their clients in more  than 483,300 civil and commercial cases, up 21.9 percent from  1992, and handled more than 18,400 law cases involving  foreigners, up 25.2 percent from 1992.    It has been disclosed that new progress was also made in  notarial service across the country in 1993. By the end of  1993, the number of notarial offices totaled 3,066 nationwide,  85 more than in 1992. Notarial offices or their representative  offices were set up in some bonded zones and economic  development zones. There were 167,000 notaries public of all  types. Notarial cases of all types concluded throughout the  year totaled 7.96 million, 3.42 million of which were related to  the economy.    It has been disclosed that prisons and reform-through-labor  institutions across the country held more than 1.244 million  criminals by the end of 1993. More than 247,000 criminals had  their sentences reduced in the same year because they showed  concrete signs of repentance and performed meritorial services  while serving their terms; more than 33,000 criminals were  released on parole and another 34,000 or more were freed on  medical parole. In the same year, more than 301,000 people were  released upon completing their prison terms.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Environment Minister Yosi Sarid by </F> Shlomo Ganor on 8 April -- videorecorded in Hebrew with Arabic  subtitles; processed from Hebrew]    [Text] [Ganor] Mr. Sarid, what kind of steps are called  for in order to stop the wave of terrorist attacks and stabilize  internal security?    [Sarid] First of all, it should be clear to all Israeli  citizens that we do not need terrorist attacks to remind us to  take all necessary steps. The Army, police, and Shin Bet  constantly do everything in their power to prevent terrorist  attacks. We have the best army, police, and security services.  Even the best security forces, however, cannot prevent every  terrorist attack from taking place. That is simply impossible.  That is the case in Israel as well as all around the world.  Nevertheless, the government is now taking additional steps. A  total closure was imposed on the territories yesterday. If this  closure requires bringing foreign workers to Israel then there  will be no recourse but to adopt this idea. We do not like this  option but we like terrorist attacks even less.    [Ganor] Despite all the efforts to persuade him, PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat has refused to condemn these terrorist  attacks. What is your reaction to this?    [Sarid] I vehemently condemn his lack of condemnation.  First, I think that 'Arafat is making a grievous mistake with  regard to his own position. He will not be doing us any favors  by issuing a condemnation. His condemnation will not bring the  dead back to life. I think that he is making a mistake on his  own part because any civilized person must condemn such a  terrible and monstrous deed. I am very surprised that Yasir  'Arafat does not understand this. The second reason is the fact  that we are in the midst of a political process which is based,  among other things, on trust. It is totally clear that if the  level of trust drops, the political process will eventually  suffer. 'Arafat should be more interested in the progress of  the political process than any other party -- certainly more  than us.    [Ganor] Do you join those, including several cabinet  ministers, who are calling for a suspension of the talks with  the Palestinians?    [Sarid] God forbid. I think that would be the worst  possible mistake. That would be giving the most extreme people  -- Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in this case -- exactly  what they want. If we were to do that, it would not be the  government, the Knesset, or even the Israeli people themselves  who would decide our fate but rather the last, accursed  terrorist who would be ready to carry out a suicide mission. By  granting this terrorist the power to stop the negotiations we  would be entrusting our fate to him. That is a totally  unacceptable prospect.    [Ganor] What were your impressions regarding the seriousness  of the Palestinian negotiators from the last week of talks?    [Sarid] The past week was very disappointing. We received  the impression that the negotiations were stuck and not making  any progress. I can solemnly promise you that this impasse was  not Israel's fault. Several things happened here: first of  all, not all the Palestinian negotiating teams showed up.  Second, we again received the impression that there were  internal differences within the Palestinian camp and within the  delegation itself that did not permit satisfactory progress.  Even our attempts to transfer the beginnings of control on the  ground were not implemented. Israel was prepared to permit the  entry of an advance force of policemen in order to begin  assuming responsibility and control. Even this was not  implemented and I very much hope this will be possible next  week. This was a disappointing week. I hope that the  Palestinian negotiators will get their act together and that  next week will prove better.    [Ganor] And if this does not prove to be the case, will you  support a unilateral Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip?    [Sarid] Such a thing does not exist anywhere in the world.  If there were such a possibility I would already have expressed  my support for a unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip a  long time ago. There is no such thing as a unilateral  arrangement. A unilateral arrangement would mean total anarchy  and chaos in the Gaza Strip. If it were possible I would  support it; however, there is no such option and we must  continue the negotiations and pull out of the Gaza Strip over  the next few days while continuing the protracted and difficult  dialogue in order to eventually reach and sign an agreement.  Once an agreement is signed we will be able to finally withdraw  from the Gaza Strip, although, as you know, we are already in  the midst of the withdrawal process.    [Ganor] This will not happen by 13 April?    [Sarid] This can no longer take place by 13 April. Once  again, through no fault of Israel's. We are not to blame for  the excessive delay. The delay stems from the inertia of the  Palestinian side, whatever its reasons. I reiterate my hope  that they will make renewed efforts next week and the  negotiations will get back on track. Everything can be wrapped  up by the end of this month. We can conclude the negotiations,  wrap everything up, sign the agreement, and even implement it by  the end of April.

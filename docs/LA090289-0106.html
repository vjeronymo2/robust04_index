			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABC UNIT DEVELOPING PAIR OF SHOWS FOR NBC  </P> <P> ABC's new television production arm is developing two shows for NBC, apparently  marking the first time one network has agreed to create programming for  another.  </P> <P> One of the proposed programs is a miniseries and the other a series, said  Brandon Stoddard, the former ABC Entertainment president who now heads the  fledgling ABC Productions unit. He said no firm deals have been made to produce  the shows.  </P> <P> The in-house production division has 18 projects in development, Stoddard said  at a Century City news conference Friday, with a miniseries and two movies in  the works for HBO, two movies in development for the Lifetime cable network,  which is partially owned by Capital Cities/ABC, and the rest slated for ABC.

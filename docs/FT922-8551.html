			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Indian MPs angry over US ban on Russian rocket deal MEMBERS of the Indian parliament strongly attacked the US yesterday over a ban on exports to the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) announced in Washington. Mrs Margaret Alva, the minister for public grievances, assured parliament that the government would do everything 'to protect national honour, dignity and choice' in face of the US ban on trade and technological dealings with Isro. She said the government 'would respond in an appropriate way'. The Bush administration's action, apparently in a public display of its resolve to control missile proliferation, was taken in order to compel Isro and Russia's Glavkosmos to terminate a Dollars 250m (Pounds 141m) contract to transfer rocket technology to India. The move follows a recent improvement in US-India relations, as shown by the Bush administration's support of an International Monetary Fund loan to India, an agreement to hold joint naval exercises, and India's recognition of Israel. MPs were alarmed that the move against Isro is the second time Washington has acted against India recently. Less than a fortnight ago it withdrew preferential duties on Indian pharmaceuticals because of India's failure to protect US patents. The Indian government claims its space programme is meant to improve communications and weather forecasting and is entirely peaceful. India chose Russian rocket technology after all western countries had turned it down on the grounds that it would improve India's missile launch capability. India has refused to sign the non-proliferation treaty, arguing that it discriminates in favour of existing nuclear powers. The Russians were proposing to supply a Missile Technology Congress Regime class system capable of carrying a 500kg payload to a minimum distance of 300km.</p>

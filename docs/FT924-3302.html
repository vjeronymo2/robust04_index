			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / People: Two 'very strong contenders' for Marley David Trapnell (left), a main board director of building materials group Marley, has leap-frogged group managing director John Castle to become group chief executive with effect from the beginning of next year. Since 1989, Sir George Russell had combined the roles of executive chairman and chief executive, but the company says it had always been intended he would relinquish the post of chief executive when a suitable successor was found. Trapnell's appointment follows a period of considerable boardroom upheaval. In mid-1990, John Castle was elevated to his present position, prompting the departures of Keith Howell, then finance director, and another board member Mike Moxon. Now Castle, 47, who had been running the day-to-day operations and to whom Trapnell, also 47, reported, is leaving Marley. Chris Beenham, the current finance director, describes Trapnell and Castle as 'both very strong contenders. One had to be chosen'. Trapnell has distinguished himself in rationalising the UK building product companies against the background of an extremely difficult market, according to Beenham. He had also been responsible for the French building companies. With the company since 1971, Trapnell joined as a factory manager on the roof-tile side. Apart from three years in California between 1979-1982 setting up a roof-tile operation there, he has been based in the UK, and was brought on to the main board in 1989. Castle, who joined Marley in 1986, also joined the board in that year. At the same time, prompted by the Cadbury recommendations on corporate governance, Gary Allen, chief executive of IMI, has been made deputy chairman, a new position 'created to reflect the fact that he is the most senior of the non-executive directors,' says Beenham. He adds that Sir George, who has just been appointed a non-executive director of Taylor Woodrow, will remain executive chairman 'for the foreseeable future'. ***** Paul Vickers, assistant md and company secretary of TV-am, has been appointed company secretary and group legal director of MIRROR GROUP NEWSPAPERS; he will remain company secretary of TV-am until that company's next agm, expected to be in March 1993. ***** Ray McGee has been promoted to sales director of P&amp;O CONTAINERS EUROPE responsible for the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Barry New has been promoted to sales director for the Mediterranean area, based in Milan. ***** Bill Ross, formerly chief executive of Inter-Hotels, has been appointed marketing director of the ROYAL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY OF ENGLAND.</p>

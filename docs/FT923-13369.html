			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Survey of World Automotive Components (10): Pressure tells as anger mounts - Japanese debate THERE ARE few more contentious trade issues between the US and Japan than automobiles and automobile parts - a fact underlined by the industry's strong presence on President Bush's controversial visit to Tokyo at the start of this year, when he put pressure on Japan to buy more US vehicles and parts. The concern is hardly surprising, since the auto parts industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the US, with sales of around Dollars 100bn, and the automobile sector accounts for three quarters of the US trade deficit with Japan. The Bush visit was only one manifestation of a growing anger in the US over this imbalance, and there are signs that Japanese automobile manufacturers are beginning to respond to the pressures, showing a greater willingness to consider buying parts from US suppliers. A key question now is whether these gestures will lead to a significant increase in actual purchases. The pressures on the Japanese are taking several forms. In Congress, for example, a trade bill was introduced in May, supported by Ford Motor and Chrysler, which would have limited the sale of Japanese cars in the US - both imported vehicles and those made at Japanese 'transplant' factories in the US - to 1992 levels unless sales of American vehicles in Japan increased. However, early in June these Draconian provisions were dropped from the legislation. Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce has found Japanese manufacturers of mini-vans guilty of underpricing their vehicles in the US market; and the US Customs Service has ruled that vehicles made by Honda in Canada do not have a 50 per cent North American content, and that the company owes Dollars 16.5m in import duties. These political pressures help explain why during President Bush's January visit Japanese manufacturers agreed to increase purchases of US automobile parts and help Detroit's Big Three sell more cars in their country. A second meeting to discuss the issues was held by the Japanese companies and their American counterparts in Chicago in May. During the January meeting the Japanese agreed to increase purchases of US parts to Dollars 19bn in 1994, from Dollars 10bn in 1991 and from a mere Dollars 2.5bn five years ago. However, there has been confusion since then over whether these totals were commitments, or merely targets. Nevertheless, in a report to President Bush last spring Mr Jack Reilly, chairman of Tenneco Automotive and head of an industry council, noted that a straw poll of manufacturers showed increased Japanese interest in buying US parts. However, the main beneficiaries of such a move may well turn out to be the US subsidiaries of Japanese parts manufacturers, whose products count as 'US content', rather than their American-owned rivals. Around 400 Japanese parts manufacturers have followed the Japanese assemblers to the US, and American parts makers suspect them of bringing with them the keiretsu system, involving extended families of companies linked by cross shareholdings which prevent outsiders from getting business. However, the Japanese industry says that the main stumbling block for US parts suppliers has been an inability to compete on grounds of cost and quality. Mr Reilly replies that the US industry is more efficient than that of Japan and adds: 'It is incredibly difficult to believe that the world's largest parts supply base is competitive on cost and quality only on 16 per cent of the transplant business.' Whatever the truth, the Dollars 19bn figure is largely predicated on increased production from Japan's US transplant factories, and that may well eat further into the domestic market share of the Big Three, which use parts made by US-owned companies much more extensively than their Japanese transplant rivals. In other words, the US parts manufacturers might gain Japanese sales, but lose more than that in sales to their traditional American customers. Nevertheless, the Japanese transplants are buying relatively more from suppliers in the US (be they Japanese- or American-owned). Government figures show that in 1991 the transplants bought Dollars 1.54 of US parts for every Dollars 1 of parts they imported, up from Dollars 1.04 of US parts in 1989. Furthermore, the transplants have been putting considerable sums into US design and development centres which will eventually generate demands for purely American parts to go into vehicles aimed at the local market. However, one US measure - the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) law - actually discourages Japanese transplants from buying US parts. The law, passed in 1975, mandates fuel efficiency levels for vehicles. When it was going through Congress the United Auto Workers Union, fearing a flood of imported fuel-efficient small cars which might cost jobs, pressured lawmakers into forbidding companies to average the fuel economies of their domestic (75 per cent local content) and imported cars. The result is that several Japanese manufacturers are deliberately keeping their US domestic content below 75 per cent so these fuel efficient vehicles can be classified as imported for CAFE purposes, and thus offset the worse fuel efficiency of their imported luxury models. Industry pressure groups are calling for the CAFE rules to be amended to get rid of this anomaly as part of the negotiations over a North American Free Trade Area. Precisely what constitutes an 'American-made' vehicle is also open to endless debate. For example, the Transportation Department, which oversees the CAFE rules, says that marketing costs can be included in domestic content. However, the customs service, which recently ruled against Honda, will not allow this in its definition, which is based largely on the origin of the car's parts. All this throws up some bizarre anomalies. For example, under the CAFE rules Ford's Mexican-assembled Mercury Tracer is classified as domestic, while the Cadillac Allante, built in Michigan, but with an Italian body, is an import.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         BALANCE OF US AUTOMOTIVE PARTS TRADE, 1985-89 (DOLLARS M)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    1985        1986        1987        1988        1989  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total balance    (2,710)   (10,085)    (12,419)    (13,548)    (15,453) Brazil             (490)      (760)       (935)     (1,041)       (674) Canada            1,576        (55)        636       1,192        (167) EC                 (882)    (2,386)     (3,176)     (2,989)     (2,693) France             (307)      (567)       (654)       (583)       (618) West Germany       (513)    (1,269)     (1,710)     (1,760)     (1,463) Italy               (74)      (214)       (356)       (315)       (327) Japan            (3,080)    (5,996)     (7,327)     (8,842)    (10,536) South Korea        (315)      (292)       (340)       (439)       (451) Mexico             (371)    (1,116)     (1,631)     (1,868)     (1,033) Spain               (52)      (143)       (222)       (271)       (312) Taiwan             (277)      (424)       (522)       (571)       (573) UK                  (11)      (253)       (295)       (235)       (166)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  Source: The Economist Intelligence Unit  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

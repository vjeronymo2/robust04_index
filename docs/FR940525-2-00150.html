Conversation between Karen Aluise, Assistant Vice President, and N. Amy Bilbija, Commission, on March 7, 1994. As noted above, the specific requirements for adequate information barrier procedures are set forth in a separate proposal that is also being approved in conjunction with this approval order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Objection by the regular specialist in a stock, with or without cause. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Any objection by the regular specialists to permit comptition in one or more of such specialist's stocks must be in writing and filed with the Exchange within 48 hours (unless the specialist is unavailable, in which case within 48 hours of becoming available) of notice of filing of the competing specialist application.

Withdrawal from registration by a CS will bar that CS from applying to compete in that same stock for 90 days following the effective date of withdrawal. When the regular specialist requests to be relieved of a stock, the stock will be posted for reallocation by the Stock Allocation Committee. In the interim, if the MPC is satisfied that the CS can continue to maintain a fair and orderly market in such stock, the CS will serve as the regular specialist until the stock has been reallocated. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  Where there is more than one CS in the stock, Exchange staff will place the stock with a caretaker <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  until reallocation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Once the stock has been reallocted to a regular specialist, that specialist will not have the right to object to competition in such stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A ``caretaker'' is a specialist from another specialist unit who is chosen by the Exchange to temporarily act as the regular specialist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The registration of any CS may be suspended or terminated by the MPC upon a determination of any substantial or continued failure by such CS to engage in dealings in accordance with the Constitution and Rules of the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the proposal amends the BSE Rule governing the specialist's book, the contents of which are otherwise confidential, to add a provision permitting specialists to disclose information in their books to other specialists competing in the same stocks on a summary basis as provided for in the procedures for CSs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III.

Ackermann, Vice President, Regulation, Cincinnati Stock Exchange, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated July 29, 1993 (``CSE letter''). In sum, the CSE argues that because their current Dealer Preferencing System is analogous to the BSE proposal, the same restrictions should be applied to both pilots, or, in the alternative, the Commission should remove the restrictions from the CSE pilot. The restrictions include prohibitions on direct cash payments for preferenced order flow, prohibitions on use of short-sale arbitrage programs, and limitations on the scope of the program. All of these restrictions have been incorporated into the BSE proposal. See Amendments Nos. 1, 2, and 3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letters from James E.

Division of Market Regulation, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments (1994). The Amex's competing dealer proposal seeks to alter the current rules of priority in regard to the orders of regional exchange specialists and third market makers that are directed to the Amex. The issues raised in Amex's competing dealer proposal are fundamentally different from the concerns raised by the competing specialist proposal which seeks to alter the current rules to accomodate competitors on the floor of the BSE. Specifically, the Amex's proposal is intended to alter the treatment of incoming orders from competing dealers, while the BSE proposal creates the ability for competing specialists to compete on the floor of the Exchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBERT WINKLER; AUTHORITY ON VITICULTURE  </P> <P> Albert J. Winkler, one of the nation's foremost authorities on viticulture,  whose research contributed to the growth of California's wine industry, has  died in a Davis convalescent hospital. He was 95.  </P> <P> In 1938, Winkler developed a system for classifying the most desirable wine  grape growing areas in California by using "degree days" -- calculating how  many days in the April-October growing season each region registered the best  temperatures for maturing vines.  </P> <P> The system is still in use today.  </P> <P> A Texas native who earned his doctorate in horticulture at UC Berkeley in 1921,  Winkler spent much of his career as a specialist in wine grapes and wine  making.  </P> <P> But during the Prohibition era, 1919-33, he switched his research to table  grapes and in the late 1920s pioneered a sulfur dioxide gassing process that  made it possible to ship and market California grapes in the East.  </P> <P> After Prohibition, Winkler returned to wine grape research. A UC Davis faculty  member for four decades, he headed the university's department of viticulture  from 1935 to 1957.  </P> <P> In his work on degree days, Winkler identified five zones or regions throughout  the state, with I and II the best for nurturing wine grapes. His Zone I,  including Oakville in the Napa Valley, was considered comparable to Burgundy, a  major wine center in France. His Zone II, including most of Napa and Sonoma  counties, was compared to Bordeaux, another historically fine wine-producing  section of France.  </P> <P> Winkler's book "General Viticulture," published in 1962, became an  international text on wine grapes and was translated into several languages.  </P> <P> Winkler continued his research even after he retired from the UC Davis faculty.  </P> <P> A memorial service was held Tuesday in Davis for Winkler, who died Aug. 29 of  natural causes.  </P> <P> Winkler is survived by two daughters, Marjorie Morris of Sacramento and Ethel  Plocher of Watsonville.  </P> <P> His wife of 69 years, Pearl Buehrer Winkler, died last year.  </P></p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: Cleaning up the battle zones - Rebel attacks on oil pipelines have taken their toll on Colombia's forests and farmlands More than a million barrels of crude oil have spilt out of Colombia's pipelines over the last six years, polluting wetlands, streams, forests and farmlands. The environment is one of the principal victims of the guerrilla war on foreign oil companies and the state petroleum company, Ecopetrol, has become expert at emergency clean-ups. But it is not just clean-up technology that has blossomed in Colombia. Legislation, refining and management standards are also improving fast and some of the measures taken to safeguard oil installations from the guerrillas are turning out to be unexpectedly friendly to the environment. Both of the main oil producing regions are well inland: most of the older fields and the main refining centre are strung out along the Magdalena valley, while newer discoveries (including Cusiana and Cupiagua, explored by BP) lie east of the Andean mountain ranges in the 'Llanos' plains. Guerrillas belonging to the left-wing national liberation army (ELN) and the communist-line revolutionary armed forces of Colombia (FARC) roam these areas, assaulting and dynamiting their targets, then disappearing into forest camps or local settlements virtually under their command. The rebel groups - which aim to force oil multinationals out and impose a more nationalist oil policy - have financed their activities by kidnap and extortion. The government is trying to cut off these sources of funds, at the same time sending in more troops. Although the three trans-Andean pipelines are buried wherever possible, there are particularly vulnerable stretches across rugged gullies and swamps. In any case, a little digging has never been an obstacle to the guerrillas. In 1992, there were more than a hundred attacks on these three pipelines, costing Dollars 8m (Pounds 5.2m) in clean-ups and repairs. Oil exports virtually ceased in November and part of December, forfeiting over Dollars 100m of income, while a million barrels of crude had to be imported from Ecuador at short notice. Repairs to the pipeline are made more difficult by guerrilla efforts to prevent access. Ecopetrol and the oil research institute have developed a pipeline database which details petrol sites, key observation posts, hydrology, access roads, response times and available equipment such as floating booms, oil skimmers and suction pumps. If the pipeline is dynamited in a very steep section and oil spills into a fast-flowing river, little can be done. 'We have to act in places where the river flows down and widens out,' said Jaime George, head of Ecopetrol's environmental division. 'We don't use dispersants in rivers because they mix oil into the water and this could go into a water supply system. In the case of wetlands, we are monitoring constantly. The leaves of any contaminated vegetation must be removed - this takes a lot of time but the tropical climate helps recovery.' Repeated guerrilla attacks have led companies to centralise their production facilities, which serve both security and environmental ends. Ecopetrol is cutting the number of collection centres in one area of the Magdalena from 76 to 6. BP will drill a number of deviated wells off the same sites at Cusiana. Each site has lookout posts with armed guards and helicopters fly unusually high between landings. Cupiagua 1, alongside a main road, is protected by sandbags. The oil companies and the guerrillas are to some extent competing for the heart and minds of nearby communities. The government recently decided to move settlers farther away from oilfields on the grounds that guerrillas have encouraged their sympathisers to occupy these areas and give them cover and support. The companies provide jobs, build schools, health centres and roads, and feed royalties to the local authorities. Occidental, which operates the Cano Limon export field, runs a massive publicity campaign on television and in the newspapers stressing its environmental and community work. 'Last year, the consortium spent over Dollars 8m on environmental protection at Cano Limon - about half on pipeline clean-ups and half on other projects  -scientific studies, the sanitary landfill and so on,' says Ed Metcalf of Occidental. The company has sponsored studies on mammals, fish and insects and planted over 400,000 trees - 20 times more than the figure required by the Natural Resources Institute. BP, which is drilling deep wells in an area with highly-complex geology, has introduced 'powerful and sophisticated equipment,' says Phil Mead, the operations manager. All the water at Cupiagua 1 is recirculated in a series of three minimum-sized pits, and water - rather than oil-based mud - is being used for drilling. There have been problems with two sites - one where a landslide occurred and another where the local community complained that the well was located too close to a river. Carlos Fonseca, an environmental expert at Bogota's Lasalle University, says: 'The outlook is very positive now; both national and foreign companies are much more aware. But employees need extra training for the new standards and we must have more environmental audits.' Although everyone agrees there is still room for improvement, Colombians have come to associate the image of oil-soaked birds with guerrilla actions rather than company operations.</p>

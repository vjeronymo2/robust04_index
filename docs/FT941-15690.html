			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Speculators push up metal prices Speculators are ignoring the fundamentally poor outlook for base metals and driving up prices on the London Metal Exchange, traders and analysts suggest. The trend could be reversed very quickly, they point out. 'Metals are cheap compared with the stock and bond markets and a little money can move prices quite a long way,' Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co, part of the Deutsche Bank group, said last night. 'Any speculator who bought at the lows and sold at the highs today would have made a tidy profit.' Traders said the only solid buying yesterday was in the copper market, where some investment funds were influenced by strengthening demand for the metal in the US and a fall in New York Commodity Exchange stock levels. Mr Bielski pointed out that nickel was the 'star performer' in the present rally, having moved up by 50 per cent from the lows in October even though the metal's prospects had been deteriorating. Nickel for delivery in three months closed last night another Dollars 160 up at Dollars 5,707.50 a tonne, having jumped by nearly 8 per cent since Friday's close. Three-month copper added Dollars 27.75 a tonne yesterday to close at Dollars 1,800.5, up by about 3 per cent since Friday.</p>

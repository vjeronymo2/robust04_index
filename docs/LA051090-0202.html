			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> CITY MOVING TOWARD SPECIAL TAX DISTRICTS  </P> <P> Mello-Roos districts, a development-financing tool commonly used in recent  years in growing areas of eastern and southern Orange County, may soon be  introduced to Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday took initial steps to establish the city's first  community facilities district, which would impose a higher, special property  tax on 113 houses being built between Golden West and Edwards streets and  Garfield and Ellis avenues. The extra tax revenue would pay for an array of  street and utility improvements, as well as additional police and fire services  for the area.  </P> <P> The council on Monday adopted four resolutions stating its intent to establish  the district.  </P> <P> The city also tentatively plans to set up Mello-Roos districts to pay for  similar facilities in the Holly-Seacliff and Bolsa Chica developments planned  nearby, City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga said.  </P> <P> Under the state's Mello-Roos Community Facilities Act of 1982, cities are  allowed to levy a special property tax in addition to the 1% maximum tax  allowed by Proposition 13, with the approval of voters in the targeted  district. That enables cities to build roads, storm drains or other  improvements in developing areas that they otherwise could not afford.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach's proposed Mello-Roos district, approved by the developer,  would impose a 1.6% total property tax on each of the homes, which are  scheduled to be completed within two years and will range in cost from $678,000  to $843,000. Home buyers initially will pay an average of about $2,800 in  property tax, a sum that would escalate each year to nearly twice that figure  by 2020.  </P> <P> The Mello-Roos tax revenues would pay for $3.5 million in improvements and  expanded police and fire services, according to a city staff report. Ellis  Avenue, now a ragged, two-lane farm road west of Golden West Street, would be  widened and improved to accommodate more traffic and provide better storm  drainage.  </P> <P> Several members of the council, which is scheduled to vote on the plan on June  18, said they may reduce the amount of special tax being considered so it does  not deter potential home buyers.JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

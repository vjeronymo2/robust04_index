			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / International Company News: Second Chinese group plans to list on ASX A second Chinese company is to list on the Australian Stock Exchange next month, furthering the exchange's plan to have an 'Asian board' operating in about a year. The new company is Canada Land, a Hong Kong-incorporated group which is developing property in Guangzhou. It plans to issue 25m shares at ADollars 0.35 each, and says that money raised will provide additional working capital. It has four development projects - comprising a mixture of residential and office properties - under way in the southern Chinese city. Completion dates range from 1994 to 2000 for the final phases of the FangCun Metro Station West. Most of the projects are being developed by joint venture companies involving the Chinese government.</p>

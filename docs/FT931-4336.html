			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Amstrad claims lead in new product sector AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics company, is hoping to lead the world with a new kind of computer - a personal digital assistant - to be launched in London next Thursday, writes Alan Cane. Shares closed the day 3 3/4 p up at 31 1/4 p. However, the launch is likely to spark complaints that Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad chairman, misled shareholders during his unsuccessful battle last year to take the company private in claiming that no 'blockbuster' products were in store which could revive the company's waning fortunes. Amstrad is claiming that the new product will be the world's first in a product sector which some analysts claim could be worth as much as Dollars 20bn (Pounds 14bn) a year in sales by 2000. Personal digital assistants, hand-held devices which will accept handwritten messages and which may include telephone and fax capabilities, are being touted as the answer to stagnant growth in the consumer electronics market. IBM, Apple, AT&amp;T, Matsushita and Olivetti are among the world's leading companies with plans to launch the product. Amstrad said yesterday that the devices could not be considered a blockbuster in the same way that its personal computers and word processors had been when they won huge sales by selling for less than Pounds 400 when equivalent products from traditional manufacturers were priced at Pounds 2,000. Publicity material from Amstrad says, however, that next week's launch will be 'the first time a revolutionary product incorporating state of the art technology will be sold at a mass market price from launch'. Mr Sugar failed in December to persuade shareholders to sell him back the company at 30p a share. Amstrad surprised the City by turning in a profit of Pounds 5.61m in the first half of the year, but Mr Sugar warned there was no guarantee the company would be profitable in the full year. Close colleagues yesterday defended Mr Sugar, pointing out it would be impossible for him to market a new product aggressively without it being labelled a potential blockbuster.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Agent Norby Walters spread $2,500 in cash on a desk in front of Ronnie Harmon  to persuade him to sign a contract that violated National Collegiate Athletic  Assn. rules, the former Iowa running back told a federal jury.  </P> <P> Harmon, now with the Buffalo Bills, was the first witness in the Chicago fraud  trial of New York-based agents Walters and Lloyd Bloom.  </P> <P> Walters spread out the money on the desk of his New York office in front of  Harmon, then a junior at Iowa, Harmon testified.  </P> <P> "We're talking about business. The product is Ronnie Harmon," Walters said in a  conversation Harmon tape-recorded March 10, 1985.  </P> <P> During the 15 months he dealt with Bloom and Walters, Harmon said, he received  a new Mercedes, plane tickets and other items worth about $54,000. He said he  fired the agents a few days after Bloom had negotiated a $1.3-million contract  for Harmon with the Bills.  </P> <P> Under cross-examination, Harmon said he paid Bloom and Walters a total of  $5,000. But he fired them before they could collect a commission on his  National Football League contract.  </P></p>

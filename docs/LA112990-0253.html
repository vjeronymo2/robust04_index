			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> AUDIOCASSETTES ON WAY TO GULF  </P> <P> More than 200,000 audiocassettes valued at more than $1 million were on their  way Wednesday to Saudi Arabia aboard a Tennessee Air National Guard cargo  plane, a gift from Nashville's music industry to American troops.  </P> <P> Every major country and Christian label donated thousands of cassettes in a  project dubbed Operation Desert Song.  </P> <P> Included were 50,000 cassettes donated by country music's current hot new  singer, Garth Brooks, who was on hand for the cargo loading.  </P> <P> "What can I say about how much we owe these people who are risking their lives  for us?" Brooks said. "This is little enough, and I only wish we could do more  to help them."  </P> <P> Including religious music was no easy feat. "There had been considerable  difficulty on that score," Amy Grant, a top gospel singer said recently, "but  they finally got it cleared through the military."  </P></p>

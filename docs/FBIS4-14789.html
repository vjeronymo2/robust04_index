			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Djordje Milosevic] </F>   [Text] Between Yugoslavia and Belarus -- two brotherly  Slavic countries -- there is full understanding and a readiness  to establish diplomatic relations and develop the most  comprehensive cooperation in all spheres. This is what FRY  Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic stated in Minsk today after  meeting with Belaraus Foreign Minister Petr Kravchanka.  Jovanovic also briefed the Belarus minister on our view of the  Yugoslav crisis and how the situation is developing, especially  in Bosnia. Kravchanka said it was of the utmost importance to  establish peace, make efforts to end the conflict in Bosnia as  quickly as possible, and abolish the sanctions against  Yugoslavia. Both sides agreed that the sanctions are unjust and  counterproductive.    The Belarus minister stated that the visit by Vladislav  Jovanovic will contribute to the development of bilateral  relations. He voiced expectations that Belarus will soon pass a  decision to establish diplomatic relations with Yugoslavia at  the embassy level. Vladislav Jovanovic in this way ended a  series of talks with Belarus officials. He previously held  talks with Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich and the deputy  president of the Supreme Soviet, Vladimir (Rusiakov). Both  sides stressed the significance of this visit and its  contribution to the development of cooperation between the two  friendly nations now and especially after the abolition of  sanctions against Yugoslavia.    The Yugoslav minister visited Belarus at the invitation of  the country's leadership. This fact also suggests a desire by  both sides to promote cooperation. It is also worth mentioning  that Belarus partners expressed support and solidarity with  Yugoslavia, as well as their disapproval of the sanctions and  their tightening and the international isolation of Yugoslavia.</p>

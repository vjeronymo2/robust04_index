			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> RAIN IMPERILS GRAPE CROP  </P> <P> Growers of grapes for elite California wines are hoping for clearing skies and  dry winds after heavy rains threatened fragile crops on the vine with rot and  mildew. A tropical storm from the South Pacific and a winter storm from the  Gulf of Alaska met in California over the weekend, sparking thunderstorms and  dousing some regions with more than four inches of rain. "Once the rain stops,  the wine grape people in Napa and Sonoma need a good strong wind to dry their  grapes out," said Mike Henry, spokesman for the California Farm Bureau. "A lot  of the growers were caught in the early stages, with stuff still on the vine."  The storms also brought an unusual, early season snowfall to portions of the  Sierra.  </P></p>

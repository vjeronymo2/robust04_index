			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of article by Susana Lee published in GRANMA on 30 </F> April]    [Text] Tomorrow at 1000, the Cuban national anthem will  mark the opening of the special session of the National Assembly  of the People's Government [ANPP] convened by the Council of  State to analyze the economic situation of Cuba. This meeting is  the conclusion of an entire debate process on this issue and it  will be in the hands of the ANPP deputies, as representatives of  the Cuban people who elected them, to define the policies, the  main paths of work that can be adopted to correct gradually the  national economic imbalance.    Just as planned [passage indistinct] of the issue at that  moment and to take it up again in a special session, the  delegates are better prepared in this instance and with the  information obtained from a broad survey conducted by the union  movement through the parliaments in the workplace process. Three  million workers actively participated in over 80,000 workers  assemblies between January and March 1994.    Last December's ANPP discussion of these vital and  controversial issues, which the mass media amply divulged to the  people, was unprecedented and worthwhile. Even much more  unprecedented is the fact that these issues were brought before  millions of Cubans that discussed, frankly and openly, these  issues and put forth ideas and proposals aimed at solving the  complicated economic and financial problems that we face today.    What place in the world can boast of having conducted a  similar process? What parliament or parliamentarian can in  addition to discussing and deciding on the matters that affect  the whole of their population, also be aware of their people's  opinions on these issues?    I can go even further, which is worth noting the day before  May Day, when hundreds of labor union representatives from all  over the world have come to partake in the May Day celebrations  and a number of them are invited to witness the debates of the  ANPP: In what country are the workers or even their union  leaders consulted on such crucial issues? What country or  government would risk consulting their work force about such  problems and ask for their opinions? In how many places have  workers awakened to the news that those famous packages of  measures had been implemented? In other words, neoliberal  formulas to solve their financial woes at the cost of the more  humble sectors.    Tomorrow, when the ANPP deputies -- representing the people  who elected them in true elections through secret and direct  ballot with over 50 percent participation as regulated by law --  decide from their seat the policy to be followed to correct the  financial situation, in a broad spectrum, a situation on which  millions of Cubans have expressed our opinions, all of which  have been taken into consideration, we will be taking one more  step on the path chosen by a true majority of our people to  resist and overcome the great obstacles we face and moving  forward. What is decided at this meeting, it is good to repeat  it, will not be a shock policy nor can we presume that all  solutions will be popular although we hope they will have the  understanding of the population. Absorbing the excess currency,  as explained on other occasions, due to the drastic reduction of  our capacity to import and the stiffening of the Yankee  blockade, is an impossible task without a certain measure of  sacrifice shared by all of us. Call it what you may: Increase in  the price in some products, eliminating gratuities, establishing  a tax system, reduction of subsidies to unprofitable enterprises  thus reducing the budget deficit, and restraint and elimination  of profitteering.    In last December's ANPP meeting there was a favorable and  broad consensus on these measures, the same as in the  parliaments in the workplace. These measures are inevitable and  needed to promote adequate conditions to be applied to our  economy to subsequently solve the basic problems of the economy.  We have started to work on this by implementing other important  decisions; such as a reactivation of production, an increase in  productivity, and improving economic efficiency. This will be  done while preserving our accomplishments and, as Fidel said,  safeguarding, above all, the interest of the people. This will  be kept in mind, and the Revolution will not abandon anyone,  this an indisputable principle.    Tomorrow, when the ANPP special session commences, its  deputies, invested with the highest responsibilities, will  undertake their tasks as homage to Cuba's May Day, with the  honor, sense of dignity, revolutionary and patriotic spirit of  our working masses, their commitment to fight and save the  Revolution and the accomplishments of socialism, and their amply  proven political awareness.</p>

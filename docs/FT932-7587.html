			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rights issue worries restrain equities A TURBULENT week in the London equity market drew to a close with prices of the leading blue chips moderately easier as dealers continued to fret about cash demands on the market and ignoring more good news on the domestic economic front. Continuing the trend of recent weeks, however, the second-line stocks attracted renewed buying interest from the big institutions. The FT-SE 100 index ended the day a net 4.6 lower at 2,812.2, down 34.8, or 1.2 per cent, on the week. Over the two-week account, however, the index has risen 18.5, or 0.6 per cent. The FT-SE Mid 250 index extended its strong showing, moving up 5.0 to a record 3,165.1; on the week the 250 index rose 22.8, or 0.7 per cent. Over the account the 250 index showed a gain of 55.76, or 1.8 per cent. Gilt-eged stocks rose strongly in mid-session, helped by the upward move by sterling after the economic data, but lost ground towards the close of business as the pound eased against the dollar, although maintaining its strength against the D-mark. Longer-dated gilts, up around  1/4 at the day's best, eventually closed around  3/16 down on balance. Index-linked, meanwhile retained gains of around  1/4 , having been up  3/8 earlier in the session. The FT-SE 100 began the day in good form, opening around six points higher in response to Wall Street moving up to an all-time high overnight. The market's optimism was quickly dented, however, by the latest fund raising moves in London. Brixton Estates joined a long list of companies seeking additional capital asking shareholders for Pounds 100m, albeit at favourable terms. This week's heaviest calls have come from British Airways, which is raising Pounds 442m and Allied Lyons, asking for Pounds 200m via a convertible rights. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi launched a Pounds 73m cash call while Compass proposed an Pounds 86m call. The market was awash yesterday with suggestions that the new trading account could well see another wave of funding calls with the property sector said to be a prime area. The cash market was firmly in negative territory within an hour of the opening and dropped to the day's low, down 15.7 FT-SE points, as Wall Street opened with a fall of around 15 points on the Dow Jones Average. A gradual recovery in the US steadied London towards the close. Turnover was a healthy 699.2m shares.</p>

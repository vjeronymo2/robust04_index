			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Doubt cast on pit vote BRITISH COAL believes the pit deputies' union Nacods has failed to secure the 66 per cent vote it needs under its constitution for strike action from its 5,000 members in a secret ballot, Robert Taylor writes. The result will be known today. The deputies were asked to back a 24-hour strike and launch a 'rolling programme of action' against the government's plans for pit closures.</p>

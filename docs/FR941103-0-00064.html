Motorist Compliance Enforcement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must provide information concerning motorist enforcement, including: (1) A description of the existing compliance mechanism if it will continue to be used for this program, and the demonstration that it is as effective or more effective than registration-denial enforcement; (2) an identification of the agencies responsible for performing each of the applicable activities in this section; (3) a description of, and accounting for, all classes of exempt vehicles; and (4) a description of the plan for testing fleet vehicles, rental car fleets, leased vehicles, and any other special classes of subject vehicles, such as those operated (but not necessarily registered) in the program area. Also, the SIP must include a determination of the current compliance rate based on a study of the system including an estimate of compliance losses due to loopholes, counterfeiting, and unregistered vehicles. Estimates of the effect of closing such loopholes and otherwise improving the enforcement mechanism must be supported with detailed analyses. In addition, the SIP needs to include the legal authority to implement and enforce the program. Lastly, the SIP must include a commitment to an enforcement level and minimum compliance level used for modeling purposes and to be maintained, at a minimum, in practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The State of Maine has chosen to use a program of registration suspension whereby subsequent registration is denied to anyone who fails to meet emission testing requirements. The motorist compliance enforcement program will be implemented primarily by the Maine Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV). The enforcement strategy is described in Maine's July 21, 1994 submittal. The enforcement strategy is designed to ensure a 90 percent compliance rate for all vehicles within 4 months of the compliance deadline. As described in the July 21, 1994 submittal, this will be accomplished by a computer matching program that will identify registered vehicles tested prior to registration, as well as those receiving their emission inspection within a 60 day period after registering. Those not receiving the emissions test will be notified of such failure, and put on notice that their registration will be suspended if they do not comply. Those that still fail to comply will either receive a summons to appear in court, or be subject to confiscation of their license plate by BMV personnel who would physically remove the plate from the vehicle. In addition, the Maine legislation authorizing I/M provides that vehicles operating with a suspended registration must be fined at least $450 for 1981 model year or newer vehicles, or $125, for older than 1981 model year vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The only classes of vehicles exempt from the I/M program are described above under vehicle coverage. Fleet vehicles, rental car fleets, and leased vehicles will be required to meet the same program requirements as all other vehicles that receive annual registration. The compliance rate for the program was estimated at 96%. The legal authority to implement and enforce the program is included in the Maine law and in DEP and BMV rules as supplied on July 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> L. Motorist Compliance Enforcement Program Oversight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under EPA's I/M rule, the SIP must include a description of enforcement program oversight and information management activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Maine I/M SIP revision provides for regular auditing of its enforcement program and adherence to effective management practices, including adjustments to improve the program when necessary. These program oversight and information management activities were described in the July 21, 1994 SIP narrative, and include: establishing procedures for personnel engaged in I/M document handling and processing, supporting a communications network for the State's oversight and management requirements, and establishing an I/M database to compare to the registration database for purposes of determining program effectiveness. In addition, the SIP describes the procedures to be followed in identifying noncomplying vehicles, timeframes for confiscation of suspended vehicle registration certificates and plates, timeframes for issuing summonses to appear in court, and the associated fines for failure to comply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

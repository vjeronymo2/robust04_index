			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Twenty-seven people in Plymouth, Mass., were arrested on trespassing charges as  125 activists demonstrated against the restart of the Pilgrim nuclear power  plant, shut down since April, 1986, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission  branded it "one of the worst-run" nuclear plants in the country. Last week the  plant started low-power testing, and it should be at full power in four months.  The state has vowed to do everything possible to keep the plant from operating.  Last month, Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum question that would have  permanently closed Pilgrim and the Yankee plant in Rowe.  </P></p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Markets: What Clarke did not do - The Bottom Line / The Budget and You If Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget was remarkable for one thing, it was what he did not do rather than what he did. Seldom have the stock market pundits been so wrong in their predictions of gloom. Aside from the general euphoria with which the market greeted the Budget, a number of stock market sectors have rebounded in relief that the worst did not happen. Others have risen as the Budget raised expectations that interest rates and inflation would be lower than had been thought. Ideas like that - plus good profit figures from Royal Bank of Scotland  - have made the banks some of the best performers this week. In the relief category must come sectors such as building materials and contracting and construction. While cut backs in spending - such as on the roads programme - and the creeping abolition of mortgage interest relief might appear bad news, the measures the chancellor ended up taking were by no means as bad as analysts had feared. Housebuilders could even take heart from the suggestion of more social housing being built. Companies such as BICC were buoyed by news that the West Coast line refurbishment will go ahead, as will the Docklands Light Railway extension. Another big concern had been the threat that tax-exempt investors, such as pension funds, might lose their tax credits on dividends. Clarke did not take up that suggestion which was good news for the life insurance companies, which manage a lot of tax-exempt money. It was good too for higher yielding stocks, especially those where dividends are secure and expected to rise. Utilities such as electricity and water stocks have been particular winners since the Budget. Another non-story as it turned out - though Clarke kept everyone guessing till the last moment with a rather theatrical performance - was the extension of VAT to more categories of goods. The lack of the widely-expected VAT on books and newspapers has boosted the media companies, like Reed, EMAP, Daily Mail, Mirror Group Newspapers and The Telegraph. Also retailers such as WH Smith, J Menzies and Pentos were gainers. Similarly, the chancellor's decision not to put VAT on food or children's clothes, as many thought he would, helped some stores groups. However, the benefit food retailers might have expected to see in their share prices has been more than wiped out by Argyll's decision on Wednesday to start depreciating its shops which unsettled the whole sector. One of the best performing sectors, brewers and distillers, was another beneficiary of the chancellor not doing something, in this case putting up duties on most alcoholic drinks. The British have become so accustomed to a few pence on a pint at every Budget that it was a real shock when it did not happen. Even the bad news was not too bad. An area to which a new tax was extended, but in a very small way, was the imposition of a 3 per cent tax on general insurance premiums. This might hit the composite insurance groups, and if the companies find themselves forced to absorb the tax it could add up to a substantial cut in profits - after all the tax is intended to raise Pounds 750m in a full year. But after hefty premium increases in recent years, the companies may be able to pass on the tax quietly to policyholders inured to rises. Likewise, airport departure duties of Pounds 5 and Pounds 10 depending on destination, which will not come into effect until October next year anyway, are unlikely to make much difference to the price of package holidays, or to the profits of the likes of British Airways or BAA. The big sector losers since the Budget have largely been those affected by other issues - like the food retailers. The electronics sector has been hit by poor trading news from GEC and Racal, while a sharp fall in profits at Hanson dragged down the conglomerates sector. The sectors which have moved immediately on the Budget may not be those which do well or badly over the next 12 months. But it is much harder at this stage to predict which will be next year's winners. Hopes of a continuing consumer-led recovery suggest consumer sectors should do well. Interest rate sensitive sectors should also outperform if the new expectation of base rates coming down further and staying down longer proves correct.</p>

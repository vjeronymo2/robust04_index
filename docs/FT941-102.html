			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / GKN ups bid to win fight for Westland GKN won control of Westland yesterday after raising its hostile bid for the helicopter manufacturer from 290p to 335p a share, valuing the target at Pounds 577m. The engineering group took its stake from 45 per cent to 54.4 per cent after a number of institutional shareholders accepted the revised cash offer. Although more than 26m Westland shares were traded yesterday, GKN was not able to declare the offer unconditional because it failed to push its stake above 55 per cent. It is expected to pass that barrier today. The revised offer - coming seven weeks after the bid was launched - followed Westland's forecast earlier this week that it would increase pre-tax profits by 64 per cent this year to Pounds 50m. Most of the expected increase was linked to a Pounds 15m profit on compensation payments from the Arab Organisation for Industrialisation (AOI), which last year was ordered to pay Pounds 385m damages to Westland over cancelled helicopter orders. Warning that there was no guarantee that the AOI would make further payments, GKN yesterday offered Westland shareholders a 290p alternative to the 335p offer that would include a potential share of any further compensation received. GKN has also offered a loan note alternative to investors, and increased the offer for each convertible preference share from 358.4p to 409.9p and for each warrant from 208.3p to 253.3p. Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, said the group had decided to increase its offers following his failure on Tuesday to persuade Mr Alan Jones, his Westland counterpart, to agree terms. The Westland board, which adjourned an emergency meeting yesterday pending an announcement that GKN's revised offer had gone unconditional, had previously criticised Sir David for undervaluing order prospects for its helicopters. Those prospects - enhanced this week when McDonnell Douglas Helicopters announced it would market Westland's EH101 model in the US - were given a further fillip yesterday when the Ministry of Defence said it was issuing tenders for new RAF support helicopters. Mr Jonathan Aitken, junior defence minister, said in a parliamentary written answer that Westland and Boeing would be invited to bid. Lex, Page 22; Background, Page 27; Market report, Page 46</p>

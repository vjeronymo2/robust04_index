			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Observer: Aesthetic machinations Alvar Gullichsen, a Finnish artist, is taking Helsinki by storm. A kind of latter-day Heath Robinson, Gullichsen invents fanciful but functionless 'bonk' machines. Bonk came into the world to cheer up the people of the small town of Nystad  -in south-west Finland - which was hit by serious unemployment when recession struck the local Saab assembly plant. Gullichsen set his associate, Henrik Helio, to produce bonk machinery such as the Bonk Freakwave Transmuter, the Bonk Electromagnetic Diviner, the Raba Hiff Bonk 600. Since then the bonk craze has swept the country. Helio now has 10 assistants turning out bonking machinery at his Nystad workshop. The Bonk Calendar - which focuses rather more on Miss Bonk than bonk machines - is, incidentally, most decorative.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Grave Provocations Driving Situation to Brink of War" -- </F> KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- If the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique dared ignite a  war against us, our people and People's Army would deal a  thousand-fold retaliatory blow at them, declares NODONG SINMUN  in a by-lined article today.    The situation of the Korean peninsula is now being brought  to  the brink of war by the new war provocation moves committed by  the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppet clique to  stifle our Republic, the article says, and goes on:    The U.S. imperialists have brought the nuclear-powered  carrier Carl Vinson near the Korean peninsula and deployed a  naval fleet of 30 warships including two carrier task forces on  the waters within a reach of 24 hours from the Korean coast for  the resumption of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises.    Meanwhile, a Patriot missile battalion involving 40 odd  missile launching pads and over 800 troops left Texas for South  Korea on the order of U.S. President Bill Clinton.    Availing itself of this situation, the Kim Yong-sam puppet  clique has become all the more undisguised in its criminal war  moves against the North.    The Kim Yong-sam group ordered all the puppet forces on to  "a  special alert" to keep them "prepared to attack the North,"  crying for "a tough reaction" against the North and "full  preparations to invade the North through a cooperative system"  with the United States. The puppets went so far as to make  public a war plan against the North dubbed "New Operation Plan  No. 5027."    The U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique  have  staged very provocative and dangerous war gambles which might  develop to a real war any time on the ground and in the air and  the sea almost every day.    The danger of war on the Korean peninsula is imminent and  real.    The U.S. imperialists intend to keep hold on South Korea  indefinitely as their colony and, with it as the bridgehead,  dominate the North of Korea and the rest of Asia. Intolerable  are the crimes of the U.S. imperialists, who are trying to turn  the Korean peninsula into the theatre of a thermonuclear war for  their aggressive goal and of the Kim Yong-sam group, which is  acting the shock brigade in executing their policy of aggression  and war, courting their favor.    Our people and People's Army do not want a war. But they are  not afraid of it.</p>

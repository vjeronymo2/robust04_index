			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Maksim Chikin report under "INFORM" rubric: </F> "Into Europe by the Front Door"]    [Text] Paris -- Last week a Russian parliamentary  delegation headed by Federation Council Chairman Viktor Shumeyko  visited France at the Interparliamentary Union's invitation. At  a press conference devoted to the visit's results the chairman  reported that he had met with Catherine Lalumiere, secretary  general of the Council of Europe, in Strasbourg.    "Past Russian parliamentarians," Shumeyko said, "have  insisted that Russia must become a Council member because it is  so big and great and must therefore have an exception made for  it. We structured the discussion differently. If Russia meets  the necessary criteria for admission, we will be glad to be  accepted into the Council." The Council president replied that  this question would most probably be decided after the  parliament's summer recess.    Shumeyko said in response to the KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA  correspondent's question about Boris Nikolayevich's health that  certain circles needed a campaign to discredit the president in  order to destabilize the situation. According to him the  president is a real "workaholic." He can get up at 0200 and  work.</p>

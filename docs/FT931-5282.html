			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays rally A reassessment of Barclays' shock move to halve the final dividend after absorbing its first ever preliminary loss, a move which triggered a plunge in the bank's shares, led to a gradual rehabilitation of the stock price. Despite a general wave of downward adjustments of current year estimates - BZW lowered their current year expectation from Pounds 375m to Pounds 300m, County moved down from Pounds 525m to Pounds 500m and Nikko reduced to Pounds 415m - the market responded to a flurry of short covering and buying on recovery hopes. The rally in Barclays drove the shares up 16 to 408p with turnover in the stock totalling a hefty 16m shares. NatWest, whose tier one capital ratio of 5.2 per cent was highlighted by analysts who pointed to the more secure 5.5 per cent provided by Barclays, suffered at the expense of Barclays shares, closing 7 off at 437p. Other banks shares mirrored the overall strength of the market with Standard Chartered extending its recent outstanding market performance and closing a further 6 up at 708p in front of Wednesday's preliminary results which are now expected to come in above market expectations. TSB attracted a fresh wave of takeover speculation which saw the shares race up 8 to a new all-time peak of 183p. Union Discount shares plunged 19 to 84p after takeover talks between the discount house and an unnamed party were terminated. But the group said it had received an offer for Winterflood Securities, its successful specialist marketmaking subsidiary run by Mr Brian Winterflood. The revelation of a strong profits increase by Barclays' securities arm, BZW, plus the recent excellent figures announced by Kleinwort Benson, saw a surge of interest in the merchant banks. Hambros jumped 10 to 328p, SG Warburg put on 3 to 634p and Kleinwort Benson settled 4 up at 393p. Food retailers shrugged off recent worries of an imposition of VAT in the UK budget later this month. J Sainsbury gained 11 to 534p and Tesco firmed 4 to 249p. Argyll Group added 13 to 381p, boosted by a recommendation from BZW. Mr Bill Currie at the securities house said: 'Trading is good especially in the new stores and there are significant productivity benefits to come over the next few years.' NatWest Securities was the day's main buyer of Kingfisher and the shares moved 13 ahead to 542p. The house said Thursday's falls had been overdone. Vague talk that Argos was planning to dispose of its home furnishings division was heard though it was quickly dismissed by analysts. The shares were however strong and closed 10 better at 290p, with BZw said to be positive on the stock. Shares in Airtours gained 13 to 327 1/2 p, with dealers predicting success in its bid for rival Owners Abroad, 6 better at 144p. The latest sharp rise in oil prices - Brent crude jumped around 50 cents to Dollars 19.70 a barrel - kept the oil sector on the move. The exploration and production stocks were strongly supported, reflecting the recent push to the sub-sector given by SG Warburg and the hike in oil prices. Enterprise closed 10 up at 488p. Hopes of imminent asset disposals continued to drive Lasmo, 3 firmer at 185p. Aran's strong acreage position west of the Shetlands oil discovery made by BP and Shell triggered keen interest in Aran shares which rose 2 to 27 1/2 p. A combination of factors sent British Aerospace into retreat. Profit-taking, combined with concerns that the company will have to repay around Pounds 60m it received from the UK government in 'sweeteners', and lower than expected sales from its Rover cars subsidiary, left the shares 7 lighter at 276p. TI Group closed 10 up at 305p in heavy trading of 9.1m shares. Worries about the poor outlook for the automotive sector in Germany weakened Laird Group, and the shares eased 6 to 269p. A rise in UK new car registrations for February boosted motor dealers. Thomas Cowie, which reported figures this week, jumped 10 to 216p. Whispers that Tadpole Technology will soon announce a significant deal sent the shares sharply ahead, jumping 27 to 324p.</p>

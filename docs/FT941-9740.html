			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Confused over my liability I was born on February 22 1919 and my wife on July 1 1915. My income is such that my tax liability falls well within the 20p in the pound bracket. It appears to me that, for 1994/95, I will be entitled to the married couple's allowance of Pounds 2,505 and the personal allowance of Pounds 4,370. It was stated in the Budget, however, that these allowances would be 'limited to 20 per cent.' I do not fully understand this. Does it mean that, as I pay no tax above the 20p in the pound rate, the restriction has no practical effect in my case? How is the restriction to 20 per cent in the allowances brought into any calculation of my tax liability? The 20 per cent restriction applies only to your married couple's allowance, which will be Pounds 2,705. In your case, the restriction will have no practical effect. According to Budget resolution 15, your tax bill will be calculated initially without taking the married couple's allowance into account; the resulting tax charge will then be reduced by 20 per cent of Pounds 2,705. You might like to ask your MP to urge the chancellor to rationalise the tax rules for people over 64 so that senior citizens no longer face more complex calculations than MPs (few of whom are over 64). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

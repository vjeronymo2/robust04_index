			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> MIDWEST AND EAST REGIONALS;  </P> <P> UCLA MISSED OUT ON A SMALL CHANCE;  </P> <P> BRUINS: THEY COULDN'T TAKE ADVANTAGE WHEN DUKE'S BIG MEN GOT INTO FOUL TROUBLE.  </P> <P> It was a situation made to order for UCLA.  </P> <P> Five minutes into the second half, Duke's big men -- 6-11 Christian Laettner  and 6-10 Alaa Abdelnaby -- each had four fouls.  </P> <P> All season long, the Bruins were vulnerable to teams with tall inside players  and here they were in the East Regional semifinal with their two principal  tormentors on the bench.  </P> <P> Duke led, 52-50, with Laettner and Abdelnaby only one foul away from taking a  seat on the bench for the rest of the game.  </P> <P> "We were in trouble," Abdelnaby said.  </P> <P> But in the ultimate twist to UCLA's NCAA tournament hopes, the Bruins failed to  take advantage of the situation and the Blue Demons wrapped up a 90-81 victory  Thursday night.  </P> <P> UCLA, which beat relatively small Alabama Birmingham and Kansas, found itself  lacking when they reduced Duke to a normal-sized team.  </P> <P> Such irony was not lost on UCLA forward Don MacLean, who had 21 points and 15  rebounds.  </P> <P> "That something like that would wind up beating us when that was our strongest  point all year -- playing smaller lineups -- well, it's a funny game  sometimes," MacLean said.  </P> <P> When his inside game suddenly became smaller, Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski  shuttled Laettner and Abdelnaby in and out of the lineup before finally using  them both despite their fouls.  </P> <P> At the four-foul juncture, Krzyzewski made an assessment.  </P> <P> "I thought we were in a situation where we would lose the game," Krzyzewski  said.  </P> <P> And although it was Duke's backcourt of Phil Henderson and Bobby Hurley who  assumed the offensive burden, neither of the Blue Devil big men were challenged  inside as UCLA struggled to stay close.  </P> <P> Laettner had 24 points and 14 rebounds in 32 minutes and Abdelnaby had 14  points and seven rebounds in 20 minutes.  </P> <P> Abdelnaby was surprised he wasn't visited more often by UCLA's offense.  </P> <P> "They should have forced the issue, but they didn't do it, thank goodness,"  Abdelnaby said. "They should have come to me and Christian a bit more and put  us in a position to block a shot or make a spectacular play or foul."  </P> <P> UCLA Coach Jim Harrick downplayed the foul trouble of Laettner and Abdelnaby.  He said their being burdened with four fouls was of no consequence.  </P> <P> "That wasn't the difference," Harrick said. "The difference was Henderson made  some shots and we missed."  </P> <P> However, Trevor Wilson said the Bruins missed a rare opportunity with Duke's  big players.  </P> <P> "We didn't do a good job of taking advantage of their fouls," Wilson said. "We  didn't execute our offense like we normally do. But we had the shots. We just  didn't hit them."  </P> <P> The Bruins shot only 40.6% and MacLean blamed tired legs and a poorly  constructed offense down the stretch.  </P> <P> "We didn't get the ball inside," he said. "I don't know why. We kind of rushed  our shots and tried to get the lead back as soon as we could. When the big guys  went out, it's funny, but we didn't go to the boards the same way.  </P> <P> "It's real late in the season and my legs are shot right now," MacLean said.  "Maybe that's what happened. All I know is it's a funny game."  </P></p>

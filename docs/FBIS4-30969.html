			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] In an effort to dispel growing anxiety  and confusion among the population about the Croatian  Government's scheduled introduction of the new currency, the  "kuna," on the 30 May Croatian National Day of Statehood, the  Zagreb daily VJESNIK published an interview on 9 May with Mladen  Sunjic, acting director of the Croatian National Bank's Legal  Department, and a commentary on 10 May by economist Ivo  Jakovljevic on the National Bank's monetary policy.    In his interview Sunjic explained the technical aspects of  the monetary conversion and sought to clear up misconceptions  and reassure the population of the soundness of the new legal  tender. Taking into consideration "negative experiences" people  had had in the past, he expressed understanding for their  apprehension that the conversion would not proceed smoothly. He  emphasized, however, that it is important to "forget the past"  and "start building trust." Trying to dispel "persistent rumors"  of devaluation, he emphasized that the conversion of 1,000  Croatian dinars into one kuna represents a redenomination and  not a devaluation. Like the old Croatian dinar, the kuna will be  convertible within Croatia, Sunjic explained, but he declined to  discuss "at this moment... if and when it will become  convertible" on international financial markets, because a  currency cannot be declared convertible "by issuing  regulations."    In the 10 May edition of VJESNIK, commentator Jakovljevic  examined the financial backing of the kuna -- foreign exchange  reserves totalling $1.5 billion held by the Croatian National  Bank and commercial banks -- and contrasted the current  situation to that of December 1991, when Croatia established its  "monetary independence" and had to use a temporary currency, the  Croatian dinar, because the National Bank of Croatia had no  foreign exchange reserves and those of commercial banks amounted  to only $200 million. Although he considered present foreign  exchange reserves sufficient to guarantee a "successful"  introduction of the kuna as the national currency, Jakovljevic  nevertheless expressed concern that these reserves will not be  sufficient to guarantee its long-term security and stability. In  his view the "real" foreign exchange reserves -- those held by  the National Bank and currently amounting to only $720 million  -- must be increased to an "optimum" of $1.4 billion; otherwise,  the kuna could become "vulnerable" in the second half of 1994.  These National Bank reserves, he added, must be financed from  "regular sources," such as the return of capital that fled the  country, foreign trade surpluses, and foreign investments. In  conclusion, Jakovljevic recommended that the National Bank  continue its present monetary policy of building its reserves to  ensure the value of the kuna over the long term.</p>

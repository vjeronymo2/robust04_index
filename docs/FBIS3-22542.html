According to Azwar Anas, coordinating minister for the  people's welfare who spoke after he was received by President  Suharto on 20 January at Istana Merdeka [Freedom Palace], the  number of persons suffering from AIDS in Indonesia is 194 at  present. Sixty-four persons suffer from AIDS in metropolitan  Jakarta, 22 in Bali, 54 in Irian Jaya, 22 in East Java, 14 in  Riau, five in West Java, and one each in West Sumatra and West  Kalimantan.    In this connection the cabinet ministers concerned are  actively promoting preventive measures, one of which is teaching  the community healthy sexual practices. Minister Azwar Anas  added: "We know that AIDS is spread in particular by sexual  relations with persons of the same sex, rather than with the  opposite sex. The symptoms only appear after one year, and there  are positive indications after five years."    Azwar Anas said that, previously, protective measures  against  AIDS were handled only by the minister of tourism, posts, and  telecommunications and the minister of health. Now all ministers  are working on this matter with the coordinating minister for  the people's welfare.    In addition to reporting on the AIDS question Minister Azwar  Anas also reported on the matter of stocks of iodized salt. In  view of the fact that the Indonesian people prefer to use  technical or raw salt, it is feared that they will suffer a  decline in IQ [Intelligence Quotient].    There are two kinds of salt. There is technical or raw salt  which is used, among other things, for fishing purposes and so  forth, and there is salt for human consumption. Clearly, the  people prefer to use raw or technical salt, the price of which  is cheaper at 35 rupiahs per kilogram. However, many people are  not aware that their average IQ will decline as a result of  using technical or raw salt.    In this connection, the president expressed hoped that  iodized salt will be used more widely by the people.    Minister Azwar Anas said that at the present time the  government is making a national survey to be used in preparing a  Presidential Instruction on the Most Disadvantaged Villages  (IDT). Individual families in the survey will be listed under  five classifications: Low Welfare, Welfare 1, Welfare 2, Welfare  3, and Welfare 3+.    The classification of "Low Welfare" means a family that  lives  in a home which is inadequate in four ways: food, shelter,  clothing, and health.    "Welfare 1" means a family that is adequately provided for  in  the above four categories, but that is unable to pay for  education costs. "Welfare 3+" means a family that is adequately  provided for in all of the above categories and whose members  are able to help others, such as by contributing goods, giving  alms, and so forth.    It is hoped that all of this data will have been collected  by  April 1994, so that action can be taken to improve the situation  in the most disadvantaged villages.    Minister Azwar Anas also reported to the president on  preparations for the Social Development Summit Conference.  Indonesia has been designated deputy chairman of the conference  by the United Nations to represent the countries of Southeast  Asia. The summit conference will be preceded by three meetings  at lower levels. There is a possibility that President Suharto  will attend the meeting in Copenhagen, that is, when the summit  conference is held.    The minister also reported on the floods which are currently  affecting some areas of Indonesia. The office of the  coordinating minister for the people's welfare has 2.0 billion  rupiahs available to help victims of the present floods, for  example in Flores, West Java, and West Sumatra.</p>

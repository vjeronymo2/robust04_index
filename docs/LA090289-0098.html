			<p><P> September 2, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A. BARTLETT GIAMATTI 1938 -- 1989;  </P> <P> DEPUTY COMMISSIONER DISLIKES PUBLICITY  </P> <P> The man who may run major league baseball after the death of Commissioner Bart  Giamatti is Deputy Commissioner Francis T. (Fay) Vincent Jr., the shy attorney  and former head of Columbia Pictures who conducted some of the negotiating that  resulted in the banning of Cincinnati Reds Manager Pete Rose from baseball.  </P> <P> Although baseball owners will choose Giamatti's successor, Yankee owner George  Steinbrenner told a New York TV station that he will press for Vincent's  election.  </P> <P> "It's what Bart would have wanted," Steinbrenner said. "I'm voting for him.  When we lose Bart Giamatti, we lose a man we can never replace. Even Fay would  say that."  </P> <P> As did Giamatti, Vincent took office on April 1. Erudite and scholarly like his  predecessor, Vincent, a history buff, has been known to call prominent people  to ask them about their roles in history-making situations. But unlike his  friend, Vincent prefers to stay in the background. Some would even describe him  as bland.  </P> <P> When he was with Columbia Pictures, Vincent spent more time in New York than in  Hollywood, and said earlier this year, "I was reasonably invisible, if not  anonymous."  </P> <P> Said Steve Greenberg, an attorney who specializes in representing athletes and  is a longtime friend of Vincent: "There's no question that after (Peter)  Ueberroth and Giamatti, he has a very different media image. But it goes to  what you want in a commissioner. Do you want flash and dash? Then Fay's not  your guy. If you want substance and a job done well, Fay's your guy."  </P> <P> Vincent and Giamatti became friends more than a dozen years ago. When Giamatti  asked Vincent to join him in baseball last fall, Giamatti said, "I was looking  for someone with the background and skills complementary to my own. It occurred  to me that I had a friend who fit the bill. Then an owner said to me, 'Have you  thought of Fay Vincent?' "  </P> <P> Vincent, 51, is heavy-set, wears dark-rimmed glasses and speaks quietly and  precisely. His nickname, Fay, is short for Francis in Irish communities, he  said.  </P> <P> Vincent walks with difficulty, aided by a cane. As an 18-year-old freshman at  Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., he was locked in his room as a prank  and the only way out, he believed, was through the window and along a ledge to  another room. But the ledge was icy and he fell four stories, breaking his  back.  </P> <P> The injury did not deter him from the legal path he had set for himself. After  graduation from Yale Law School, he practiced corporate law for 15 years with  firms in New York and Washington. For four months in 1978, he served as  associate director of corporate finance for the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  </P> <P> Then, in June 1978, he was called by investment banker Herbert Allen, a friend  who had been two years behind him at Williams. Allen wanted him to join  Columbia Pictures Industries, which Allen's family investment firm, Allen &amp;  Co., controlled. Columbia was suffering from the embezzlement scandal  surrounding then-studio chief David Begelman.  </P> <P> The Columbia board of directors was about to oust president Alan Hirschfield  and Allen wanted Vincent to take over. Vincent's unfamiliarity with the film  and TV business was deemed a plus.  </P> <P> "Nobody knows him," Allen was quoted as saying in the book, "Indecent  Exposure." "Nobody can lay a glove on him. We need a Judge Landis."  </P> <P> Vincent said the challenge was worth the risk.  </P> <P> "I was 40," he said recently. "Herbert said, 'What do you have to lose? Nobody  expects you to succeed, and if you fail you go back to being a lawyer. If you  succeed, you'll have a lot of fun and make a lot of money.' So I had to try  it."  </P> <P> He succeeded by most standards. He helped re-establish Columbia's credibility  and ended the company's political strife; positioned Columbia for Coca-Cola's  $750-million acquisition in 1982, and presided over the acquisition of Merv  Griffin Enterprises for $200 million, Embassy Communications for $267 million  and Tandem Productions for $178 million.  </P> <P> In one of his most-publicized moves, Vincent hired flamboyant British producer  David Puttnam to run Columbia in 1986, but Puttnam, an outsider harshly  critical of the Hollywood Establishment, was gone only a year later, having  offended top Columbia stars such as Bill Cosby and Bill Murray.  </P> <P> "I think if we'd done it over again, we'd have done things differently," said  Vincent. "But I think it was terrific to break out of the usual mold and hire  someone different."  </P> <P> Vincent was also on board when Columbia released the Warren Beatty-Dustin  Hoffman flop, "Ishtar."  </P> <P> In a decade at Columbia and then Coca-Cola, Vincent rose to become executive  vice president of Coca-Cola and president of its Entertainment Business Sector.  In late 1987, he was shifted to running Coca-Cola's bottling-company  investments. He left in July 1988 to return to his old law firm, Caplin &amp;  Drysdale.  </P> <P> Vincent began working with Giamatti and Ueberroth for several months before  taking office. His experience was put to use during negotiations for the new  CBS and ESPN network and cable television agreements, which go into effect next  year.  </P> <P> Vincent said that the switch to baseball was more in line with his own  interests, which do not include much of movies or TV.  </P> <P> "The underlying subject matter of television and movies is not something I had  a passion about," he said. "But all my life, I've been addicted to baseball.  That makes a difference."  </P></p>

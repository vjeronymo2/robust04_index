			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Accounting change lifts life companies SHARES AT leading life assur- ance companies yesterday rose on the news that London &amp; Manchester had won approval for an innovative accounting change which will boost its profits. Exeter-based London &amp; Manchester expects its 1992 profits to be increased by at least Pounds 3m as a result of the change which will allow it to transfer profits contained within life assurance funds to its shareholders at a faster rate. L &amp; M closed at 286p, up 18p. Anticipating that other life companies may follow L &amp; M's lead, the market marked Refuge up 15p to 705p, United Friendly by 11p at 418p, and Britannic 18p higher at 938p. The accounting change allows L &amp; M to offer shareholders quicker access to surpluses earned on investments from non-profit protection policies and unit-linked life policies. The way that surpluses are distributed on with-profits policies will remain unchanged. Each year L &amp; M allocates 90 per cent of the surpluses earned on with profits policies to policyholders in the form of annual (or reversionary) and final bonuses (paid at the end of the policy period). The remainder is paid to shareholders. However with-profits policyholders also receive some of the surplus earned on non-profits and unit-linked business and will obtain lesser amounts from this source in future. L &amp; M had won the approval of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Government Actuary's Department that the revised basis is consistent with the requirement to ensure that the 'reasonable expectations of policyholders are met', although it will need to notify its with-profits policyholders of the change. Mr Tom Pyne, group chief executive, said: 'Shareholders will get their proper earnings but more quickly. Profits had been earned but we couldn't release them from the life fund.' He added the group's unit-linked business was growing faster than with-profits policies and that the change would allow for quicker recognition of profits. L &amp; M's profits, which amounted to Pounds 21.2m in 1991, have been adversely affected by problems on its mortgage book. According to analysts the change should strengthen dividend cover. L &amp; M also warned that rates of reversionary bonuses - which are paid to with profits policyholders each year - will have to fall as a result of falling investment returns.</p>

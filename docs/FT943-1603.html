			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / People: UD catches Finn Johnsson in its gin trap Guinness has ended the almost year-long search for a successor to Crispin Davis, former managing director of United Distillers, with the surprise choice of Finn Johnsson, chief executive of Euroc, Sweden's largest building products group. The decision to plump for a second MD for Guinness' spirits division who has no experience of the drinks market came as a surprise to City analysts. The departure of Davis - famous for the decision to reduce the strength of Gordon's gin - after little more than a year was widely attributed to his experience in marketing consumer goods with Procter &amp; Gamble. It is widely believed that Davis wanted UD to compete more strongly on price  -as competitors are doing - while Guinness chairman Tony Greener, with his background in Dunhill, retained his faith in building premium brands. Greener says there is no reason why the head of UD should be a drinks man, as the company has 'plenty of people with drinks and marketing experience. I was not specifically looking for somebody who understands the drinks industry. I was looking for somebody with substantial international experience, running businesses around the world in highly competitive markets and who knew his way around the world. 'Finn Johnsson fulfils that specification. He is someone who is a good leader and general manager of a highly competitive international business.' Greener adds that after a Europe-wide search, Johnsson was 'clearly the best candidate'. Analysts suspect Johnsson's lack of drinks experience means Greener will continue, initially at least, to have a dominant influence on UD's strategy. But Johnsson's achievements at Euroc, which he joined as chief executive in 1990, suggest he is not a soft touch. He has gained respect in Sweden for turning the company round and restoring it to profit, in spite of a recession in building products and cement. Before Euroc, he spent 14 years running international consumer products companies with Swedish Match, subsequently Stora. He ran companies whose business interests were mainly outside Scandinavia, and gained management experience in the US, Western Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Johnsson says he is excited at returning to branded consumer goods where he spent so much of his career. But he has to wait a few months yet. The agreement with Euroc is that he will not take up his new post until February. (See Observer)</p>

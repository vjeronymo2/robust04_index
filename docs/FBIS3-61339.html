			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ashot Aramyan: "Further and Further Away From </F> Harmony: `Empty Pockets--Empty Stores'--Such Is the Current  Situation in the Consumer Market"]    [Text] The situation in the republic consumer market is, to  be honest, less than attractive. The lack of sufficient  resources in Russian rubles and other foreign hard currency is  beginning to show. Many merchants, having earned these days  their first thousands of drams, have encountered difficulties  converting them to other currency and....closed their stores.  Elbow-shoving queues form in state-owned stores, where the  supply of goods is minimal. People are indignant that butter  priced at 25 drams and sugar at 10 drams have been designated  for unrestricted sale rather than being sold by rationing  coupons. Let us point out, however, that these complaints are  unfair, since the available quantity of these goods clearly was  not enough to distribute them to the entire population through  coupons. In some instances, however, both store employees and  members of law enforcement also violate the rules of trading,  creating chaos and confusion in the lines. This is doubly  impermissible, since right now backing up the dram with  available goods is a political as well as economic action.    There also is a clear discrepancy, imbalance, between the  official exchange rates of currencies set by the Central Bank  (for instance, 15 drams for one U.S. dollar) and the "black  market" rates, which are, it should be pointed out, more  realistic (25-30 drams for a dollar). The banks, which are  experiencing a shortage of foreign currency, set restrictions on  sales of hard currency, trying to artificially hold down its  exchange rate and not allow the dram to weaken. Wherever hard  currency is sold at the official rate, colossal lines form  immediately.    Meanwhile, and precisely for the aforementioned reasons,  prices rise continuously. While during the first days of the  money exchange, Magna cigarettes could be purchased for 5 drams,  and then later for 8-10 drams, now at this price, if one is very  lucky, one can count only on Turkish cigarettes of a quality  that is lower by an order of magnitude. Butter went from costing  45 drams a kilogram to 80-120 drams, and sugar--from 15 to 30.    If the difficulties with the internal convertibility of the  Armenian currency continue, before the year is out the republic  may get its third bout of hyperinflation in so many months,  empty store shelves, and total impoverishment of the population.    With all the shortcomings in organizing the sales of butter  and sugar reserved for the state trade network, I think that  prices for these products will not gallop for a while. The  government also should take immediate steps to organize pre-New  Year sales of the greatest number of goods possible by coupons:  this could bring down panic buying, and reduce the intense  pressure on the consumer market.    Under socialism, the cheerless scheme of the consumer market  workings looked this way: there is money but no goods. At the  initial stage of a transition to market relations, the picture  changed dramatically: the population no longer has any money,  while everything one can imagine in one's most wonderful dream  has now appeared in the stores at high prices. Now the situation  has become even more dramatic: empty pockets and empty stores.  Are we moving further away from harmony?</p>

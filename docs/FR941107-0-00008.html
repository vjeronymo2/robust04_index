			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 90 handlers of winter pears regulated under the marketing order each season and approximately 1,850 winter pear producers in Oregon, Washington, and California. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [13 CFR &sect;121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $5,000,000. The majority of these handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Oregon, Washington, and California winter pear marketing order, administered by the Department, requires that the assessment rate for a particular fiscal year apply to all assessable winter pears handled from the beginning of such year. Annual budgets of expenses are prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of this marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are handlers and producers of Oregon, Washington, and California winter pears. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs for goods, services, and personnel in their local area, and are thus in a position to formulate appropriate budgets. The Committee's budget is formulated and discussed in public meetings. Thus, all directly affected persons have an opportunity to participate and provide input.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate recommended by the Committee is derived by dividing the anticipated expenses by expected shipments of pears. Because this rate is applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate which will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expected expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee met on June 3, 1994, and unanimously recommended total expenses of $6,835,926 for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year expense amount was $6,933,615, which is $97,689 more than the amount recommended for the current fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.43 per standard box, or equivalent for winter pears. The Committee did not recommend a supplemental assessment rate for Anjou variety pears this fiscal year. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 winter pear assessment rate was $0.45 per standard box, or equivalent and $0.04 for the supplemental assessment rate on Anjou variety pears. This represents a $0.02 decrease in the assessment rate recommended for this fiscal year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rate, when applied to anticipated winter pear shipments of 13,817,000 boxes or equivalent, will yield a total of $5,941,310 in assessment income. Assessment income, along with $401,324 from other income sources, and $493,292 from the Committee's authorized reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. The $493,292 withdrawal of funds from the Committee's authorized reserve will result in no reserve remaining at the end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994&hyph;95 fiscal period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "r": "Slovak Republic Citizens' Approach to the </F> Speeches Made in Parliament on 9 and 11 March 1994"]    [Text] Bratislava--Citizens' views on the speeches made by  President Michal Kovac and then Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar  during the 27th meeting of the National Council of the Slovak  Republic were monitored by the Public Opinion Research  Department of the Slovak Statistical Office in the first 10 days  of April. The extent of respondents' lack of information about  the two speeches was the same, with one-third of the respondents  stating that they did not know the contents of the speeches.    Approximately one in four (24 percent) of the 1,287  respondents accepted the president's speech fully, 27 percent  accepted it with reservations (they agreed only with some of its  parts), and 16 percent expressed a negative attitude.    Views on the former prime minister's speech were slightly  more negative. The evaluation of the contents of Vladimir  Meciar's speech shows that there were 5 percent fewer approving  reactions (19 percent) and 3 percent more disapproving reactions  (19 percent). The proportion of those who agreed with  reservations was 2 percent higher than with respect to the  president's speech and represented 29 percent.    In expressing their views more specifically, the respondents  applied several levels of assessment. When asked to evaluate  spontaneously the contents of Michal Kovac's speech, respondents  expressed their greatest appreciation for the fact that it was  truthful (20 percent). The opposite view (that the speech was  not truthful) was expressed by 8 percent of respondents. The  president's criticism of the government (or, respectively, Prime  Minister Meciar) was endorsed by 9 percent of respondents, while  11 percent rejected it.    When assessing the contents of Vladimir Meciar's speech,  some  23 percent of respondents did not consider it truthful, while 16  percent held the view that the former prime minister was  speaking the truth. One percent of respondents endorsed  Meciar's criticism of the president, while 5 percent rejected it.    Specific views on the speeches in parliament were expressed  only by respondents who were familiar with their contents.    The responses were collected between 1 and 8 April 1994 from  1,287 citizens of the Slovak Republic above age 18,  representative in terms of sex, age, level of education,  nationality, size of the community of residence, and region of  Slovakia.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Views on President Michal Kovac'sSpeech in the National Council ofthe Slovak |  |Republic on 9 March 1994(in percent)                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fully agree                           |24                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agree with some parts                 |27                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Totally disagree                      |16                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Not familiar with contents of speech  |33                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Views on Vladimir Meciar's Speechin the National Council ofthe Slovak Republ-|  |ic on 11 March 1994(in percent)                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fully agree                           |19                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agree with some parts                 |29                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Totally disagree                      |19                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Not familiar with contents of speech  |33                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

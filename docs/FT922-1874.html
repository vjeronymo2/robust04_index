			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / The Maxwells: Police helped by accountants THE ARRESTS of Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Larry Trachtenberg yesterday by the Serious Fraud Office follow several months of inquiries by a team of more than 50 police officers and other staff, given considerable support by accountants acting as administrators to the Maxwell companies. The SFO staff is still working on further investigations which may lead to additional charges in the coming months. Mr John Tate is controller of the SFO Maxwell team, which includes several lawyers and up to 30 accountants seconded from the forensic division of KPMG Peat Marwick. But besides its own inquiries, the SFO has also been able to draw on information from the substantial investigations work conducted by accountants who were administrators acting on behalf of creditors to the Maxwell public and private companies. Mr John Talbot, a partner with Arthur Andersen, has co-ordinated the administration of the private Maxwell business empire of more than 400 companies. The firm passed information on alleged MCC share support operations to the SFO. Mr David Lee, head of the litigation and special investigation services unit at Price Waterhouse, administrators to Maxwell Communications Corporation, has been equally important. Mr Neil Cooper, the partner at Robson Rhodes, liquidator to Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the pension funds, has also been investigating movements of money. The accountants have had access to information not available to the police under special powers given to them by the 1986 insolvency act. So-called 'section 236' interviews allow them to ask questions of individuals, who have no right to silence. This information cannot be passed on to police. There have been regular meetings to share other information by the different accountants and the SFO. Private investigators have also been employed to help trace assets and identify movements of money. The SFO has publicly announced five separate inquiries between November 1991 and January this year in conjunction with the City of London police, to which some of yesterday's charges relate: November 18, 1991: a Pounds 55m loan from Swiss Bank Corporation to Adviser (188), a company owned by Headington Investments, after a complaint from Swiss Bank Corporation December 4: allegations concerning the management of assets of the Mirror Group Newspapers Pension Fund December: further allegations concerning money missing from MGN, following a complaint from Mirror Group December 18: arrangements made to support the price of MCC shares, following receipt of information from Arthur Andersen, administrators of the private Maxwell interests passed to the Department of Trade and Industry January 3 1992: assets including cash and investments removed from MCC, launched following investigations by Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC The charges against Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Larry Trachtenberg appear to relate principally to the Swiss Bank Corporation loan and alleged thefts of pension fund money. There is no mention of share support allegations, by which directors buy shares in their own companies but do not disclose the purchases as required by UK company legislation.</p>

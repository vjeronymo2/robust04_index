			<p>BFN     [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian  parliament and head of State, received Mr. Kananabeldy, first  deputy chairman of the State Committee for Material and  Technical Supplies of the Republic of Turkmenistan, who led a  delegation of Turkmen industrialists on their visit in Tbilisi.    The aim of the delegation's visit to Georgia was to choose  agricultural and industrial products in exchange for Georgia's  still unpaid debt. The Turkmen side once again showed its full  understanding of the current complex economic situation in the  republic, which was reflected in the fact that Georgia will  supply Turkmenistan with Georgian products in exchange for 3  billion cubic meters of gas worth several million U.S. dollars,  as envisaged in the bilateral agreement signed in 1994.  Meanwhile, our Turkmen friends accepted the prices suggested by  us.    The head of state thanked the Turkmen side for their  fruitful  cooperation and understanding of our problems. Shevardnadze  said: Our republic's population knows very well about your  realistic support, and we will do everything to carry out our  responsibilities.    At the meeting, Shevardnadze raised the issue of the  importance of finding new and economically useful ways to  transport Turkmen gas to Georgia and other countries.    Georgian Prime Minister Otar Patsatsia, Deputy Prime  Minister  Zurab Kervalishvili, and other officials were present at the  meeting.</p>

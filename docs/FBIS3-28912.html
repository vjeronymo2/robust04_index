			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, Feb. 12 KYODO -- Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa reaffirmed after fresh talks with  U.S. President Bill Clinton on Saturday [12 February] the  collapse of efforts to conclude a new bilateral trade framework,  stressing the need for a "cooling off period." Hosokawa spoke  to reporters at a press conference after a previously  unscheduled breakfast meeting with Clinton, called at Clinton's  request, in the family quarters of the executive mansion.    He said that the two sides could not resolve their  differences regarding interpretation of a previous agreement to  use "objective criteria" to measure the progress of imports in  Japan. Japan rejects the idea of using "numerical targets" to  that end, which it says amounts to managed trade.    But Hosokawa said he was hopeful that the U.S. would not, in  the aftermath of the collapse of the talks, resort to  "unilateral punitive measures in violation of GATT," a reference  to the multilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    U.S. officials have warned of retaliation against Japan  before the Group of Seven (G-7) industrial countries convenes  its annual summit meeting in Naples in early July.    Hosokawa said his "frank" breakfast talks with Clinton took  place in a "relaxed atmosphere" and that they did not dwell on  awkward subjects. He said the talks reaffirmed the "adult"  nature of the bilateral relationship.    Clinton and Hosokawa had three hours of formal summit talks  Friday at the White House, in which the two leaders had what one  senior U.S. administration official later described as "rather  intense" exchanges over economic issues.    They announced afterwards Friday at a joint news conference  the two countries' failure to reach an accord on the new  framework. U.S. administration officials subsequently said  Washington would not reopen the framework negotiations unless  Tokyo changes its position.    The Clinton administration concluded an agreement with  Hosokawa's predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa, last July that called  for setting up a new "framework" of trade relations between the  two countries to help slash Japan's trade surplus and open its  markets.    Under the terms of the agreement, the two countries were  supposed to work out a formula by the summit meeting Friday on  how to increase foreign access in specific market sectors --  autos and auto parts, insurance, and government procurement of  telecommunications and medical equipment.    Hosokawa is due to return home on Sunday.</p>

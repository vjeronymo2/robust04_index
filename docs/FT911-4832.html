			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Citicorp falls 70% in quarter CITICORP earnings plunged 70 per cent in the first quarter, hard hit by the slowdown in the world economy and the slump in the US property market. North America's biggest banking group was forced to increase loan-loss reserves by Dollars 200m (Pounds 113m). Citicorp yesterday reported earnings of Dollars 70m, or 10 cents a share, down from Dollars 231m, or 60 cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. However, taking in changes in accounting practices, after-tax profits for the first quarter of last year would have been even higher at Dollars 371m. Mr John Reed, Citicorp's chairman, told a lively and unusually crowded annual meeting in New York yesterday that business conditions were still deteriorating. 'We will feel pressure in terms of revenue and credit on both the consumer and corporate business as this slowdown continues,' he said. Although an economic revival in the US may start later this year, Mr Reed cautioned that 'there is little evidence of this now, nor is there reason to expect a robust recovery'. Analysts said the latest results were much as expected. Mr Jim Hanbury at Wertheim Schroder said: 'The deterioration is continuing, but at least they're putting up some reserves against it.' Citicorp's interest income and operating expenses were virtually unchanged from a year ago. Fee and commission revenues edged up by 4 per cent, and income tax provisions were down by almost a third. But these positive factors were wiped out by a jump in loan-loss provisions from Dollars 570m to Dollars 812m. The increase includes an extra Dollars 200m in reserves, divided almost equally between consumer and corporate business. Net write-offs fell from Dollars 679m to Dollars 646m, but this was entirely due to lower losses on Third World loans. Write-offs on consumer loans climbed by 27 per cent, and on corporate business by 33 per cent. Non-performing commercial loans rose to Dollars 10.6bn on March 31, from just under Dollars 10bn three months earlier and Dollars 7.9bn a year ago. The bank's portfolio of foreclosed properties climbed to almost Dollars 2bn, from Dollars 1.8bn last December and Dollars 624m a year ago. Citicorp cut its quarterly dividend earlier this year from 44.5 cents to 25 cents, but Mr Reed said that, despite continuing pressure on earnings, he does not expect a further dividend reduction.

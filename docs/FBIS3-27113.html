"When it officially opens to service next year, Shanghai  will  become the third city in the country to have subway traffic," Xu  Kerang, deputy general manager of the Shanghai Subway  Corporation, said.    Shanghai is China's largest economic center.    Construction of the subway began in January 1990 with a  total  investment of four billion yuan.    Starting from the Jinjiang Leyuan (garden) in the southern  suburbs of Shanghai, the 16.1-kilometer, 13-stop subway will  pass through the downtown shopping center to reach the railway  station in the northern part of the city.    In addition, Xu said, preparation is under way to build the  No. Two subway running from the downtown shopping district at a  transfer point with the No. One subway, to the Pudong New Area,  a newly-established economic zone that is expected to lead the  transformation of Shanghai's industrial and financial sectors.</p>

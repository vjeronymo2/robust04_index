			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ORDINATION OF WOMEN SUPPORTED  </P> <P> A survey indicates Roman Catholic priests are becoming more willing to accept  the ordination of women.  </P> <P> The magazine U.S. Catholic sent 1,300 readers an article by Gregory F.  Augustine Pierce, a syndicated columnist and Catholic author, in which he  advocated the ordination of women.  </P> <P> The magazine asked readers to comment on the article.  </P> <P> The results were published in the magazine's January issue, released today.  </P> <P> Sixty-nine percent of the respondents were laywomen, 23% laymen and 8% clergy.  Of the three groups, the biggest increase in support came from priests.  </P> <P> Fifty-nine percent of the priests said women should be ordained. That compared  to 48% in a 1975 survey.  </P> <P> More than three-fourths of the laypeople said they would welcome a female  priest to their parishes. Women are more likely to attend a Mass celebrated by  a female priest, but 78% of the men said they would have no objections to a  female priest.  </P></p>

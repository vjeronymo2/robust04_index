			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Q &amp; A  </P> <P> Q: Enclosed is a copy of a $1,000 note from the Bank of the United States in  Philadelphia that was given to my father in 1925 as partial payment of a debt.  It is dated 1840. Upon his death in 1987, it was discovered in a photo album. I  am wondering if it might have any value. -- Upland  </P> <P> A: It is worthless as a note but might be worth something to a collector. But  collectors would be interested only if it is authentic and not one of thousands  of fakes sent out in the 1950s as promotional material. The fakes are printed  on parchment paper; the real thing was printed on heavy white paper.  </P> <P> Because you say your father received the note in 1925, let's assume that it  isn't one of the 1950s replicas.  </P> <P> Although the name Bank of the United States may have sounded very official and  governmental, it was really just another bank. According to a pamphlet put out  by the Pennsylvania Bankers Assn., there were two different banks that called  themselves the Bank of the United States. One closed in 1811. The other --  after switching to a state charter -- collapsed in 1841.  </P> <P> Nicholas Biddle, the second bank's president from 1823 to 1839, was brought to  trial for mismanagement but acquitted. It was charged that many of the bank's  assets were of questionable value. (Sounds like today, doesn't it?) Biddle died  "heartbroken" in 1844, according to the association.  </P> <P> The collapse of this bank eventually led to the setting up of the Federal  Reserve System.  </P> <P> Your note obviously became worthless as a note when the bank collapsed in the  1800s, because these things weren't insured. The note might be worth $250 to  $300 to a collector -- but only if Biddle signed it.  </P> <P> There are two problems with this. Biddle tended to sign in an acidic ink, so  few of his signatures survive. And because Biddle quit the bank in 1839, and  your note is dated 1840, he would have had to sneak back into his old office to  sign it.  </P> <P> Q: I have 100 shares of Rose Marie Reid stock from my late mother's estate.  Rose Marie Reid has apparently been acquired by some company, because I see the  name on tags of bathing suits each spring in the department stores. Could you  find out who bought Rose Marie Reid and what this stock is worth? -- Thousand  Oaks  </P> <P> A: Rose Marie Reid went out of business in August, 1965. The next month all of  its properties were repossessed and sold for non-payment of taxes. The stock is  worthless, according to R. M. Smythe &amp; Co., which tracks down long-lost  companies.  </P> <P> Now, let's look into that bathing suit. Jonathan Logan, another apparel firm,  had a licensing agreement with Rose Marie Reid in the 1960s. It got the rights  to the Rose Marie Reid name, although nobody at Jonathan Logan is quite sure  how this all came about. Jonathan Logan was later acquired by United Merchants  &amp; Manufacturers Inc.  </P> <P> Q: In cleaning out my late father's papers, I came across a 1923 German  Treasurer Exchequer Bond with coupons maturing between March 1, 1924, and Sept.  1, 1927. I suspect that the events that occurred in Germany during this period  negated collectibility of the bond. However, I am wondering if the United  States after World War II might have entered into any agreement with Germany  for honoring claims of bondholders during this period. -- Bethlehem, Pa.  </P> <P> A: Haley Garrison, head of Antique Stocks and Bonds in Williamsburg, Va., says  the bonds you hold are worthless.  </P> <P> Garrison says 1923 was the year that Germany, devastated by skyrocketing  inflation, printed these bonds aplenty. "Immigrants brought truckloads of this  stuff in hopes that it might someday be redeemed," he adds.  </P> <P> But the bonds weren't redeemed then, and they aren't worth anything today. You  can contact Garrison at (800) 451-4504 if you'd like more information. JOHN  CRUDELE  </P></p>

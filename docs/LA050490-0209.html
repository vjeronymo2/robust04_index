			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUSSIAN ORTHODOX PATRIARCH PIMEN DIES AT 79;  </P> <P> RELIGION: HIS PASSING CLEARS THE WAY FOR DEEP REFORM IN THE CHURCH. HE TENDED  TO SUPPORT KREMLIN POLICIES.  </P> <P> Pimen, patriarch of Moscow and all Russia, died Thursday at age 79, clearing  the way for deep change in the Russian Orthodox Church, the 1,000-year-old  institution said by critics to resist reform more stubbornly than the Soviet  Communist Party.  </P> <P> Since 1971 and the now-derided era of Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev, Pimen  had been spiritual head of the country's Orthodox believers, who number as many  as 50 million.  </P> <P> In recent years he clearly became too infirm for the job. When priests last  October celebrated the first religious service in the Kremlin's Church of the  Assumption since the Bolshevik era, the frail and white-bearded patriarch,  visibly ailing, had to be carried back to his limousine.  </P> <P> Orthodox activists said Pimen's history of compromise with the Soviet  government and his poor health meant that their long-suppressed church has not  seized opportunities made possible by the reforms of President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev.  </P> <P> Gorbachev received Pimen in the Kremlin in April, 1988, for the first talks  between a Russian Orthodox patriarch and Soviet leader since World War II. He  said then that the church has a clear role to play in helping effect the  changes in society that are the chief goals of his perestroika program for  economic and social restructuring.  </P> <P> It was a striking shift in Soviet policy, which had previously sought to  circumscribe church action or even brutally eradicate religious faith.  </P> <P> In a message read on state-run television news, the Holy Synod of the Russian  church reported Pimen's passing "with deep sorrow," but it gave no clue as to  the cause of death.  </P> <P> The synod met Thursday night in Moscow, preparing to elect an acting patriarch.  By tradition, a permanent successor is to be chosen within six months by  another church body, the Local Council, which is composed of all metropolitans,  archbishops and bishops as well as representatives of both clergy and laity.  </P> <P> The act of choosing a new Russian patriarch is certain to unleash high-level  debate about religion's place in Soviet society and the degree of independence  that the church should seek.  </P> <P> Pimen's path was to defer to the Kremlin by giving, for example, seemingly  knee-jerk approval to its foreign policy and arms control initiatives and by  never raising the church's voice against human rights abuses or social policies  now acknowledged to have been grave errors.  </P> <P> "Pimen's place in history was similar to Brezhnev's," said Orthodox activist  Mikhail Osadchi, linking the church leader with what is now publicly termed the  "era of stagnation." He said believers want the next patriarch to be like  Tikhon, who was named to the post in 1917 and set a course independent of the  fledgling Soviet government.  </P> <P> Under Pimen's stewardship, the church paid millions of rubles annually into the  coffers of the Soviet Peace Fund, an officially sanctioned social organization  created to push Kremlin foreign policy goals. Pimen also traveled to the United  Nations in New York, to Berlin, Budapest and elsewhere to endorse the words and  deeds of Soviet leaders at international conferences and meetings.  </P> <P> Pimen's church has also fought bitterly to hang on to the real estate and  parishioners it gained in the western Ukraine in 1946 when dictator Josef  Stalin forced the Ukrainian Catholic Church to merge with Russian Orthodoxy and  relinquish both its believers and sanctuaries.  </P> <P> Disapproval of Pimen surged into view under the freer climate of opinion  inaugurated by Gorbachev. In 1988, as the church prepared to celebrate the  millennium of Russian Christianity, dissident priest Gleb Yakunin and his  followers sent Pimen a letter asserting that he was too old, sick and  discredited by his lack of independence to take real advantage of Gorbachev-era  freedoms.  </P> <P> "We are obliged to tell you the truth . . . that you, your holiness, are so  weakened by your ailments that you are not in a condition to bear the burden of  patriarchal service," the dissidents said.  </P> <P> Counterattacking, Pimen accused his critics of sowing the seeds of temptation  and discord and of violating church discipline. He said they should be dealt  with on the basis of a "strict pastoral approach and healing guardianship of  the soul."  </P> <P> Pimen, whose given name was Sergei M. Izvekov, was born July 23, 1910, into a  family of civil servants in the Moscow region. At 17, he took monastic vows and  went on to serve as father superior of the Trinity-St. Sergei Monastery in  Zagorsk, the country's most important, in 1954-57.  </P> <P> He became a bishop in 1957 and was appointed business manager of the Moscow  patriarchate three years later, in 1960. That year he also became an archbishop  and a permanent member of the Holy Synod.  </P> <P> He was named a member of the Congress of People's Deputies, the new Soviet  Parliament, last year.  </P></p>

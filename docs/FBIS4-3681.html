			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Xu Hongzhi (6079 1347 3112) and </F> XINHUA reporters Zhou Shuchun (0719 2885 2504) and Ju Mengjun  (0215 1322 6511)]    [Text] Ashkhabat, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng met with hundreds of MP's, government officials, scholars,  and entrepreneurs at the presidential palace in Ashkhabat this  morning, where he gave an offhand, ebullient speech.    President Niyazov of Turkmenistan spoke first at the  meeting.  He said that leaders of Turkmenistan and China are determined  to develop all-round friendly relations between the two  countries. They will not only develop the ongoing good relations  in the political and cultural fields but will also expand  cooperation in the economic sector.    President Niyazov said that he fully agrees with Premier Li  Peng's view that countries, whether big or small, are entitled  to participate in international affairs or to choose their own  path of development in accordance with their own characteristics.    In his speech, Premier Li Peng said that he was accorded  very  warm hospitability during his official visit to Turkmenistan.    He said: "In the past two days, I have had very friendly,  sincere [fei chang you hao er cheng zhi 7236 1603 0645 1170 5079  6134 2304] talks with President Niyazov. We had an extensive  and in- depth exchange of views on bilateral relations and on  international and regional issues of common interest. Officials  and businessmen of the two nations also held counterpart talks.  We have discovered that our two nations share identical or  similar views on many issues. We can say that our talks and  meetings have been fruitful."    Li Peng said: China is ready to expand friendly cooperation  with Turkmenistan in all fields, including the building of a  modern "Silk Road" linking China and Central Asia -- including  Turkmenistan -- by modern railways. Such ties will also serve  to enhance contacts between Asia and Europe. "This `New Silk  Road' will not only serve as a broad way for economic  cooperation but also as a brilliant path toward friendship."    Li Peng said in conclusion, "Dear friends, I am convinced  that with this visit, the friendship between the people of China  and Turkmenistan will certainly become more solid and that  mutually beneficial cooperation will certainly grow day by day."    Upon hearing this, the hundreds of people present rose and  gave a long ovation to Li Peng's ebullient speech and heartfelt  wishes.</p>

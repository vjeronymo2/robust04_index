			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Laperrousaz: "Innovation: The Government </F> Launches a Major Consultation; New Research Policy  Orientations"--first paragraph is L'USINE NOUVELLE introduction]    [Text] The minister of higher education and research has  built up a conviction. His priorities: the environment, medical  research, aeronautics, innovation in small to mid-size  industries.    "For a country like France, it is in the nation's best  interest to question itself about the main orientations of its  scientific policy." To start his mandate, Francois Fillon, the  minister of higher education and research, decided to send  French research back to the drawing board.    To this effect, he just launched a broad national  consultation among researchers in public and industrial  laboratories in order to identify priority orientations for  French research. This consultation is accompanied by a so-called  "Delphi" survey (based on a method developed in Japan) of 3,000  experts.    The time to perform such an audit is not necessarily  ill-chosen. Things have changed since the National Research  Conference organized by Jean-Pierre Chevenement 12 years ago.  First of all, the economic context: During a recession, research  cannot escape cutbacks. Actually, the ratio of research  expenditures to the gross domestic product has stopped  increasing in several countries, including France, where it  remains stable around 2.42 percent. The era of triumphant  science is past, and the abandonment of a large program such as  the Hermes space shuttle marked a return to greater realism.  Especially considering that the image of science and technology  has changed in the public's mind.    "Ten years ago, it was thought that boosting research would  improve living conditions. Today, the public believes that  science destroys employment," claimed a spokesman for the  working group created by Francois Fillon to do the spadework  prior to the great national debate on research. In this changed  context, redefining priorities is probably not a luxury.    Already, the minister identified a few major orientations:  environment, medical research for which an additional 100  million francs [Fr] will be included in the 1994 budget, and a  similar amount for upstream research in aeronautics, and  innovation in small to mid-size businesses. The national  consultation should make it possible to better define this  research policy, which will be submitted to the Parliament  during its spring session.    The working group, consisting of 26 members and headed by  Robert Dautray, the high commissioner to atomic energy, just  submitted its first conclusions. Their observations contain no  real surprises: Basic research is good enough, but basic  technological research remains inadequate; as for industrial  research, not enough of it is financed by the businesses  themselves, it is excessively concentrated by sectors, and small  to mid-size industries are not adequately represented.    As a result, in years to come the ministry should focus a  greater proportion of its efforts on basic technological  research. "To ensure that it remains competitive, a country like  ours needs first of all a strong technological research and  efficient procedures to transfer the knowledge acquired to  industrial applied research," the working group insisted.  Unfortunately, engineering sciences have been "relatively  neglected in France, in particular those involving expertise in  complex systems and objects."    Another failure of French research is the relative  inadequacy  of "traditional" sectors such as building and construction,  chemicals, transportation, and the agrifood business, although  these sectors account for much of the economy and employment. A  special effort was made in the 1994 budget in favor of the  agrifood business, which doubled in recent years but  nevertheless invested on the average only 0.35 percent of its  sales in research, although it must integrate a whole series of  new technologies (clean plants, high-pressure sterilization,  ionization, etc.). The three-year program called "Tomorrow's  Food," which is totally in line with the "Food for the Year  2000" program, will get Fr40 million, "i.e. 50 percent more than  the annual average for `Food for the Year 2000'," people at the  ministry pointed out.    Immediate measures were also taken to support innovation in  small to mid-size businesses: The ANVAR [National Agency for the  Implementation of Research] budget will be 16 percent higher in  1994, reaching Fr1 billion. Actually, small to mid-size  businesses are underrepresented in French research; they  contribute only 16 percent of the national effort. But their  involvement in research is not just a matter of money.  Businesses must also have men capable of taking over knowledge  and translating it into innovations. In this respect, the  minister decided to double the credits allocated to Cortechs  (agreements to train senior technicians through research) and he  intends to promote Cifres (industrial research-training  agreements), two procedures that will enable businesses to hire  researchers and technicians for limited periods.  <H5>  A Maze of Procedures and Parties Involved </H5>   Regional centers for innovation and industrial transfer  (CRITTs), industrial relation committees (Crins) of the CNRS  [National Center for Scientific Research], industrial technical  centers: There is no lack of structures to help businesses in  their innovation efforts. Should more be created? Certainly not,  people at the ministry answered. It is already hard enough for  businesses, especially the smaller ones, to find their way  through the maze of parties and procedures involved. Obviously,  some clarification is needed, and the ministry will undertake a  study of the matter during 1994. The region might provide a  rather suitable frame to improve the structure of the scientific  and technical environment of businesses: "In each region, we  must cause the emergence of a network of laboratories working  with overall cohesion," the minister's staff explained.    Still in order to help businesses, the working group  recommended to eliminate the restriction introduced in 1992 on  the research tax credit, a measure that has the manufacturers'  unanimous approval.    The working group also emphasized the need to strengthen the  ties between public and private research, something on which  everybody agrees. Joint laboratories represent interesting  experiments, the group noted. What is required is to evaluate  these experiments, put and end to those that are no longer  useful, and create new laboratories with well-defined stakes and  for predetermined probable durations. "Businesses that wish to  do so should be able to collaborate with public research at high  level," Francois Fillon stated for his part, quoting the example  of the Bioavenir program, which associates Rhone-Poulenc and  several university and CNRS laboratories. Certainly, the time  when these two worlds used to distrust each other seems to be  gone for good.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Spring ploughing is in  full swing in the Yonbaek plain.    The cooperative farms in the plain have tilled vast tracts  of  paddy and non-paddy fields in a few days by raising the  operation rate of the tractors.    The plain, known as a granary on the West Coast, covers  broad  areas of Chongdan, Yonan and Paechon counties, South Hwanghae  Province, the central western part of Korea.    In the preliberation days the peasants there toiled with  dull  hoes and wooden ploughs.    The comprehensive mechanization of agriculture, which began  making a rapid development after the publication of the  socialist rural theses in February 1964, has now reached the  stage of completion. In Paechon County the number of the  tractors increased 3.1 times, lorries 7.4 times, rice harvestors  10 times and weeding machines 15 times over the past twenty  years with the constant supply of modern farm machines. The  agricultural working people of the plain do nearly all  categories of farm work ranging from ploughing to rice seedling  plucking, rice transplanting, weeding, manuring and harvesting  with machines.    Each cooperative farm in the plain has nearly one hundred  technicians and experts.    Of late the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent 500  tractors and some 250 lorries to the cooperative farms in the  plain so as to further consolidate the material and technical  foundations of agriculture.    The rural villages of plain have turned into modern  socialist  rural communities good to work and live in; they hold a big  share in the nation's grain production.    Last year tens of thousands of more tons of grain was  produced than in the previous year in the plain.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: The five-year curse is lifted UNIT and investment trusts have finally rid themselves of the burden imposed by the October 1987 crash on their five-year performance figures. The effect is dramatic. Over the five years to October 1, the average unit trust fell by 4.8 per cent and the average investment trust rose by a measly 0.02 per cent, according to Micropal. But during the five years to November 1, the average unit trust rose by 40.1 per cent, while the average investment trust holding grew by 37.6 per cent. The change is good news for unit trust managers trying to market their funds; they have to produce five-year performance figures in their promotional literature. But even after the shift, an investor might well have done better in a building society. Someone who deposited Pounds 5,000 in Halifax's 90-day Xtra account would have earned, after basic rate tax, 50.5 per cent over the same period. Performance figures may be meaningless. Few private investors will have been bold enough to buy unit or investment trusts at the start of November 1987, when the financial system seemed to be in chaos. The peak period for unit trust sales will have been in the summer of 1987 - before the crash. It seems even less likely that many investors will have chosen the best performing unit trust over five years, Gartmore Hong Kong. In November 1987, the reputation of the Hong Kong stock exchange had been severely dented by the closure of the market in the wake of the crash. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see which areas investors should have favoured five years ago. The tables show the best and the worst sectors over the period. The best returns were offered overseas - in the Far East, North American and Europe. The worst returns were achieved by one of 1987's fashionable sectors - UK smaller companies. In the investment trust sector, it is encouraging to see the big general trusts showing good figures. Over five years, the average international general trust rose 79.1 per cent (mid-price basis with income reinvested). Law Debenture is top of the sector over three, five and 10 years; Foreign &amp; Colonial, the biggest trust, is fourth (out of 18) in the sector over five years, with a gain of 103.6 per cent. Perhaps the most startling contrast is in the venture capital sector, where Pounds 100 invested in Candover has grown into Pounds 281.30 over the last five years; the same sum invested in Sumit has shrunk to Pounds 22.37. But how much attention should investors pay to performance figures? It is difficult to predict which fund manager will have the magic touch. That makes the arguments in favour of tracker funds, which aim to match the performance of a given stock market index, all the more compelling. One final statistic adds weight to this argument. The Gartmore UK Index, which tracks the FT All-Share, has no initial charge and a 0.5 per cent annual fee, is third out of 86 funds over three years.  ----------------------------------------  BEST UNIT TRUST SECTORS OVER FIVE YEARS  ---------------------------------------- Sector                       % growth Far East exc Jap                160.3 North America                    93.3 Far East inc Jap                 52.5 Europe                           49.8 Int Balanced                     47.5  ---------------------------------------- WORST UNIT TRUST SECTORS OVER FIVE YEARS  ---------------------------------------- Sector                       % change UK Small Cos                    -17.0 Comm &amp; Energy                    -2.9 Fin &amp; Prop                       -1.1 Convertibles                      0.7 Japan                             4.8  ----------------------------------------</p>

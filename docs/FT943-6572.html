			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Immigrants fall victim to Greek-Albanian tensions: James Whittington watches thousands of illegal workers, rounded up in Athens and bused to the frontier, herded back over the mountains at Kakavia At 5.30am, 12 buses wound their way up a narrow mountain pass in northwest Greece to a small border post on the frontier with Albania on the last leg of a six-hour journey from Athens. The early morning peace was shattered as nearly 1,000 tired and confused Albanians were led by policemen from the buses to a padlocked border gate. Watched over by the Greek army, they spilled through the six-foot opening and past a sleepy Albanian guard. By the end of the day, over a thousand more had made the crossing, bringing the number of Albanians expelled by Greece as illegal immigrants since August 15 to more than 20,000. Most of the deportees have been rounded up in what is becoming one of the biggest purges of Albanian immigrants by the Greek authorities in modern times. It comes against a background of deteriorating relations between the two states which threatens to further destabilise the southern Balkans. The deportees are mainly young men who, like hundreds of thousands of others, had sought employment as cheap labour in Greece. Nearly all entered the country illegally, trekking for days across the mountains that divide the two countries. With Albania's economy struggling to cast off the shackles of the former Communist regime, the money they send home has made an important contribution to the country's balance of payments. Last year, remittances from Albanians living abroad were around Dollars 330m, compared to an estimated Dollars 125m in visible exports. Now they are being sent back, carrying few personal possessions and complaining that furniture, rent deposits and bank savings had all been left behind. Landlords and employers in Greece have been asked to hand over all Albanian immigrants for screening, and many more are expected to be deported. Before he was picked up by the police, 29-year-old Kostmas had been living in Athens for four years and was soon to receive official residency papers. He worked as a labourer in a magazine depot and said he had been held in a detention camp for three days before being expelled. 'I knew that the police were searching for us but I thought I'd get away. This has ruined me. I have no job, no money and nowhere to go. All I can do is wait for the present problems to die down and then return to Greece,' he said before hitch-hiking to Tirana, the Albanian capital. Normally, the Greek authorities send only a hundred or so illegal immigrants back to Albania every week. But since the opening of a court case in Tirana in which five members from the country's Greek minority are being tried on charges of possession of weapons and espionage, the numbers have increased dramatically. The trial has ignited long-running tensions between the two countries and revived claims by Tirana that Greece has territorial designs on south Albania, and by Athens that Albania is persecuting its Greek minority. Greece has complained that the court case is a set-up and, besides the mass deportations, has blocked European Union aid to Albania worth Ecu35m (Pounds 28m) in an attempt to have the trial stopped. It has also rejected Tirana's offer of talks and threatened to step-up its military presence in the area until the government's treatment of the minority improves. No-one knows the size of Albania's Greek minority. The Albanians claim there are about 90,000, out of a population of 3.4m; the Greeks say there are up to 300,000. Most live in the south in an area which Greece still calls North Epirus. They are Greek in all but nationality, speaking Greek rather than Albanian and practising Greek Orthodoxy rather than Islam, which is the country's dominant faith. Under the Communist regime which collapsed between 1990 and 1991, the minority was repressed like the rest of the population. Religion was banned in 1967 and social progress was made only through the organs of the Communist party. Now, under a democratically elected government, they are demanding their own secondary schools and university education in Greek along with full representation in the police, military and civil service. The Omonia political movement, which promotes their rights as a minority with funding from Greece, accuses the governing Democratic party of discrimination. Not only have the Albanian authorities turned down all requests for new Greek schools, but they have forbidden the use of Greek in church services. The Athens government has jumped on this and warned it was preparing measures to protect the minority. 'Greece is ready to defend all its interests and at the same time protect, with all its means, the Greeks in Albania,' Mr Andreas Papandreou, the prime minister, said last week. Quite how far Greece is willing to go to back this statement up is unknown. Today in Tirana, the prosecution is due to sum up its case against the five men, all of them members of Omonia. It is expected to accuse them of encouraging separatist designs for the Greek minority, possession of weapons, and receiving support and funds from the Greek intelligence services. A guilty verdict is expected at the end of the week. In the meantime, bus loads of Albanians continue to arrive at border posts and nationalist tensions in the region continue to grow.</p>

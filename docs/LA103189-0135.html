			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Sales tax -- Because of a typographical error, a Times Poll story Monday  reported the wrong amount of temporary sales tax increase that Californians, on  the average, would accept to pay for earthquake repairs and relief. The correct  amount is 1 1/2 cents on the dollar, not 1 cent as the story stated.  </P></p>

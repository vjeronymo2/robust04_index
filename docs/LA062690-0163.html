			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOVIETS HAVING BILL PROBLEMS, ASK NEW CREDIT  </P> <P> A Foreign Ministry spokesman today acknowledged that the Soviet Union is having  trouble paying $2 billion in foreign bills but asked for more Western credits  to help move toward a market economy.  </P> <P> "We're experiencing some commercial difficulties now," the spokesman, Gennady  I. Gerasimov, told a news briefing.  </P> <P> "Our perfectly immaculate record on the external market of always paying our  debts is now under question."  </P> <P> Gerasimov quoted the Soviet State Bank president, Viktor Gerashchenko, as  saying the Soviet Union has a current accounts deficit, the difference between  cash on hand and outstanding bills, of $2 billion.  </P> <P> He said this was due to several factors, including the disruption involved in  the transition from central planning to a market economy.  </P> <P> Despite its current difficulties paying its bills, Gerasimov said the Soviet  Union needs more Western economic credits like the $3.1-billion West German  bank credit backed by the Bonn government this week.  </P> <P> "If we have credits, it will be easier for us to have economic reform," he  said.  </P> <P> European Community leaders meeting in Dublin this week agreed to help the  ailing Soviet economy but first ordered aides to consult with the Kremlin about  proposals for both short-term loans and long-term assistance.  </P> <P> The leaders fended off a request by France and West Germany to adopt an  immediate $15-billion aid package.  </P> <P> Gerasimov said the Soviet Union's economic potential should be sufficient  collateral guaranteeing repayment of large-scale economic credits.  </P></p>

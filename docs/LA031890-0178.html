			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> HAIL ATLANTIS MIGHT GET DERBY SHOT  </P> <P> Running a filly in the Santa Anita Derby and coming back a month later in the  Kentucky Derby worked once for Wayne Lukas, so will he try it again?  </P> <P> Hail Atlantis' seven-length victory in the $212,800 Santa Anita Oaks Saturday  had Lukas thinking about another Winning Colors parlay.  </P> <P> "I might have to take a hard look at supplementing her to the Santa Anita  Derby," Lukas said. Such a move would cost $20,000, which would be due three  days before the April 7 race.  </P> <P> "I'm definitely going to call Tom Meeker (Churchill Downs president) and put in  her name (for the Triple Crown series for a $3,000 fee). She's on her way to  the Kentucky Oaks, but I would like to be sitting there (the) Friday (before  the Derby) with the option."  </P> <P> To mention any derby or the Kentucky Oaks in connection with Hail Atlantis  would have been ludicrous last year.  </P> <P> She was beaten 21 lengths in her debut in July at Hollywood Park. A couple of  weeks later, she finished fifth, 20 1/4 lengths behind. Stretching out 15 days  later, she showed brief speed, then was eased when she bled.  </P> <P> Since returning Jan. 6, the 3-year-old Seattle Slew filly hasn't been worse  than second in five starts.  </P> <P> Making her stakes debut in the Grade I Oaks, Hail Atlantis easily took the lead  with a :22 4/5 first quarter, then simply extended it under Gary Stevens. She  was timed in 1:43 flat for 1 1/16 miles.  </P> <P> Her stablemate, Bright Candles was second, 1 1/2 lengths in front of 13-10  favorite Fit To Scout, who never fired after her much-troubled trip in the Las  Virgenes three weeks earlier. She was a neck better than Cheval Volant, whose  stakes-winning streak ended at three.  </P> <P> In winning for the third time in eight career appearances, Hail Atlantis  provided Lukas with his third consecutive victory in the Santa Anita Oaks and  Stevens with his fourth in a row.  </P> <P> "What a stride this filly's got," said Stevens, whose other triumphs came  aboard Timely Assertion, Winning Colors and Imaginary Lady. "She reminds me a  lot of (Kentucky Derby winner) Winning Colors. She has the same kind of action.  </P> <P> "She was just loping out there. She's a long-skipping thing, rates herself and  still reserves something for the stretch. I've noticed dramatic improvement in  each of her last four races.  </P> <P> "She knows where the quarter-pole is. When she drops her right lead, she goes  to running."  </P> <P> Stylish King's 1990 debut was over before it really started.  </P> <P> The highly-regarded son of Roberto, who had been training superbly for his  first race as a 3-year-old, was eliminated at the start. He finished sixth at  7-10 odds.  </P> <P> On the sidelines since he finished fourth at 4-5 in the Hollywood Prevue Dec. 6  at Hollywood Park, Stylish King veered out at the break, bumped solidly with  Blue Gum, and that was basically it for those two in a race won by 11-1 shot  Hawaiian Pass.  </P> <P> "The only thing I could see was that his left hind leg wasn't set under him,"  Eddie Delahoussaye said. "He felt fine to me because his front legs were  straight. When he broke, he lost that foot and fell to his right."  </P> <P> Delahoussaye added that Stylish King, who was considered a Santa Anita Derby  possibility, seemed fine coming back afterward.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Kent Desormeaux, who has made his way into the top 10 locally, won't be at  Santa Anita two days next week. He will be in Baltimore Wednesday for a hearing  regarding a disputed purse and, on Sunday, will ride Passing Ships in a race in  Saudi Arabia. . . . Prepping for the San Bernardino Handicap April 1, Santa  Anita Handicap winner Ruhlmann worked five furlongs in :58 4/5 Saturday  morning. Olympic Prospect, who disappointed when heavily favored in the Phoenix  Gold Cup, went the same distance in 1:00 2/5. He is scheduled to return in the  Potrero Grande Handicap April 4.  </P></p>

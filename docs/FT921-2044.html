			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Tsongas quits presidential race MR PAUL TSONGAS yesterday ended his attempt to become the US Democratic party's presidential nominee. The withdrawal of the former senator from Massachusetts means that both the Democratic and Republican fields have been reduced to a clear front runner and a dissident outsider, with no other contender apparently in sight. Mr Tsongas, the first in either party formally to declare a candidacy nearly a year ago, gave up because he was beaten in recent primary contests, mostly by Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and because political money is not attracted to losers. Defeats in Michigan and Illinois on Tuesday were the writing on the wall and Mr Tsongas's dog-tired interviews after those primaries showed he knew it. He declined to endorse either of the remaining Democratic contenders, Mr Clinton or Mr Jerry Brown, the former governor of California, but said Mr Clinton was 'certainly in the driver's seat'. Mr Tsongas said he did not want to stay in the Democratic race just as a 'spoiler'. Logically, Mr Clinton should be the principal beneficiary of Mr Tsongas's withdrawal, because the policy gap between them is much narrower than that between Mr Tsongas and Mr Brown. This should show up in next week's Connecticut primary, where Mr Tsongas, from a neighbouring state, might have done well. But Mr Tsongas has repeatedly said he would not be Mr Clinton's running mate because they disagree profoundly on key aspects of economic policy, particularly Mr Clinton's advocacy of a middle-class tax cut. Recent exchanges between the two have also been bitter. There may not, therefore, be an instant rush of support to Mr Clinton. Mr Tsongas leaves the contest with honour, having made some cogent points, especially on economic policy. He also claims that he showed the way to other Democrats. Ignoring the obvious handicap of being another Greek from Massachusetts, like 1988 presidential contender Mr Michael Dukakis, he took on the president when Mr Bush, in the afterglow of the Gulf war, appeared unassailable. Now Mr Bush's rating is more like 40 per cent and his re-election far from assured. Mr Tsongas stood on the right of the party. Although a liberal on social issues, he did not promise tax cuts for the individual, but advocated tax breaks for investment in manufacturing, eschewed protectionism, and generally called for sacrifices in the cause of economic revitalisation. His appeal, demonstrated not only in his native New England but in such states as Maryland and Delaware, was mostly to more affluent Democrats, just the sort of constituency that deserted the party in the last three elections. This proved more effective than conventional campaigns by Senators Tom Harkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska - who sought organised labour's backing - but was no match for Mr Clinton's broad-based approach and infinitely superior organisation.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Today the Hungarian National Assembly's Foreign  Affairs Committee heard Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's  report on his visit in Belgrade on 27 January. He confirmed  once again that Hungary is not going to initiate the lifting of  the UN embargo. Peter Gyuricza reports from the Committee's  meeting.    [Gyuricza] Events of the following months will prove whether  changes in Belgrade politics -- which also made possible Foreign  Minister Jeszenszky's visit -- have indeed taken place. The  foreign minister said that these changes include the diminishing  of psychological pressure on ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina,  reducing extremist manifestations, easing the tone of the  Belgrade press, and decreasing the frequency of call-ups.    Geza Jeszenszky favorably viewed the fact that negotiations  are under way between the Democratic Community of Hungarians in  Vojvodina and the Serbian Government with regard to autonomy and  its institutions. Geza Jeszenszky said that Hungary will not  initiate lifting the UN Security Council embargo. At the same  time, however, as a sovereign state guided by its national  interests, it may believe that the time has come to hold talks  about this with its partners and allies, especially since no way  out can be seen. [passage omitted] Hungary is observing the UN  Security Council resolution, stressed Geza Jeszenszky. [passage  omitted]</p>

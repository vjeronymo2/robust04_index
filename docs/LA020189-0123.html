			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE REJECTS UNWED COUPLE'S HOUSING BID  </P> <P> An unwed couple expecting their third child "are creating children for the  welfare rolls," a federal judge said in blocking their request to overturn an  agency's ban on housing unmarried couples.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Ronald R. Lagueux also suggested that Dana Dagnese leave  the family so that Susan Arsenau and the children could meet the housing  authority's regulation, said Steven Brown of the American Civil Liberties  Union's Rhode Island chapter.  </P> <P> The couple, who have lived together six years, filed a federal lawsuit two  weeks ago saying the authority's decision to deny them emergency housing  violated their rights to "freedom of association, family privacy and equal  protection of laws." The couple were seeking a preliminary injunction Tuesday.  No trial date has been set.  </P> <P> "Here is a couple in an illicit relationship, who are creating children for the  welfare rolls, while others who qualify for housing are shunted aside," the  judge said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Wouldn't the court look silly asking the authority to foster these people and  allow them to continue an illegal relationship?"  </P> <P> Dagnese, who has been separated from his wife for almost a decade, is awaiting  completion of his divorce, Brown said. He and Arsenau have a 3-year-old  daughter and a year-old son and are expecting a child in March.  </P></p>

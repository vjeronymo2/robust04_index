			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BRODERICK ATTORNEY VOWS TO CHALLENGE ALL 69 JUDGES IN COUNTY  </P> <P> A motion to disqualify the entire Superior Court bench from presiding over the  murder trial of Elisabeth Anne (Betty) Broderick was denied Wednesday,  prompting her lawyer and the prosecutor to predict that the proceedings may be  delayed.  </P> <P> Jack M. Earley, Broderick's attorney, had contended that no San Diego judge  could appear unbiased in his client's murder trial because one of the victims,  her ex-husband, was a prominent malpractice attorney and part of San Diego's  "close-knit" legal community. But San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus  Rodriguez ruled that he had no jurisdiction to disqualify the bench and that  there were no legal grounds to do so.  </P> <P> Broderick, 42, is accused of murdering ex-husband Daniel T. Broderick III, 44,  and his wife, Linda Kolkena Broderick, 28, early on the morning of Nov. 5. She  has pleaded not guilty, and her trial has been set for July 16.  </P> <P> But Earley said Rodriguez's ruling, which he plans to appeal in the 4th  District Court of Appeals, might push that date back. Earley said that, if  necessary, he is prepared to challenge the 69 Superior Court judges one by one.  </P> <P> "I'm assuming that what the judge was saying was that, if there's 50 judges, we  should have 50 hearings," he said. "Effectively, by their ruling, it's going to  be at least a year and a half before we even get through the challenges. . . .  They're saying that you can't do it once, even though that makes sense  economically. They're saying I should go one judge at a time."  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Kerry Wells said: "If they want to drag it out, this is a  good way to do it, by challenging judge after judge. Cases like this sometimes  do take a long time to get to trial. Realistically, it could be a long time."  </P> <P> In fact, Earley's challenges would only last as long as he continued to win.  Were he to challenge an individual San Diego County judge, that judge would be  allowed to respond in writing and another judge would preside over a hearing to  determine if the challenged judge was impartial. If the presiding judge ruled  in Earley's favor, the case would be transferred to another San Diego judge and  Earley would be free to challenge him, starting the process all over again.  </P> <P> If the presiding judge ruled against Earley, however, the original judge would  be allowed to hear the case. Then, Earley said, he would file a writ of appeal  to the 4th District Court of Appeals. And he could also seek a change of venue  motion.  </P> <P> Wells said she is eager to get on with the case.  </P> <P> "Ultimately, we have to have a judge hear this case," she said. "And my  personal opinion is there are fair judges in San Diego County and there are  fair judges every place else in the state, and I don't particularly care where  we go. As long as both sides get in front of a fair judge."  </P> <P> In a related matter, the 4th District Court has ruled that the appellate record  of Betty and Daniel Broderick's divorce will be sealed, as were the original  divorce records.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHINA UPHEAVAL LIKELY TO FORCE MAJOR CHANGES ;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS  </P> <P> The crisis now engulfing China has reached such critical proportions that even  if the country's aging leaders manage to crush the democracy demonstrations and  sweep student protesters from the streets, the future course of the world's  most populous nation has almost certainly been changed.  </P> <P> The forces that have come to the surface over the past week run so deep that,  if history is any guide, the Chinese regime will not be able to keep them  suppressed forever.  </P> <P> "It certainly is an upheaval of historic dimensions, and I think it will  eventually change the dynamics of politics in China," Prof. Kenneth Lieberthal,  director of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of Michigan, said  Sunday.  </P> <P> Over the past four decades, ruling leaders of the Chinese regime have several  times cut off student protests or other demonstrations -- only to find in later  months or years that the protests had reemerged even stronger and that leaders  of the crackdown were themselves swept away.  </P> <P> And, with the possible exception of a full-scale revolt in Tibet in 1959, none  of these previous outbursts of protest were nearly so large or pervasive as the  outpouring of demands for democracy that have swept the country over the past  week.  </P> <P> Although students have taken the lead in the massive democracy demonstrations,  experts agree that they are supported by virtually every segment of the Chinese  population and throughout nearly all regions of the nation.  </P> <P> The most dramatic example of a crackdown that proved unsuccessful in the long  run was in April, 1976, five months before the death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung.  As many as 100,000 people turned out in Tian An Men Square to protest what they  felt was the Chinese leadership's refusal to give proper respect and honors to  the memory of former Premier Chou En-lai, who had died earlier that year.  </P> <P> Then, as now, the fervor of the protesters was mingled with softer emotions  that seem to characterize such confrontations in China -- including surprising  concern among the demonstrators for the forces arrayed against them. Such  sentiments stand in sharp contrast with the harsh spirit of comparable protests  in many other countries, most notably neighboring South Korea.  </P> <P> In the spring of 1976, the regime was controlled largely by radical leaders  such as Mao's wife, Jiang Qing. The leadership called security forces into  Beijing to clear the square and quell the protests. By all accounts, there was  considerable violence and, according to the initial estimates of security  officials, more than 100 deaths.  </P> <P> The brutal suppression of that protest, while initially successful, eventually  helped lead to the downfall of some of the Chinese leaders involved in calling  out the security forces. A month after Mao died, his wife and her allies --  known as the Gang of Four -- were arrested.  </P> <P> The more moderate leaders who rose to power after Mao's death overturned the  Chinese Communist Party's judgment that the 1976 protests had been  counterrevolutionary and instead concluded that they had been "completely  revolutionary."  </P> <P> "If Chairman Mao had been in good health, if he had been capable of making up  his own mind, he would not have made such decisions," declared a new Chinese  leader nearly three years after the suppression of the Tian An Men  demonstrations.  </P> <P> Ironically, that new Chinese leader was Deng Xiaoping, the same man who now, as  chairman of the Communist Party's Central Military Commission, has become a  symbol of resistance to political change and the target of student protests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Democracy Wall Protests  </P> <P> In late 1978 and early 1979, a new series of demonstrations swept Beijing.  Hundreds and sometimes thousands of young people began gathering at a site  known as Democracy Wall, where wallposters called for human rights and  democracy in China.  </P> <P> Deng, then in the process of consolidating his control over the Chinese  Communist Party, at first voiced some support for the Democracy Wall protests.  But a few months later, he led a crackdown. The demonstrations were stopped,  leaders were arrested and the right to put up wallposters was eliminated from  the Chinese constitution.  </P> <P> Wei Jingsheng, the leader of that Democracy Wall movement, was tried as a  counterrevolutionary for allegedly giving state secrets to a foreign  journalist. He remains in jail, but the people in the streets today --  numbering in the hundreds of thousands -- are his political heirs.  </P> <P> Deng's willingness to suppress the Democracy Wall campaign was reminiscent of  his successful efforts two decades earlier, with Mao, to crack down on  intellectual freedom in China.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Hundred Flowers' Movement  </P> <P> In 1956, when Mao was Communist Party chairman and Deng was the party's general  secretary, the party encouraged intellectuals to voice their opinions. "Let a  hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," said Mao,  quoting an old Confucian aphorism.  </P> <P> The following year, astounded by the vehemence of the intellectuals' criticism  of the Communist Party that the invitation had triggered, Mao and Deng cracked  down. About 300,000 people were purged from the party, and thousands of  intellectuals were jailed or exiled to the countryside.  </P> <P> More recently, Deng and the Chinese regime have confronted a recurring series  of student demonstrations and have tried to cut them off. But the efforts have  proved unsuccessful over the long run.  </P> <P> The current wave of student demonstrations dates to December, 1984. At first,  the protests were pitifully small, particularly when compared to the mass  outpourings of the past week.  </P> <P> At Beijing University, the nation's most prestigious school, several hundred  students put up wallposters and marched at night to protest overcrowded  conditions on campus. At another nearby university, students demonstrated to  complain of poor food.  </P> <P> The regime paid little attention until the following fall, when the student  protests spread to Tian An Men Square and took on larger political overtones.  Nearly a thousand students outside the Great Hall of the People denounced  Japan's "economic invasion" of China and corruption within the party. Some of  these demonstrators also called for democracy.  </P> <P> This time, the Chinese leadership acted. The regime warned students that it  would use tough measures against anyone who took part in another planned  demonstration. After the protest movement subsided, a handful of student  leaders vanished from campuses.  </P> <P> Within a year, however, Chinese students were back in the streets, this time in  much greater force and focusing more directly on the cause of democracy. In  December, 1986, protesters at a small university in Hefei, encouraged by a  school administrator named Fang Lizhi, took to the streets to protest efforts  by party officials to exclude non-approved candidates from an election.  </P> <P> This time, the protests for democracy spread. In Shanghai, tens of thousands of  students took to the streets. In Beijing, students staged a midnight march to  Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> The crackdown began in January, 1987, when the Chinese Communist Party launched  a campaign against "bourgeois liberalization." Communist Party General  Secretary Hu Yaobang and his propaganda chief were ousted from their jobs, and  three leading intellectuals, including Fang Lizhi, were expelled from the  Communist Party.  </P> <P> For a time, the crackdown worked. But in April, triggered by the death of Hu,  students took to the streets again, this time in far larger numbers and with  the support of workers and others in China.  </P></p>

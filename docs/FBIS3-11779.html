			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Jorge Rogabruna, vice director of hygiene and  epidemiology in Havana City Province, said that the law that  prohibits the rearing of pigs in the central municipalities of  the capital and in apartment buildings and city neighborhoods  remains valid. He stated that in Centro Habana, Habana Vieja,  Cerro, Plaza de la Revolucion, Playa, and Diez de Octubre the  rearing of those animals is prohibited and that it is not  authorized in urban localities of other municipalities in Havana  City with large concentrations of people. Rogabruna said that  there are control mechanisms at the zone and municipal levels  through the people's councils which send commissions to visit  the owners of the animals and warn them of the infraction they  commit by keeping those animals.</p>

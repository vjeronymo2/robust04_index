			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PARK SUPPORTERS ROOT FOR REMAP;  </P> <P> MOUNTAINS: THE SANTA MONICAS WOULD END UP IN SUPERVISOR ED EDELMAN'S DISTRICT.  HE IS CONSIDERED MORE SYMPATHETIC TO THE CONSERVATION CAUSE.  </P> <P> Park advocates involved in efforts to preserve the Santa Monica Mountains are  keeping their fingers crossed in hopes that a court-ordered redrawing of Los  Angeles County supervisorial districts will survive an appeal by the county.  </P> <P> Conservationists believe the boundary realignment, intended to create a Latino  majority district, will also help their cause by putting the mountains in a  single district to be served by Supervisor Ed Edelman. They consider Edelman  more attuned to environmental concerns than the area's current representatives,  Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana, who have traditionally sided with developers.  </P> <P> "I think it augurs well," said one conservationist, who would not allow herself  to be quoted by name. "I kneel by the side of my bed each night and pray that  that map goes through."  </P> <P> Paul Tryon, executive officer for the Los Angeles/Ventura region of the  Building Industry Assn. of Southern California, acknowledged that the  redistricting "has a potential of boding less favorably for us as an industry"  in the Santa Monica Mountains. But Tryon said the association will go on  working "with the Board of Supervisors . . . regardless of how their boundary  lines may be drawn."  </P> <P> The redistricting map drawn by civil rights groups was approved Aug. 3 by U.S.  District Judge David V. Kenyon. He ruled in June that the supervisors had  intentionally discriminated against Latinos by drawing the existing district  boundaries so as to dilute their voting strength. The county appealed that  ruling and last Thursday got the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to stay  implemention of the reapportionment plan, pending a hearing scheduled for next  Thursday.  </P> <P> The Santa Monicas currently are split into three districts. Edelman's district  includes the eastern end of the mountains from Griffith Park to the San Diego  Freeway, but Dana and Antonovich represent the less-developed western areas  where most development battles are being fought. Dana's current district  includes the Malibu coast and the Santa Monicas' southern slopes, and  Antonovich's includes the oak-studded valleys and hills of Agoura.  </P> <P> Kenyon's order would push Edelman's 3rd Supervisorial District westward through  the mountains to the Ventura County line. Antonovich would also yield to  Edelman much of his current base in the San Fernando Valley, including portions  of the Simi hills.  </P> <P> Dana and Antonovich, part of the Board of Supervisors' conservative majority,  have received lavish support from real estate interests, and have usually sided  with them in development battles.  </P> <P> Edelman, while no "flaming environmentalist," in the words of one activist, has  been more receptive to environmental concerns. In two recent cases, he cast the  only dissenting votes on controversial projects.  </P> <P> "Edelman has voted . . . our way more than any other supervisor," said David  Brown, vice president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation and chairman of  the Sierra Club's Santa Monica Mountains task force. "He's tended to be the one  supervisor who held out for reasonable planning," Brown said.  </P> <P> Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains  Conservancy, a state agency that acquires parkland in the mountains, said  Edelman would be likely to take "a much more careful look at the cumulative  impact" of development than Antonovich and Dana.  </P> <P> The realignment "will make a difference for preservation of the mountains,"  said Barbara Fine, vice president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon  Assns., adding that she was not speaking on behalf of that organization.  </P> <P> Each of the five supervisors has a single vote, and redistricting would not  change that. However, supervisors typically vote the wishes of the colleague in  whose district a project is located.  </P> <P> Edelman, who was reelected in June to a four-year term, cannot be counted on  "as a knee-jerk vote for anything," his press deputy Joel Bellman said.  </P> <P> "He hasn't been adamantly, inflexibly anti-development," said Bellman, "but I  think it's fair to say he's been one of the more sensitive board members" to  environmental and homeowner concerns.  </P> <P> Edelman alone has escaped the ire of critics who have accused the supervisors  of undermining efforts to acquire lands needed to complete the Santa Monica  Mountains National Recreation Area. The mountain park is struggling against  tight budgets and soaring land prices. Critics, including some members of  Congress, have accused the supervisors of inflating land prices by agreeing to  "upzone" mountain property to allow more intensive development than county  plans provide. The supervisors have said they are balancing the needs of the  park with the rights of property owners to develop their land.  </P> <P> A recent controversy involved the Paramount Ranch project, a proposed luxury  housing development on an Agoura site that the government hoped to buy for the  recreation area. The tract was zoned for 103 homes and park supporters urged  supervisors to hold the line there. This, they said, would reduce the project's  impact on adjacent federal land and give the government a better chance to  acquire it. With Edelman dissenting, the supervisors voted, 3 to 1, last year  to approve construction of 150 homes.  </P> <P> In another case last December, Edelman dissented from the board's 4-1 approval  of a controversial golf course, country club and housing development in Corral  Canyon in Malibu. Bob Hope, owner of the tract, has since canceled the project  as part of an effort to win support for his Jordan Ranch development in eastern  Ventura County.  </P></p>

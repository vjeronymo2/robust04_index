			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: OAT BRAN PRODUCTS PROVE POPULAR  </P> <P> A woman at a local bakery recently sauntered up to the counter to ask the clerk  if the outlet's brand of oat bran muffins could reduce her cholesterol.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid I really don't know," the clerk responded. "Our bakery items are  already prepared when we get them. We just bake the dough."  </P> <P> The customer seemed a bit confused, since the young woman behind the  magnificent display of baked goods had failed to answer her question.  Nonetheless, the customer headed for the bin of oat bran muffins.  </P> <P> To her dismay, the bin was empty -- another example of consumer demand for a  product with a perceived health effect. And bakeries aren't the only retailers  finding it hard to keep oat bran muffins on the shelf.  </P> <P> After being bombarded by weekend shoppers, a Los Angeles membership warehouse  chain, where consumers can buy foods and other items at reduced prices, had  trouble offering Monday morning shoppers any of their usually large supply of  oat bran muffins, even though the rest of the warehouse items had been  completely restocked after the busy two-day spree.  </P> <P> It appears that Angelenos are very eager to buy food items that contain oat  bran.  </P> <P> Manufacturers have been quick to respond to that consumer demand. They tout oat  bran as an ingredient in everything from gourmet cold breakfast cereals to  granola-type snack bars. Gourmet cookie makers are even adding bran cookies to  their product lines.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increased Consumer Interest  </P> <P> Health experts claim -- and opinion polls indicate -- a growing interest by  consumers in reducing their blood cholesterol to acceptable levels. But often  the amount of oat bran in commercial products -- when compared to that given to  participants in the study that recognized the cholesterol-lowering effects of  the fiber -- produces insignificant health benefits.  </P> <P> It is important to keep in mind that the study group consumed two ounces of oat  bran each day, which represents about two-thirds of a cup of the insoluble  fiber. And they followed a low-fat diet that derived only 30% of its calories  from fat.  </P> <P> This can easily be translated into a one-ounce serving of hot oat bran cereal,  oatmeal or cold oat cereal in the morning, oat bran or oatmeal bread with  sandwiches for lunch, oat bran muffins as an afternoon snack and an oatmeal  cookie for dessert. Spoon a tablespoon or two of oat bran into savory dishes or  into crust mixtures for oven-baked chicken. Substituting oats for up to  one-third of the flour called for in some recipes is another option.  </P> <P> Maintaining a low-fat diet regimen is also vital. Use nonfat milk, lean meat  and egg whites instead of whole eggs in recipes. Remove the skin from chicken  before cooking and coat the chicken with an oat bran crumb mixture and bake  instead of frying.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OAT BRAN LOAF  </P> <P> 2 cups water  </P> <P> 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons oat bran  </P> <P> 2 packages dry yeast  </P> <P> 1/4 cup honey  </P> <P> 1/4 cup oil  </P> <P> 1 1/2 teaspoons salt  </P> <P> 4 1/2 to 5 cups flour  </P> <P> Cinnamon Date Filling, optional  </P> <P> 1 egg white  </P> <P> Bring 1 1/2 cups water to boil.

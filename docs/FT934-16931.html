			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / The Week Ahead: US employment figures likely to encourage hopes of an upturn - Economics WORRIES about the strength of the US economy may be allayed later this week by jobs data which are expected to indicate a pick-up in economic demand during September. The financial markets expect a 155,000 rise in non-farm payrolls during the month, after the 39,000 fall in August. News to this effect when the figures are published on Friday would almost certainly boost the dollar, which in the past week has looked somewhat lacklustre against the D-Mark. Other indicators from the US due to be published during the week include the latest data on home completions and vehicle sales. The financial markets will also be given the September unemployment data for both the former east and west Germany, new manufacturing orders for west Germany and industrial production. The interest in these figures rests on whether they will indicate some signs of upturn in the German economy after the recession which has depressed the economic outlook for Europe as a whole. In Japan, the government will announce its estimate of the August trade surplus, in data which may shed light on whether imports are starting to rise as a result of any faint stirrings in domestic demand. At the German Bundesbank, Mr Hans Tietmeyer has his first council meeting as president, after replacing Mr Helmut Schlesinger, who retired on Friday. The Thursday meeting is not expected to result in any change in interest rates. In Britain, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will deliver his views on economic policy to the Conservative party conference on Thursday. At the Treasury tomorrow the government's panel of economic advisers meets for the first time since Mr Clarke took over as chancellor in May. Fans of Professor Wynne Godley, the maverick Cambridge economist who is one of the 'seven wise men', will be disappointed that he will miss the meeting as he is on a research posting in the US. Foreign exchange and stock traders will follow news of political manouverings in Russia where the recent crisis has periodically pushed down the D-Mark and European bonds on worries that any conflagration could harm the European economy. The following gives the highlights of the week. Figures in brackets are median market predictions provided by the MMS financial information company.

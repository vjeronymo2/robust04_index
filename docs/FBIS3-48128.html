SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama in the meeting said the  responsibility of the SDPJ as a member of the coalition parties  is great. He asked for cooperation of the party members, saying  the party must be resolved to answer the expectations of the  people on pending political issues.    Chairman Murayama said he will not think about resigning but  will continue to lead the party. He said the party leadership  will continue efforts to have the bills approved in the current  Diet session. In talks with coalition member parties and in  discussions in the joint conference of two houses of the Diet,  he said, his party will continue to insist that the prevention  of political corruption should be the main theme in the  political reform.    The party Central Executives Council in the meeting today  decided the upper house members who voted against the political  reform bills should be strictly disciplined.    The leaders of the SDPJ group in the upper house also met  today, and decided to urge four of the rebel members, who belong  to the SDPJ's upper house floor group but are not formally  affiliated with the SDPJ, to leave the group. Regarding the  rebels who are formal members of the party, the leaders agreed  to request the party Central Executives Council to consider  dismissing them from the party. The council will make a  decision on whether to remove them from the party's upper house  pact by 27 January.    Meanwhile, in the SDPJ Kanagawa Prefecture chapter,  officials  of the chapter decided to resign en masse, taking responsibility  for a SDPJ upper house member from the chapter voting against  the bills. Apparently, the impact from differences over ways of  dealing with the reform bills is sending ripples to local  chapters as well.    Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata gave a speech at Fukuoka City  today. Speaking about how he thinks the political reform bills  should be handled, he said he cannot accept any proposal to  limit the reform to that aimed only at preventing corruption.  Noting some people are talking about enacting only the bill  relating to political corruption, he said if these people are  serious about the political reform, they would not be saying  such a thing.    In the speech, Hata claimed the cause of the political  corruption problem lies in the current election system enabling  political parties to field many candidates in each of the  electoral districts, thus forcing the parties to use so much  money in campaigns. As long as that issue remains unresolved,  the political scenes will never change, he insisted. He thus  made it clear that he will not accept the idea of narrowing the  reform efforts to only those concerning corruption as now being  talked about by the Liberal Democratic Party and some of the  SDPJ members.    Regarding the possibility of Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosoakwa's assuming political responsibility in case the  political bills fail to be passed by the Diet in the current  session, Foreign Minister Hata noted that public opinion polls  showed more than 50 percent of the people support his cabinet.  If Hosokawa decides to do that, Hata said, it will only incur  the anger of the people. Each and every member of the Diet  should be held responsible for this situation, he insisted.    Within the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], in the mean time,  there are now growing voices that the bill on prevention of  corruption should be acted on first. But there are also some  who think a compromise plan should be worked out in the joint  conference of the two houses.    Ryutaro Hashitomo, chairman of the LDP Policy Research  Council, spoke in Nayoro City, Hokkaido, about the political  reform bills, and said Prime Minister Hosokawa and all the  cabinet members should think where the problem lies. He said he  wants them to feel responsible about the abusive way they run  the Diet and about their dialogue intended as only a show  performance. Noting that it is clear that the political reform  bills cannot be passed as they are now, Hashimoto urged the  government to change its way of thinking.    Hashimoto indicated he wants to be cautious in responding to  proposed talks with the coalition to discuss a new compromise.    Meanwhile, Keizo Obuchi, former general secretary of the  LDP,  who heads the Obuchi faction, delivered a speech in Gunma  Prefecture. According to him, a general agreement by members of  both houses in the Diet must be a precondition to holding the  talks to discuss a compromise plan. He said the party should be  cautious about agreeing to a compromise plan.    Another LDP leader -- former Foreign Minister Michio  Watanabe  -- spoke in a commercial television program this afternoon, and  said the polical reforms should start from measures on  preventing corruption and controlling political funds. He  insisted that enough time must be given to discussions on the  political reform.    In another scene, the group of the LDP members supporting  the  political reform -- the Dietmen's Union for Promotion of  Political Reform -- decided to launch a signature collection  campaign within the party in a call to urge the party leadership  to positively participate in the joint conference of the two  houses to come up with a new compromise plan.</p>

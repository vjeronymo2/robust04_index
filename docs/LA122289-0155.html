			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ZUBE TUBE SOUNDS LIKE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIT  </P> <P> There's not much to the Zube Tube, the Ultimate Cosmic Sound Machine. But then,  there wasn't much to the Hula-Hoop, either.  </P> <P> The 39-inch-long, brightly colored cardboard tube can produce sounds from "Star  Wars" battles and MTV-style echoes to Gregorian chants, whale songs and the  ocean's roar.  </P> <P> "The number of noises you want to make are as infinite as your imagination,"  said Judy A. Walls, senior vice president of Ritam International Ltd., a toy  company in the southeastern Iowa town of Fairfield.  </P> <P> "There's no batteries, no electricity," she said. "I think everybody is just  'electroniced' out."  </P> <P> Inside the 2 3/4-inch-diameter tube is a spring that acts as an acoustic coil.  The spring is connected at each end by custom-made plastic cups. A hole on the  side of the tube allows a child's -- or adult's -- finger to reach in and pluck  the spring, which produces the myriad of sounds.  </P> <P> A person can also speak into the hole, as well as either end of the tube, to  produce even more sounds.  </P> <P> "We feel it's going to be the next Hula-Hoop. In its first 18 months, they sold  something like 100 million Hula-Hoops," Walls said. "We plan on doing the same  thing. I think three years is realistic."  </P> <P> Some 200,000 Zube Tubes have been sold since they were marketed in  mid-September, she said. The suggested retail price is $9.95.  </P> <P> Toy and gift companies in Finland, Switzerland, Germany, France, England and  Canada have inquired about the tube.  </P> <P> Sandy Watsey, Ritam executive vice president, said that while in London, a  group of company officials went to Harrod's to tape a video using the  department store's Zube Tube display. However, they ended up filming an empty  display because the store was sold out, she said.  </P> <P> "They say over there that the Zube Tube is more popular than Nintendo," Watsey  said.  </P> <P> The concept of the Zube Tube was developed by Bob Deissler, who was studying  physics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.  </P> <P> "I was playing with a slinky and it happened to touch a Styrofoam cup," said  Deissler, who was visiting the 10-year-old toy company this week.  </P> <P> Intrigued by the sound, Deissler experimented with a different type of spring a  year later.  </P> <P> "It worked really great. That's when I really decided to pursue it," he said.  </P> <P> Deissler applied for and received a patent in 1980.  </P></p>

The three have  outrightly rejected hegemonism and have given expression to  their shared perception of an international order based on  respect for sovereign equality of all states, non-intervention,  peaceful co-existence, peaceful settlement of disputes.    With one voice Benazir, Li Peng and Kim Il-song denounced  the  political and economic domination of the developing countries by  the big powers, and asked them to live and let others live. In  fact, the above-named countries have been subjected to punitive  diplomacy and blackmail by the US for the simple reason that  they have embarked upon a path of independent economic  development. Pakistan has been accused of having made the  Islamic bomb, and DPRK a Marxist bomb while China has been  charged with supplying 400-metre-range M-11 missiles to Pakistan.    Pakistan has offered to conclude the NPT [Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty] together with India. The DPRK has  proposed the establishment of nuclear-weapons-free zone in the  Korean peninsula, meaning the removal of 1000 nuclear and lethal  weapons from there by the US. Further, it has to remove 48000  troops from South Korea, another 45000 troops from Japan and  warships from the Korean waters. This Washington is not  prepared to do and insists on Pyongyong's unconditional  submission to the inspection by the so-called IAEA  [International Atomic Energy Agency] team of North Korea's two  suspected nuclear sites. The row had taken a serious turn, with  President Clinton threatening to bomb Pyongyong's nuclear  installations. Benazir has sought to defuse the tension by  lending support to the ongoing negotiations between the US and  the DPRK at the United Nations, and pleading that  non-proliferation should not be made a pretext for blocking the  acquisition of nuclear technology for peaceful purposes.  Apparently, Pakistan's role has had some sobering influence on  the adversaries.    Both Pakistan and China have categorically denied the M-11  missile deal amidst Washington's refrain that Beijing had made  the delivery to its neighbour. China has made it clear that it  gives weapons for the recipient country's self-defiance [as  published] only and not to create imbalance in South Asia.  There is nothing clandestine about Pakistan-China arms transfer  which began, it may be recalled, after the US stopped military  assistance to Islamabad after the Sino-Soviet border agreement  in 1963. In December 1989 the two neighbours reached an  agreement for cooperation in the production of arms and  ammunition. Pakistan has to do something about its defence  since Rajiv Gandhi did not respond to Benazir's proposal for a  mutual balanced reduction of forces. Nor to her predecessor  government's offer of no-war pact. India is ever after a  deadlier weapons such as Agni, Prithvi, Akash missiles in  addition to four rocket launchers given to it by Russia.    Benazir has been mobilising world opinion in favour of a  judicious settlement of Kashmir where insurgency might spill  over into neighbouring countries, triggering off a regional war  in which Afghanistan and Iran may be embroiled at some stage  similar to Muslim Ummah's involvement against Russians in  Afghanistan. In the '60s and '70s, the People's Republic of  China unreservedly back the solution of Kashmir problem on the  basis of the UN-sponsored plebiscite. The Chinese President  Jiang Zemin particularly mentioned that the Kashmir dispute was  the main obstacle to the normalisation of relations between  India and Pakistan.    At the same time the Chinese leaders avoided taking sides  presumably because any partisan attitude on their part would  deprive them of whatever influence they might bring to bear upon  India by quiet diplomacy. Any offer of mediation by Beijing  would not be acceptable to India which insists on bilateral  negotiations. Astute diplomats as they are, the Chinese denied  assuming any such role. It is by some semblance of  even-handedness and nonpartisanship that Beijing can exercise a  moderating influence on India. Certainly, China will never  allow India to invade Pakistan, especially when the Soviet Union  is no longer there to neutralise Beijing.    Kim Il-song has maintained his government's support to the  settlement of Kashmir dispute on the basis of the will of the  people expressed through an impartial referendum, a position  adopted in consultation with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1976.  Unlike China, the DPRK has no unresolved disputes with India  and does not have to toe a cautious line. Therefore,  Pyongyang's partisanship would not complicate the matter but add  to the moral weight of Pakistan's stand.    Alone among the UN members Pakistan has stood by China on  human rights issue as proclaimed by Benazir that her government  shares Beijing's perception on that score. The United States  has left no stone unturned in making pariah of China on the  suppression of the West-inspired subversion at Tiananmen Square  in June 1989. Day in and day out, the Western media keep  playing up the so-called Tibetan separatism in a bid to fuel  insurgency in China's Himalayan province while the British  governor of the crown colony of Hong Kong is busy sowing the  dragon's seed there which he calls representatives assembly. It  is ridiculous -- nay mischievous -- to plant a state within  state on the eve of the lapse of Britain's paramountcy in the  region. Similarly, the Western powers have been arming Taiwan,  a part of mainland China, to teeth so that that entity may  resist reunion with the parent country.    Pakistan's Prime Minister has strongly opposed the Western  designs on China's territorial integrity and endorsed its  inalienable sovereign right to Tibet, Hong Kong and Taiwan, a  gesture that was appreciated by the Chinese government and  people. Pakistani leader underlined the need for strengthening  that United Nations in order to enable it to contribute to the  establishment of an international order based on justice. The  nonaligned nations could effectively resist the hegemonistic and  exploitative role of the big powers that impedes the emergence  of global egalitarianism. But the NAM [Nonaligned Movement] has  been stuck by paralysis in the post-cold war years.    The December 15 GATT document is discriminatory against the  developing countries as it imposes an unequal trade regime on  them all. More galling is the pusillanimous submission on the  part of NAM which had been crying hoarse for market access in  the developed world. India's half-hearted call for G-15 Summit  to address the GATT met with equally half-hearted response. The  summit could never meet. Nor was Narasimha Rao serious about  countering the domineering North with whose multinationals he  has been hobnobbing. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, India  has been placating the imperialist-zionist lobby for a permanent  seat in the Security Council. Whither NAM?    In this context the meeting of the leaders of Pakistan,  China  and the DPRK has been particularly significant in that they have  been resisting attempted subjugation from armed plutocratic  powers. At this critical juncture Kim Il-song's advice aimed at  South-South cooperation is significant. The great Korean leader  argues that Asia is blessed with immense natural resources,  manpower, technical know-how and experience. Given meaningful  cooperation, all these could be turned to good account. The  People's Republic of China and the DPRK are living examples of  development through self- reliance. Pakistan has forged  multiple economic, trade and technological links with the both  and has been expanding the cooperation. Benazir has laid stress  on energy, agriculture and irrigation where Chinese assistance  is urgently required. She has invited the Chinese entrepreneurs  to invest in Pakistan where the government's economic reforms  and new financing modes will facilitate joint ventures in  collaboration with local investors.    Five accords were signed:    (1) bilateral cooperation in science and technology, (2)  transport, (3) twinning of Punjab and Xian provinces, (4)  border trade agreement which raised the volume of such trade to  2 million Yuan, and (5) an 80-million-yuan soft loan to  Pakistan. China has helped Pakistan set up heavy mechanical  complex, heavy forge foundry and aircraft rebuild factory. It  is about time that attention was paid to light industry in  private sector on the basis of joint ventures. This was agreed  at a meeting of the 6-member Chinese delegation led by Zeng  Xianlin, Minister for Light Industry and Pakistan's Minister of  Production, Islam Nabi, at Islamabad in September '91. The  Chinese official opined that light industry could be established  with small capital and fetch foreign exchange which in turn  could be invested in defence sector.    Among the areas identified for the purpose are the  manufacturing of electrical fans, air-conditioners, electrical  equipments, auto-bicycles, elevators, hand-operated deep well  pumps and food processing. In addition to making Pakistan  self-sufficient in engineering goods, the industry will create  jobs. Some of these products could be exported to China,  thereby reducing Pakistan's trade deficit. In 1991, China  exported goods to Pakistan amounting to US$598 million while  Pakistan's export was mere US$89.2 million. The balance is more  or less the same at present. Improved communication links and  exchange of visits by businessmen can promote trade via land  route. It is a good news to the traders that both the  governments have decided to repair and develop Karakoram Highway  into an all-weather road.    Similarly, there exists great potential in promoting  cooperation with the DPRK in trade and development. Already,  Pyongyong has extended technical assistance in establishing  hydro-power station in Azad Kashmir. It has offered to assist  Pakistan in seismic-proof pre-fabricated housing, manufacture of  generators and mining equipment. North Korea's long-standing  offer to construct underground railway system to solve the  nation's chronic mass transit problem must still be open if only  we could avail of it. The DPRK will also buy chemical products  from Pakistan.    These are examples of mutually advantageous economic and  technical cooperation in bilateral relations among the states of  the South. Pakistan, China and the DPRK have shown how states  with differing political, social and economic systems, can work  together in a rewarding fellowship.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Music fails to seduce Bentalls' customers / Visiting a south London store in the front line of the recession HARRY the pianist tickles the ivories in an attempt to lull the shoppers into spending their money. But they are not so easily enticed and wander around the gleaming white Bentalls department store clutching their bags close to their chests and staring suspiciously at the serried ranks of merchandise. This is Monday morning in Kingston, south London - the retail recession's front line - and there are few signs of the gloomy mood lifting, in spite of Harry's best efforts. 'This is the longest sustained difficult trading period I have known in my 30-year career,' says Mr Richard Goodwin, the store manager. 'And I do not believe recovery will be fast,' he adds. 'Since the election we did see more interest from our customers and spending increased for five or six weeks. Then it dropped off a little. People may just be waiting for the sales to start. Shoppers are not daft and they know that retailers have to get rid of excess stocks,' he says. Staff bustle around him, filling shelves for the start of the sale on Thursday. Mr Goodwin believes the lingering downturn (he does not like the word recession) has two principal causes: fear of the jobs situation and the steep fall in house prices, which have slid by as much as 25 per cent in the Kingston area. Neither will be quickly reversed, he believes. 'I do not suppose there is any family around here that does not know of somebody who has become unemployed within the past year to 18 months. When it gets as close to home as that, people begin to fear that if it's happened to my aunt, my uncle, or my neighbour it could also happen to me.' There are some encouraging signs: the slight fall in unemployment figures is one. After rising from 2.1 per cent in 1989 to 6.9 per cent this year, the unemployment rate has just fallen back for the first time in 20 months. 'I think there will be some move towards recovery during the sales period and we will see an improvement from then on, but how long it will take is anybody's guess,' he says. At a group level, Bentalls' sales of Pounds 71m in the year to February 1 are still below those of 1988 in spite of an increase in retail space. Profits of Pounds 1.43m are only a third of those recorded four years ago. Mr Grenville Peacock, managing director, says there is little he can do to trim costs any further, since staffing has been already cut heavily to 1,200. 'We are employing 20 per cent less people than we were 3 1/2 years ago,' he says. He believes only a significant cut in interest rates can help restore consumer confidence and says he finds talk of the recession persisting for another three years 'really alarming'.</p>

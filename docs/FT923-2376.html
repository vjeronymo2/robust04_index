			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Spain tries to avoid interest rate rise THE SPANISH Government was yesterday trying hard to stave off a rise in interest rates after agreeing to a 5 per cent devaluation of the peseta at the emergency meeting of the EC monetary committee in Brussels in the early morning. By late afternoon, the Bank of Spain is understood to have injected some Dollars 12bn into the interbank market to dampen strong pressure for higher rates. The central bank, though, said it had not intervened in the foreign exchange markets and the peseta showed some signs of stabilising around Pta70 to the D-Mark, well down on its new parity of Pta68.4 but still comfortably clear of its Pta72.6 floor. The Spanish authorities are hoping desperately that the devaluation agreed in Brussels would see the currency through at least the rest of the week, until the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on Sunday. Upward pressure on rates in the interbank market showed there were still worries about the fate of the Spanish currency ahead of the French vote. Spanish officials went to Brussels on Wednesday night determined to remain in the exchange rate mechanism and there was considerable satisfaction in Madrid yesterday that this had been achieved. 'ERM membership is the biggest asset Spain has,' said Mr Jaime de Pinies, chief economist at Banco Santander de Negocios. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, told MPs that the government had been forced to devalue to protect itself against speculators. It had been inevitable because after the exit of sterling and the lire speculators would have turned against the peseta and an interest rate rise would have been unable to prevent it. Nevertheless, the devaluation badly undermines Madrid's long-standing commitment to a strong currency and passes the burden of fighting inflation on to the budget. Mr de Pinies said he believed the Bank of Spain would need to raise its 13 per cent base rate by up to 2 percentage points if the French vote against the treaty on Sunday, but warned that this would be 'a very dangerous thing to do as we enter a recessionary phase in the economy'. The other solution would be to devalue further, he said. But the 5 per cent devaluation is already likely, to add at least one percentage point to Spanish inflation this year said Mr Jorge Hay of Banco Central Hispano. Business insisted that complementary moves by the government were necessary to maintain the credibility of the new exchange rate. 'The devaluation means nothing unless it comes together with a budget that sharply reduces the public deficit and forces through salary moderation,' said Mr Guillermo de la Dehesa, chairman of Spain's association of chambers of commerce. Mr Solchaga is due to present his 1993 budget to parliament next month, a task already hampered by huge overruns on spending and income shortfalls this year. Draft proposals suggest the government has been considering a nominal increase in spending of 8 per cent but this, yesterday, was beginning to look distinctly expansionary. Mr de Pinies said Madrid should now be looking at a 5 per cent increase 'at the most'. Spain's public sector deficit in the first half of this year was 40 per cent up on 1991 and 116 per cent higher in the month of July. The current account deficit in the first half overshot official forecasts by more than Pta428bn to stand at Pta1,405bn. The country is running the second highest trade deficit in the west. Yesterday's devaluation was the first since Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez' socialist Government devalued immediately after coming to power in 1982.  -----------------------------------------          NEW ECU CENTRAL RATES  ----------------------------------------- BFr                        41.9547 DM                         2.03412 DKr                        7.75901 Pta                        139.176 FFr                        6.82216 Pounds                    0.689533* Dr                         250.550 IPounds                   0.759300 L                          1632.36* LFr                        41.9547 Fl                         2.29193 Esc                        176.844  ----------------------------------------- *Suspended from ERM Source: EC monetary committee  -----------------------------------------</p>

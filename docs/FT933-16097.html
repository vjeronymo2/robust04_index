			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Drive to reduce building litigation A REVIEW to reduce contract abuses and litigation in the construction industry was launched yesterday by Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister. Mr Baldry, a barrister, said more time was spent on litigation over building defects than correcting them. The inquiry, expected to cost Pounds 250,000, is to be financed jointly by the government and construction employers' organisations. It will examine ways to improve contractual and purchasing arrangements in the industry. It will be led by Sir Michael Latham, a former Conservative MP who was director of the Housebuilders Federation from 1971 to 1973. Members of the inquiry team will include representatives of property developers, main contractors and specialist sub-contractors. Sir Michael said the review would take 12 months, with an interim report planned for the end of this year. The inquiry, proposed last summer by construction employers' organisations, follows a series of complaints about builders from customers and from within the industry. Customers have complained about contractors trying to boost earnings by claiming sometimes large additional payments for changes in the design or specification of a building once construction has started. The review is also expected to look at late payment of bills to contractors and sub-contractors. Mr Baldry said the review would examine ways to overhaul procedures to reduce conflict and litigation and encourage productivity and competitiveness. He said lawyers recognised that construction provided the bulk of civil actions in the courts and that this was a big drain on the industry and its customers.</p>

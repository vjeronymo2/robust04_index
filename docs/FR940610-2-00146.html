			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 13, 1993, the Licensee responded to the Demand for Information indicating that he did not intend to perform licensed activities or to use the strontium-90 source in his possession, or one in anyone else's possession. Further, in a telephone conversation on June 2, 1994, with Mr. Charles M. Hosey of the NRC Region II office, Dr. Velasquez agreed to the provisions and to the issuance of this Confirmatory Order. I find that the Licensee's commitments as set forth in that conversation are acceptable and necessary and conclude that with these commitments the public health and safety are reasonably assured. In view of the foregoing, I have determined that the public health and safety require that the Licensee's commitments in the telephone call of June 2, 1994 be confirmed by this Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> IV <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to Sections 81, 161b, 161i, 160o, 182 and 186 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, and the Commission's regulations at 10 CFR 2.202 and 10 CFR parts 30 and 35, it is hereby ordered that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Analysts downgrade forecasts for Boots SHARES IN Boots Company fell yesterday after analysts downgraded their profit forecasts following disappointing final quarter sales figures from Do It All, the retail group's loss-making DIY joint venture with WH Smith. Boots' shares fell 26p to 509p while those of WH Smith declined by 19p to 469p. The City had been eagerly awaiting the trading statement from Boots for further signs that Christmas trading was stronger than in the previous year. January sales were widely reported to have enjoyed their busiest start for years. The main sales figures from the group's chemist division were in line with both the directors' and analysts' expectations. Sales increased by 5.5 per cent in the last quarter of 1992 compared to the previous year. Commenting on the figures Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said: 'In common with many other retailers the Boots' businesses, which are Christmas sensitive, demonstrated a late sales peak.' Boots Opticians showed a particularly strong 11.7 per cent sales gain, but the company said results in Childrens World with 2.3 per cent sales growth, and Halfords, with a 3.1 per cent gain, were 'somewhat lower.' However, the group said there have been improvements in post-Christmas sales. In the wake of the announcement most analysts cut their profit forecasts for Boots by between Pounds 5m and Pounds 15m.</p>

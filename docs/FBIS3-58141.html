			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Conor Cruise O'Brien: "Quit Now We're Ahead? </F> No Way"]    [Text] We are being told that the IRA is under heavy  pressure to deliver peace. Some even hold that it is about to  split under this terrible strain. Don't believe a word of it!  The morale of Sinn Fein-IRA -- one organization, not two -- is  far higher now than it was at the beginning of last year. And  the main reason for this is the Downing Street declaration of 15  December 1993.    The IRISH TIMES has a Northern reporter who has the entree  to  the appropriate circles. Her name is Suzanne Breen, and she was  among the guests at Sinn Fein's Christmas party, right after the  publication of the Declaration, and after the IRA's immediate  and derisory response, which took the form of announcing its  customary three-day Christmas truce. Gerry Adams in person  presided over the festivities of his followers and friends.    Were the assembled Sinn Feiners cast down at the IRA's  rebuff  to the declaration which their President had done so much to  shape? They were not. The general mood was one of unalloyed  euphoria. They were delighted with the declaration -- which they  felt was a coup on their own part -- but they were also entirely  supportive of the IRA's "no hurry, let's see" response.  Implicitly, but unmistakenly [as published], they support the  continuation of the violence.    But why should Sinn Fein-IRA be so pleased with the Downing  Street declaration? The reason is that it contains one sentence  included at its behest, in an attempt to appease them, as they  well know. And this sentence, with other matter related to it,  constitutes the only really new element in the declaration. The  sentence runs:    "The British Government agrees that it is for the people of  the island of Ireland alone, by agreement between the two parts  respectively, to exercise their right of self-determination on  the basis of consent, freely and concurrently given, North and  South, to bring about a united Ireland, if that is their wish."    No previous British Government has ever agreed to any  proposition of that order. Obviously, it does not yet represent  everything Sinn Fein-IRA is looking for. It includes the  principle of consent -- meaning Unionist consent -- and it makes  no change in the legal status quo. For those reasons (and  because they were consulted in advance, and because they have  nothing to hope for from the Opposition at Westminster) the  response of the Official Unionists to the declaration has been  calm and measured. Middle-class Unionists tend to be legalistic  in their approach to documents. But Sinn Fein-IRA looks at  documents in terms of symbols and signals: especially those  which suggest who is winning the battle of wills. That  sentence, issued officially on behalf of the British Government,  conveys to them the message that the IRA is winning. Hence the  euphoria.    The general pattern of Sinn Fein-IRA's responses over this  year is predictable. There will not be the "permanent end to  the use of, or support for, paramilitary violence" which the two  governments have been looking for and still pretend may be round  the corner. Sinn Fein-IRA will seek further concessions, in the  form of "clarifications." Indeed, the clarification game is  already in full swing. John Hume has called for clarifications  to be provided by the British and Irish Governments for both  Sinn Fein and the Rev Ian Paisley's party (a recipe for  diplomatic bedlam). Gerry Adams has backed Mr Hume's demands,  adding for good measure that Mr Major's failure to date to  provide the necessary clarifications is "childish" and "grossly  irresponsible." The IRA will measure its continuing dosage of  violence in proportion to the responses to the demands for  clarification.    There are likely to be tactical cease-fires, and when these  break down the blame will be cast on the intransigence of the  Unionists, the perfidy of the British Government, and the  treachery of the Irish one. Even at this stage, the most  congenial of these themes is being addressed. Mr Hume this week  charged that Mr Molyneaux "does not want the IRA campaign to  stop and is provoking them into continuing." So if the IRA  campaign does continue, it will be the Unionists and not the IRA  who are responsible, in Mr Hume's eyes. In short, Sinn Fein-IRA  and its friends have already begun an enjoyable game of  cat-and-mouse with the two governments, and with the longing for  peace of a gullible public in both islands.    It is not Sinn Fein-IRA that is under pressure. It is Sinn  Fein-IRA that is applying -- and occasionally relaxing -- the  pressure, in a highly sophisticated manner. Those who believe  the group to be under pressure, because of the general longing  for peace, are utterly mistaken. For terrorists, a general  longing for peace does not constitute a threat. On the  contrary, it is an asset, a major resource, that they exploit at  will: "You want peace, do you? Well, we control the supply of  that commodity. How much will you pay us, politically, to let  you have a bit of peace, for a while?"    The brutal fact is that the two governments, and Mr Hume,  were conned by Sinn Fein into issuing a declaration that  benefits nobody except Sinn Fein's masters, the IRA. The  governments and Mr Hume were led to believe that the IRA was so  war-weary that all it wanted was some formula with the magic  word "self-determination" in it, to save its face, and then it  would give up the fight, for good. Mr Reynolds, it seems, was  assured of this by some monks he met in the border area, and the  diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by Mr Hume. Mr Major  appears to have experienced similar revelations. It was all a  put-up job. The alleged war weariness was never more than a  ploy. Those who fell for it cannot admit the fact, even to  themselves, so the ploy is still working.    One should not despair. Sinn Fein-IRA may overplay its hand,  and the two governments may recover their nerve, or acquire  some. The only road that can lead to lasting peace is the hard  road of fighting the IRA instead of appeasing it. And that will  require internment, evenhandedly applied to both sets of  paramilitary godfathers. That road may yet be tried. But the  omens for it being tried at any time this year look far from  good.</p>

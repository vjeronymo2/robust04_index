			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nada al-Isa from Zagreb] </F>   [Text] Ivo Komsic, member of the Presidency of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, today held a news conference in Zagreb. Here  is a report by our Zagreb correspondent Nada al-Isa:    [al-Isa] The first result of the Washington agreement is  already evident, the clashes between the Croats and the Muslims  have virtually stopped. This marks a turning point in general  Croat-Bosniak relations. This was stated by Ivo Komsic, member  of the Presidency of Bosnia-Herzegovina, at a news conference in  Zagreb today. However, the agreement is still only a preliminary  agreement since the public, the people will have to express  their view on it, Komsic said. He said that the Assembly of  Bosnia-Herzegovina will give its final word on the Washington  agreement on 28 March.    The Bosnian Serbs should now be included in the  negotiations.  We should talk to them on the return of the occupied  territories. The Serbs can join the federation, Komsic said,  but parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina joining Serbia is out of the  question. They can only take a bit of Bosnian dust, whatever is  left on their shoes.    Asked to comment on the statement by Croatian President  Tudjman at the news conference today that there is a possibility  of a part of the so-called Srpska republic in Bosnia-Herzegovina  joining Serbia, Dr. Komsic said that he did not know where Dr.  Tudjman obtained this information, and that this was out of the  question.    Komsic expects some difficulties in the implementation of  the  Croatian-Bosniak agreement, which could come from individual  persons. The implementation of the agreement will be hindered  by the same persons who artificially caused the Croatian-Muslim  clash.    It would be interesting to see what the reaction will be  here  in Croatia to the statement by Dr. Komsic regarding the  so-called Herceg-Bosna. Replying to the question as to what  would now happen with the so-called Herceg-Bosna, Dr. Komsic  said: Nothing, because it has never existed. Only the state of  Bosnia-Herzegovina has and will continue to exist. All  artificial creations must completely disappear.</p>

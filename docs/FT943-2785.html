			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / Bank is 'keeping Ucatt afloat' Ucatt, the construction union, would not be a going concern if it did not continue to have the full backing of Unity Trust Bank, the trades union bank, according to a report prepared by the union's accountant. HW Fisher submitted a memorandum to the independent Certification Office this week with the union's annual financial return for 1993. The union reported a Pounds 1.05m operating deficit last year, down from Pounds 1.83m in 1992, with a negative net cashflow of Pounds 685,000 on its current account, down from Pounds 901,000. However, Ucatt's general fund reported an accumulated deficit of Pounds 3.17m on December 31 1993. Ucatt had to pay Pounds 200,000 in interest charges on its Pounds 1.25m bank overdraft last year. It also said it owed Pounds 1.14m to unspecified sundry creditors. In its report - which is addressed to Ucatt members - HW Fisher says: 'The bank has only agreed to maintain the overdraft facility on a temporary basis. We consider that there is therefore a significant level of concern as to the appropriateness of the going-concern basis.' It says that its opinion 'is not qualified in this respect', on the basis that Ucatt's bankers have indicated that they will continue to support the union. The overdraft has been secured by fixed charges over union properties. Unity Bank has said it will continue to support the union commercially until a new business plan is completed and the bank is 'satisfied that its implementation will restore the union to financial sta-bility'. Mr George Brumwell, Ucatt's general secretary, said yesterday: 'We are now in a position to make a significant reduction in our debts.' The union is in the process of selling property and reducing its staff. The accounts show that the union has saved about Pounds 800,000 in personnel costs. Its regional staff cost Pounds 1.67m last year, down from just over Pounds 2m in 1992. There was also a reduction in general administrative expenses to Pounds 661,000 from Pounds 749,000. However, the union has had to trim its services to members. There was a cut of more than half in legal assistance to Pounds 204,000 from Pounds 510,000. Funeral and other benefits amounted to only Pounds 56,000 in 1993. Ucatt had investment income of just Pounds 8,000 last year.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Kobe Steel to raise capital via cross-holdings in group KOBE Steel, a leading Japanese steel company, is to sell shareholdings in its subsidiaries to other members of its keiretsu, or corporate grouping, over the next three years. The move comes as Japanese companies face increasing pressure to improve returns on investments in the face of a rise in the cost of capital and a plunge in earnings due to the slumping economy. More companies, which had access to cheap equity financing in the stock market boom of the late 1980s, are expected to follow Kobe's example, as the continuing slump in share prices has forced an increasing number of companies to pursue efficient investments. Kobe expects to post Y6.9bn (Dollars 58m) of special profits from stock sales for its current year to March. It also plans to sell about Y5bn worth of shares over the next three years. Kobe said the capital raised will be re-invested in its new materials and semiconductor businesses and used to cover costs for inventory adjustments. Shares in seven subsidiaries - including Nabco, Shinko Electric, Shinko Shoji, and Nippon Koshuha Steel - will be sold by the parent company. During the first half of the year to March 1993, Kobe sold 3.1 per cent of Shinko Shoji to Shinko Electric and 4.1 per cent of Shinko Electric to Shinko Shoji. Kobe said that, by enhancing cross shareholdings among affiliates, ties within the keiretsu would be strengthened, and would also contribute to growth of the whole group.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / BT adds services to interactive trial British Telecommunications has delayed the start of trials for its interactive television project until the middle of next year to add a wider range of services than simply video-on-demand. The 2,500-home trial in the Colchester and Ipswich area will offer home shopping, banking and educational programming as well as the film and television service that had been scheduled to start in the spring. Shopping-on-demand will be offered under individual brands. Thomas Cook will offer holidays and travel, Sears fashion and sporting goods and WH Smith books, compact discs and videos. A grocery service will be developed by Safeway stores. Mr Rupert Gavin, director of BT's information, communication and entertainment programme, said yesterday: 'In order to test the capability of interactive TV, it is important to offer consumers a wide range of services.' Technical trials in 60 homes showed it was possible to send good quality pictures in digital form down ordinary telephone lines at the same time as the lines were being used for a telephone conversation. BT, which has a telephone network linking 20m homes, found the technology had a wider than expected range. This suggested 92 per cent of the network could handle interactive services. The first commercial trial is likely to cost more than Pounds 30m. BT should have enough information by the end of next year to decide whether to roll out the service across the UK, which could cost several billion pounds. BT wants to find out what services people are prepared to pay for and what is the best method of charging. The commercial trial will include monthly subscriptions, paying for individual items and a mixture of the two. Included in the service will be 600 hours of television, 400 hours of films and 200 hours of music, all regularly updated.</p>

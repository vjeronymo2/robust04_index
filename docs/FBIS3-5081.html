			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the issue of opening the  Japanese cellular phone market, Japan Mobile Communications  Company [JMCC] and Motorola are believed to have tentatively  reached an agreement. While JMCC provides its cellular phone  service in the capital and central Japan, Motorola has  complained of difficulties in providing service in those parts  of the country. JMCC will agree with Motorola to settle the  issue by making investments in Motorola mobile phone facilities  earlier than planned. In response, the Posts and  Telecommunications Ministry will urge the U.S. Trade  Representative to stop taking procedures to slap sanctions on  Japan.    JMCC proposed in late January raising the level of the  current Motorola-type mobile service to that of its NTT-type  mobile phone service by constructing 323 radio ground stations  for the Motorola-type mobile phone service in the capital, and  the central part of Japan by March 1997. In response, Motorola  asked JMCC in mid-February to construct the radio ground  stations two years ahead of schedule -- by March 1995 -- and for  JMCC to purchase 225,000 sets of Motorola-made cellular phones.    In hitherto informal negotiations, JMCC had expressed a  willingness to invest in Motorola cellular phone facilities  earlier than planned.    JMCC is saddled with borrowings that are 20 times the value  of its capital, and the raising of funds holds the key to  implementing its side of the agreement. Toyota Motor  Corporation has expressed willingness to go along with JMCC's  request for increasing its capital. The Japanese car maker has  also promised to do everything it can to expand the  Motorola-type mobile phone service in Japan.    Meanwhile, Motorola will withdraw its request for the  purchase of its cellular phones. Motorola has concluded that it  would be a plus for it to compromise with JMCC at this stage  where it has prospects for real profits, rather than push ahead  with sanctions. A senior Motorola official is due to visit  Japan this weekend. While in Japan, he will meet with the  Japanese side to discuss ways for JMCC to invest in Motorola  mobile phone facilities earlier than planned.    The U.S. trade representative is believed unlikely to slap  sanctions on Japan if JMCC and Motorola conclude their  negotiations successfully. There is a possibility, however,  that the U.S. trade representative will not immediately halt  procedures for slapping sanctions on Japan with the aim of  wringing concessions from Japan in Japan-U.S. framework talks  that broke down at the most recent Japan-U.S. summit talks in  February, and therefore an intergovernmental agreement is likely  to be deferred until later.</p>

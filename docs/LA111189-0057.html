			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ROBERT HILBURN: ALTERNATIVE POP TUNES EMBODY ACCESSIBILITY, CRAFT  </P> <P> Variety is the key to a healthy pop music diet -- and that's the emphasis of  this installment of the Alternative Top 10, a periodic guide to the best new  singles and album tracks.  </P> <P> The list is headed by four recordings that encompass so much accessibility and  craft that they are likely to be actual Top 10 singles in the coming weeks.  </P> <P> The heart of the list, however, centers chiefly on artists who work in styles  that may be a bit too quirky for the kind of mass radio exposure that is  required to be a national hit.  </P> <P> Yet it is these records -- by newcomers with such offbeat names as Shakespear's  Sister, 3rd Bass and Eat -- that not only give character and seasoning to our  pop fare, but also help shape the changes that are essential to stretching the  music's boundaries.  </P> <P> The Alternative Top 10 doesn't automatically exclude records in the actual  Billboard magazine Top 10, but the focus is on tracks by new acts or by artists  that often get shunned by radio's mainstream pop formats.  </P> <P> The November choices:  </P> <P> 1. Terence Trent D'Arby's "I'll Be Alright" (Columbia) -- This tale of romantic  celebration is a knockout mix of Sam Cooke soul and Beach Boys good cheer. A  simply irresistible track from his new "Neither Fish Nor Flesh" album.  </P> <P> 2. Tracy Chapman's "Subcity" (Elektra) -- "Crossroads," an unnecessarily dour  statement of independence and integrity, is the first single from the  folk-accented artist's second album, but the more natural successor to "Fast  Car" is this tuneful reflection on society's neglected underclass.  </P> <P> 3. Aerosmith's "Janie's Got a Gun" (Geffen) -- The frisky "Love in an Elevator"  is the first hit from the veteran rock group's "Pump" album, but this dramatic  portrait of a child abuse victim will probably become an even more important  part of the band's repertoire.  </P> <P> 4. Soul II Soul's "Back to Life" (Virgin) -- Another classy and imaginative  dance-floor soundscape from the London team that gave us "Keep on Movin'."  </P> <P> 5. 3rd Bass' "Steppin to the A.M." (Def Jam) -- Sturdy rhymes and snappy beats  from the first white rap outfit from Def Jam since the Beastie Boys.  </P> <P> 6. Shakespear's Sister's "You're History" (FFRR Records/Polydor) -- Though this  kind of novelty wears out quickly, the delightfully absurd put-down of an old  lover is too much fun to ignore.  </P> <P> 7. Adult Net's "Waking Up in the Sun" (Fontana/Mercury) -- Brix Smith, a Los  Angeles native no less, is best known for her work with English cult faves the  Fall, but the singer-songwriter is concentrating now on her own group Adult  Net.  </P> <P> 8. Eat's "Skin" (Fiction/Mercury) -- A wickedly satiric slap at a small-town  fat cat, from a British band signed to the Cure's record label, built around an  anxious, evil-eye swamp rock arrangement.  </P> <P> 9. Mekons' "Memphis, Egypt" (Twin/Tone/A&amp;M) -- There's a lot of the Clash's  independent spirit in this veteran English group, so it's only natural that the  Mekons would borrow a bit of rock dynamics from Mott the Hoople, a band that  was a favorite of the Clash's Mick Jones.  </P> <P> 10. Steve Stevens' "Action" (Warner Bros.) -- Time out for a little '70s  nostalgia. Billy Idol's former guitarist salutes the wonderfully energetic  Sweet with a version of that old British group's 1976 hit.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] No secret agreement whatsoever exists between the  coalition government and the Hungarian parliamentary parties in  Slovakia. This was stated at a press briefing of the Hungarian  Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH] by Pal Csaky today.    Speaking about the forthcoming parliamentary elections, he  said that the MKDH supported the notion that the Hungarian  political forces in Slovakia ought to have a joint stand, but he  did not agree with the idea of establishing a joint party. The  MKDH wishes to study the proposal of a union worked out by  Coexistence, but, for the time being, it is supporting the idea  of creating a tripartite coalition between MKDH-Coexistence and  the Hungarian Civic Party.    Csaky also said that, after the elections, his party will  support any government that, on the basis of democratic  principles, continues on the course Slovakia has entered on.</p>

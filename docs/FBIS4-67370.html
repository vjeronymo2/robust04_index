			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast: Video report from Moscow </F> Oblast's Polymetal Plant by L. Varebrus and V. Stupin,  identified by caption; figures in brackets denote broadcast time  in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds]    [Text] [101254] Varebrus over video of padlock,  barbed wire fence, and sign reading "Stop! No Entry!":  Even today production facilities here are kept behind seven  seals, and the barbed wire fence and awesome sign are no mere  stage props. But there are no secrets behind these gates.  There is waste ground. The gates are opened only very rarely.  The predecessors of the present plant created a very dangerous  neighborhood here -- a radioactive dump of their own waste, and  what is more, directly on the banks of the Moskva river, as you  can see.    Unidentified man carrying radiation counter:  Right by the gate -- 10 microroentgen... Uh-oh --  132...520...divided by four that is 130.    Varebrus to camera over video of snowy landscape:  Not a negligible quantity. Incidentally, this is not just a  dump. The land belongs to the Kolomna museum. If you dig, you  can find up to 1,300 microroentgen per hour. And on the surface  up to 650. Not everywhere, of course. Just in certain places.  Waste emitting more than 300 microroentgen is subject to burial  at a special facility near Sergiyev Posad. Initially, nothing  was known about this danger, subsequently it was kept secret,  and now, when it would be possible to remove this filth --  uranium, thorium, and radium lie buried under the snow here --  the money has run out. So production managers from the present  polymetal plant have themselves sounded the alarm.    V. Sotskov, deputy director for safety and emergency  situations, identified by caption: The simplest solution  would be if the waste could simply be taken away. But, as I  have already said, it is technically impossible to dig it up, or  cover it up somehow. The bank will be destabilized and the  deposits will slide into the Moskva river.    Varebrus: True, the radioactive substances would  not dissolve in water. But they would accumulate in the silt  and pass into fish. And so there is only one solution -- look  for and find the money necessary to protect our health.

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Bank deal aims to lift E Europe trade AN agreement aimed at restoring trade between Russia and east European states through rapid settling of accounts between their main commercial banks was signed in Moscow yesterday. It also marks an attempt to begin their integration into the European banking system by using the Ecu as the basic unit of account. Trade between these states, former members of the Comecon trading system, has largely been conducted by barter in the past two years since the break-up of the Communist bloc. The volume of trade has plunged to a fraction of former levels. Mr Dominique Rambure, a director of the Italian San Paolo Bank and honorary chairman of the Ecu Banking Association, said yesterday the agreement would allow the participating commercial banks to clear accounts with each other within 24 hours. A line of credit would be opened by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development which would guarantee all banks against default. The participating banks are the Russian Foreign Trade Bank, the IBEC Bank and the International Moscow Bank in Russia; the Bank Handlowy and Powszechny Bank Kredytowy in Poland; the Komercni and Investicni banks in Czechoslovakia; the Inter Europa Bank in Hungary; and the Private Bank and the Bulgarian Post Bank in Bulgaria. All will be linked through the Swift communications system. 'This will allow these countries to rebuild their payments and trade relationships which have collapsed. It will give them quick and secure payment and it will connect them with the European clearing system,' said Mr Rambure. The drop in trade between Russia and her former partners was one of the sharpest on record - around 60 per cent in Russian exports and imports last year. A further decline in trade has been forecast for this year.</p>

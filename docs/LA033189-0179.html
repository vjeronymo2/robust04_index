			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> INJURY MAY SIDELINE OZZIE SMITH  </P> <P> A strained muscle that shortstop Ozzie Smith suffered on his left side while  stealing a base may keep him out of St. Louis' season opener, the Cardinals  said today.  </P> <P> Manager Whitey Herzog said a medical determination on Smith, 34, who was hurt  Thursday during a game at Dunedin, Fla., against the Toronto Blue Jays, is  expected within 48 hours.  </P> <P> Smith is not the only St. Louis player hurt. Pitchers Danny Cox and Greg  Mathews are disabled, and first baseman Pedro Guerrero has been idled a week by  the strained tendons below his right knee he sustained March 24.  </P> <P> The Cardinals open in New York against the Mets, defending National League East  champions.  </P> <P> "Spring training is just too long," Herzog said of the Cardinals' problems. "I  don't see what it accomplishes, except guys keep (getting hurt)."  </P></p>

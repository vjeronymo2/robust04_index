			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by economic reporter Junichi Maruyama: "What To Do </F> About Economic Reform--`Foreign Commitment,' Which Is Increasing  the Intensity"]    [Text] The "coalition defection shock" of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] offered the United States a  greater surprise than did the coming to power of a new  government.    White House press secretary Didi Meyers, who received the  report just before a press conference held on 25 April, said,  "We will have to watch the situation in Japan closely as it  unfolds," at the same time exhibiting an expression of  bewilderment over the unanticipated turmoil inside the Japanese  Government. THE WASHINGTON POST on page 1 ran the headline,  "Japan's Government Coalition Collapses," and reported that a  stalemate in Japanese policy would continue for months.    The U.S. Government on 22 April issued an unusual "welcoming  statement" to Prime Minister Hata without waiting for him to  receive his nomination as prime minister in the Diet. Mike  McCurry, the U.S. State Department press secretary, praised the  prime minister as "the man who bears the responsibility for  wrestling with issues involved in the U.S.-Japan relationship."  This is because Prime Minister Hata who has intimate knowledge  of negotiations with the United States and has accumulated  cabinet experience both as finance minister and foreign minister  is seen as suited to effecting the opening of Japan's markets  and reducing the trade surplus.    U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, at a meeting with  Foreign Minister Hata in Marrakech, Morocco, on 15 April  "consistently conducted himself in a gentlemanly fashion we  haven't seen before" (the head of MITI). This was because  Kantor, recognizing Foreign Minister Hata as the next prime  minister, had an aim of obtaining a pledge regarding Japanese  concessions in order to reopen the stalled trade talks.    But, belying the gentle manner, the demands Representative  Kantor set forth were harsh. He presented three conditions for  reopening comprehensive talks: creating yardsticks, expanded the  introduction of foreign goods and services, and a review of the  midrange macroeconomic plan aimed at reducing the trade surplus.    It was requested in discussions between Kantor and Hata and  with President Gore about the same time that there be close  cooperation between the United States and Japan on the nuclear  issue involving the People's Democratic Republic of Korea (North  Korea). The fact that, on returning to Japan, Prime Minister  Hata at the Shinseito's policy conference of the coalition  parties persisted in strongly emphasizing enactment of tax  reform and the fulfilling of international obligations regarding  the issue of North Korea was due to the shackles put on the  deputy prime minister of Japan by the United States at Marrakech.    However, given the strong fears dogging the minority  government with the defection of the SDPJ from the coalition  government, it will not do for the scenario depicted by Prime  Minister Hata and expected by the United States to collapse  forthwith. The Hata government has decided to issue a decision  by the end of June regarding the overlay of a capital investment  plan for public works with a permanent tax reduction through tax  reform. Taking such a stand, he would like to have comprehensive  discussions reopen and bring about a final agreement for them by  the July Naples summit (the G-7 meeting of the heads of the  advanced industrial nations).    However, should the SDPJ, which defected from the coalition,  still oppose a hike in the consumption tax to overcome reduced  tax revenue, tax reform will be brought to a standstill. Without  the prospect of realizing a permanent tax reduction,  comprehensive discussions with the United States cannot be  reopened. Furthermore, should Japan be unable to set forth a  policy for effectively reducing its trade surplus at the summit  where "growth and employment" will be key themes, there is fear  that Japan will be subject to concerted denunciation.    The United States and Europe have both accepted deregulation  that incorporates a general plan for international economic  reform as an international commitment. But, if the Hata  government's centripetal force is weakened and bureaucratic  resistance is not controlled, bold deregulation will be  difficult.    Noboru Hatakeyama, former MITI negotiator and until last  year  in the forefront of U.S.-Japan negotiations, counseled that "it  will not be acceptable to say that if the government does not  come up with concrete indicators it is because the bureaucracy  wouldn't budge." Tsuyoshi Kondo, director of Itochu  Corporation's Politics and Economics Institute, pleaded with the  new government "to offer slogans easily understood both  domestically and abroad and to maintain the ability to gather  information outside bureaucratic channels."    U.S.-Japan trade negotiations currently are in the unusual  position of being hands off to the bureaucrats. Should this  continue, it must be allowed that US-Japan relations as a whole  will slip into a precarious position. However, I don't see the  prospects for Prime Minister Hata overcoming a weak political  base at home and somehow being able to find a way to extricate  himself from tempestuous international relations.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RULING PUTS DIANE WILLIAMS' MEDAL IN LIMBO  </P> <P> Whether U.S. sprinter Diane Williams will be required to forfeit the bronze  medal she won in the 1983 world championships at Helsinki because of a rule  adopted Tuesday by the International Amateur Athletic Federation will not be  determined until later this year.  </P> <P> The IAAF, which governs track and field, voted to withdraw recognition of  records, titles and results earned by athletes who subsequently admit use of  banned substances before those performances.  </P> <P> But the IAAF also established a statute of limitations of six years. Williams  admitted in a televised interview last February with ABC's Donna de Varona that  she used drugs while competing for the L.A. Naturite Track Club between  January, 1982, and March, 1984.  </P> <P> Williams has repeated the confession several times, most recently in June  before a Congressional panel chaired by Joseph R. Biden, Jr. (D-Del).  </P> <P> Based on her admission, the IAAF has been empowered to recall her bronze medal  from Helsinki if it determines that the statute of limitations dates back six  years from the day in February when she first confessed.  </P> <P> But IAAF Vice President Arne Ljungqvist of Sweden said that the IAAF might  determine that the statute of limitations dates back six years from the day  when the rule was passed.  </P> <P> The first interpretation would include William's Helsinki performance because  it would cover the period from February, 1983, to February, 1989. The second  interpretation, however, would not affect her because it would cover the period  from Sept. 5, 1983, to Sept. 5, 1989. The 1983 World Championships were held in  early August.  </P> <P> Ljungqvist said that the IAAF executive council will issue a ruling before Jan.  1.  </P> <P> Williams, who was raised in Chicago, attended Michigan State. She failed a drug  test after qualifying for a berth on the U.S. sprint relay team in the 1984  Olympic trials, but she was not disqualified because of an error in the testing  period. She did not compete for the sprint relay team at the Summer Olympics  because of a decision by the coaches.  </P> <P> Williams' national championship and second-place finish in the Pan American  Games in the 100 meters in 1987 will not be affected by the rule because she  said that she has not used drugs since 1984.  </P></p>

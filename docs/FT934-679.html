			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Cazenove partner tipped to head Stock Exchange The joint senior partner of Cazenove and Company, one of London's most discreet and successful stockbroking firms, is the leading candidate to become the next chairman of the Stock Exchange. Mr John Kemp-Welch, a member of the exchange's board, has been approached by other board members to fill the post. It is likely to be vacated next year by Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, who has been chairman since 1988. 'He is clearly the front runner,' said a board member. 'He has indicated that he is interested, though a formal decision has not been taken either by him or us.' Mr Kemp-Welch, who yesterday refused to comment, is due to retire as joint senior partner of Cazenove on April 30. Cazenove adopted a unique strategy among leading securities firms when the stock market was deregulated in 1986 by remaining an independent partnership. It never publishes financial results, but it is believed to have been more consistently profitable than any other London securities firm. It has about 200 publicly quoted UK companies as clients, including an unrivalled number of the UK's biggest companies. Mr Kemp-Welch, 57, who was educated at Winchester, has a reputation for being tough and single-minded. His father, Mr Peter Kemp-Welch, was also senior partner of Cazenove. A member of White's Club in London's St James's, he lists his recreations as 'shooting, farming, cricketing, the hills of Perthshire'. A board member said that Mr Kemp-Welch was unlikely to commit himself to taking the post until nearer the time of his departure from Cazenove. He also pointed out that Sir Andrew had not decided exactly when he wished to stand down. 'Andrew wants to go in his own time. He wants to make it abundantly clear that his departure is unconnected to the Taurus debacle,' the board member said. Last spring, the exchange cancelled its Taurus project to computerise its share settlement and registration processes, at a cost to itself and its member firms of several hundred million pounds. Mr Peter Rawlins, the Stock Exchange chief executive, took responsibility and resigned.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yang Ching-hui; from the "Hookup" </F> program]    [Text] High-ranking officials of the Strait Exchange  Foundation [SEF] and the Mainland Affairs Commission [MAC] held  a joint closed meeting yesterday. It was pointed out that in  view of the series of unfriendly acts by the Chinese Communists  in recent days, which harms the atmosphere of the upcoming talks  between Chiao Jen-ho and Tang Shu-pei [Tang Shubei], the meeting  decided to reexamine the timing of the Chiao-Tang talks; it did  not exclude the possibility of postponing the talks.  Yesterday's decision has cast a cloud of uncertainty on whether  the first high-level meeting between SEF and the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] will be held on 31  January as scheduled. Here is a report by Yang Ching-hui.    [Begin recording] [Yang] The breakfast meeting between MAC  and SEF put an emergency brake on the Chiao-Tang talks. Kao  Kung-lien, MAC vice chairman and spokesman, stressed: MAC and  SEF discussed the Chiao-Tang talks. In light of the current  relations between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, which are  currently at a low ebb; in light of the unfriendly atmosphere  surrounding the talks, an atmosphere created by the Chinese  Communists' attempt to isolate us diplomatically and to forbid  France to sell us arms; and in view of the fact that Wang  Chao-kuo [Wang Zhaoguo], Wang Tao-han [Wang Daohan], Tang  Shu-pei, and others from the mainland have maneuvered for a more  advantageous position by issuing various statements on eve of  the talks, it is necessary to reevaluate more profoundly whether  the talks should be held on schedule. Kao Kung-lien said:    [Kao] The Chinese Communists made a special point of  creating an unfriendly atmosphere, thereby creating obstacles to  the talks even before they take place. For the sake of avoiding  political issues, they are actually trying to prevent us from  enforcing laws under our jurisdiction. We believe there is no  need to hold the Chiao-Tang talks on schedule, and the matter  should be reexamined.    [Yang] Kao Kung-lien stressed: Unfriendly acts on the part  of the Chinese Communists have increased in recent days. This  has had a negative impact on the development of relations  between the two sides of the Strait.    [Kao] The Chinese Communists' attempt to isolate us  diplomatically and to suppress us militarily will only create  resentment among the general public on Taiwan. This will  certainly have a very negative impact on cross-Strait relations.  In our view, the Chinese Communists' acts have never departed  from their old mentality (words indistinct). This will only  result in the waste of the resources of the Chinese people. If  they do not change their mentality and adopt a policy of  promoting coexistence and common prosperity, it will be  difficult for cross-Strait relations to develop further.    [Yang] MAC held that because the Chinese Communists do not  want to alter their rigid mentality, we cannot help but  reevaluate the timing of the Chiao-Tang talks. Kao Kung-lien  stressed that although he would not go so far as to say the  Chiao-Tang talks will be canceled, it is likely the talks will  be postponed. Our side will inform ARATS following the  reevaluation. However, there will be no major changes in the  government's general policy direction toward the mainland. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 12 (YONHAP) -- Russia wants to repay part  of its overdue debt to South Korea by offering a building site  for the Korea-Russia Trade Center, the Korea Trade Promotion  Corp. (KOTRA) said Thursday.    The Russian Government has decided in principle to give  Korea  5 hectares (15,000 pyong) of land currently reserved for the use  of Moscow University for the trade center in exchange for some  of its outstanding liabilities, and is discussing details with  the Moscow city hall.    City officials and university authorities are said to  strongly oppose the plan, but the government favors the idea and  is likely to look for other sites if it cannot get the land,  KOTRA officials said.    If Seoul accepts Moscow's proposal at a joint economic  committee meeting slated for May 19-23 here, repayment of some  of Russia's liabilities with Korea will be resolved.    KOTRA, however, has its heart set on the land owned by the  university campus and may seek to locate the trade center there  without linking it with Korea's loans to Russia, officials said.    "We exchanged a memorandum of understanding with Moscow city  and the university last month to set up a trade center within  the university," an official said.    The memorandum was signed without any linkage to the loan so  the Seoul Government can decide whether to attach the matter to  the loan repayment, he said.    KOTRA, regardless of the outcome of the project's linkage to  the loan, is sounding out local companies to determine their  interest in the center. Such firms as Dongbu, Daelim and  Byoksan have shown an affirmative response.    The center will be comprised of four sectors -- exhibition,  department store, hotel and apartments -- and is expected to  cost 300 million U.S. dollars.    Seoul had failed to settle some of the loan repayment with  rent for the Korean industrial complex in Nakhodka due to  opposition from Moscow.    Korea loaned 1.27 billion dollars in economic aid to the  former Soviet Union and interest on the outstanding liabilites  had reached 387 million dollars as of the end of last year.</p>

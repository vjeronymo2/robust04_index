			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Publisher to the English eccentric - A man who specialises in odd books IN 1962 John Rotheroe founded what has become one of Britain's notable minor institutions - Shire Books, of Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire. As the company celebrates its 30th anniversary Rotheroe gains modest satisfaction in knowing that there is scarcely a bookshop in Britain that does not stock at least one of the 850 titles published so far. Similarly there cannot be a single English eccentric who is not familiar with at least one of these titles, that range from dummy boards to dovecotes, from Egyptian coffins to East Anglian village signs. 'If the subject is sufficiently offbeat or obscure we will consider it,' said John Rotheroe, 56 who owns and runs the company with his wife Jacqueline, though he admitted that with an average of three to four books offered to him every working day the majority of aspiring authors are disappointed. Rotheroe spent two years working in a London advertising agency after he left the London School of Economics with a degree in medieval economic history, even so he is not a man given to seeking publicity. 'We did once achieve fame - in a Guardian fourth leader that enthused about a book we produced in the late 1960s on ancient hill figures,' he said. His favourite way of promoting his staunchly independent seven-person company is to spend many days - including weekends - 'on the road', visiting some of the 6,000 accounts in this country, most of whom he knows personally. 'They range from very large branches of W H Smith to museums, stately homes and small parish churchs - Orford church in Suffolk is our oldest account,' he said. 'Visiting the customers regularly not only results in sales, but returns, which, strangely enough, I do not mind,' Rotheroe said. 'A lot of our titles are so obscure that booksellers find they can't sell them, so it is our policy to buy these back at the price we charged for them. Some people think this is odd, but it is only common sense really. It does nobody any good having old tatty unsold paperbacks hanging around. Besides, returns total only about five per cent, and we build this figure into our costings.' The best selling titles might sell as many as 3,000 of the 500,000 books Shire expects to sell in a year. Titles such as John Bly's Hallmarks in English Silver, Heraldry, and Your Family Tree have been reprinted many times. The Bly book has gone through 13 reprints. For the effort in selling this number of books - and often in mailing a single book worth under Pounds 1.50 after the retailer's discount is taken into account - Shire turns over a mere Pounds 650,000 a year. Profit this year could well be as low as Pounds 40,000 before tax. Most of this figure will be ploughed back into the company. It is many years since Rotheroe borrowed money. This partly explains why, even if the Rotheroes wished to sell out, no large publisher would be keen to acquire the company. 'Our low figures keep the big boys away. We have had one or two nibbles, but not for many years,' Rotheroe said. 'We should probably be a lot more profitable if we restricted our number of titles (500 are in print), but that would take away a lot of the fun. Warehousing for small books such as ours is not expensive and I like to be able to supply the odd unusual title, if that is what a customer wants.' 'I am particularly proud of our Shire Ethnography series. To say they were loss making would be a kind way of putting it. But nobody was doing cheap ethnography - our titles cost Pounds 3.50 - and there was a need. We have some of the best names in the subject between our covers. They include 80- year-old Harry Beran, who has just produced a volume entitled Betel Chewing equipment of Eastern New Guinea. Shire Books has only one outlet in New Guinea and only 10 per cent of its sales are overseas. This is an area Rotheroe would like to expand, though probably not yet, its Australian distributor recently went down leaving them with an Pounds 8,000 debt. Even so, Rotheroe says the recession has affected Shire far less than bigger publishers. 'I think this is because we are so widely spread,' he said 'Invoices average around Pounds 10, so although this is very labour intensive it rarely means we are owed great deal by a single customer. 'Nevertheless this year we are not really expecting to make much more than the previous year. The recession has affected the tourist trade, which has in turn affected us. Also with so many museums now charging for entry we find people are less inclined to buy a book in he shop at the end of their tour. 'They often used to do this automatically as a sort of thank-you gesture. 'However we always try to take a long-term view. We look upon the ethnography titles as a 15 year project. It will probably be that long before people start taking notice and buying them in numbers. 'We have also had some success in producing books ahead of demand. A good example was the Comics title in our Discovering series.' Another keystone of the Shire policy is updating whenever a title reprints. 'We try hard to keep our subject matter current,' he said. 'Although we pay our authors an advance of only about Pounds 600 for a 5,000 word Shire Album title and a royalty of 5 per cent, through regular updating and a low selling price we keep them in print for years. So many books have a small print run, a high cover price and a very short life.' To keep prices down - books in the Shire Album series for example have cost Pounds 1.95 for the past three years - the company does nearly all the design in its 17th century town house headquarters in the centre of Princes Risborough. Only the photographs are added to the page at the company in Wales that has printed nearly all their titles for the past 20 years. 'Low prices are our creed,' Rotheroe said. 'When we started we were selling books at the price of a gin and tonic. Now I say that some of our titles cost no more than the price of a pint of beer. 'Very often a Shire book is an impulse buy - it is the 'ooh' factor we so often sell on. And you can only achieve that by keeping prices low. 'It means we don't make huge profits. But we manage to survive and enjoy ourselves on all the obscure topics we do. It would be flattering to be imitated. But nobody would want to. Our books are too slow selling.'

Ciampi, who has no official political affiliation, opened  the  consultations meeting a delegation from the Christian Democrat  Party, headed by party secretary Mino Martinazzoli and including  Parliament whips Gerardo Bianco and Gabriele De Rosa.    The premier then met with the Socialist delegation, led by  secretary Ottavio Del Turco, who reiterated his party's support  for Ciampi, and then the delegation from the Liberal Party, from  which secretary Raffaelle Costa bowed out given that he is a  member of the government, responsible for transportation.    Ciampi is slated to meet later in the day with the Social  Democrats, European Federalists, the Democratic Party of the  Left (PDS), Northern League and the Republicans.    Consultations will continue tomorrow with meetings with the  Greens, Communists, the neo-fascist MSI [Italian Social  Movement], Network, SVP [South Tirol People's Party] and the UV  [Valdostan Union].    The Christian Democrats held a press conference after  meeting  with Ciampi and stressed the need not to rush into early  political elections. Martinazzoli ruled out the hypothesis of  linking general political elections with those for the European  parliament, to be held in June. He said it was necessary to  "hold early elections in the spring" and then stressed the  importance of first passing several key bills before parliament.    Whether or not Ciampi's government can count on a majority  in  parliament will be verified in the parliament during the debate,  Martinazzoli added, and said the Christian Democrats would not  be alone in backing Ciampi.    Among the key bills which Martinazzoli felt should be passed  before early elections were those dealing with the right to vote  for Italians abroad, the [Justice Minister] Conso bill on  preventive custody and two bills linked with the government's  economic and finance policy.</p>

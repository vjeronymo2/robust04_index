			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Leeds Permanent rises to Pounds 246m A fall of almost Pounds 50m in provisions for bad and doubtful debts helped Leeds Permanent Building Society, the UK's fifth largest, report a 32 per cent increase in pre-tax profit for the year to the end of September, taking it from Pounds 186.2m to Pounds 245.8m. The drop in provisions - from Pounds 131.1m to Pounds 82.2m - also assisted Leeds Permanent's net interest income, which rose to Pounds 458.4m (Pounds 425.8m), through a reduced charge for irrecoverable interest. Non-interest income was flat at Pounds 104.6m (Pounds 104.2m), although a further Pounds 9.1m was set aside as statutory reserves for the life insurance subsidiary which became operational in July. Mr Malcolm Barr, chairman, said the society - which has been without a chief executive for more than 18 months - was now closer to making an appointment than it had been six months ago, and that a statement would be made in 'a matter of weeks rather than months'. It seems unlikely, however, that a new chief executive will be appointed before the end of the year. Mr Roger Boyes, finance director, said that against the background of a relatively flat mortgage market, he saw prospects for growth coming from non-core areas such as sales of life insurance and unit trusts. It would be important, he said, both to ensure that the organisation's infrastructure could deliver service at a low cost and to develop new areas of business. However, the society had no immediate plans to take advantage of the greater powers which had been proposed by the government to set up a wholly-owned general insurance business. Leeds' recurring administrative expenses rose by a little less than 4 per cent to Pounds 226.1m, and costs of a further Pounds 22.6m were incurred in a voluntary redundancy programme. Total assets rose slightly to Pounds 20.6bn (Pounds 19.5bn). Mr Boyes said that Leeds Property, the society's estate agency, had reported profits of Pounds 360,000. He admitted that these were modest and said that over the last few years it had delivered much less mortgage business to the society than had been hoped. The society was fully committed to the estate agency, he said, but 'all parts of the business are constantly under review'.</p>

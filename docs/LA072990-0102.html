Five of his employees -- Pedro Pinzon, 30; Josue  David Pinzon, 23; Rony Havive, 30; Alvaro Ruiz, 39; and Mauro Casares, 64 --  are free on $25,000 bail. Another defendant, Paringer Singh, 39, is free on  $15,000 bail.  </P> <P> Officials are trying to extradite another of Ives' employees, Najuum Isaac, 30,  from Israel to face charges.

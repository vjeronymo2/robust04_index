			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Description: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The information requirements in this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule are essentially monitoring and recordkeeping requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encompassing critical control points in the production and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection of fish and fishery products as established in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HACCP plans of processors and importers. The specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information collected and the frequency of collection will depend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on such factors as the species and the processing conditions. It  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will include observations of processing parameters such as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time and temperature of processing and storage; the condition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raw materials; the results of chemical and microbiological tests;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the sanitation conditions in a processing facility; the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corrective actions taken in response to processing deviations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> etc. Records identifying production lot codes and date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacture will also be maintained. Records will be maintained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the processing facility or at an importer's place of business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for 1 year after the date of preparation in the case of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refrigerated products and at least 2 years for frozen products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This information will be used by FDA investigators during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regularly scheduled inspections of processing plants, or at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time of entry of imports, to determine whether products were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processed under sanitary conditions and processed, packaged,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stored, and distributed using HACCP control techniques to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards that might cause the products to be adulterated. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information will also be used when necessary to trace and remove  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially hazardous products from the marketplace.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Records of processing conditions will also provide a means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for processors to monitor the quality of their products and to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alert them when a deviation from the critical limits established  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the HACCP plan has occurred that may create a potential public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> health hazard in the final product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The figures provided below reflect an FDA estimate of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> annual hours of monitoring and recordkeeping based upon currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available data and assumptions about the effects of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in proposed part 123. The estimate is based on data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to develop cost estimates for the economic impact analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by Executive Order 12866 and thus is subject to the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of uncertainties described elsewhere in this preamble. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, the agency has anecdotal evidence that the burden on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> firms that are operating under a mandatory HACCP system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by the State of Alaska is more nominal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, FDA acknowledges the possibility that the estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided here are conservatively high, indicating recordkeeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdens that are higher than would customarily be the case. FDA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically invites comments on this point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

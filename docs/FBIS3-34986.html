			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Da'ud Talhami, member of the political bureau of  the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP] and  its principal spokesman, has stated the following:    The extensive negative reaction among various circles of the  Palestinian people, inside and outside the occupied territories,  to the Cairo agreement shows a broad popular and political  dissociation from the administrative self-rule plan and its  backers. It also shows the extent of popular resentment to the  concessions that were made and to full compliance with Israel's  "security" conditions and requirements.    While the Cairo agreement's content proves the veracity of  the Palestinian democratic forces' analysis of the  Oslo-Washington accord and its substance, represented in the  redeployment of the occupation--not its withdrawal from Gaza and  Jericho--it also clarifies the dimensions of the Oslo accord and  the ensuing dangers for the future of the land, the cause, and  Palestinian rights. Moreover, it removes all the wrapping from  demagogic statements that have sought to present the accord in  favorable light and convey the opposite of its content.    In return, this grave development in a series of retreats  before Israeli conditions opens the way to expanding and  organizing the popular movement opposed to the accord through  the inclusion of new forces and figures in the ranks of this  movement. After the announcement by some forces and  personalities, especially the People's Party and Dr. Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi, of their opposition to the Cairo agreement, the  DFLP's invitation to them to join the ranks of Palestinian  democratic forces and the large national opposition force  derives renewed credibility. This invitation aims at  establishing the broadest alignment to defend Palestinian  national rights and the future of the land, of Jerusalem, and of  the people in the homeland and the diaspora. It also has to  confront, isolate, and foil the Oslo-Cairo agreement in  preparation for providing alternative conditions ensuring a  comprehensive solution that responds to the resolutions of  Palestinian, Arab, and international legitimacy.</p>

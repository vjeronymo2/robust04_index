			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the </F> Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, by an unidentified announcer;  from the "Picture Versus Picture" program -- live]    [Excerpts] [Announcer] Here in the Picture Versus Picture  studio we have Dr. Jadranko Prlic, prime minister of the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna. Good evening. Thank you for finding  time after your long meeting in the Presidential Palace to come  here to explain the circumstances under which this meeting took  place and, of course, the whole story of the signing ceremony in  Geneva tomorrow. First of all, at their meeting today Croatia's  state and political leadership and 140 representatives of the  Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina discussed the  implementation of the Washington Agreement. What is your  impression of the meeting? It went on for quite a long time.  Does that mean that there were disagreements?    [Prlic] It was a frank meeting. First of all, various views  were voiced. But, in my view, not for a moment did the meeting  question the existing policy of the Croatian Democratic Union  [HDZ] and its implementation, the policy embodied above all in  the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna and, by implication, in the  concern for all the Croats who continue to live beyond the  borders of the Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna but remain the  concern of the relevant bodies in the Croat republic of  Herzeg-Bosna.    As I said, the talks were frank and ended in an atmosphere  of  support for the Washington Federation Agreement. Of course,  there were various views on the maps as published yesterday, or  rather the day before yesterday. This is understandable, one  day after the event every new version, every new map provokes  different reactions depending on the location. However, when  all this was seen in the context of realizing the Croatian  interest in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the interests of all Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and in view of the opportunities the  agreement will give to the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the  conclusion was reached that, nevertheless, this agreement will  help to realize the fundamental goals of the Croatian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Announcer] I can see that you have stubbornly and  tendentiously been insisting on saying the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna. Does it exist and will it exist, and to what  extent does what you call the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna  correspond territorially to the maps agreed upon in Vienna?    [Prlic] I have not been tendentious in any way. One can,  without being tendentious, speak about something, about what he  wants to do....    [Announcer, interrupting] I mean, you deliberately placed  stress on that.    [Prlic] In the areas under the control of the Croatian  Defense Council [HVO] the people and all refugees from other  areas are being born and die as citizens of the Croat republic  of Herceg-Bosna. Birth and death certificates, the flag--in  other words, the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna is a reality, it  is an instrument that has made it possible for us to attain the  goal that we have just achieved. The Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna is a state mechanism that helps to secure the care,  the logistics, wages for HVO units and fighters, tens of  thousands of them, for the police of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna, for all those employed in education, in primary  and secondary schools, the University of Mostar, health workers,  pensions. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] When you speak about the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna, do you also include the two so-called mixed  cantons?    [Prlic] The Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna will continue to  exist until the agreement on the federation between Bosniak  Muslims and Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina is implemented. We  will not allow a vacuum in this process. Life must go on, daily  needs must be met, and we are here to remain to the end. Later,  this will be transformed into the authorities in individual  counties and mixed cantons, and in the methods as agreed in the  agreement on the Constitution.    [Announcer] When you said that the meeting in the  Presidential Palace was frank, that differing views were put  forward, I expect that among these differing views the most  controversial one was the mixed, so called Mostar-Neretva  Canton....    [Prlic, interrupting] And the canton of Central Bosnia.    [Announcer] This came as a surprise to the people of  Herceg-Bosna.    [Prlic] Well, in some way it did. But in view of the  alternatives, I consider this solution a better one. It is a  guarantee to both the Croat and the Bosniak Muslim people that  they will be able to exercise parity within the two mixed  cantons of Central Bosnia, and the area from Konjic to the point  where Bosnia-Herzegovina has access to sea, i.e. Neum. I think  that what is ahead of us are different forms of struggle. No,  not a struggle, but of a normal life of fighting to realize  one's national rights, language and all that stems from it,  economic goals. More prominence will have to be given to  willingness, common sense, ability, more than is the case in  war. In other words, capability will have to be given more  prominence.    [Announcer] Listening here in Zagreb to the voices coming  from Herzegovina, it seems that the people there are most  surprised by the fact that Medjugorje and Citluk [predominantly  Croat towns in western Herzegovina] come under one of the mixed  cantons.    [Prlic] So what?    [Announcer] Well, I do not know. The people seem to be  worried about it. Are you saying they have no reason to be?    [Prlic] Well, the people are worried. The first reaction  was, why is Citluk, which in addition to Grude is the most  Croatian of all municipalities including Croatia, and former  Yugoslavia, within the mixed canton. However, Citluk will  remain Citluk, Medjugorje will remain Medjugorje, the Virgin  Mary [vision of her reported in Medjugorje] and everything  connected with her will remain there, and I cannot see why being  in the mixed canton should threaten it in any way.    [Announcer] Let us now take a look at this other Croatian  canton, the Bosnian Posavina Canton. It seems to me that the  proposal for its size is rather generous--it is based on the  census of 1990, but most of the territory of this canton is  controlled by Serb units. In your opinion, what will happen to  this corridor that seems to be of exceptional importance to the  Serbs. Should it be severed in some way or not?    [Prlic] This is a matter of political consent. We heard from  Geneva today about this agreement between the foreign ministers  on the division of the total territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina--51  percent for the Bosniak Muslim-Croat federation, that is 49  percent for the Serbs, which I do not believe will be the final  version. I think there are many other options involved in this  game, and that we have still not found the definitive solution.  What we now have in Bosnian Posavina was a lasting objective of  ours....[pauses] Those who said: Look at all the refugees, we  have lost something, when will this be returned....[pauses] I  primarily value the opinions of those who invested something in  this because war always has its own laws that differ  considerably from those in peacetime. I believe that the Bosnian  Posavina people have the right and opportunity to return to  their homes, although this will be very difficult to accomplish  through political dialogue. However, we should not disregard  other options.    [Announcer] How do you view what the five powers have  concluded in Geneva--they are in favor of the cease-fire  agreement, they advocate the 51-49 percent solution, yet they  also support a single Bosnia-Herzegovina in its internationally  recognized borders.    [Prlic] What else could they have said? The world will not  set a precedent so easily--it will not withdraw the  international recognition of any state. Since the United States  is backing this integrity, this option will be relevant.  Whether it will be accepted as the final solution remains to be  seen.    [Announcer] Let me ask you one more question: In view of the  Washington Agreement and all other future options in  negotiations with the Serbs--do you think the Croatian identity  [Hrvatstvo-- Croathood] is threatened anywhere in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Prlic] The Croatian identity is threatened in many parts  controlled by the Muslim and Serb Armies. There is quite an  outflow of people. A Herceg-Bosna Chamber of Deputies  delegation will be leaving on a visit to the Croats in Bosnian  Krajina on Monday [16 May], this will be a three-day visit. We  expect this to materialize, we hope that they will not only stay  in Banja Luka, but that they will go to other places as  well--there are 2,000 Croats in Teslic, they also live in  Mrkonjic Grad, Sanski Most, and Prijedor. The Croats living in  these areas are a matter of constant attention and concern for  the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.    I wish to say that the implementation of the peace agreement  and the federation agreement is going well, despite all the  difficulties. We have managed to achieve freedom of movement,  we signed relevant protocols with the Sarajevo government--for  example, our tax and customs system has been accepted in its  entirety. We have regulated the free flow of not only  commercial goods, but also of humanitarian convoys, including  those belonging to international humanitarian organizations. We  have formed a mixed group for drawing up a program for the  return of refugees. We are particularly interested in this  because many more Croats have left the regions now controlled by  the Muslim Army than is the case with Muslims who have left  areas now controlled by the HVO. Therefore, the return of  refugees is one of our vital interests. I wish to say this  openly and clearly--this is of primary importance to Croatian  policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The realization of the construction of the overall  power-generating system in Bosnia-Herzegovina is already under  way, this also applies to the water supply system and the  railway line from the sea toward Sarajevo. These are only some  of the measures taken so far. [passage omitted]    [Announcer] Just a procedural question that does not seem to  be unimportant: Will tomorrow's signature in Geneva be submitted  for approval to your parliament's Chamber of Deputies?    [Prlic] The Chamber of Deputies session will be held before  the constituent assembly--this was agreed this evening--and the  constituent assembly is expected to ratify these acts because  some of them have altered the federation's constitution adopted  at the first session of the constituent assembly [sentence as  heard].    [Announcer] So you believe that this will be accepted by the  Chamber of Deputies.    [Prlic] All or almost all members of the Chamber of  Deputies,  all members of the bodies of the HDZ for Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  the government of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna were  present today. Judging by what was apparent, all this was  accepted. So I do not believe any problems could crop up in  this regard.</p>

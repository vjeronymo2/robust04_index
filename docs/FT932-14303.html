			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Bank of Japan set to intervene over yen's rapid rise: Currency's appreciation against the dollar is threatening to choke off the country's export growth THE BANK of Japan was this morning standing ready to intervene in foreign exchange markets in an attempt to arrest the yen's rapid rise against the US dollar which threatens to choke off Japanese export growth. It is thought the BoJ is preparing to defend a rate of Y110 to the dollar. The BoJ intervened twice yesterday but it is thought extremely unlikely there will be co-ordinated intervention with other central banks to slow the yen's rise. The dollar closed down Y1.95 at Y111 in Tokyo trading after President Bill Clinton's remarks in Washington over the weekend that a stronger yen would help to cut Japan's trade surplus with the US. Mr Clinton's remarks, which came after similar comments several weeks ago from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, confirmed Japanese officials' suspicions that Washington's policy on the yen has shifted sharply within the new Democrat administration. Senior finance officials say their understanding was that the US had been happy with a rate of about Y120 to the dollar. Mr Bentsen's support for a stronger yen were regarded by some officials as off-the-cuff remarks and not necessarily a guide to US policy. However, Mr Clinton's comments after his weekend talks with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, seem to confirm the US administration's determination to talk up the yen. The US approach is seen as a central ingredient of a much more assertive approach to macro-economic and trade relations with Japan. The yen's rise has provoked a mixed response among Japanese politicians. Mr Miyazawa and Mr Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, a leading policymaker in the ruling Liberal Democratic party, both supported the BoJ's move. Other senior LDP leaders, including Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, finance minister, stressed that the US and Japan were in agreement that sharp fluctuations in the yen's value were undesirable. Mr Hayashi said he was perplexed by the yen's rise, which helped to undermine the recent rally in the Tokyo stock market, with the Nikkei index closing 185.52 lower at 20,112.34. The fragility of the Japanese economy was yesterday underlined by a 0.3 per cent contraction in the money supply last month compared with March last year. The decline marked a reverse from the modest expansion of the money supply in February, which indicated the end of a five-month contraction starting last September. The BoJ also revised down the February rise in the money supply to 0.1 per cent from its initial estimate of 0.2 per cent. The central bank believes the fall in the money supply has probably reached its bottom but that it will not resume growing until the economy recovers. The BoJ expects money supply growth will only resume once corporate demand for bank borrowing increases, which is likely only when industrial production rises. The contraction was partly due to the surge in the yen's value against the dollar which has reduced the yen value of foreign currency deposits, the BoJ said.</p>

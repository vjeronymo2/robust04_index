			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Restore link with Iraq, says Heath The UK's diplomatic links with Iraq should be restored for political and humanitarian reasons, Sir Edward Heath said yesterday. The former prime minister said the diplomatic situation was unhelpful to British interests. He has just returned from Baghdad where his talks with Iraqi president Saddam Hussein led to the release of three Britons serving long prison sentences on charges of entering the country illegally. He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: 'Our ambassador in Amman and his staff do everything they can from outside. It is not the same thing as being there on the spot and being able to use our judgment about what is going on.' He said that the Russian charge d'affaires was looking after British interests and doing a good job. 'But why do our activities have to be handled by the Russian charge?' he demanded. Sir Edward warned that UN sanctions were not affecting the Iraqi president's standing in the country. 'This action does not make Saddam's people hostile to him. It puts them on his side because they resent very strongly the way they are being treated.' Sir Edward urged that talks should start with Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi deputy prime minister. The situation was alienating other Middle Eastern countries which wanted to resume business with Iraq. Meanwhile, Lady Olga Maitland, Conservative MP for Sutton and Cheam, called for international action to free foreign nationals still held in Iraq after the Gulf war. She said there were 625 Kuwaitis and 61 foreign nationals from more than 30 countries in Iraqi jails.</p>

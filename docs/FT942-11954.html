			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt The market for German government securities is in a grumpy mood. With little trading in the underlying bunds - most price movements are driven by trading in derivatives - the market reacts with oversensitivity to whatever may be perceived as bad news. This week's bad news is likely to come from two sets of economic data due in the next few days - details of order intake and industrial production for March. To the extent that the data show evidence of recovery in the German economy, they will unsettle a market already weakened by the knock-on effects of the US interest rate environment. Mr Holger Fahrinkrug, an economist at Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft in Frankfurt, predicts that manufacturing orders will increase by 0.5 per cent month-on-month, which corresponds to a healthy 6.5 per cent annual increase. He thinks industrial production will be unchanged month-on-month, but after February's rise of 1.2 per cent that means an annual rate of 0.2 per cent. If these robust figures cause nervousness in the markets, there is also scope for disappointment at tomorrow's outcome of this week's repo operations. After a 23 basis point cut in this key rate in the past two weeks, the scope for further reduction this week is limited.</p>

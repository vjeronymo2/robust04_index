			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chrysler to Trim Output at 3 Plants: Production rates at three Chrysler Corp.  assembly plants will be cut in March, resulting in the indefinite layoffs of  more than 2,000 workers, the company said. Spokesman Doug Nicoll blamed the  moves on slow sales. The cuts are due at Chrysler's plants in Belvidere, Ill.;  Newark, Del., and Toledo, Ohio, which make some of the company's most  profitable cars and Jeeps.  </P></p>

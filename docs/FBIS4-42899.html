			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Werner Hofer] </F>   [Text] Attentive customs officials in the area of the  Linz-Hoersching airport have prevented an illegal export of war  materiel. Spare parts for Russian MiG fighters were involved.  The security authorities have not ruled out that the shipment  was intended for the war zone in Bosnia.    Twelve crates were delivered by truck to Hoersching on  Tuesday [7 June] and stored intermediately at the customs office  there. The goods arrived from a CIS state. Security authorities  have so far not revealed which one. The truck entered the  country at some border crossing. The freight documents were  issued in cyrillic letters. They were not translated by the  customs officers. Thus, no one knew that the consignment  contained spare parts for MiG fighters. The documents  themselves were fine. When the goods were stored at Hoersching  airport, attentive customers had the documents translated. Then  the suspicion arose that war materiel might be involved the  import and transit of which is not permitted. The freight was  to be transported to Amsterdam from Hoersching. Officially, the  spare parts were to be forwarded by air freight from there to  India. However, the security authorities do not rule out that  the MiG spare parts were really destined for the war zone in  Bosnia.    The 12 crates were confiscated, and legal  proceedings--against unnamed individuals--have been initiated  given the violation of the war materiel law has been initiated.  It has to be clarified whether the truck drivers knew what the  sealed crates contained.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Three parliamentary commissions -- for  constitutional issues, for foreign relations, and for the  protection of human rights and freedoms -- at a joint session  held in Sarajevo today discussed issues concerning  Bosnia-Herzegovina's future state and legal constitution.  Merliha Colo reports:    [Begins Colo recording] The members of the parliamentary  commission at today's session discussed the general agreement  for the formation of a federation on those Bosnia-Herzegovina  territories with a majority Bosniak and Croatian population, and  a framework for the preliminary agreement on principles and  bases for the formation of a confederation between the Republic  of Croatia and the Bosnian federation.    Secretary General of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly [word  indistinct] Sampara explained the main provisions contained in  the general agreement on the federation of the Bosniaks, the  Muslims, and the Croats concerning the structure of the central  state authorities.    The agreement envisages that the assembly of the future  republic will consist of two chambers -- a chamber of deputies  and a chamber of peoples. The chamber of deputies will have 120  seats and will consist of deputies from political parties, while  the other chamber, the chamber of peoples, is seen as having 90  deputies -- 30 each from the Croatian and Muslim communities,  and 30 from other ethnic groups.    The president and vice president of the state, as well as  the  prime minister and deputy prime minister, would be from each of  the ethnic groups, while the foreign minister and defense  minister could not come from the same ethnic group.    Several members of the commissions said that the existing  draft is more generalized that it should have been and, as such,  does not answer numerous questions concerning the future  constitutional-legal order of the Bosnian federation as well as  purely procedural matters, for example, in what manner will the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly and its bodies take part in the  passing of a future constitution.    The presentation by Dr. Haldo Causevic was interesting. He  pointed at several terminological imprecisions in the agreement  that create dilemmas and hide legal traps. For example, it is  not defined whether by forming the new federation, the state and  legal sovereignty of the existing Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  will be forfeited and whether the new state community will be  able to inherit its rights.    The agreement is also not precise in the part in which it  outlines the territories of the future state, while the  territories and the peoples are the two pillars of each state.    In deciding about these and other controversial issues, not  a  single step further must be made without activating the work of  the republican assembly, which must adopt a stance toward them,  it was concluded at today's session of the republican assembly  commissions.

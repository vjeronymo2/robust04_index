			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow holds up despite receding rate cut hopes Wall Street SHARE PRICES were little changed yesterday after investors shrugged off comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, which appeared to rule out another interest rate cut, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished just 6.49 up at 3,251.57, the index having rarely strayed from its overnight close all day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was a slight 0.01 easier at 413.76, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks failed to hold on to an early gain, ending 0.76 off at 633.37. New York SE turnover came to a moderate 200m shares and rises narrowly outpaced declines by 949 to 753, an indication of the market's underlying firm tone. Although investors remain sensitive to changes in monetary policy - recent gains have been fuelled by hopes of another interest rate reduction - they chose to ignore statements by Mr Greenspan yesterday which indicated he was satisfied that the last interest rate move, a one percentage point cut in the discount rate on December 20, would be sufficient to spur the US economy towards a solid recovery. Attention focused on individual corporate stories, in particular on quarterly results. Goodyear Tire climbed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 61 3/8 after announcing fourth-quarter income of Dollars 105.1m, a big improvement on the Dollars 11.6m earned at the same stage of 1990. Corning Glass declined Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29 7/8 and Dow Chemical lost Dollars 1 to Dollars 56 1/4 as the controversy surrounding the silicone breast implants manufactured by Dow Corning, jointly owned by the two companies, continued. Following a delayed opening due to an order imbalance on the buy side, Greyhound rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 10 3/8 on the American Stock Exchange after an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker issued an initial buy recommendation, arguing that the company, which emerged from bankruptcy last October, is well positioned to benefit from its role as the only US national bus operation. Deere &amp; Co advanced Dollars 1 initially but ended only Dollars  1/4 up at Dollars 51 5/8 in the wake of an upgrade from Bear Stearns, the broking house, which now rates the agricultural equipment maker's stock a 'buy'. First Fidelity Bancorp firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 33 3/4 after Alex Brown &amp; Sons added the stock to its 'emphasis' list for institutional clients, citing the group's capital strength, asset quality improvement and operating efficiencies. On the over-the-counter market, Medical Graphics jumped Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 16 1/4 in active trading after the US Food and Drug Administration granted approval for the company's pulmonary function diagnostic system. Canada WEAKNESS in commodity prices led to moderate losses in Toronto stocks. Causing the market to ease further towards the end of the day was the US Treasury auction of three-year notes, which produced results weaker than expected. The composite index ended 10.6 down at 3,597.8, with declining issues leading advances by 305 to 289. Volume totalled 29.4m shares. Finning fell CDollars 1 to CDollars 13 1/8 after the company announced a loss of CDollars 1.3m in the fourth quarter, against a profit of CDollars 4.0m a year earlier. Alberta Natural Gas reported lower income from continuing operations in the fourth quarter, but the stock gained CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 13.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BAKERSFIELD POSTS UPSET OF CSUN IN VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> The end of the 1989 women's volleyball season was expected to be a time of  pleasurable reflection for those associated with the Cal State Northridge team.  </P> <P> After a decade of dominance on the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Division  II level, the Lady Matadors are bound for the big time next season.  </P> <P> What better way to celebrate its move to Division I than to accomplish the  usual -- earning a berth in the national finals?  </P> <P> "Excellence in the '80s" was CSUN's team slogan and Coach Walt Ker announced  early that Northridge was more motivated than ever to go out on top.  </P> <P> So much for the best-laid plans.  </P> <P> Cal State Bakersfield squashed CSUN's plan for an 11th consecutive trip to the  Division II quarterfinals, upsetting the third-ranked Lady Matadors, 16-14,  15-6, 15-13, Friday night.  </P> <P> And, yes, upsetting is an appropriate term.  </P> <P> Northridge (26-11), which had won 13 of its past 14 matches, was outdug,  outserved, outhit and perhaps outfoxed by the 11th-ranked Roadrunners.  </P> <P> Bakersfield (18-15), which had split its previous four matches this year  against Northridge, juggled its lineup and adjusted its hitting patterns in the  West regional final.  </P> <P> "We came back from losing to Northridge at the Air Force tournament (in  November) and said 'Assuming we're going to get Northridge in the regional,  this is what we'll do,' " said Bakersfield Coach Dave Rubio, a Ker protege.  </P> <P> Bakersfield's Rachel Morton, normally a middle blocker, was moved to outside  hitter and Roadrunner players were instructed to tip down the line in an effort  to break up CSUN's blocking pattern.  </P> <P> "We were tight at first," said Rubio, who played for Ker at CSUN and Granada  Hills High.  </P> <P> "But once some of the things we had been practicing started to work, it gave us  that much more confidence."  </P> <P> Down, 10-4, in the first game, Bakersfield scored 10 consecutive points en  route to a 16-14 win.  </P> <P> "They never broke down," said CSUN's Allisa Evans, a senior outside hitter.  </P> <P> "They played great from point one to 45. They excelled in every facet of the  game, from beginning to end. Everything we tried, they handled."  </P></p>

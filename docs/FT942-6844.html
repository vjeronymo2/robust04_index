			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (6): Crumbs of comfort for pessimists - Philip Coggan assesses the prospects for Britain's economy Long experience of the UK economy has made observers deeply cynical. Even after the so-called 'Thatcher miracle', the long 1980s boom ended as so many had done before it, with inflation rising sharply and the current account slumping into deficit. So it is not surprising that many fear the current UK recovery will eventually run into the same problems. Throughout 1993, the pessimists were repeatedly disappointed. Growth was stronger and inflation lower than they had expected. Indeed, interest rates and inflation were at their lowest levels for a generation. Such conditions were all the more remarkable when one considers the policy vacuum which followed sterling's ejection from the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992. Many commentators thought that inflation was bound to revive 12-18 months later, as it had done after previous devaluations. They evidently under- estimated the deflationary pressures which were present in the world and UK economies. In early 1994, the oil price dropped back, in real terms, to the levels reached before the first oil shock in 1973. The debt hangover from the late 1980s boom has made both companies and consumers nervous about borrowing: broad money supply growth has been sluggish in the UK. Central banks remain vigilant against inflation and have kept real interest rates at high levels, despite deep recessions. Nevertheless, all the above factors may merely be cyclical, rather than structural. One does not have to look too hard at the economic statistics to find evidence that the UK's old problems may return: a pick-up in the rate of growth of average earnings, a high budget deficit, a trade account that stayed in deficit throughout the recession and is now widening, an excess of private consumption and a lack of investment. An equally forthright school of thought believes that the current recovery will be too feeble to bring much prosperity to the average Briton, or to make much of a dent in the unemployment totals. The tax increases introduced by Chancellors Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke, which will raise between Pounds 15bn and Pounds 17bn over the next three fiscal years, are expected to prove a drag on economic growth. Often, these debates about the prospects for the UK economy become bogged down in sterile arguments about the size of the 'output gap'. According to this theory, there is a trend rate of output growth. If the economy is growing above the trendline, capacity constraints are likely to cause inflation, as they did in the late 1980s. If the economy is growing below the trendline, there is a 'gap', and the country can enjoy non-inflationary growth. The problem is that there is no consensus on the trend rate of growth, nor on the size of the output gap. Pessimists, like Mr Bill Martin of UBS, think that the gap is small and that 'the economy is structurally deficient, having neither ample spare capacity nor an adequate internationally-trading sector.' But the International Monetary Fund estimates an output gap of 4-5 per cent which, if correct, would allow the UK many years of non-inflationary GDP growth at, say, 3 per cent. International investors might prefer to look back at the UK's long inflationary history and reflect that, when push came to shove, the monetary authorities have always gone for the easy option of devaluation and inflation. Economic policy was perceived to be in ruins after sterling's departure from the ERM. Piece by piece, the authorities have put together a monetary framework designed both to gain credibility with the financial markets and to allow the UK economy to recover. The Bank of England now has a much more prominent role. It publishes a quarterly inflation report and has the responsibility for the timing of interest rate moves. The theory is that 'political' influences on interest rate moves should be avoided, although the chancellor still has the final decision on whether to change rates. When the minutes of the monthly meetings between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England were first published in April, they duly showed that the former was much more keen on cutting rates than the latter. Publication of the minutes may give the governor more power, since if the chancellor were perceived to be recklessly ignoring his advice, that information would soon be common knowledge. But the real test may come when it becomes public knowledge that a chancellor has overruled the governor's desire for an increase in interest rates to combat inflation. Financial markets do not yet seem ready to accept the anti-inflationary credentials of the new system. There is certainly a perception that the Bank is much more keen than the chancellor on getting inflation down to the lower half of the 1-4 per cent target range. The other traditional British problem, the balance of payments deficit, is a further source of debate. The deficit appears to be deteriorating; on the current account, from Pounds 1.8bn in the third quarter of 1993 to Pounds 2.6bn in the fourth quarter; and on visible trade, from Pounds 1.77bn in 1993's fourth quarter to Pounds 2.12bn in the first quarter of 1994. The official statistics also appear to show that British exporters used the devaluation to raise prices, rather than to increase their market share. Thus, the trend in trade is much worse in volume, than in value, terms. However, doubt is cast on these figures by the Confederation of British Industry's survey, which appears to show that exporters have been cutting prices. And the switch to the Intrastat system of collecting statistics (based on VAT receipts, rather than customs returns) for trade with the European Union has led some to believe that the new figures are understating imports. Doubts about the quality of the statistics make it even more difficult than usual to be definitive about the economy's prospects. But for a government seeking re-election in 1996 or 1997, neither of the two most likely scenarios have much appeal. The first is that the economy will accelerate and run into balance of payments and inflationary constraints, causing the authorities to slam on the monetary brakes. The other is that growth will continue at a modest, non-inflationary pace but without creating the 'feel good' factor of rising prosperity and low unemployment that makes voters smile on governments.</p>

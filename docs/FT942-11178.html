			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / International Company News: Canadian Pacific in rail merger talks Canadian Pacific plans to reach agreement with the federally-owned Canadian National Railways (CN) for a merger of their eastern Canada railway systems late this month, said Mr William Stinson, CP's chairman. The deal could take effect from January 1 1996. Both sides believe the merger is the only way to deal with overcapacity in eastern Canada and federal officials support the strategy, Mr Stinson said after CP's annual meeting in Calgary. 'Overcapacity is draining hundreds of millions of dollars yearly from both railways,' he said. 'Trade routes have shifted more north-south and we have hundreds of miles of non-profitable track.' CP's western rail system, which has been expanded to carry rising volumes of export wheat and other commodities, is profitable and would not be part of the merger. A new company 50 - 50 owned by CP and CN would operate the eastern system from Manitoba to the Maritimes. 'CP Rail's results must be brought into line with those of the best US railroads,' said Mr Stinson. CP has sold assets to concentrate on rail and sea transport, oil and gas, coal, hotels and property. CP's first-quarter profit was CDollars 17.2m, or 5 cents a share, after a CDollars 7m special charge, against CDollars 21.7m, or 7 cents, after a special gain of CDollars 28.5m a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 1.6bn, against CDollars 1.47bn. Operating income gained 45 per cent to CDollars 224m.</p>

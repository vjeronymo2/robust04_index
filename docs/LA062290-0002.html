			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KIRKPATRICK ON DEMOCRACY IN A CHANGING SOUTH AFRICA  </P> <P> Jeane Kirkpatrick seems to like the word "democracy." She uses it or a  derivative six times in her column ("A Color-Blind Peace Depends on Democracy,"  Commentary, June 11): I do not know what her definition of democracy is.  </P> <P> I am sure that most of the people of the world including those in South Africa  have little idea of the meaning, advantages and responsibilities of a  democratic government. Kirkpatrick speaks of "democracy and comfort for  whites." Does she equate privilege with democracy? If there is no privilege,  will there be no democracy?  </P> <P> Kirkpatrick failed to tell us of the relative sizes of the constituencies of  African National Congress (ANC), Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC) and Inkatha. In  her words "PAC (is) a rapidly growing black-consciousness party." She calls ANC  "a Marxist-style national liberation group" and "a fundamentally Leninist  liberation movement." She refers to Inkatha as "a Zulu-based democratic party,"  (that) "emphasizes nonviolence, pluralism and the market economy." Her use of  the phrase "market economy" leads me to believe her main interest is a stable  society where a person can engage in profitable activities and not be too  concerned with "liberation movements."  </P> <P> I am not a wholehearted supporter of the ANC, although I feel some sympathy  because I believe that it was born out of the blood, sweat, tears and deaths of  its members. Is Inkatha a creature of our people? If it fails is the PAC a  fallback position? I don't think Kirkpatrick is willing or qualified to answer  these questions. Certainly, The Times has someone who has been there and can  enlighten us.  </P> <P> CARLYLE SMITH  </P> <P> Sun Valley  </P></p>

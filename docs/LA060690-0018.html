			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE FACULTY UNION SWITCH VOIDS PROPOSED 3-YEAR CONTRACT  </P> <P> Faculty members at Antelope Valley College in Lancaster have voted to dump  their current union in favor of a more militant group, voiding an already  negotiated three-year contract proposal that would have included substantial  pay raises.  </P> <P> With the campus now on summer session, college officials said a new contract  deal and related pay raises for the campus' 360 instructors probably could not  be drawn up before fall.  </P> <P> In results from the hotly contested election, which were tallied Tuesday,  college teachers voted 141 to 123 to select the American Federation of Teachers  as their new collective bargaining agent. The AFT will replace the California  Teachers Assn.  </P> <P> Under the contract negotiated by the CTA, the college's 103 full-time  instructors would have gotten a 10% pay raise July 1, and at least 5% in both  the second and third years of the contract. The college's 257 part-time  instructors would have gotten a $2.50-an-hour raise to start, and an additional  5% in the second and third years.  </P> <P> Federation officials would not say whether they were unhappy with the wage  provisions of the contract proposal. But they did say the faculty's decision to  forgo the immediate pay raises showed the extent of its dissatisfaction with  the CTA's performance.  </P> <P> The AFT, which already represents office workers at the college, is expected to  present a tougher set of faculty contract demands, including one for a  grievance policy, something the college has resisted.  </P> <P> College President Allan Kurki declined to comment on the effect of the union  switch, except to say, "I am disappointed we've got to start negotiations over  again now. It had taken months for us to get to this particular point."  </P></p>

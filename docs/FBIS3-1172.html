			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel is to remain in  his post as the National Party [NP] premiership candidate in the  Western Cape, despite the uproar over the alleged involvement by  three police generals in a so-called third force. The uproar  followed the release of a report by the Goldstone Commission of  the involvement by the police and the Inkatha Freedom Party in  violence and arm smuggling.    A spokesman from Mr. Kriel's office said the minister  regarded the Goldstone findings as accusations and is awaiting  the result of the international investigation team appointed by  the state president.</p>

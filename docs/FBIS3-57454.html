A great deal has been done in the period since the creation  of the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense. Plans for the  organizational development of the Armed Forces and their  strategic deployment have been elaborated, and the relevant  directives have been sent to the troops and their implementation  has been organized. A certain amount of experience has been  built up in recruiting citizens to military service on contract.  The Armed Forces rear services support has by and large been  planned and organized quite well amid the complex economic  conditions in the state. A concept for the military training  system has been elaborated.    At the same time, not everything has gone smoothly in the  organizational development of the Russian Armed Forces. Certain  errors have been made in the organization of the command and  control of the troops and cadre and training work. Military  communications, which are markedly lagging behind world  standards in their development, are generating serious  criticism. Cooperation with local administrations in settling  questions of the draft to the Armed Forces has not been  established everywhere in a clear-cut way. There are also other  shortcomings which primarily require the responsibility and  professionalism of the military leaders in order to be overcome.    The main aim of the conference which has been held, Pavel  Grachev noted, is to expose our shortcomings and blunders in  time. To assess them. And find ways of solving problems. The  correct conclusions will be drawn in the Armed Forces, the  minister stressed, and all the necessary measures will be  adopted to ensure the state's security effectively.    [Signed] The Russian Federation Ministry of Defense  Information and Press Directorate</p>

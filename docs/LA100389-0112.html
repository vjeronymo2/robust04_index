			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AISSA WAYNE FILES SUIT AGAINST  ATTACK SUSPECTS  </P> <P> Charging that she was the victim of terror and intimidation, Aissa Wayne on  Monday sued a Los Angeles private detective and two men who allegedly attacked  her and a companion in Newport Beach last fall in connection with Wayne's  attempts to get custody of her daughter.  </P> <P> Wayne, the daughter of film legend John Wayne, also is suing ex-husband Thomas  Gionis, the Pomona surgeon who allegedly orchestrated the attack. Wayne and  financier Roger Luby were bound, threatened and assaulted by a pair of  intruders at Luby's Newport Beach mansion on Oct. 3, 1988.  </P> <P> Gionis and the three men named in the civil suit filed Monday in Orange County  Superior Court in Santa Ana -- detective O. Daniel Gal, Jerrel Lee Hintergardt,  and Jeffrey K. Bouey -- are all awaiting criminal proceedings in connection  with the assault.  </P> <P> At Gionis' instructions, Gal allegedly trailed Wayne and hired Hintergardt and  Bouey to carry out the attack on her, prosecutors assert. Prosecutors charge  that Gionis intended the attack as a warning to his ex-wife in their bitter  dispute over custody of their daughter, Anastasia.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge granted Gionis custody of the child early this year,  finding that Wayne was "emotionally immature." But that order was rescinded and  Wayne was given temporary custody after the criminal allegations against Gionis  were revealed.  </P> <P> The lawsuit filed Monday also names as defendants George J. Stephan, who has  represented Gionis in some of his legal battles, and Stephan's employer, the  Los Angeles law firm of Wood, Lucksinger and Epstein. The suit seeks damages  based on allegations of terror, assault, battery, false imprisonment, wrongful  interference with parental relationship and negligence.  </P></p>

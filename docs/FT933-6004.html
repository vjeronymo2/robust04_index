			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (6): Vehicle of growth - The role of the car industry MALAYSIA has a dream, called Vision 2020. The idea is to achieve the economic status of an industrialised nation by the year 2020. Its car industry is one of the ways that it sees of getting there. Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional, or Proton, produced its first car in 1985. The country's 'First National Car Project' was seen as the means of expanding the nation's engineering skills and manufacturing capabilities. In conjunction with Mitsubishi of Japan, the government set up the plant and Proton began to motor. By 1992, the company accounted for more than 67 per cent of the domestic car market, was exporting to 17 countries, and had established a sizeable sales network in the UK. Delighted at this progress, the Malaysian government announced Proton's partial privatisation and a second car project. From the beginning, the government's intention has been to use its car industry as a way to develop an engineering sector. By supplying its own industry, it hoped to iron out any start-up problems, so that it could move on to the world stage as a fully geared up supplier of cars and subsequently of components. Local content was the name of the game, and Proton was playing well. British consultant engineers were imported, to the disappointment of the manufacturer's Japanese partners, and Hicom, the government controlled heavy industrial holding company, began manufacturing car parts. Fuel tanks followed radiators and exhaust systems on to the local content list. Success is measured only partially in the 102,800 units that Proton produced in the year to March 31 1993. More significant for the government were the 200 car component companies that emerged, including more than 70 which were producing for the original equipment market. A ban on external sourcing of more than 30 components had helped to take the local content of motorcycles assembled in Malaysia to more than 75 per cent, Proton to over 60 per cent and other passenger and commercial vehicles to more than 30 per cent by the beginning of this year. By 1993, the country could boast 13 vehicle assemblers, including Proton, with a total installed capacity of 306,000 units of motorcycles per year, and 202,000 units of passenger and commercial vehicles, none of which was 100 per cent externally sourced. As for the second national car project, the government claims that it will not eat into Proton's sales but will offer a variant of a Japanese 660c model aimed at the market below the Proton's price range. In collaboration with Daihatsu of Japan, it aims at a 1994 start-up to produce 20,000 cars a year. The government has taken steps to ensure that any market contraction will be felt first by imported vehicles. Hire purchase limits, introduced in 1991 to moderate domestic demand, were amended in April 1992 to exempt cars costing less than MDollars 40,000, which Protons do. The rules were subsequently lifted altogether, but the slowdown they prompted cut the sales of the dearer imported cars. Sales of non-Protons fell by 25 per cent between 1991 and 1992. Import tariffs have also been used to sharpen the price differential between locally assembled cars, parts for which are charged at between 13 and 40 per cent, and completely built car imports, charged at 140 to 300 per cent: and are anyway limited to 10 per cent of the market. But Proton has been ailing in its own right of late. Sales in the financial year to the end of March 1993 were down nearly 2 per cent on the previous year. The setting for the decline was a slowdown in Malaysia's motor industry as a whole, after marked growth from 1988 to 1991. In terms of sales, commercial vehicles fell by nearly 57 per cent to 35,054 in 1992, compared with 81,099 in 1991, while passenger vehicles fell 13.5 per cent to 117,773. The decline at home made Proton all the more determined to export. By the end of April 1993, it had exported 66,183 cars, of which 56,821 were to the UK, where it has gained from the demand for cheaper cars in recessionary times. There is even talk of an overseas plant, in Indonesia, or maybe in Chile. The outlook for Proton certainly rests on its success as an exporter. Malaysia's own demand could not support one car manufacturer, let alone two. It is also exposed to foreign exchange risk because of its yen-based costs, which one industry analyst suggests were as high as 45 to 50 per cent in 1992. It can offer cheaper labour costs than many of its competitors, but lacks economies of scale. At the end of the day, Proton is an anomaly. It exists to feed a nation's greater need, and it is likely to receive all the protection it needs to survive, until its survival is no longer tied up with Malaysia's Vision.</p>

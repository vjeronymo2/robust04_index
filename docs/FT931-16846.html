			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / (CORRECTED) Europe comes down to earth to look for common ground - A new realism across the Continent Correction (published 5th January 1993) appended to this article. 'EUROPE is not a melting pot like the US', the Swiss professor said in impeccable English at the office of a Californian multinational in French-speaking Geneva. 'It is a salad - and we must learn to manage diversity.' But can the chefs in Brussels concoct a meal to satisfy the diverse palates gathered at the feast? In Switzerland, apparently not. Only days before Prof Stephane Garelli, regional chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, spoke of the European salad, Swiss voters had rejected entry into the European Economic Area - the European Community's waiting room - despite his appeal for a Yes vote. As commercial Europe opens its doors today for the first full day's business in the single market, the big question is: will the Euro-diet prove too rich for all its citizens' tastes? A 12-day odyssey in unscientific pursuit of western European public opinion confirmed that, in the very broadest terms, the EC and its amorphous goal of 'ever closer union' is still approved by a substantial majority - at least on the continent of Europe. A growing body of opinion says the pace being set by a remote EC leadership is too fast and even, some say, too far. Germans speak of their fears for the D-Mark. The French are openly concerned that Brus-sels is no longer behaving like a fully owned subsidiary. Yet from the deserted streets in Elsinore, Hamlet's Danish fortress of Euro-doubt, through dithering Switzerland to the federalist heartlands of Alsace and Baden-Wurttemberg down to Brussels-besotted Madrid and the Anglo-Levantine bazaar of Gibraltar, one opinion was also shared: like it or not, last month's Edinburgh summit has got the stalled European juggernaut rolling again. The new cement of European solidarity is worry that an overbearing Eurocracy, daydreaming over expense account lunches, is unaware of the recession being endured by taxpayers. The Community's popularity was faltering long before Denmark's No and France's much-derided petit oui in last summer's referendums. To Mr Karlheinz Reif, head of the European Commission's opinion pollster, Eurobarometer, changes in attitudes could be detected as far back as 1989, even in such avowedly pro-EC countries as France and Italy. A growing awareness of the imminent single market began to drag perceptions of Europe down from the clouds. It would influence individual lives and, hence, for the first time, became worthy of critical scrutiny. Maastricht, Mr Reif says, brought something already lurking in the back of the European psyche out into the open: 'Ordinary Europeans have stopped seeing the EC as peace and security and have started looking at it more closely.' It is in the nature of views that the topography depends on the vantage point of the spectator. Furthermore, few, if any, believe that they have any chance of altering the landscape.                         *      *      * That sense of political impotence was tangible among Danes on the 17.44 stopping train from Elsinore to Copenhagen. With the ink on the Edinburgh summit conclusions barely dry, Mr Poul Schluter, the prime minister, had claimed with a politician's characteristic hyperbole 'a great day for Denmark'. Cradling a bouquet of treaty opt-outs, he warned his fellow citizens that they must now choose between EC membership or leaving the Community. In one carriage, however, his upbeat tone had fallen on cynical ears. Sannah Jensen, a 24-year-old student, confessed many doubts but said she would vote Yes again. Attributing anti-EC feeling largely to residual anti-German nationalism from the 1864 war and the summer tide of tourists on Denmark's beaches, she said: 'Every honest Dane says that now we have 11 countries that want to do something, we don't have a right to say you can't do it.' Yet only a few metres away, Brigitte, a nutrition student, fervently disagreed. She pledged to vote No again to register her fury that her first vote now appeared to have been arbitrarily invalidated. 'How many times are we to vote? The government is trying to browbeat us with scare tactics - it seems everything has been decided a long time ago.'                         *      *      * Similar fears of manipulation were shared, in altogether different circumstances, some 700 miles away in Liechtenstein, the tiny principality tucked up next to eastern Switzerland and linked to its neighbour by a 70-year-old customs union. But was the Liechten-steiners' convincing vote to join the EEA a gesture of independence from Berne after the Swiss's No vote a week previously? Or was it a statement of dependence on the wider European market? In a triumphant news conference, Prince Hans-Adam II praised his 30,000 subjects for following his persistent cable TV campaign to vote 'Yes to Europe'. Yet both sides in Liechtenstein were united at least by agreeing that their quest was not for Utopia but merely the least bad option.                         *      *      * It is a measure of the anxiety being generated by the combination of recession and the European debate that Switzerland shuddered in self-doubt after the referendum outcome in its tiny neighbour. Much has been made of the schism in the Swiss poll on the EEA between the German-speaking cantons' No and the French-speakers' Yes. Yet in the big German-speaking cities, the Yes vote was also a majority. It was conservative rural voters who bedecked their cars with appeals to 700 years of neutrality and freedom. With total Swiss unemployment up from 19,000 in August 1990 to 130,000 today, cold economic winds are playing their part in the debate, undermining the nation's traditional view that it is safer out than in. 'Five years ago we barely discussed EC membership,' one nationalist proclaimed. 'Now we discuss nothing else.' In urbane, metropolitan Geneva, the peasants' revolt is brushed aside by executives at the US-based computer company Hewlett-Packard. Representing 35 nationalities and speaking a dozen languages, they earn in Swiss francs but often enjoy the lower French cost of living across the border. 'The Swiss are naturally cautious,' said one. 'They have voted once. They will vote again and again until they come round.'                         *      *      * Such sentiments are shared in the European Parliament in Strasbourg where ideological differences nearly dissolve in the multi-partisan objective of a deeper, wider Europe fit for Euro-politicians to play in. If absolute power corrupts absolutely, then practically no power seems to do much the same. On the day Mr John Major was greeted with boos and hisses and Mr Jacques Delors declared 'time is on our side', it was hard not to conclude that diversity of opinion is no more welcome in Europe's political capital than it was in the Soviet Union. In the words of Belgium's Mr Willy de Clercq, a one-time European commissioner: 'We in the parliament believe Maastricht was too little, too late.' And, indeed, that progress towards a united Europe was 'not fast enough'. But whose views do these people's representatives actually represent? In more than 60 interviews across the continent, only one European voter argued that the pace of union was too slow. Mr de Clercq now heads a committee charged with explaining to the citizenry that 'those who want to stop in the middle of the river are going to drown'. But was that what Europeans really wanted? Mr de Clercq was dismissive. 'I think it is more or less known what the European citizen wants', he said, contradicting himself only minutes later when he agreed with Mr Delors' statement that the Community was a good product that was proving hard to sell.                         *      *      * What, in that case, can be sold to humble mortals on terra firma? At the Mercedes-Benz plant in Stuttgart or the Citroen repair shop in Lyons, few use such esoteric Euro-terminology as Mr Delors' 'variable geometry' to describe their plans for the future. From cities where memories of the second world war are still vivid, most workers remain loyal to Monnet's and Schuman's vision of European unity. But it is the recession, immigration and jobs - and Brussels' apparent powerlessness to address these issues - that are canteen talk in the German plant, now on an extended Christmas lay-off, and worry the redundancy-riven workshop in Lyons. Of the MEPs interviewed in Strasbourg, it was Mr Bruno Gollnisch of France's widely despised, extreme-right National Front, who seemed to be addressing many of these 'live', if unfashionable issues. But his nationalist solutions appeared to have surprisingly little resonance in Stuttgart. Only the Ossis - the former citizens of East Germany - proved decidedly illiberal compared with their western compatriots. One of these, Steffen, a maintenance worker, insisted the Community was 'all right as it is, and should remain so', but he firmly rejected a single currency and demanded immigration controls. His colleagues from further east differed only over who should be allowed in. 'We could come in more or less straight away,' said a Hungarian, 'and maybe the Czech lands . . . but the rest should stay out.' In Mr Gollnisch's home territory of Lyons, the most overt racism among diners at Les Six Troyens restaurant appeared to be against the foot-dragging British. But among the younger French clientele, a 'Maastricht, Non' psychology is growing. 'European unification means one government,' said a bearded travelling salesman. 'That was Yugoslavia before, and look at it today. . . '                         *      *      * Only in Madrid was it possible to encounter levels of European rapture capable of registering on the de Clercq scale. At the Fundacion March, a group of post-graduate political scientists groped to explain why Spanish public opinion was so universally uncritical towards the Community and its works. 'It is a choice between Africa and Europe,' said one cynic with a sheepish grin. Another more reflectively proposed: 'Only people - like the British and Danes - who think the government of the Community is less responsible than their own can afford the luxury of questioning it.'                         *      *      * Back in Switzerland, Prof Garelli, former director of the World Business Forum at Davos, contends that the Single European Act was the catalyst for a single market modelled on the business agenda for the so-called 'Bankers' Europe' so detested by left and hard right alike. It was now the duty of the politicians, he said, to make their programme relevant to popular demands. A cursory rummage though continental public opinion suggests that the Maastricht equation needs retuning if it is to achieve that end. If not, there is a danger of creating a divided Community: a middle-class adventure playground, full of opportunities for the multilingual executive with any eye to the main chance, but for the less privileged, a bleaker place, prone to destructive extremism. Away from politics, however, it is not all bad news. Inch by inch, month by month, human European bonds are strengthening. The transport network grows yearly more remarkable, the frontiers less notice able. British pub bores can now drone on about the roadworks on the Autoroutes, but they do so over warm beer. The Spanish still guard their eccentric working hours and the Greeks their cheap cigarettes and affluent German tourists. As yet, the bratwurst in a croissant has still to be invented. CORRECTION Professor Stephane Garelli, a consultant to Hewlett-Packard, was incorrectly described yesterday as the company's regional chief executive. That position is held by Mr Franco Mariotti.</p>

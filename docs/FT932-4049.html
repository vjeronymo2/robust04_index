			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Tokyo divided on whether downturn is over A FIERCE argument over whether the two-year downturn in the Japanese economy has come to an end has broken out among the highest ranks of the Japanese government. The debate comes after a senior economic minister yesterday announced the recession had bottomed out. Mr Hajime Funada, the minister in charge of the Economic Planning Agency, one of the weakest ministries in the Tokyo pecking order, delivered the assessment to a monthly ministerial meeting to assess the economic outlook. Mr Funada said: 'After carefully observing economic movements I am sure that the economy has hit bottom.' For the last three months the EPA's diffusion index of economic indicators has suggested the economy is recovering. Mr Funada's assessment provoked a sharp rebuke from the powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) which believes it is too early to say the recession has reached its trough. Miti's position is supported by senior bankers, industrialists and retailers. Mr Yuji Tanahashi, Miti's vice minister, emphasised there was no consensus within the government over the state of the economy. He said Miti believed the bottom of the recession was at least two or three months away. The EPA alleges that Miti is more pessimistic simply because the business lobbies which the industry ministry represents want to maintain pressure on the government for further public spending to boost the economy. For their part Miti officials dismiss the EPA's forecasts because the agency persistently underestimated the scale and intensity of the downturn. The Bank of Japan, which is cautious about prospects for recovery, will weigh into the debate today with its closely watched quarterly survey of the state of the economy. The dispute within the government, which has been joined by industrialists and bankers, reflects a widespread belief that the next few weeks will mark a critical period, as the Y24,000bn (Pounds 146.8bn) the government has pumped into the economy over the past year in emergency spending measures feeds through into the private sector. Business leaders generally back Miti's stance. Mr Masami Tachikawa, chairman of the trust companies association, said still stagnant consumer spending meant that 'nobody can say the economy is set for a smooth recovery.' Mr Isao Nakauchi, Daiei department store chain president, said: 'As far as personal consumption is concerned it can hardly be said that the domestic economy has hit bottom.'</p>

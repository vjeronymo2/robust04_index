Supreme Court Judge President Desalegn Alemu Kibret said in  a  press statement that the two defendants the court knows to be in  custody have been ordered to appear before court on 10th January.    Mr. Kibret said that although the prosecutor has the right  to  revoke the charges he had levelled at the accused, but this  should be made clear to the court which handled the case, and  added that, if not, neither the prosecutor nor any other  authority has the right to release the individuals who have been  jailed under a court order.    Accordingly, the Supreme Court has ordered the central  investigation to bring the two defendants before court on 10th  January and summoned Justice Minister Mehitema Soloman and  deputy prosecutor, Zeru Meles, Prison Police Chief Yemane Fisea,  and Central Investigation head Zeray Yihdego to give  explanations on the same day how the two were released without  the court's order.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The applicable renewable oxygenate requirement (15 percent or 30 percent) applies year-round. The requirement is measured on an oxygen-equivalent basis (i.e., credit given according to the oxygenate content of the RFG) and is based on a per gallon oxygen content of 2.0 weight percent which is consistent with the minimum per gallon oxygen content standard in the RFG program. However, the renewable oxygenate requirement must be met on an annual average basis and need not be met on a per-gallon basis. This requirement applies to all refiners or importers of reformulated gasoline and/or RBOB. It does not apply to oxygenate blenders, pipeline operators, or terminal operators, though such parties are required to abide by any restrictions regarding the type of oxygenate that may be blended into RBOB provided by refiners. Specifically oxygenate blenders, pipeline operators and terminal operators will have to adhere to the RBOB blending limitations not only of the RFG final rulemaking, but also the additional limitations resulting from today's rulemaking. If a state exercises the option discussed in section III.G of this notice to address shoulder season concerns, the enforcement requirements on terminal operators may be slightly altered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Refiners and importers of reformulated gasoline are also permitted to generate and trade, on a nationwide basis, credits earned from use of renewable oxygenates in excess of the applicable minimum requirement to other producers desiring to use a lesser volume of renewable oxygenates. Such credits can be used to satisfy part or all of a refiner's renewable oxygenate requirement for the same calendar year that the credits are earned. No banking of credits between calendar years is allowed. The averaging and trading provisions established today for the renewable oxygenate program will have no adverse environmental impact since today's action does not alter the VOC, toxics, and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emission performance standards for reformulated gasoline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effect of these averaging and trading provisions is to greatly expand the flexibility afforded refiners, particularly during the initial startup of the program. While the renewable oxygenate program takes effect for refiners beginning December 1, 1994, individual refiners do not need to blend any renewable oxygenate into their gasoline until later in the year or at all if they so desire. They will just have to demonstrate that they met the requirements over the course of the entire year through either the blending of greater than 15% renewable oxygenates in the latter part of the year, or the purchase of sufficient credits from other refiners. As a result, the averaging and trading provisions effectively provide refiners with additional time to meet the initial requirements of the program, and allows them to smoothly ramp up their use of renewable oxygenates during the course of the first year to the full 30% requirement in 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The renewable oxygenate requirements are placed at the refinery level and will apply to reformulated gasoline sold in all the covered areas, including the opt-in areas and the two covered areas in the State of California (Los Angeles and San Diego). Details of the enforcement program are discussed in section IV of this notice. Refiners who produce reformulated gasoline for use in California beginning in March 1996 are exempt from most federal reformulated gasoline reporting, recordkeeping, and similar enforcement requirements. As a result, refiners producing California reformulated gasoline are not currently required to distinguish between gasoline volumes sold in Los Angeles or San Diego and gasoline sold in other parts of California. However, the renewable oxygenate provisions promulgated today will apply to reformulated gasoline sold in Los Angeles and San Diego, as discussed in section IV of this notice in greater detail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency received a number of comments concerning impacts of the program on VOC emissions during the ``shoulder season.'' After considering the issue, EPA has decided that a limited change to the program to address the shoulder season concerns is warranted. As discussed in section III.G, EPA has included in the final rule a provision which would allow EPA to extend the limitations on the blending of certain renewable oxygenates which exhibit volatility-related commingling effects to the shoulder season within individual states upon receipt of a petition from the Governors of the states if certain requirements are met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Renewables Requirement and Definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Renewables Definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition of renewable oxygenates adopted in this final rule has been expanded from that contained in the proposal, but nevertheless it is intended to limit credit toward the renewable oxygenate requirement to those oxygenates which EPA expects to yield net fossil fuel savings. The final definition is structured so as to exclude from the renewables definition oxygenates produced in their entirety from nonrenewable sources such as coal, oil, peat, and natural gas due to their non-renewable, fossil nature. The definition includes oxygenates derived wholly from renewable biomass sources including but not limited to corn and other grains, other food products, and cellulosic plant material. It also includes oxygenates derived from waste products such as waste cellulose and plastics, sewage, sawdust, scrap tires, and methane recovered from landfills. EPA recognizes that some of these waste products may have been derived from fossil hydrocarbon sources. Including these sources in the set of permissible feedstocks will not by itself result in increased generation of such wastes, however, and hence will not increase consumption of materials which can be used as fossil fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition excludes waste products that are untransformed from their original fossil fuel form. As a result, methane captured from landfills would qualify as a renewable feedstock but natural gas currently flared at the wellhead or refinery would not qualify as a renewable feedstock, since it would be used in its untransformed state as an oxygenate feedstock and is in fact a fossil fuel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It should be noted, however, that the definition includes oxygenates whose oxygen content comes from another renewable oxygenate. As a result, ethers derived from renewable alcohols and isobutylene which was produced from oil or natural gas would qualify as a renewable oxygenate, whereas ethers derived from nonrenewable alcohols would not qualify regardless of the source of isobutylene.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defence correspondent] </F>   [Text] The United Nations must grasp the current valuable  opportunity for a ceasefire and peace in Bosnia by sending extra  peacekeeping troops, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said  today.    The full extent of the willingness of other countries to  contribute extra forces to peacekeeping operations in the former  Yugoslavia would become clear within 24 to 48 hours, he said.    "Two or three countries have already indicated a very  positive response which we welcome," said Mr Rifkind.    "We will know over the next 24 to 48 hours at most whether  it  is a small number of contributors or a wide range."    Mr Rifkind was speaking after Sir David Hannay, British  Ambassador to the United Nations, chaired the first of a series  of meetings in New York to discuss an urgent UN plea for 10,650  more men to join the peacekeepers.    The British initiative will bring the 19 countries -- mostly  from Europe but including the United States and Argentina --  together for a second informal meeting tomorrow.    Mr Rifkind said agreements around Sarajevo, the Croat-Muslim  ceasefire in central Bosnia and the Serb agreement to reopen  Tuzla airport were significant changes for the good.    "What we may be seeing is a creeping ceasefire," he said.    "These changes do represent something quite important and a  valuable window of opportunity that could lead towards peace in  Bosnia."    He stressed: "We are anxious that this opportunity should  not be missed. We think it is important that all countries that  can make an important contribution should, and do so to the  maximum extent they can."    Mr Rifkind said it would not be right for him to identify  those "two or three" countries willing to contribute.    But they are understood to include Turkey, which has so far  been prohibited from taking part in peacekeeping operations in  Bosnia because of its extensive historical links with the  region, which it ruled for centuries under the Ottoman Empire.    But officials hope to persuade UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali to lift the ban, particularly as Russia --  traditional allies with the Serbs -- plans to send more forces.    Britain is ready to send a second infantry battalion based  on  The Duke of Wellington's Regiment from Tidworth, Wilts., which  is equipped with 72 Saxon armoured vehicles.    The British UN force commander in Bosnia, Lieutenant-General  Sir Michael Rose, has warned that ceasefires could collapse  unless more troops were sent to police front lines.    Mr Rifkind said: "We have indicated our willingness to play  our part. I think there will be a lot of thought being given in  national capitals today.    ``If events of the past few weeks should continue and there  is an opportunity for achieving peace in Bosnia then the UN and  member countries will want to play their part in maximising this  opportunity in bringing it to a satisfactory conclusion.''</p>

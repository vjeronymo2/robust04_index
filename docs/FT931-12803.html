			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: Bouygues advances by 7% to FFr680m BOUYGUES, the French construction group, saw its net profits rise by 7 per cent to FFr680m (Dollars 127.7m) in 1992 from FFr635m in 1991, according to provisional figures published yesterday. The company, which last month won a FFr530m contract in Hong Kong to build a new football stadium and new headquarters for the Jockey Club, has not allowed for possible provisions on its losses on the Channel tunnel project. Bouygues, one of the largest construction contractors on the Channel tunnel, has been in dispute with Eurotunnel, the tunnel operator, over payment for its work on the project. In 1991, it made a provision of FFr123m for its share of the losses on the scheme. The group, like other construction companies, has been affected by the sluggish state of the international building and property markets. Its overall sales fell by 4.4 per cent from FFr64.3bn in 1991 to FFr61.5bn last year. Mr Martin Bouygues, chairman, has been rationalising the group in an attempt to withstand the competitive state of the construction sector.</p>

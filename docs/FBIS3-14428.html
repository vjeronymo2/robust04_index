			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. </F> 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, in Amman, by Ramadan Husayn, in Cairo,  date not given; from the "Dialogue from Afar" program--recorded]    [Text] [Husayn] Welcome in our program.    [Al-Majali] Thank you.    [Husayn] Prime Minister, His Majesty King Husayn has just  ended a Gulf tour that took him to the Sultanate of Oman and  Qatar. This tour coincided with important developments on the  Arab scene. What was the outcome of that tour?    [Al-Majali] We are going through a delicate phase. His  Majesty King Husayn always makes a point of exchanging views  with his brothers the Arab leaders. His visits to Qatar and  Oman were in this context. His Majesty is an advocate of Arab  reconciliation and coordination. He does not want a new order  to emerge in the region without all the Arab brothers being  actively involved in shaping it.    [Husayn] Dr. al-Majali, Jordan and Egypt held intensive  consultations with the sides of the Yemeni crisis. The Yemenis  then signed the Pledge and Accord Document in Amman. Soon  afterward, disagreement surfaced again in Yemen. Is Jordan  currently engaged in any mediation efforts to resolve the crisis  in Yemen?    [Al-Majali] Since the onset of the Yemeni crisis, the Yemeni  president and vice president have been in touch with His Majesty  King Husayn, who they saw as able to settle the differences  between them. With characteristic patriotism and pan-Arab  enthusiasm, His Majesty worked closely with them until the  pledge and accord document was signed in Amman. Differences  then surfaced over the implementation of that document, but I  think that consultations are continuing and we pray to God  Almighty that the difficulties facing the implementation of that  document will be surmounted. What matters is that they have  succeeded in formulating a good document; and I think that  everyone is committed to it. There are practical obstacles  right now, but God willing, they will be overcome.    [Husayn] Mr. Prime Minister, the Arab League Council will  hold its 101st session a few hours from now. Would you tell us  about the Jordanian position on the issues on the agenda,  particularly Arab national security matters and the amendment of  the Arab League Charter?    [Al-Majali] Approximately half a century has passed since  the  Arab League Charter was written. The number of member states  has increased and the international scene is no longer the same.  Therefore, we believe that the charter should be revised. We  also believe that there is a need to revise the UN Charter, not  just the Arab League's. This charter [not further specified]  should take into account the changed international scene, or  risk being outdated. That is one thing.    Also, we believe that the Arab League should be a forum for  discussing the new order in the Arab world. The Arab world  should strive for more cohesion and solidarity so as to be able  to avoid the type of disasters that have befallen it due to  divisions in its ranks and a certain lack of communication.    [Husayn] Dr. al-Majali, will Jordan press for a change in  the  original text of the charter or does it support the view that a  new addendum would suffice?    [Al-Majali] Actually, I think that the charter's original  text should be amended. But if the Arab brothers agree on an  addendum and if that addendum is as binding as the original  charter, this would be a mere technicality. What matters is the  spirit in which the charter's amendment is made or the addendum  formulated.    [Husayn] Mr. Prime Minister, how do you see the situation  now, following UN Security Council Resolution 904, which  denounces the Hebron massacre, and in light of the current  consultations concerning providing international protection to  the Palestinians?    [Al-Majali] We hope that the spirit of this resolution will  find practical expression. The Palestinians are in desperate  need of protection, both during the negotiations and the  transitional phase, the phase we hope will begin soon. We want  this protection to be provided. Practical measures should be  taken in this regard.    There must be a clear vision on the other [Israeli] side.  The Israelis must abandon the fears they had in the past. The  Hebron massacre proves the absurdity of talk about the  settlements remaining where they are. These settlements are bad  news for peace. The United States has expressed this view  hundreds of times, as did the whole world. Therefore, there  must be enough boldness to take the right step and remove these  settlements, because they are quite a serious obstacle. I am  aware that the two sides agreed that the settlements will be  discussed in a later stage of the negotiations, but it is clear  that the presence of settlements and the attacks by settlers are  responsible for delaying the current negotiations.    [Husayn] That is right. What is happening on the  Jordanian-Israeli track of the talks?    [Al-Majali] The situation is this: We believe in a just and  comprehensive solution and want to see progress on all tracks.  At the same time, we believe that every track has its  particular nature and features. As we move along, we keep an  eye on what is happening on the other tracks, because it is in  the interest of all sides, including the Israelis, that a  comprehensive solution emerge, rather than isolated agreements.  Isolated agreements would only strengthen the hand of those who  oppose peace and wish to wreck what we may achieve.    Therefore, I believe that we have to move forward. We hope  that Israel is as serious as we are in this regard so that the  peace process can advance on all tracks.    [Husayn] Thank you.    [Al-Majali] You are welcome.</p>

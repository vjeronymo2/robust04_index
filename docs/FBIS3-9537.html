Petrus said the demonstration of 25 February 1948, also in  Prague's Old Town Square but in support of the communist coup,  "was not done by the unions. The victorious Communist Party  abused the unions." He said he promised Klaus that the "unions  would not let themselves be abused again by any victorious party  for a new February."    Petrus rejected Klaus's statement yesterday that the  demonstration had been organized by "a partial group of people".  The trade union leadership was not a partial group, he said.    He said the unions regretted the incidents surrounding  Minister of Employment and Social Affairs Jindrich Vodicka's  attendance (Vodicka was prevented from addressing the  demonstrators). But Vodicka had not been invited was himself to  blame.    The demonstration, attended by 40-50,000 people according to  union estimates, was a watershed in the work of the unions,  Petrus said. "We realized discussions alone were impossible  because you can only talk with somebody who wants to listen," he  said. Petrus did not comment on the unions' next moves, saying  it was for the congress to decide.    Demonstration participants appealed to parliament to  consider  their demands concerning the making of repeated contracts, the  position of pregnant women and mothers with small children, the  increase in the pension age, the management of money set aside  for pension insurance and the ban on trade union activity in the  civil service.</p>

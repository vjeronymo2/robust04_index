He told  party workers in west Belfast: "The Unionist veto prevents  political movement and makes the achievement of consent  impossible." Mr Adams hinted, however, that if the right  signals flowed from the Downing Street declaration an IRA  ceasefire could not be ruled out.    "I have to go back to the May 10 situation, where Sinn Fein  negotiators with the British government delegation meetings and  the political basis and perameters for them, and at the British  request a proposition was put to the IRA to suspend its campaign  and the IRA agreed to do that and then the British walked away  from it.    "On the one hand that makes the situation all the more  dangerous because of the way the British Government tried to  abuse that process. "But on the other hand, the IRA have been  very positive about the Irish peace proposals put by myself and  John Hume.    "There is still the opportunity for peace and Sinn Fein is  committed to ensuring the British Government doesn't squander  that opportunity." Mr Adams accused the Government of being an  obstacle in moving the peace process forward. He said: "Their  inability to come to a definitive attitude or to decide whether  this declaration fits into the overall peace strategy is tied  totally to the British clarification.    "In other words, the sooner they provide this clarification  the sooner Sinn Fein can come to conclusions. The only logical  reason for the British refusing clarification can be that they  are working to their own political agenda."</p>

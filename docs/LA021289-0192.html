			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STING IN CHICAGO SHOWS FBI'S NEW SKILL AT CRACKING 'CRIME IN SUITES'  </P> <P> When FBI agents posing as representatives of a bogus Arab sheik began arresting  congressmen for bribery nearly a decade ago in the famed Abscam sting, there  were cries of outrage on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> Similar expressions of shock and anger were heard last month when it was  disclosed that FBI agents pretending to be commodities traders had spent months  secretly tape recording conversations in the pits of the world's two largest  futures exchanges here.  </P> <P> "This wasn't a cocaine ring. This, at best, was a little white-collar crime,"  Thomas A. Crouch, a commodities broker who dealt with one of the undercover  agents, complained to a Chicago newspaper.  </P> <P> Dozens of traders and brokers at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago  Mercantile Exchange have unexpectedly found themselves entangled in what  appears to be the most ambitious and sophisticated undercover operation ever  launched by the Justice Department.  </P> <P> The Chicago undercover operation is graphic evidence to business executives who  hide behind legitimate and often complex enterprises that they are not immune  to the investigative tools developed over the years to go after criminals  ranging from common burglars to mobsters.  </P> <P> Indeed, as prosecutors and the FBI grow more adept at mounting undercover  operations, they are turning their new skills more and more often on what U.S.  Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh recently called "crime in the suites."  </P> <P> But the use of these invasive techniques, coupled with the tough federal  racketeering law, has prompted a chorus of protests from the pits of the  commodities exchanges to the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal -- just  as Abscam evoked howls from the halls of Congress.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dismisses Complaints  </P> <P> "Part of the concern is that white-collar people who commit white-collar crimes  don't like to consider themselves a part of the same social class as the Mafia  or as the people who commit street crimes," said Geoffrey Miller, a  constitutional law expert and dean at the University of Chicago Law School. "So  they really object when their homes are searched or their telephones are  bugged."  </P> <P> Anton R. Valukas, the U.S. attorney in Chicago, has heard plenty of the  complaints over the last few years and last few weeks. He finds no merit in  them.  </P> <P> "I don't think that just because people have a position of wealth or power in  the community that they ought to be immune from prosecution," Valukas said last  week in a rare interview. "That suggests that those individuals somehow are  above the law or that we ought not use all the means at our disposal to  prosecute those individuals because the means are tough and harsh.  </P> <P> "To the contrary, I think that those are exactly the people who have  traditionally been beyond the law and against whom these methods and means  ought to be used."  </P> <P> Nowhere have undercover operations and racketeering laws been used more  effectively than Chicago, where recent targets have ranged from corrupt judges  and lawyers to city officials and police officers.  </P> <P> Chicago has become, according to law enforcement officials, an incubator for  the type of aggressive white-collar prosecution likely to turn up elsewhere in  the country. One Chicago operation even had the title "Operation Incubator."  The expertise gained here now is being shared with prosecutors from coast to  coast.  </P> <P> A close examination of the earlier Chicago operations, particularly at the  effective techniques for persuading people to cooperate, offers a glimpse of  how the current commodities investigation may proceed in the coming months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grown More Daring  </P> <P> The examination also reveals how federal investigators have grown more daring  and ambitious in combating white-collar crime since the end of the J. Edgar  Hoover era at the FBI.  </P> <P> During his 48 years as director, Hoover prohibited agents from operating  undercover in criminal investigations because he feared his men would be  corrupted by such firsthand contact with criminals.  </P> <P> After Hoover's death in 1972, the bureau began to develop an interest in  mounting undercover investigations. But the targets of those modest initial  efforts remained traditional criminals -- mobsters, thieves and drug dealers.  </P> <P> Even Abscam, the first undercover operation to capture the public's  imagination, started out as an investigation of art thieves with ties to  organized crime. It uncovered congressional corruption only by serendipity.  </P> <P> FBI agents lured congressmen to a Washington townhouse, where legislators were  videotaped accepting cash in exchange for promises of arranging favors for a  non-existent sheik. A senator, seven representatives and 11 others were  eventually convicted.  </P> <P> But it was through an investigation of corruption in the country's largest  municipal court system in Chicago -- Operation Greylord -- that the government  polished the art of the sting and laid the groundwork for its undercover  investigation of the commodities exchanges.  </P> <P> Greylord was an intricately scripted undercover operation that at times seemed  more like a made-for-TV movie than a federal investigation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hidden in Cowboy Boots  </P> <P> Phony criminal cases, complete with FBI agents posing as criminal defendants,  were manufactured and sent on their way through Chicago's courts. Courtrooms  and judges' chambers were infiltrated by undercover FBI agents acting as  attorneys and wearing concealed tape recorders. A real judge cooperated and  allowed the government to hide a tape recorder in his cowboy boots to document  offers of bribes.  </P> <P> Initial disclosures suggested that only low-level court personnel and one judge  had been caught in the three-year investigation. But, in a technique common to  undercover operations, prosecutors persuaded many small fry to provide  information against the bigger fish. For instance, police officers who had been  recorded taking bribes wound up providing evidence against the judges to whom  they had delivered the money.  </P> <P> Today, six years after the sting went public, more than 80 people have been  convicted of bribery, conspiracy and racketeering. Among them are 12 judges and  dozens of attorneys. And the government has lost only three cases.  </P> <P> Greylord demonstrated convincingly to top Justice Department officials the  value of undercover investigations, and the quality of the evidence they  generate.  </P> <P> "As aggressive as this office had been for over a decade in prosecuting  corruption in Chicago, we were never able to successfully prosecute judges  until we used the methods which were involved in Greylord," said Valukas, whose  father is a respected Chicago judge.  </P> <P> Miller agreed, saying: "Greylord really gave a tremendously good name to  undercover investigations of the sting type. You had a (criminal justice)  system that was unbelieveably corrupt and had been for years. The Augean  stables needed to be swept, and Greylord was excellent at doing that."  </P> <P> At the time the U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI were conducting Greylord, the  Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force in Chicago was operating an  elaborate undercover operation aimed at more traditional targets -- organized  crime and gambling.  </P> <P> In Operation Safebet, two FBI agents posing as businessmen took over a credit  card operation whose owner had come to the government in 1981 after being  shaken down by organized crime figures.  </P> <P> The business provided phony receipts for customers who used credit cards at a  couple of lounges near O'Hare International Airport that were fronts for  prostitution. Instead of showing that the credit card had been used at the  lounge, the receipt used the name of a legitimate-sounding business.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $970,000 Profit  </P> <P> Under the stewardship of the government, the business expanded to perform the  service for 15 to 20 lounges, gambling operations and escort services, many  operating under protection of mobsters and high-ranking officers in the Cook  County Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> By the time the undercover portion of the investigation was closed down in  1984, the credit card business had made a profit of $970,000 -- for the U.S.  Treasury.  </P> <P> And the illusion had been so successful that when the operator of an escort  service was confronted by one of the undercover agents flashing his FBI  credentials, she laughed and said: "Where did you get those? They look real."  </P> <P> So far, 58 people have been indicted on various federal charges as a result of  Safebet. Two of them are fugitives, two cases were dismissed and one mob  associate was found shot to death in a car trunk.  </P> <P> The 53 people convicted include several mobsters; five Sheriff's Department  officers, including the chief of intelligence and the head of vice; operators  of the houses, and two bankers who provided loans to crooks in exchange for  kickbacks.  </P> <P> As often happens in an undercover operation, information was turned up that led  to charges in unrelated crimes. Charges were brought in connection with an  unsolved murder, and a Colombian drug ring was broken up.  </P> <P> "This is the only time we've ever had a sting where we were able to show the  organized crime aspect of running an industry and the role of police and  political protection," said Gary S. Shapiro, chief of the organized crime  prosecution unit.  </P> <P> Other undercover operations were being conducted in Chicago and elsewhere in  the United States at the same time, including a successful penetration of  municipal corruption in Chicago that triggered a larger investigation in New  York City.  </P> <P> But Safebet and Greylord showed how effective and sophisticated such operations  could be. Greylord demonstrated that the government could penetrate places as  sacrosanct as a judge's chambers with electronic bugs and agents wearing wires.  In Safebet, the FBI operated a business successfully and gathered evidence at  the same time.  </P> <P> The experiences were combined in 1985 when the FBI launched the first of two  highly ambitious undercover operations aimed at the Board of Trade and the  Mercantile Exchange.  </P> <P> Within the government, they were known as Operation Hedgeclipper and Operation  Sour Mash, and they offered the prospects for an inside look at the highly  lucrative and arcane world of futures trading.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Serves as Central Casting  </P> <P> The first stage in a major undercover operation involves collecting enough  evidence to justify the expenditure of time and money. For example, the  government spent well over $1 million in laying the groundwork for the  commodities investigation. Potential targets must be deemed worthy of the  operation, the undercover portion must be viable and a convincing argument must  be made that the evidence is not available another way.  </P> <P> A proposal and budget for a big undercover probe, known as a Group One  investigation, is presented to a group of Justice Department lawyers and top  FBI officials in Washington known as the Undercover Committee.  </P> <P> Once a project is approved, the Undercover Committee serves as Central Casting  for the operation, providing names and qualifications of agents around the  country who can be brought in to play undercover roles.  </P> <P> "There is a whole pool of people in the bureau with special skills," said  Robert G. Long, an FBI agent in Chicago. "The guy who can pull it off as a  banker may not work out posing as a drug dealer."  </P> <P> In the commodities investigation, two young agents with backgrounds in  accounting were brought in from FBI offices outside Chicago. They used the  names Richard Lee Carlson and Michael D. McLoughlin and received training in  the commodities business with the cooperation of Archer-Daniels-Midland, a  major agribusiness that had complained to the government about the way the  exchanges were operating.  </P> <P> At least two other agents with similar backgrounds, who used the names Peter  William Vogel and Randy George Jackson, were brought in as the probe expanded.  </P> <P> The FBI created false backgrounds for the agents, listing previous employers,  Social Security numbers and educational references. They also set them up in  expensive apartments and bought them memberships at trendy health clubs so they  would fit in with their prey.  </P> <P> Some backgrounds were less than airtight. For instance, an official at Siena  College in Loudonville, N.Y., said there was no record of McLoughlin graduating  in 1981, although that was what McLoughlin listed on his commodities  registration form.  </P> <P> The official said, however, that Michael Bassett graduated from the school in  1980. Michael Bassett was the name the agent used when he confronted traders  during late-night visits to their homes to deliver grand jury subpoenas.  </P> <P> The registrar at St. Mary's College in Moraga, Calif., told The Times that the  school has records showing that Jackson graduated with an accounting degree in  1978. Quoting an unidentified source, the Chicago Tribune reported that the  records were created at the request of the FBI as part of the agent's cover.  </P> <P> But no one at the exchanges apparently checked the backgrounds, allowing the  agents to work alongside the traders and brokers for months, recording  conversations in an investigation that began unfolding last month.  </P> <P> If it follows the patterns of Greylord and Safebet, the commodities probe may  last years. The first charges, which could come within weeks, will likely name  small players, just as the initial Greylord indictments focused on low-level  police and court personnel.  </P> <P> The scenario is already being played out in lawyers' offices, with prosecutors  and before a special federal grand jury: Traders and brokers who did business  with the undercover agents have been subpoenaed and threatened with harsh  sanctions usually used against organized crime figures if they refuse to  cooperate in the government's efforts to catch bigger fish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Brokers Are Upset'  </P> <P> According to defense lawyers, some traders have already "flipped" and begun to  cooperate in the government's attempt to build cases against more influential  traders, supervisory officials in commodities firms and possibly executives at  the two exchanges.  </P> <P> "The ultimate targets may be higher-ups in the back offices who knew what was  going on and permitted it or benefited from it," said Susan Bogart, a defense  attorney and former federal prosecutor. "Flipping the low-level traders in the  pits would permit the government to obtain evidence which would explain the  execution of trades and the corresponding paper trail that could lead higher."  </P> <P> The elaborate and expensive commodities investigation is likely to be deemed a  success only if it moves beyond the traders in the pits of the exchanges and  implicates higher-ups the way Greylord did in the courtrooms. And that means  that, before the end of the investigation, more protests are likely from  targets and potential targets alike.  </P> <P> "The congressmen were pretty upset about Abscam and the judges were pretty  upset about Greylord," said Albert W. Alschuler, a criminal law professor at  the University of Chicago Law School. "And now the commodities brokers are  upset about this operation. But I don't know that the public is upset about  it."  </P> <P> Researcher Tracy Shryer in Chicago contributed to this story.  </P></p>

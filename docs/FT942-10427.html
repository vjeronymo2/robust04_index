			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Russian defence spending to surge President Boris Yeltsin, seeking to broaden his political support, has agreed to a 66 per cent increase in this year's defence budget in the biggest deviation yet from recent Russian fiscal commitments to the International Monetary Fund, according to a senior parliamentarian. A member of the lower house of parliament's defence committee told reporters yesterday that the offices of Mr Yeltsin and the prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, had agreed to increase defence spending from Rbs33trillion to Rbs55trillion in the 1994 budget. The increase appears to be part of efforts by the government to convince parliament to finally adopt a budget when it returns to the issue today. Mr Yeltsin appears keen to boost his domestic popularity and develop a working relationship with the conservative parliament he ushered in with elections and a new constitution last December. But the increase in defence spending, if implemented, will run counter to the spirit of the recent pledges of fiscal rectitude made by Moscow to the IMF in return for release of the second half of a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) reconstruction loan. 'If he cannot hold back the defence spending, Chernomyrdin will suffer a big blow to his credibility,' said Professor Anders Aslund, a former economic adviser to the Russian government. Mr Chernomyrdin led the final round of loan negotiations with the IMF two months ago. The parliamentarian, who declined to be identified, said the new defence figure was agreed during last week's parliamentary recess. It had initially been negotiated between the president's national security adviser and the defence and interior ministries. The increase followed an appeal last week by Mr Alexander Livshits, an economic aide to the president, for increased spending on defence factories and research institutes. Mr Livshits said this was necessary to 'compensate' for the government's failure to implement a policy of selective support for strategic factories and sectors. He also sought to prepare the ground for such increases by calling on the international community to react with understanding to Russia's inability to keep promises on inflation and budget targets made to the IMF. Mr Chernomyrdin had vowed to the IMF earlier this year that he would stick to a tight money policy to drive down inflation, even if it meant bankruptcies of enterprises which were a drain on the rest of the economy. Accordingly, he sent a memorandum to the IMF setting the 1994 budget deficit at Rbs53trillion - which, according to IMF officials, amounts, together with local budget deficits, to 8 per cent of GDP. But last month the government agreed to further increases in agricultural subsidies which increased the deficit to Rbs68.8trillion. Unless cuts are made elsewhere in the budget, the new defence spending - much of it likely to be spent on new orders or subsidies to ailing defence plants - will increase the deficit to Rbs80trillion. It is not clear how the IMF, which is due to consider further loans to Russia later this year, will react should the budget begin to diverge far from its promised target. 'We cannot control the government on a day to day basis,' said one western official. 'At the end of the day, it is up to them to deliver as best at they are able to. The IMF can always give them absolution but then there is the day of reckoning, and that is without appeal,' he said, referring to the potential damage of putting off economic adjustment for very much longer.</p>

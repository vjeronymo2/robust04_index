During their meeting, the two exchanged views on the  bilateral relations between China and Singapore and the  situation in Asia.    Liu said he was very satisfactory with the development of  the  bilateral relationship and the healthy cooperation between  Singapore and China since the two countries established  diplomatic relations in October 1990.    Commenting on the situation of Asia, Senior Minister Lee  said  that a group of new industrial countries would come onto Asian  stage if peace and stability could be maintained in the future  20 to 30 years.    This would bring significant influence to the world, Lee  said.    Agreeing with Lee, Liu emphasized that the peace and  stability of the Asia-Pacific region would be very important not  only to China, but also to all nations in Asia.    General Liu and his delegation arrived here this afternoon  for a transit visit from January 11 to 14 between his official  visits to Thailand and Indonesia.    During his stay in Singapore, Liu will call on Prime  Minister  Goh Chok Tong and Lee Hsian Loong and visit resort Sentosa on  Wednesday and Thursday before leaving here for Jakarta.</p>

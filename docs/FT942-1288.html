			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourse recovery, but dollar fears revive The dollar had a better day in Europe but renewed US fears of currency weakness, after continental market hours, sent brokers pensively home, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT tried to move on the news, or the absence of it, retreating from its highs after the Bundesbank announced that it would leave key interest rates unchanged for at least the next two weeks. The Dax index rose 27.68 to 2,022.10 on the session after a high of 2,038.54. In the afternoon the bund future reacted by half a point after its earlier gains, said Mr Jens Wiecking at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf; equities followed suit, falling then recovering to end the day at 2,032.52. Turnover rose from DM8.5bn to DM9.2bn. Deutsche Bank lost ground in the post bourse, ending at DM684.50 after a rise of just DM1.50 to DM688 on the session on exposure to debt markets, property scandals and recent talk of management changes. Merck Finck was not looking for a sustained equities recovery. 'As the most important bond investors are still heavily over-invested', it said this week, 'they will be inclined to use any recovery to reduce or unwind lossmaking bond positions. As a consequence, the recovery potential for German bonds will be dampened in the weeks ahead, so that equities should not expect much support from this side.' PARIS saw the CAC-40 index dip to 1,908.32 in reaction to the Buba news before regaining its confidence once again to close the session, and the account, at 1,939.02, up 21.98 or 1.1 per cent. Eurotunnel ended 30 centimes down at FFr24.70 as the takeup of the UK side of the rights issue came in above expectations, and the bourse authorities said that it had opened an official enquiry into the movement of the shares prior to the issue coming to the market. The result of the French side of the issue is expected early next month, and the takeup level is forecast to exceed that in the UK. Euro Disney was one of the day's losers, off FFr1.50 at FFr16. MILAN held on to early gains, although it remained cautious in the absence of clear government action to tackle the budget deficit. The Comit index rose 15.81, or 2.3 per cent to 707.44; but there was concern that further profit-taking could emerge at around the 710 point level. In contrast, the real-time Mibtel index finished 45 higher at 11,190, after a day's peak of 11,331. The insurance sector remained under pressure ahead of Monday's public offering and private placement of 51 per cent of Ina, the state insurer. Generali slipped L150 to L42,100, Fondiaria dropped L430 to L13,230 and Ras lost L300 to L25,500. The new shares of Mondadori, the publisher, finished at L15,480 as they made their debut, compared with an opening L15,260 quote and the L15,000 offer price. The old shares, which have dividend rights and are quoted separately, rose L684 to L15,984. MADRID reacted to early strength on Wall Street, Iberdrola, Repsol and Telefonica accounting for some 40 per cent of the day's Pta29bn turnover as they rose Pta29 to Pta979, Pta135 to Pta3,995 and Pta35 to Pta775 respectively. However, the outstanding gain, given the recent unpopularity of banks on poor bond market trading experience, was a Pta500, or 4.8 per cent rise to Pta11,000 for Bankinter, picked out with Banco Popular this week by Mr Bryan Crossley at Hoare Govett for their 'almost irresistible combination of high rates of profitability, strong balance sheets and low market ratings.' AMSTERDAM made a hesitant recovery assisted by strength in the bond markets, helping the AEX index to a day's gain of 4.64 or 1.2 per cent to 387.38. One of the day's best performers was Nutricia, the food group. There were reports, which the Dutch company denied, that Unigate of the UK might be considering the sale of its stake to Heinz of the US . Nutricia's shares added Fl 3.40 to Fl 84.00. ZURICH continued higher in response to firmer bond futures, but the SMI index edged back from 2,641.1, its best level of the day, to finish 31.0 ahead at 2,626.7. Banks and insurers continued to lead after their recent long slide. UBS bearers rose SFr37 to SFr1,147 and Zurich Insurance gained SFr34 to SFr1,320. The weak dollar, however, continued to dampen the performance of industrials. Nestle added just SFr5 to SFr1,115 while Ciba lost SFr3 to SFr709. OSLO recovered after recent weakness, underpinned by lower debt market yields. The all-share index rose 10.19 or 1.8 per cent to 577.58 in turnover of NKr365m. Shipping and industrial stocks led the advance. Elkem A shares gained NKr7 to NKr83 as a wage agreement averted the threat of industrial action at two of its aluminium plants. Norsk Hydro, benefiting from higher aluminium and oil prices, added NKr4 to NKr214. TEL AVIV rose 2.75 per cent, supported by aggressive buying by portfolio managers. The Mishtanim index finished 4.63 ahead at 173.17 in low turnover of Shk132m, but it was still 3.1 per cent down on the week.

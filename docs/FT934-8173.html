			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Bidders for BR to be given a dry run POTENTIAL bidders for privatised British Rail routes will be invited to take part in 'shadow negotiations' with the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising early next year. The office has been set up by the government to handle the franchising of BR's routes and to monitor the performance of franchisees. Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director, said yesterday that the purpose of the negotiations was to explain to the bidding teams how the franchising system works and to allow the office to refine its own proposals. One of the main aims of the franchising office is to establish agreements which provide commercial incentives for companies involved in the new system and which minimise the scope for legal disputes. Mr Salmon said: 'We have devised a 'no-fault' incentive system which keeps the lawyers in their place.' Franchisees will be paid according to the quality and reliability of the train service, while Railtrack, the company set up to own the track and signalling, will be able to charge more for providing a high quality of service to the operator. Mr Salmon, a former corporate financier with NM Rothschild, the merchant bank, is to spend the next few weeks explaining the details of the franchising system at a series of conferences and presentations. 'There is a lot of the detail which is important,' he said. 'Only when we get that into the public domain will the big players sit up and get talking.' Invitations to tender are expected to go out next October and the first private operators will take over in the spring of 1995. About 50 private companies and 30 teams of British Rail managers have expressed an interest. The capital needed to take over rail operations is not large because equipment will be leased or rented. But bidders will be required to provide bonds to reimburse season ticket holders in the event of the company folding. They may also have to provide guarantees of 'good behaviour'. Mr Salmon described the move to franchising as 'the biggest change in the railway system, including nationalisation' but said he did not expect large-scale changes in the physical shape of the network. Companies taking over franchises to run British Rail routes will pay more to use the track at peak times, Railtrack, the company set up to manage British Rail track and signalling, said yesterday. Charges will depend in part on the type and the number of trains run, wear and tear on the track and the cost of any improvements and investment in the line. Details of how Railtrack will charge for its services were unveiled at the formal launch of the company in London. Railtrack will spend the next few months devising access agreements for its future customers; acquiring formal ownership of 10,000 miles of track, 2,500 stations and 90,000 bridges; and taking on responsibility for the 22,000 tenants in British Rail property. It will also investigate ways of involving private sector finance to help fund modernisation of track and signalling. Safety will be monitored by a safety directorate which will be part of Railtrack but which, Railtrack said, would be kept, 'as far as possible', separate from its commercial arm. When Railtrack formally takes over control of BR's infrastructure on April 1 it will have 12,000 staff ranging from signalmen to business controllers. Track and signals will be grouped in 10 geographical zones.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS MARKED  </P> <P> "Literary Britain" unearthed old memories of one of my own precious literary  moments in England. First it was the train to Windsor, the tour and a picnic  lunch across the river from the castle. Then down narrow country lanes to the  quaint village of Stoke Poges, the setting for Thomas Gray's immortal poem,  "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard." It was a mystical experience.  </P> <P> CHARLES F. QUEENAN  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / OECD Economic Outlook: 'Sombre' prospects for immediate growth - The OECD sees high budget deficits as limiting scope to stimulate economic demand SUBSTANTIAL recovery across the world's richest nations has been postponed once again, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said yesterday. In its latest biannual Economic Outlook*, the OECD said economic expansion would be held back by the combination of high consumer and business debts, rising unemployment, tight monetary policies and weak confidence. The organisation, which represents 24 industrial nations, supports moves towards lower interest rates across the region. It suggests that the block on the Bundesbank cutting its credit rates soon - a development which would open the way to easier monetary policy across Europe - would be removed if Bonn acted quickly to reduce its financial deficit. Describing the immediate outlook for growth across the OECD as 'relatively sombre', the OECD says the scope for governments generally to stimulate demand by fiscal measures is 'very circumscribed' because of the high budget deficits in many developed nations. A brighter note is the progress made in many countries in bringing down inflation, even though this has often been largely a consequence of extremely weak demand pressures. Also, growth in world trade has remained fairly high, partly because of the strengthening in the economies of regions outside the OECD, including south-east Asia, south America and the former communist nations of eastern Europe. The OECD says: 'Over the coming months the negative forces which have slowed OECD economies are unlikely to dissipate rapidly. Confidence is currently weak in most OECD countries and is likely to revive only gradually.' Over the next year, the balance of risks may push the world economy into another period of only weak growth, the report says. There is a danger that 'continued indebtedness problems and weak confidence will delay recovery and that German inflation and interest rates will take longer than expected to ease.' Across the 24 nations of the OECD, the organisation's economists believe real economic growth next year will be 1.9 per cent compared with an OECD estimate of 3 per cent in June. Growth in the OECD this year is expected to be 1.5 per cent, as opposed to the 1.8 per cent forecast six months ago. However, putting a more up-to-date gloss on the OECD's forecasts, Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, the organisation's chief economist, said yesterday that on the basis of recent economic data he thought growth in the US next year would probably be half a percentage point higher than in the OECD's formal projection, while growth in Germany would be half a percentage point lower. These two developments would cancel each other out, leaving the organisation's overall prediction for growth across the region in 1993 unchanged. The group has revised down its growth forecasts substantially for Italy and Britain, where in each case the increase in output next year is now expected to be roughly half the amount it forecast last June (see table). The June forecast for Germany referred only to western Germany and is therefore not strictly comparable to the current one. In the case of the US, Japan, France and Canada, growth in 1993 is projected at about two-thirds of the level forecast six months ago. Next year is expected to be the third in a row in which OECD growth is less than 2 per cent. Among the worst affected nations are Britain, Canada, Finland and Sweden, each of which will have seen their economies shrink in two years out of three by the end of this year. Unemployment is expected to climb by the end of next year to 34m, or 8.4 per cent of the OECD labour force, an increase of 10m jobless people since mid-1990. Fear of job losses has sapped confidence among consumers, which the OECD says is a big factor holding back a recovery. With many countries suffering from weak business activity, 'the question arises as to whether the stance of macroeconomic policies can be adjusted somewhat to support demand in the near term', according to the OECD. The OECD lists several measures under discussion to boost growth: Lower interest rates. In countries with weak inflation and low demand, 'there would be a case for easing monetary conditions more significantly (than in the past few years)'. Modest measures to boost state spending. While the increasing budget deficits in many countries make large programmes of increased government spending inappropriate, there may be a case for temporary measures to loosen fiscal policy or focused schemes to spend taxpayers' cash on investment. Looser monetary policies in Germany. Lower interest rates across Europe would be helped if the Bundesbank were to change its policy of keeping borrowing rates high. Devaluation. While devaluation by some countries, and Italy and Britain leaving the system, provided a short-term economic boost by making exports from these nations more competitive, the report warns that such improvements 'have often been quickly eroded by higher inflation'. The low demand across the OECD has produced one bright spot in that the OECD-wide inflation rate is expected to be a weak 3.5 per cent this year, falling to about 3.2 per cent next year and about 2.5 per cent by the end of 1994 - the lowest rate since 1960. World trade is projected to increase by 4.7 per cent this year, 4.9 per cent next year and 6.1 per cent the following year. These numbers assume that the Uruguay Round of the world trade talks is settled amicably. *OECD Economic Outlook No 52, OECD Publications, 2 Rue Andre Pascal, Paris Cedex 16, France, or HMSO.

			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Contracts for civil servants questioned THE INTRODUCTION of fixed-term contracts for senior civil servants was unlikely to improve the quality of advice given to ministers, Sir Robin Butler, head of the Civil Service, told a committee of MPs last night. A switch to such contracts has been recommended by the European Policy Forum, an influential free-market think-tank, following concern about the quality of policy advice given to ministers. Sir Robin told the all-party Treasury and Civil Service committee that civil servants were less likely to give 'frank and fearless' advice if they were employed under fixed-term contracts. 'Advice to ministers is more likely to be impartial if advisers do not see the end of a fixed-term contract approaching,' he said. 'A willingness to tell ministers that a particular action is wrong is encouraged by security of tenure.' Sir Robin rejected suggestions that standards of Civil Service behaviour had declined in recent years. He was concerned about public unease over the role of civil servants in cases such as the sale of arms to Iraq revealed by the Matrix Churchill trial and the payment of certain expenses on behalf of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. But the particular cases were very different and he did not think they indicated anything was wrong. Sir Robin accepted that questions of Civil Service impartiality were bound to be raised when one party had been in power for so long. He said: 'Scepticism arises about whether the Civil Service is able to serve a government of another party with equal commitment. I believe that it could, and all civil servants were concerned to demonstrate that they could in the run-up to the last election.'</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: G7's annual gathering borders on the irrelevant - Nothing was decided in Munich that could not have been determined in other national, bilateral and multilateral forums IT IS too easy to say the Group of Seven economic summits have outlived their purpose. What is becoming increasingly apparent, however, is that there is no point in holding them, like clockwork, once a year. They should be convened not merely for serious discussions, but when there is something serious to decide. There is a big difference between the two. Gatt, the state of the world economy, the importance of financial and other assistance to the former Soviet republics and, on the political side, the plight of what was Yugoslavia, all constitute serious subjects. But on none of them was anything decided in Munich that could not have been determined in other national, bilateral and multilateral forums and, in the case of the world economy and supporting President Boris Yeltsin, already has been. A case existed for a summit devoted to giving what is now laughably called the final political push to a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. But it has been apparent for some weeks that France did not want a Gatt agreement as a hostage to fortune prior to its September referendum on the Maastricht treaty, while President George Bush is equally nervous about alienating his farmers before November's presidential election. For all the heads of government, their finance and foreign ministers and other officials beyond number to convene in Munich to hear the obvious makes mockery of the process. The sheer size, formality and expense of the summit exercise may also be questioned in the age of instant and efficient technological communication. Of course, much is made of the value of the informal exchanges that summiteers may derive from their wining and dining. The problem is that this goes on all the time anyway. They all met in Rio de Janeiro less than a month ago for the Earth Summit, and the Europeans in Lisbon 10 days back. Mr John Major met Mr Bush in Washington prior to the Earth Summit and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan met the US president last week. Mr Bush and Mr Brian Mulroney of Canada confer all the time. Mr Yeltsin has been to Washington, Ottawa, London and Paris since becoming president. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand are always getting together. It is hardly as if the leaders do not know each other, with the possible exception of Mr Giuliano Amato, the new Italian prime minister. A case once existed for building up the G7 into something it was not, perhaps by providing it with a permanent secretariat beyond the floating crew of sherpas. But the determination of all G7 countries to vest the United Nations with greater authority, together with renewed reliance on the technocrats of the International Monetary Fund, has rendered this unnecessary. A summit might also be appropriate to celebrate something remarkable - the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, for example. Houston in 1990 and London last year constituted such, in their way, appropriate venues, given the roles played by President Ronald Reagan and Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Causes for celebration are not now conspicuously evident. There used to be a belief, too, that national electorates would be impressed by their political leaders striding purposefully on the world stage, or being ferried around on golf carts. However, the domestic political benefits of summits has always been wishful thinking. President Gerald Ford hosted the second summit in Puerto Rico in 1976 and was out of office a few months later. Venice in 1980 did nothing for President Jimmy Carter nor Tokyo in 1986 for Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone. The casualty list is so long that it is surely apparent that most people back home care little. It can be worse, too. Mr Bush is not getting the glowing press coverage of his performance at Munich, while Mr Major is not without egg on his face for his aborted attempt to rescue Gatt. It is hard to think of a single statesman who leaves with an enhanced reputation. The curious thing is that the above criticism is not confined to the thousands of journalists who scurry from one national briefing to another in search of the slightest nuance. It is now the stuff of private conversations of any number of senior officials gathered here. One finance minister has been heard to remark he enjoyed his holiday in Munich. The perfect testament to the irrelevance of this summit is that it has effectively been hijacked by Mr Yeltsin, whose country is not even a member and who has come to Munich cap in hand. The conclusion must be that summits can still serve a purpose, but that this must be evident beforehand. The emptiness of all the communiques and statements issued in Munich demonstrates a lack of this essential ingredient. Organisations survive by adapting to change. Party political conventions in the US are under fire because they no longer serve their original purpose of choosing presidential candidates, who emerge from the preceding primaries. The annual economic summit of the biggest and richest nations faces a comparable challenge. Its future and relevance are now in doubt. The summiteers should count themselves lucky that Bavaria is rich enough to foot the bill, but it is easy to think of better homes for its money.</p>

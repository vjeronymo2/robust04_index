			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Berri to be Lebanese speaker: Civil war militia leader wins highest Shia legislative post MR Nabih Berri, one of the principal militia leaders in Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war and a close ally of Syria, became speaker of the Lebanese parliament yesterday after 105 of 128 deputies voted for him in the first session of parliament. Mr Berri, the 54-year-old son of Shia Moslem Lebanese emigrants to Sierra Leone, joined the legislature for the first time in the controversial August 23 - October 11 general election and has been elevated to the highest position a Shia may aspire to in Lebanon. The southern Lebanon district of Nabatieh gave Mr Berri more than 120,000 votes - the highest number received by any candidate in the legislative poll. The accession of Mr Berri, like the composition of the first new parliament in 20 years, symbolises the social revolution caused by the country's civil war. Mr Berri's only competitor for the speaker's chair, a wealthy Shia Moslem from an old Beirut family and an MP since the 1960s, received only 14 votes. Twelve newly-elected Moslem fundamentalist deputies, including eight members of the Iranian-backed Hizbollah, also attended yesterday's session, some wearing robes and turbans. Seventy-six of the 128 members have never served in parliament before. 'Let bygones be bygones,' Mr Berri told the assembly in his acceptance speech. The words were especially poignant: his Syrian-armed Amal militia fought Christian and Druze militias and even its fellow Shia Moslems in the war. It imprisoned western passengers during the June 1985 TWA hijacking and from 1985-1988 bombarded Palestinian refugees in Lebanon in the infamous 'camps war'. Mr Berri recently reversed his opposition to Lebanon's sectarian system of government, under which political positions are allotted by religious affiliation. He has vowed to fight the permanent settlement of some half million Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Mr Berri this year resolved his feud with Hizbollah, who fielded parliamentary candidates on his southern Lebanon list. The fundamentalists had long scorned Mr Berri, a lawyer by training, for his western dress and for the Amal militia's lack of fervour in fighting the Israelis in Shia southern Lebanon. Yet Mr Berri promised yesterday to strive to recover the Israeli-occupied zone. A new Lebanese government is to be formed in coming weeks. President Elias Hrawi has made clear his desire to nominate Mr Rafiq Hariri, the Lebanese-born Saudi billionaire, as prime minister. Business sources believe a Hariri premiership would strengthen the Lebanese pound and improve economic conditions.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS CAN'T STAND EARLY SUCCESS; PHILLIES WIN, 3-2  </P> <P> The Dodgers, who labored 22 innings to score one run in Wednesday's 1-0 victory  at Montreal, got two runs in the blink of an eye Friday night against the  Philadelphia Phillies.  </P> <P> Apparently satisfied with their quick run production, the Dodger offense took  the rest of the night off as the Phillies won, 3-2, before 33,541 at Dodger  Stadium in the opener of a nine-game home stand.  </P> <P> The Dodgers, who were 0-for-14 with runners in scoring position during the  Montreal marathon, were 0 for 5 with runners in scoring position after the  first inning and stranded nine runners Friday night.  </P> <P> Dodger pitcher Ramon Martinez, who gave up only two earned runs, got off to a  rocky start.  </P> <P> Leadoff man Len Dykstra belted Martinez's second pitch into the right-field  corner for a triple. It appeared that Martinez had worked his way out of the  jam after Tommy Herr hit a sharp line drive to second baseman Willie Randolph  and struck out John Kruk.  </P> <P> But Martinez kept the inning alive when he hit first baseman Ricky Jordan in  the left arm and Dwayne Murphy singled home Dykstra.  </P> <P> Terry Mulholland, the Phillies' starter, didn't look much better than Martinez  as he gave up two runs and three hits in the first inning.  </P> <P> Alfredo Griffin singled to right on Mulholland's first pitch and scored on  Eddie Murray's two-out single to left. Murray advanced to third when Jeff  Hamilton followed with a double to right and Murray scored on a wild pitch.  </P> <P> But Mulholland settled down after the first inning.  </P> <P> After being traded from the San Francisco Giants, Mulholland struggled with the  Phillies and was sent to the bullpen. Since returning to the starting rotation,  Mulholland had won his last three games.  </P> <P> "Terry realizes now that he needs to use some off-speed pitches," Phillie  Manager Nick Leyva said. "In the first inning, he didn't use them and they sat  on his hard breaking balls and fastballs.  </P> <P> "But he has done a super job his last two times out."  </P> <P> Martinez got into trouble again in the fourth, giving up a leadoff single to  Jordan and walks to Murphy and Darren Daulton to load the bases.  </P> <P> Steve Jeltz drove in Jordan with a bloop single to left. After Martinez fell  behind Mulholland 3-and-0, Mulholland drilled a broken bat grounder to third  baseman Jeff Hamilton. Hamilton was unable to field the ball cleanly with his  bare hand, with Murphy scoring to give the Phillies a 3-2 lead.  </P> <P> But Martinez struck out Dykstra and got Herr hit back to the box to end the  inning. Martinez was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the seventh.  </P> <P> Martinez, who gave up seven hits and five walks in seven innings, said he had  control problems.  </P> <P> "I tried to keep the ball down, but I hung some of my pitches," Martinez said.  "I struggled with my fastball so I threw more sinkers, which are harder to  control. I was throwing close pitches, but they just weren't strikes."  </P> <P> The Dodgers had a chance to tie the score in the bottom of the eighth.  </P> <P> Mickey Hatcher opened with a single to right. Billy Bean ran for Hatcher and  was forced at second by Murray. Hamilton followed with a single to left to  finish Mulholland, who was lifted for reliever Jeff Parrett.  </P> <P> Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda went to his bench, sending up Mike Scioscia to pinch  hit for Dempsey. But Scioscia fouled out to third. Lasorda wasn't finished,  though, sending up Lenny Harris to pinch hit for outfielder John Shelby. But  Parrett struck out Harris to end the inning.  </P> <P> "I forced (Scioscia and Harris) to try to hit my breaking stuff," Parrett said.  "I got the chance to be the closer tonight and it felt awfully good."  </P> <P> The Dodgers had another chance in the ninth when Mike Marshall lined a one-out  pinch-hit single to center.  </P> <P> But Parrett struck out Alfredo Griffin and induced Randolph to fly out to right  to earn his sixth save.  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> Outfielder John Shelby, sent down to Albuquerque on July 19, was recalled by  the Dodgers Friday. To make room for Shelby, the Dodgers sent outfielder Mike  Huff to Albuquerque. Huff hit .200 with one home run in 12 games with the  Dodgers.  </P> <P> Shelby, who was hitting .156 in 79 games with the Dodgers before he was sent to  the minors, batted .286 in 32 games with Albuquerque. Ben Hines, Dodger hitting  coach, thinks Shelby's hitting mechanics improved. "His swing looks shorter,"  Hines said. "And I'm sure John has worked at it."  </P> <P> Shelby said he was glad to return to the Dodgers. "It always feels good to be  back," Shelby said. "I got a chance to work on things and straighten some  things out (in Albuquerque) and I feel I got it straightened out. It was almost  like starting over. I didn't make a lot of drastic changes, just a lot of  little things."  </P> <P> Shelby said he worked hard in the minors.  </P> <P> "I didn't look at it like I was down there on a vacation," Shelby said. "It was  still work. I just took it day to day. When I was down there I never thought  about getting called up."  </P> <P> Shelby, who was booed during his slump, said he didn't care whether the fans  booed him upon his return.  </P> <P> "I can come here and hit .500 and they can still boo me," Shelby said. "If they  boo me, I'll still be in the lineup."  </P> <P> After Shelby struck out looking in the first inning, there were scattered boos.  But he changed them to cheers when he doubled to right in the fourth inning.  </P> <P> Dodger outfielder Chris Gwynn, who is on the disabled list with a sprained  ligament in his right knee, was examined by Dr. Ralph Gambardella before the  game and is scheduled to undergo a Magnetic Resonance Imaging exam today.  </P></p>

			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Letter: Pollution and buses in Santiago Sir, Leslie Crawford's report from Santiago ('Putting the brakes on the bus cartel', February 26) usefully highlights some of the problems caused by bus deregulation in the Chilean capital, and recent government action to counteract them. However, although dealing with pollution from the buses may have provided a useful rationale for reducing the total number of buses by withdrawing the oldest vehicles, it would be wrong to regard buses as the main source of transport pollution. The recent comprehensive transport study of the city published by the Commission on Urban Transport, shows that only in respect of particulate emissions (from diesel engines) were buses and lorries the main source. For other transport pollutants, the car was the main source, generating two thirds of the nitrous oxides, and 90 per cent of the carbon monoxide. As in Britain, it is private transport (rather than public transport, whether efficiently or badly run) that must be tackled.

			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NHL / GORDON EDES;  </P> <P> IT HAS BECOME A SHOT ON GOALIES  </P> <P> Even before his all-star goalie, Grant Fuhr, was run over by Winnipeg's Andrew  McBain in a game last Wednesday night and suffered a strained neck, Edmonton's  Glen Sather said he has been concerned about the growing number of collisions  involving goaltenders this season.  </P> <P> The matter was discussed at the general managers' meeting in Florida last week,  said Sather, the coach and general manager of the Oilers.  </P> <P> It's about time, said King goalie Glenn Healy, who was leveled Saturday night  by Hartford's Kevin Dineen and is rapidly tiring of the number of  crease-crashers he has encountered this season.  </P> <P> "To me, it's frustrating," Healy said. "I like to play fair -- I don't swing my  stick at anybody, I don't chop at ankles, because I think that's cheap, so I  don't think I should be constantly subjected to being bumped or worried about  someone blind-siding me."  </P> <P> The problem has worsened, Healy said, since Philadelphia goalie Brian Hextall  was suspended for 10 games after he swung his stick at Edmonton's Kent Nilsson  in the 1987 playoffs, injuring the Oiler forward.  </P> <P> "Ever since then, it's been a joke," Healy said. "If I try to move a guy (out  of the crease), the referee says something every time.  </P> <P> "Kevin Dineen doesn't stop, and just runs me right over, he hits the  goaltender. He figures, 'What's Healy going to do? He's not going to swing his  stick.'  </P> <P> "And they have this little built-in excuse that a defenseman carried them into  you. No one was near Dineen when he ran me over."  </P> <P> The worst offenders, according to Healy, are the Calgary Flames. He wouldn't  name names, but center Joel Otto has been known to drive the net. And in a game  earlier this season, Tim Hunter cross-checked Healy in the back of the head,  knocking off his helmet, then rubbed his face into the ice, cutting the  goaltender above the eye.  </P> <P> The issue would seem to be covered by the National Hockey League rule book.  Under Sec. 6, Rule 47 (c), a referee is instructed to call a minor or major  penalty if a player charges the goaltender while he's in the crease. Charging  is defined as taking more than two steps or strides before contact is made.  </P> <P> It further states that either interference or charging should be called in  every case an opposing player makes unnecessary contact with a goalkeeper. Even  when the goalie is out of the crease, the rule states, he is not "fair game" to  be hit.  </P> <P> The problem, Healy says, is that referees are not making the call.  </P> <P> "If a guy goes to the net and he's not being legitimately pushed by a  defenseman, that's got to be interference," Healy said. "Referees have to stop  calling it a push every time.  </P> <P> "That excuse is a bunch of malarkey to me. If it's 2 minutes every time they  run into a goalie, guys will stop doing it."  </P> <P> Calgary and the Washington Capitals have been selected as the teams to visit  Moscow and Leningrad for four exhibitions each against Soviet teams next fall.  Capital defenseman Larry Murphy, a former No. 1 draft choice of the Kings,  played for a Canadian midget team that went to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "I was 16 and it's still the most amazing trip I've ever been on," Murphy told  Robert Fachet of the Washington Post. "I took over a lot of jeans and bubble  gum and I wound up with so much stuff I had to buy suitcases to bring it home.  </P> <P> "I had so many rubles left at the end, I went out and bought everything I  could, toys and fur hats and things. We stayed in a big hotel and the waiters  in the dining room were always trying to make deals for jeans."  </P> <P> Add Soviets: Ex-coach Don Cherry on the recent series against Soviet teams:  "Every time I turned on the TV, I saw Russians. Are there any left in Russia?  We used to see them every 4 years. Now we see them every 4 days."  </P> <P> Talking Turkey: Whoever said hockey players aren't sensitive hasn't been to  Quebec lately.  </P> <P> Last week, the Nordiques stopped talking to reporters after one had referred to  the team as turkeys. The term quickly caught on, especially since the French  word for the bird is dinde, inspiring one radio station to sell "Nordinde"  sweaters and to make up a song on the subject.  </P> <P> The flap is over, but obviously there were some ruffled feathers.  </P> <P> "Our actions were justified," said Peter Stastny of the Nordiques. "We accept  criticism, even though sometimes they're cheap shots. But we can't tolerate  being made fun of and treated poorly."  </P> <P> Hockey Notes  </P> <P> Former New York Islanders player and ex-Minnesota North Stars coach Lorne  Henning is the front-runner to coach the Islanders after Al Arbour finishes  this season, but another former Islander, Bobby Nystrom, said he'd like to be  considered. Nystrom, a one-time Islander assistant who now does some  broadcasting as well as being the team's director of corporate affairs, said he  doubts he has a chance for the job, however.  </P> <P> The Winnipeg Jets are retiring Bobby Hull's No. 9 on Feb. 19, a tribute that  apparently could not happen as long as John Ferguson was general manager. "He  didn't like Hull and that was that," said Mike Smith, who replaced the fired  Ferguson Oct. 30. Hull played with the Jets from 1972-79 and helped them win  two World Hockey Assn. titles before the WHA merged with the NHL in 1979.  "Without Bobby Hull, I don't think there would be professional hockey in  Winnipeg," Smith said. Hull's number was retired by the Chicago Blackhawks in  1984, 12 years after he left.  </P> <P> Minnesota's Brian Bellows missed a 2:30 a.m. curfew in Chicago, after he failed  to accompany the team back to its hotel and thus missed Coach Pierre Page's  announcement that there would be a bed check. As punishment, Bellows was forced  to take a cab to Chicago's O'Hare airport, pay for his own flight to St. Louis,  pay for another cab to the hotel and for his room in St. Louis.  </P> <P> Why Kevin Dineen isn't Hartford trainer Tom Woodcock's favorite player:  Woodcock used the uniform numbers of six Whalers in a Connecticut lottery that  had a jackpot of $9.7 million. He missed by one number, Dineen's No. 11.  </P></p>

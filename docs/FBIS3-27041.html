Danzim, deputy secretary of the autonomous regional party  committee, chaired the meeting. Chen Hanchang, member of the  autonomous regional party committee standing committee and  director of the propaganda department, relayed the principal  guidelines of the conference. He said: We should firmly grasp  the basic guiding principle of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, closely center  around the central work of economic construction, subject  ourselves to and serve the work of the entire party,  comprehensively carry out the tasks on the propaganda and  ideological front, and provide a favorable ideological guarantee  and public opinion for stepping up the establishment of a  socialist market economic system; promoting sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic development; safeguarding political  stability; and promoting overall social progress.    Chen Hanchang said: At the national conference on propaganda  and ideological work, General Secretary Jiang Zemin further  expounded the major tasks in propaganda and ideological work:  The propaganda and ideological front must firmly grasp the  basic guiding principle of the theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and emphatically do a good job in four  aspects of work, namely, theory, public opinion, ideological  education, and the main theme, which means arming the people  with scientific theory, guiding them with correct public  opinions, cultivating them with a lofty spirit, and inspiring  them with excellent work. The one basic guiding principle and  four aspects of work put forward by General Secretary Jiang  Zemin serve, respectively, as the soul of the propaganda and  ideological front that defines the direction of all work and as  four major key projects that embody and carry out the basic  guiding principle. Only by so doing can we better accomplish  the important missions undertaken by departments in charge of  propaganda and ideological work; correctly publicize the party's  theories, line, principles, and policies; vividly reflect the  great practices of the masses; and unite all the strength that  we can muster to strive for attaining the magnificent goal of  establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics.    Chen Hanchang urged party committees at various levels in  Tibet to fully understand the significant importance of the  national conference on propaganda and ideological work;  earnestly study the guidelines of important speeches delivered  at the conference by General Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li  Peng, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, and Director [of the Propaganda  Department under the CPC Central Committee] Ding Guangen; fully  study, grasp, and implement these guidelines; and regard this as  a turning point to boost Tibet's propaganda and ideological work  to a new level.

He noted:  1) We should firmly adhere to the basic principles for the work  of the entire party and consider the overall situation to  completely accomplish the important missions undertaken by the  departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work and  make contributions to advancing the construction of material and  spiritual civilization as well as social progress in Tibet. 2)  We should gain a clear understanding of the international and  domestic situations and seize the opportunity to step up the  pace of reform and development in Tibet. To serve the cause of  reform and development, we should continue to carry out  propaganda and ideological work by being well aware of public  opinion and maintaining the stability and continuity of the  keynotes in propaganda. We should seek comprehensiveness,  objectivity, and precision and avoid one-sidedness in  propaganda. Taking the basic interests of the party and state as  our main concern, we should consciously act in unison with the  CPC Central Committee in terms of politics. Tibet's tasks in  reform and development are more arduous this year. All  departments in charge of propaganda and ideological work must  keep emancipating their minds, seeking truth from facts,  integrating their own characteristics, seriously summing up  experiences, studying the law of propaganda, promoting their  work with creativity, and vigorously seeking new ideas for  propaganda and ideological work under the conditions of a  socialist market economy. 3) We should regard the work of  maintaining social stability as our duty and support reform with  a clear-cut stand. This year is one of crucial importance to  the progress of Tibet's reform and construction. Thus, we must  fully assess the arduousness and complexity of reform. Whether  we can score a victory in the work of deepening reform is a  severe test of us. In this new year, comrades on the propaganda  and ideological front should subject themselves to the overall  situation, serve the central work, correctly guide public  opinion, support reform with a clear-cut stand, precisely grasp  and publicize the party's principles and policies, correctly  address the overall economic situation in a timely manner, and  scientifically and conscientiously publicize a series of reform  programs, policies, and measures adopted at this year's regional  work conference on the economy. They should regard social  stability as their duty and address and resolve in a timely  manner the ideological problems cropping up in the course of  reform. They should carry out the media's supervisory role and  help party committees and governments at various levels improve  their work, properly handle public feelings, and thaw  contradictions to create a favorable milieu and public opinion  for deepening reform and smoothly establishing a new socialist  market economic system in Tibet. 4) Party committees and  governments at various levels must strengthen their leadership  in propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological  work plays an important part in the overall efforts for the  cause of establishing socialism with Chinese characteristics; it  is a political advantage of the CPC and an important magic  weapon for ensuring the smooth progress of reform and  construction. Party committees and governments at various  levels must attach great importance to this work, strengthen  their leadership in it, and really take responsibility for the  work. Party committees at various levels should place the work  of intensifying and improving propaganda and ideological work on  the agenda and frequently give guidance and check on the work.  Government departments at various levels should attach  importance to and support propaganda and ideological work;  create necessary conditions for cadres engaged in the work;  actively help them resolve practical difficulties; and strive to  solve the current problems of scarce personnel, poor quality,  bad facilities, and dull work methods on the propaganda and  ideological front so as to remarkably improve the conditions for  propaganda and ideological work and bring about better results.

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Greener valleys singing the blues: Roland Adburgham on the limited impact of government aid in depressed Welsh communities It was not unexpected, but the announcement that Tower colliery in Mid Glamorgan will close next week, bringing to an end generations of deep-mining in south Wales, sent reverberations through the surrounding valleys. The impact was twofold. There was the symbolism of the closure - south Wales once had a quarter of a million men working in the coal mines - and the defeat of a determined campaign by the local community to save what it regarded as a viable pit. Second, there was the loss of another 200 jobs in an area where nearly one in four of the male workforce is unemployed. There are 30 people unemployed for every vacancy at the local job centres in the Aberdare travel-to-work area, which includes Tower. By highlighting the valleys' seemingly intractable economic problems, the closure of Tower raises the question of whether the government's interventionist programme for regenerating the valleys has failed. The initiative was started by the Welsh Office in 1988 to alleviate the painful structural changes caused by the rundown of the old coal and steel industries. Under its umbrella, more than Pounds 770m of public funding has been injected into the valleys, where 700,000 people live. The programme, launched by Lord Walker, then Welsh secretary and now chairman of English Partnerships, the regeneration agency for England, is currently in a second five-year phase. This was unveiled last autumn by Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, as a plan called 'building on success'. But the 'success' he confidently claimed for the programme was cast into doubt last November in a statistical report published by the government. It found 73 plants had opened in the valleys since 1988, but 138 had closed. In spite of the opening of plants by overseas companies such as Hitachi of Japan, the manufacturing workforce had declined at a faster rate than in Wales as a whole. Lord Walker's original claims for what he described as 'the most comprehensive programme for economic growth the valleys have known' have proved too optimistic. He spoke of 'pump priming' by the government which would lead to private-sector investment of more than Pounds 1bn, and of reducing long-term unemployment by two-thirds. In fact, the Welsh Office now estimates that, in the first five years, private investment totalled less than Pounds 700m. Unemployment remains high: the rate in Mid Glamorgan, which covers much of the valleys region, stands at 12.5 per cent, compared with an average for Wales of 10.4 per cent. The most obvious improvement is in the greening of the grime: the appearance of the valleys has been transformed by the reclamation of slag-heaps. Mr Redwood's view is that the initiative's impact has been overshadowed by the recession and, without it, the valleys would have been much worse off. He supports continued intervention on the grounds that it was state-owned industries that caused the damage. Yesterday he announced grants totalling Pounds 2.5m for projects in five communities. In all, his five-year programme promises a total of more than Pounds 1bn of funding. This time, no target has been set for private investment, although Mr Redwood agrees more needs to be attracted. One entrepreneur who supports the initiative is Mr Alf Gooding, who was born in the valleys. Gooding Sanken, the company he set up with Sanken Electric of Japan to make power supply units, moved last year into a plant in Cynon Valley, in the heart of the region. The factory was built by the Welsh Development Agency - under the valleys initiative, the agency plays the lead role in encouraging inward investment and land reclamation. The factory employs 250 people and, if the workforce reaches the projected 400, Gooding Sanken can recoup 40 per cent of its Pounds 10m investment. Without the aid, Mr Gooding says, the factory would not be there. 'How can anyone say anything other than that the initiative is doing one hell of a good job?' he asks. Mr Tony Roberts, chief executive of Cynon Valley council, which has Tower in its district, agrees the initiative has encouraged public and private sector partnerships and helped to put a spotlight on the valleys. But he is flummoxed by what he sees as the illogicality of a national energy policy which results in the closure of Tower colliery. 'On the one hand we are being encouraged to play our part in regeneration, but then we have to sacrifice Tower on the altar of market forces. It does not seem sensible.' Sceptics have long argued the initiative is primarily a public relations exercise, a packaging of schemes with little 'new' money over and above what would be available elsewhere in Wales. Dr Victoria Winckler, head of policy research at Mid Glamorgan county council, recognises there have been improvements in roads and housing, for example, but argues these might have happened in any case. 'As far as we're concerned as a local authority, the initiative has had no identifiable effect.' There are still high levels of deprivation and low levels of economic activity, she says. 'A lot of people have moved out of the workforce altogether.' In a recent report, Poverty and Prosperity in Wales, Professor Barry Wilkinson and Mr Jonathan Morris of Cardiff Business School found the poorest parts of Wales were still in the valleys and the disparities worsening. Professor Wilkinson says migration out of the valleys is continuing. 'I think the Welsh Office should be upfront about it. They should acknowledge these areas are not getting any better. I think the government should either pump in real money to preserve the communities, or stop paying lip service to the problem and say that, when Norman Tebbit (former employment secretary) said 'get on your bike', he meant it.' Mr Roberts, of Cynon Valley council, emphasises the need to support existing businesses, but recognises that commuting down the valleys to Cardiff and the M4 motorway corridor - which has been more successful in winning inward investment - is part of the answer. He argues the initiative should improve the road and rail links to help that trend. This implies accepting that the concept of the old communities, the raison d'etre of which was the pit at the end of the street, must be consigned to the past. No large plants will provide a substitute: other UK regions can offer similar grants to inward investors. Any incoming industry is likely to be small-scale: the most recent is the Japanese company, TAP Manufacturing, which is building a car parts plant in Rhymney Valley. It will employ only 60 people. Demand will continue to diminish for the high-wage, skilled male worker. Those jobs which are created are more likely to be for women than men. At Gooding Sanken, 70 per cent of the workforce is female. If part-timers are included, more women are now in work in Mid Glamorgan than men. Outside manufacturing, local jobs are likely to be found in service industries, particularly tourism, which require very different skills to manufacturing. One example is the Rhondda Heritage Park, a museum commemorating what was once the powerhouse of the industrial revolution. It is a cultural change in which government money is only part of the answer, as the relative failure of the valleys initiative has shown. Two years ago, in a report Resurrecting the Valleys - Can Existing Policies Do the Job?, Mr Kevin Morgan of the University of Wales wrote: 'A new recipe for social and economic regeneration involves far more than additional resources. While finance may indeed be the key ingredient, it is not of itself sufficient. In other words, the future shape of the valleys . . . is partly in our own hands.' Today, that has been brought home only too clearly to the Tower miners.</p>

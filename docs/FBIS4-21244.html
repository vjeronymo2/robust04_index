			<p>for   Heroin   <F P=102> AU1604151694 Prague CTK in English 1744 GMT 15 Apr 94 </F> <F P=103> AU1604151694 </F> <F P=104>  Prague CTK </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] Munich, April 15 (CTK) -- Bavarian Interior Minister  Gunther Beckstein today described Czech-Bavarian cooperation in  the drive against organized crime as excellent.    ``Policemen in both (bordering) countries are well aware of  the fact that criminals, not national contradictions, are their  common enemies. The problems which appear in big politics are  fortunately not felt in security policy,'' Beckstein said in an  interview with CTK.    He said he considered car smuggling, documents forgery,  illegal migration and antiques smuggling from the Czech Republic  the main problems on the common Bavarian-Czech border.    ``Antiques smuggling considerably harms the Czech  Republic,''  said Beckstein, adding that Bavaria ``has taken many successful  steps in this respect. The Czechs did so in the smuggling of  German cars.''    The Czech-Bavarian border is also the main route for heroin  smugglers. Last year customs officials seized 520 kilograms on  the Czech-Bavarian border and 531 kilograms the year before.    With regard to illegal immigration, Beckstein said Bavaria  wanted a readmission agreement between the Czech Republic and  Germany to be concluded soon.    In 1993 Bavarian border guards detained almost 1,700 people  smuggling refugees, of whom 1,285 were seized on the  Czech-Bavarian border and the rest on the Bavarian-Austrian  border.</p>

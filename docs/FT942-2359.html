			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Media Futures: Barclays in-house revolution Barclays Bank is accelerating in-house multimedia developments designed to keep it competitive in electronic banking and take it into new business areas. It has been shaken by the speed with which the major telecommunications companies have managed to provide acceptable multimedia services, such as video-on-demand over conventional telephone lines. Now it is planning to have its first interactive trials in some branches by the end of the year. The bank sees VOD as the model for a range of new, electronically-delivered services which will transform retail and wholesale banking over the next few years. Among the possibilities are a virtual end to branch banking and its replacement by video kiosks and interactive television offering a broad range of services, such as catalogue shopping in addition to current account processing. These threats are not new. What is new is the speed with which possibilities are becoming realities. Barclays senior management is aware of the urgency. Chairman Andrew Buxton is insisting the bank's 70 top executives take multimedia awareness training this year. Joseph De Feo, head of information technology at Barclays, says: 'We thought we had time. We planned to have the programme motoring by 1996-97 based on our estimates of the investment in infrastructure the telcos would have to make to deliver these services. They made faster progress. Here and in the US, the telcos can provide video-on-demand over the existing telephone network. We don't have five years now and this is putting pressure on developments.' Barclays has its own multimedia unit, part of Barclays Network Services. It has a staff of 15 and a budget of over Pounds 1m a year. It is managed by Anwer Shah, an experienced multimedia expert formerly with Sony of Japan and VideoLogic, the UK electronics company. De Feo believes that only Citibank of the US is taking a similar approach to multimedia. The group has already developed some pioneering products through collaboration with partners - an electronic shopping and banking kiosk with the Italian San Paulo bank, an electronic shopping catalogue through a project part funded by the European Commission - but its principal object is to prepare Barclays for the electronic future. De Feo says: 'Our intention is to have the know-how inside the group to be able to make judgments about the right avenues for us to develop: smart telephones, interactive television, or electronic kiosks.' Barclays is in close discussions with all the major multimedia players, British Telecom, AT&amp;T, Mercury and the computer suppliers. An internal programme, code named 'Columbus' is looking at the future: which suppliers the bank should form relationships with, which joint ventures it should pursue, which areas it should exploit first. De Feo says that organisations like banks will have to think radically about how multimedia will affect them. They will no longer control the delivery channel because customers will no longer go physically to branches. So he believes Barclays should play a part in the new 'channel', in the provision of software 'agents' that will lie between the customer and a broad range of multimedia services. These special computer systems will be a critical part of the delivery mechanism, carrying out a range of services on behalf of the customer. Seeking out a new car from a dealer's database automatically, for example, securing the best insurance and settling the deal through electronic funds transfer. 'Multimedia will make possible a range of services, but the customer will use an agent to gain access to them. The agent will be the brand. We would not want to get into agent work outside things we know about. But we believe we have to be a partner with the telcos or technology companies in developing agent activities. We could find that we will get as much in the way of revenues out of our participation in the agent business as we do out of banking.' De Feo reasons.</p>

At a panel discussion of the Conrad Adenauer Foundation on  the "Future of Reforms in Russia," Gaydar, with leading members  of his party and other groups of the democratic camp, advocated  the view that the amnesty decision of the State Duma in Russia  will lead to civil war.    The prominent Russian reformer advised the finance ministers  and central bank chiefs of the seven leading industrialized  nations (G-7), who will meet at Kronberg Castle over the weekend  [26-27 February], to postpone further payment of IMF loans until  "the efficient use of the money can be ensured" through specific  progress in the reforms. This is not the case under the current  circumstances. Nowadays, further external financial aid from  the West is pointless, Gaydar said.    The decisive thing is that Russia continue the initiated  course of reform of its own accord and ensure the stabilization  of the ruble. As long as the new government continues to drive  the state finances into ever higher deficits with ever new  promises of expenditure, one need not be surprised if Russian  companies transfer more and more dollars into Swiss accounts.    Gaydar harshly criticized the Chernomyrdin government for  giving the ruble additional inflation by relapsing into the  monetary union, as in the case of Belarus. The monetary union  with other follow-up republics of the former Soviet Union has  caused costs amounting to 10 percent of the Russian GNP. It is  quite clear that reformers like himself did not make themselves  popular by uncoupling themselves from the other republics.    Viktor I. Sheinis, another high-ranking representative from  the democratic camp, namely from the "Yavlinskiy-Bodyrev-Lukin  Group" (Yablonko), painted a somber picture after the latest  surprise coup of the old communists and ultranationalists in the  State Duma. Dangers are growing in Russia -- also for the West  -- that are much greater than the Iraq threat was at its time.  At that time, the West mobilized gigantic resources at very  short notice for the Gulf War.    The Yablonko representative referred to the parallels  between  today's Russia and the Germany of the Weimar Republic, which was  humiliated by the Treaty of Versailles. Ultrarightists and old  communists are not offering any solutions for the enormous  problems, but they are using the people's misery, which has been  spreading following the collapse of the communist economic  system. They are sowing hatred and use foreign policy topics as  a playing ground for the domestic struggle for power. In view  of the fragmentation and the difficulties in establishing  democratic party structures, for instance, the democrats will  have a very difficult position over the next months and years,  Sheinis said.    More clearly than the other politicians, who had flown in  from Moscow, Sheinis pointed out that democrats and market  economy reformers contributed primarily with their own mistakes  to giving the old communists and the ultrarightists their  current majorities in the large country.    How harshly Russian democrats can polemize against the role  of NATO in Bosnia and in the new relations with the East  European reform states was shown by Sergey N. Yushenkov, member  of the Defense Committee in the State Duma and manager of  Gaydar's parliamentary group. On the other hand, Boris A.  Solutukhin, who is responsible for human rights issues in  Gaydar's group, made it clear that Russia's citizens will not  easily permit themselves to be put into the straitjacket of a  dictatorship again.    The Russian democrats, however, seemed to agree on one  issue,  namely that the amnesty decision, which is supported by an  unholy alliance of ultrarightists and old communists with a  surprising majority, cannot be abolished by the courts. Rather,  the opponents of economic reforms and democracy hardly have any  other choice "than to adjust to even worse times." [sentence as  published]</p>

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIRGINIA BEATS N.C. STATE, MOVES INTO ACC LEAD  </P> <P> The star quarterbacks flopped and the statistics lied. Otherwise, it was just  an ordinary upset as No. 24 Virginia beat No. 18 North Carolina State, 20-9,  Saturday at Raleigh, N.C.  </P> <P> The victory enabled Virginia to take over first place in the Atlantic Coast  Conference.  </P> <P> The high-powered Cavaliers lost almost every offensive category but the final  score.  </P> <P> The Wolfpack ran 79 plays to Virginia's 49, and had 26 first downs to the  Cavaliers' 13. N.C. State also held the ball for more than 36 minutes.  </P> <P> Virginia's Shawn Moore and N.C. State's Shane Montgomery are considered by many  two of the best quarterbacks in the South. But Montgomery left early with a  concussion and Moore completed only three of 10 passes for 113 yards.  </P> <P> Still, Moore had reason to smile after teammate Jason Wallace returned an  interception 40 yards for a touchdown and Jake McInerney extended his  consecutive field goal streak to 14 for the victory.  </P> <P> The victory puts the Cavaliers (8-2 and 5-1) in position to win their first ACC  football title. Virginia's final ACC game will be in two weeks against rival  Maryland.  </P> <P> The Wolfpack (7-2 and 4-2) lost for the fourth consecutive time to the  Cavaliers.  </P> <P> Montgomery broke Erik Kramer's school passing mark with 42 yards on the game's  opening drive before being injured. Montgomery has 4,626 career passing yards  to Kramer's 4,602.  </P> <P> Montgomery is not expected to miss a game.  </P></p>

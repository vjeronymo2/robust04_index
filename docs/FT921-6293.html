			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Russia plans to end price controls on key items THE RUSSIAN government yesterday announced politically explosive plans to remove the remaining price controls on key items ranging from oil to vodka in the next two months. The announcement is a bold gamble by the government to push through radical economic reforms in the face of gathering political opposition, and to secure early financial assistance from the west. A draft programme worked out with the International Monetary Fund and approved by the government yesterday would keep price controls on medicines, baby food and local services such as rents. Oil and gas prices will be liberalised when the heating season ends on April 20, but the price of basic consumer items such as vodka, bread, milk, matches and sugar will be freed by the end of March. The timing is politically risky given that the price rises will be introduced just a week before the convening of the Congress of People's Deputies, Russia's top legislature, whose increasingly discontented members have the power to sack the government. To offset such discontent, the government hopes to secure significant western support by the end of March, when the executive board of the IMF is expected to give its final seal of approval to the programme that is now being forwarded to it in Washington. Although IMF resources will only be available later this year, a positive response should give Russia access to other western finance - including a stabilisation fund for the rouble - which have been made conditional on IMF support. A debt relief package granted by the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries to the republics also comes up for renewal at the end of March. Its extension until the end of this year is conditional upon the implementation of IMF-approved reforms. Most Russian retail prices were liberalised on January 2, with devastating effects for consumers. But the prices of some essential items remained regulated - albeit at a much higher fixed price - for fear of a consumer backlash. Mr Yegor Gaidar, the deputy prime minister responsible for economic reform, told yesterday's cabinet meeting that the further liberalisation would help create a 'normally functioning market mechanism by the end of the year'.

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan tumbles as magistrates warn Berlusconi Weakness on Wall Street was the main driving force yesterday, but Italy had its own domestic troubles. MILAN tumbled 2.1 per cent after magistrates confirmed that Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had been issued an investigation warning in connection with corruption allegations. The Comit index fell 13.37 to 635.27 as the day's developments raised worries that the fast moving political situation could distract attention from the passage of the 1995 budget through the Senate by its year-end deadline. Losses were seen in all sectors, with the blue chips particularly hard hit. Fiat lost L167 or 2.7 per cent at L6,119 and Parmalat, the milk and food group, was L74 or 4.4 per cent down at L1,605. Among the telecommunications stocks, Stet fell L205 to L4,768 and Telecom Italia was L155 or 3.5 per cent weaker at L4,224. ZURICH's attention was firmly fixed on a live television broadcast of the UBS shareholders meeting. The SMI index dipped 35.2 or 1.4 per cent to 2,571.8, depressed by the weaker dollar and the malaise elsewhere in Europe. UBS bearers fell SFr26 to SFr1,159, with the bank said to be a seller, and the registered stock shed SFr11 to SFr268 as the market awaited the news that the shareholders had approved the creation of a single class of share, which came after the market had closed. Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision fell SFr25 to SFr1,345 as it emerged that the investment trust had already lodged a provisional appeal at Zurich's company registration office two week's ago. Mr Ian McEwan at Merrill Lynch commented that the shares now faced a confused passage in the short term, although in the longer term, he reiterated his view that they had been driven substantially over fundamental value. Chemical and pharmaceutical blue chips were lower, with Ciba down another SFr3 at SFr766. Dealers said they expected only short-term weakness in Ciba following Monday's announcement that it was to acquire 49.9 per cent of Chiron, the US biotechnology company, for a price above market expectations. Goldman Sachs, however, commented that the deal made excellent strategic sense. It raised its longer term rating on the stock, forecasting that the price could reach SFr900 over the next year. Nestle, which is to report 10-month sales today, lost SFr25 at SFr1,205, with analysts forecasting flat sales growth, depressed by negative currency factors. The main industrial issues were also lower. Sulzer declined SFr9 to SFr905 as James Capel downgraded the stock, noting that its order levels were rising, but not by enough to suggest that earnings from the cyclical businesses were set to explode. PARIS regained the 1,900 level by the close, with the CAC-40 index down 16.42 at 1,911.41. Turnover amounted to FFr3.6bn. Alcatel Alsthom remained under pressure, the shares down FFr7.90 to FFr415.00, on news that the chairman of a subsidiary had been detained for questioning in connection with an investigation into alleged false billing and overcharging of France Telecom. However, the stock came off a low for the year of FFr410.10 as the main board of the group declined a resignation offer from the executive. There was no let-off in demand for Renault, with turnover approaching FFr365m as the shares slipped 80 centimes to finish at FFr180.20. FRANKFURT was pulled down by technical weakness. The Dax index was off 30.51 at 2,074.77, recovering some of the losses in post-bourse trading to 2,072.49. Turnover totalled DM5.5bn. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, yesterday advised market watchers not to expect a change in monetary policy at tomorrow's regular meeting of the council. The market is now awaiting results from the chemical and bank sectors, which are due to start later this week. On the banks, Merrill Lynch in a recent note suggested that the 10-month results should be broadly neutral and summarised that the sector was likely to 'outperform mildly over the intermediate term in the context of an unspectacular market'. Among chemicals, BASF, which launches the results season tomorrow, is widely expected to show a substantial improvement in nine-month profits. The stock closed yesterday at DM305.80, down DM8.00. Volkswagen, off DM5.70 at DM461.80, has been attracting reasonably bullish comments from analysts. Mr Keith Hayes at Merrill Lynch said that he had raised his opinion on the basis of the recent share price pullback, but over the long term he remained 'severely sceptical'. AMSTERDAM finished sharply down in a session that was pressured by events largely outside the market. The AEX index fell 4.75 to 406.44. In the absence of corporate news the trend was one way, assisted also by dollar weakness - Philips declined Fl 1.30 to Fl 51.70, Royal Dutch Fl 2.60 to Fl 187.80 and Unilever Fl 2.20 to Fl 194.30. Elsewhere, NedLloyd dipped Fl 3.40 to Fl 53.20, affected mainly by retail selling. MADRID's direction was dictated by falls elsewhere and the General index finished 2.00 lower at 302.37. Turnover of Pta16bn was well below the levels of recent days as industrials suffered profit-taking after the sharp gains in previous sessions.

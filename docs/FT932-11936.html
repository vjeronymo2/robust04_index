			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Observer: Who will turn on the gas? In the hunt for a successor to chairman Bob Evans, British Gas seems prepared to look beyond a deep-in-the-pipe gas chap to complement chief executive Cedric Brown who is settling down as an effective 'operations' man. Lord Walker, a non-executive director likely to be influential in the search, is indeed reputed to be angling for it himself, but, given the controversy over privatisation on his watch as energy secretary, that would not be an inspired solution. What is needed is an outsider who can tackle a bureaucratic giant and, maybe, preside over its break-up. Evans, who joined the company in 1950, was never likely to turn the company on its head. Sir Peter Holmes retires from Shell shortly - and oil men have been considered before. David Simon is thought to have been approached for the chairmanship when Sir Denis Rooke left; later, of course, he took charge of BP on the ousting of Bob Horton. (Now there's a terrifying thought for the board; Horton is, after all, distinctly under-employed heading Railtrack.) But a completely fresh mind is really what is needed. No doubt a blue-eyed boy like Sir Christopher Hogg would be hard to persuade. But how about Sir Denys Henderson? Or perhaps BT chairman Iain Vallance fancies a change of watchdog? Since leaving British Steel, Sir Bob Scholey hasn't picked up anything that would stand in the way. Finally, who says the gamekeeper won't turn poacher? Sir James McKinnon, whose views on Evans were warmly reciprocated, retires from Ofgas in September. Meanwhile, the Ofgas boss is believed to favour a woman as his own successor  -on the quaint theory that most gas consumers are female - given that they do the cooking, pay the bills and write the complaining letters. Sally Hunt, director of economic consultancy Nera was on the list for the Oftel job following Sir Bryan Carsberg, so perhaps someone will ring her.</p>

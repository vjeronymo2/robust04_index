			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Virginia Silveira] </F>   [Text] Sao Jose dos Campos -- The Aerospace Technical  Center's (CTA) Experimental Physics Division in Sao Jose dos  Campos is constructing a large-sized electron linear accelerator  to conduct experiments that may furnish data of interest in  nuclear technology and in the development of techniques for  industrial use of radiation.    The first stage of the project, in its final phase of  completion, includes a small-sized accelerator capable of  generating energy on the order of 30 mega-electron volts (Mev)  of power. The director of the Institute of Advanced Studies  (IEAv -- part of the CTA), Colonel Hugo Pereira Chavez,  remarked: "That energy is sufficient to solve 80 percent of the  problems relating to studies in the nuclear field."    He reported that the final configuration of the accelerator  will have eight accelerator structures 2 meters long, fed by  four Klystron (high-powered) valves, and energy totaling 130  Mev. The accelerator is being installed in the underground  gallery of a building designed to meet all the radiological  safety operational requirements.    The first part of the project occupies a two-story building  inside the IEAv area, where 15 nuclear physics specialists and  technicians are working. According to director Pereira Chaves,  the project absorbed $5 million in investments within an  eight-year period. The resources were financed by the Parallel  Nuclear Program associated with the Federal Government's  Strategic Affairs Secretariat.  <H5>  Laboratories </H5>   The IEAv director thinks that, with slightly over $5  million,  it will be possible to complete the construction of the  accelerator in eight modules. This step is considered essential  to the development of an autonomous national nuclear program.  The IEAv's accelerator project involves the construction of  microwave, electronics, electron beam transport and focusing,  vacuum, and chemical laboratories.    The accelerator will also consist of an electron gun (source  emitting electrons). The IEAv has already built and tested two  versions of the gun. According to Colonel Pereira Chaves, the  second version is now in operation, and is undergoing an  optimization process.    The director claims that one important aspect of the  electron  gun was the pioneer development in Brazil of the metal-ceramic  weld, a process with extensive technological applications  already transmitted to other research institutions.    The IEAv also has developed the electron beam injection  system, the accelerator structure, a microwave network, a  Klystron modulator, a control system (allowing for mechanical  operation of the accelerator), a vacuum system (with pressure of  10-9 torr/pressure unit), and a cooling system.    Among the accelerator's main applications is the evaluation  of the effects of irradiation of materials in the industrial  field, with uses in radiochemistry, environmental pollution, and  sterilization of surgical materials and food. Another  application might be the development of experiments for  radiological protection (shielding), to assess damage from  irradiation of materials in the nuclear and aerospace fields.  <H5>  Processes </H5>   Through the accelerator, the IEAv has now succeeded in  producing electron beams with energy of 30 Mev. "With that  energy, it is possible to carry out experiments with the  production of pulsated neutrons simulating nuclear reactors."  According to the IEAv director, with the accelerator project it  was possible to develop various techniques of interest in other  fields, as well as to master special processes not yet available  in Brazil.    Prominent among the processes are those for metal-ceramic  weld, electroforming (shaping of surfaces), construction of an  electron gun, magnetic lenses (focusing of electromagnetic  radiation), and microwave components.</p>

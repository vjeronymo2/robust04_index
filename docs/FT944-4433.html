			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank has had a dreadful year. The collapse of Metallgesellschaft and the Schneider scandal have dented the bank's reputation and profits. The recent rebound in the bank's share price suggests investors are beginning to look on the catalogue of mishaps as a thing of the past. But yesterday's 10-month results are unlikely to encourage any further re-rating. The figures are discouraging on a number of points. The 2.7 per cent drop in interest income on the comparable period of 1993 contrasts starkly with gains of more than 10 per cent at Dresdner Bank and Commerzbank in the same period. Clearly Deutsche's mainstream lending business is performing more sluggishly than those of its smaller rivals. This is in part due to Deutsche's prudent policy of scaling back loans during the German recession, but there has been no corresponding decline in risk provisioning. New provisions remain high and it is little consolation that the extraordinary gains on the sale of stakes in Daimler-Benz and Karstadt have been swallowed up by big write-offs against Metallgesellschaft and Schneider. Deutsche has avoided the loss on own-account trading experienced by Dresdner, but analysts are still downgrading forecasts. As a result Deutsche's shares now look fairly valued versus other German banks. Another drag on the share price is the possibility that Deutsche will back up its ambitions in the investment banking field with a big acquisition. This would entail a large goodwill write-off and the bank might have to turn to shareholders to rebuild core capital.</p>

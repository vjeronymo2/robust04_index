			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Quality queriedas flotation fatigue sets in: Maggie Urry finds some overheating ahead of the next wave of new issues The new issues market badly needed the rest provided by the holiday season. This year's flood of companies coming to the stock market has put such a strain on investors that recent flotations have suffered. There is every prospect of the rush resuming in the new year, with names such as Dairy Crest, House of Fraser, Ashanti Goldfields, Beazer Homes and Alpha Airports Group, part of Forte, lined up. The overheating of the new issues market has meant that some recent issuers have had to accept a lower price than they might have hoped for, while others have withdrawn flotations. The market's attack of indigestion was caused by a surfeit of issues in November, and has been worsened by the inclusion of some unpalatable deals. Quality control of new issues has become a worrying challenge for the City. The excess of issues in November can be put down to companies waiting until the summer holidays were over before starting the marketing build-up - meaning the earliest float date would be in mid-October - while aiming to squeeze in before the November 30 Budget. There were also a dozen issues from companies set up to be corporate members of Lloyd's under the insurance market's new rules. 'The market has seen six months worth of issues in six weeks,' says one corporate financier. The amount of money being demanded by flotations has not of itself been a problem. New issues have called on about Pounds 5bn this year, while rights issues have taken more than Pounds 11bn. But nearly all the issues have been from companies regarded by professional fund managers as 'small', usually consigned to specific small company funds. Their flotations have often been primarily directed at institutional investors through placings. Managers of small company funds have been inundated with requests from issue sponsors to meet the companies' managements. One fund manager says: 'I have to fight them off. I ask myself can I spare the time to see them? It's a matter of doing a bit of quick desk research first.' He admits to dismissing Celltech - a recent biotechnology issue which did not meet enthusiastic support - on the grounds that 'I don't understand those sorts of things'. The second problem, that of quality, is more serious. One merchant banker puts it delicately: 'There have been a lot of issues this year which have been not the highest quality and have been overpriced.' The ease with which companies have floated and the prices obtained - usually higher than could be achieved through a trade sale - has tempted more to come to market. Within the total, bankers and brokers say, there are bound to be a few less good businesses. 'There are always pearls among the swine, you just have to be selective,' says the fund manager. Investors' selectivity has left some companies attracting poor demand for their shares. Some, such as Lilliput Group, which makes ornamental houses, and Court Cavendish, the nursing home operator, saw the share price sink below the issue price. Others which floated before the summer lull have since warned on profits and suffered share price falls. Drew Scientific, which makes diagnostic medical kits, floated in May. In October Drew announced it would make a loss in the six months to September 30, rather than the profit investors had expected. It had been having problems since July with a component for its kits. 'None of this was known when we issued the prospectus,' the chairman said. The shares now stand at 63p, compared with the 105p issue price. A similar tale came from Holliday Chemicals, which makes industrial dyes. It floated in March at 195p and reported a slight fall in interim profits in August. Last month it issued a warning about full-year profits and its share have fallen to 160p. The case which has upset investors most, though, was last month's collapse into receivership of Swithland Group less than two weeks after the car dealer had failed in its attempt to float. It became clear the group needed the cash it would have raised from the issue simply to survive. The issue, which was not underwritten, did not attract sufficient demand to go ahead. Sponsors of issues, usually merchant banks or stockbrokers, have always given an implicit seal of approval to an issue simply by putting their name to it. From December 1, though, the London Stock Exchange's listing rules changed, increasing sponsors' responsibilities while allowing a wider range of advisers to act as sponsors. They are now required to write a formal letter to the exchange confirming that the listing rules have been complied with - which includes ensuring that 'proper disclosure' has been made. If a sponsor is found to have broken its obligations, the exchange can censure it, disqualify it from acting as a sponsor and publish the reasons. A sponsor could jeopardise its reputation if it brought a company to market which later proved to have misled investors in its prospectus. In public sponsors say they are unconcerned about the new letters which, they protest, only formalise an existing commitment to supervise issues properly. Mr Nigel Atkinson, head of listings at the exchange, says he hopes the new letters will make sponsors more responsible. Even before the rule change, he says, the exchange has made a point of following up cases such as profit warnings soon after a float. Advisers are given a 'hard time' over the due diligence they carried out when preparing the prospectus. If next year's bout of new issues is to find a receptive market, sponsors will have to show more restraint in picking the companies they are prepared to bring to market. And investors must continue to be vigilant in examining the prospectuses and grilling the management.</p>

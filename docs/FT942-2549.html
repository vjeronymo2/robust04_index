			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / The Long View: Teenage masterminds 'This time it's going to be different.' It is the regular plea of the salesman, the politician and the bad payer, but prudent long-term investors will prefer to assume that things will stay much the same. We even had a rail strike this week to remind us of the old days. Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, told the City on Wednesday that there would not be another boom-and-bust cycle. But many Tory backbenchers see tax-cutting as the only means by which they might salvage their parliamentary seats at the next general election. In any case, coldly calculating City investors will reason that in two or three years' time the Tories could be swept away and replaced by a Tony Blair-led Labour government with a commitment to full employment. So far, certainly, the British economic recovery looks like a throwback to the past. Consumer spending has been the engine of recovery, based on a falling rate of savings, and import volumes have been rising faster than export volumes. Compare this with the recovery now beginning in Germany, where domestic consumption is flat but export orders are rising sharply. History suggests that although the Treasury may not repeat its mistakes it is liable to make a new one. This is the department, remember, that guided the British economy into the Lawson boom of the late 1980s, when an economic miracle was declared; that steered the economy into a deep recession that John Major had said need never happen; and next, directed us into the European exchange rate mechanism which we would never be forced to leave. As for current policy, it is ill-defined but is somehow based on regular discussions between Kenneth Clarke and Eddie George at the Bank of England, who between them will manipulate short-term interest rates at precisely the right time. But they are like old soldiers re-running the D-Day invasion when today's battles are developing elsewhere. The big problems now concern long-term interest rates, which have been rocketing up all year. Not only has this taken the Treasury by surprise but it shows little inclination to grasp what is going on or to realise that there will be important policy implications. Kenneth Clarke's contribution on Wednesday was, rudely, to accuse the City markets of being 'schizophrenic' in that traders and investors were panicking over inflation when the analysts and economists in the next office were forecasting that the government's targets would be immaculately reached. Personally, I can no longer use the word schizophrenic in this column. When I do, the Schizophrenia Association of Great Britain complains that I am trivialising a distressing condition. Quite. In any case, Clarke has got it completely wrong, in two ways. The allegedly perspicacious analysts, are part of the sales teams used by the big securities houses to persuade investors to buy stocks and bonds, including billions of British government gilts. There is no reason why traders and investors should take what they say at face value, any more than they should have put their money behind Clarke's promises on Thursday morning (which they did not). Secondly, it is misleading to suggest that inflation is the main problem. Certainly, many investors are expecting some cyclical pick-up over the next year or two (to 4 per cent by the end of next year, according to the latest Smith New Court/Gallup opinion survey). Yet this scarcely explains why gilt yields have jumped by more than two percentage points this year, still less why German ten-year bond yields this week rose above corresponding returns on US Treasuries. Could it be that we are finally heading for the global capital shortage which has been much predicted? It was temporarily deferred by last year's speculative bond market bubble but, with economic recovery now getting under way in continental Europe, the conditions for a serious global capital squeeze are slotting into place. The boom continues in the third world, and the former Communist states of eastern Europe are accelerating, not least in their demands for imported capital. Investment demands are rising globally. Only the continued recession in Japan offers a moderating influence and a compensating flow of savings. A couple of years ago, the Treasury mapped out its recovery strategy against the background of a growing and liquid global bond market. The UK could run very large twin deficits - a public sector borrowing requirement which peaked at Pounds 43bn in 1993 and a balance of payments deficit which was Pounds 11bn last year and is likely to rise. We could live beyond our means and borrow the difference. A recovery based on high consumption and declining savings could be tolerated. Sometime like, er, 1999 we would eventually return to balance. The UK was not, of course, alone in this. Too many countries have tried to put their snouts in the same trough. Some face worse problems, such as Spain and Italy where government bond yields are above 10 per cent. In a world of scarce capital, borrowing is not a cheap and easy option. Even last year the Bank of England was reluctant to issue long-dated gilts at 7 per cent or less, but now it faces market rates of over 8 1/2 per cent. The policy response is likely to be to roll over the accumulating deficit on a short-term basis, largely through the banks, but that will threaten loss of monetary control (now troubling the Bundesbank) and an eventual confidence crisis. A different economic strategy is required: further tax increases to curb consumption and reduce the deficits. In a growing world economy there is scope to rely much more heavily on exports to support output and employment. And when capital is expensive it pays to be a lender, not a borrower. That does not look like a way of winning an election. But it really would be different.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE ORDERS SEIZED ASSAULT GUNS RELEASED  </P> <P> In a major blow to the Bush Administration's ban on foreign-made assault guns,  a federal judge Wednesday ordered the Customs Service to release more than  1,000 semiautomatic rifles seized at an Alabama airport, ruling that the  government had no right to bar entry to weapons purchased under valid import  permits.  </P> <P> The Alabama judge's decision overturned the seizure of weapons at one site as  part of a nationwide government effort to intercept shipments of any of the  640,000 assault rifles that already had been approved for import but had not  yet entered the United States.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Impact of Ruling Uncertain  </P> <P> So far at least 4,000 weapons have been blocked at import points. It was  uncertain what effect Wednesday's ruling will have on the 3,000 or more assault  weapons seized elsewhere. U.S. officials declined comment on the case until  they can review the judge's order.  </P> <P> The setback for the government came in the first legal challenge to the  sweeping Administration ban.  </P> <P> In a sworn declaration in the case, Stephen Higgins, director of the Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, had warned that "although the number of weapons  involved in this (Alabama) case might appear to be insignificant, the overall  issue involves the importation of over three-quarters of a million firearms."  </P> <P> A ruling against the government, he declared, would "undermine" the  government's review of its policy on possession and sale of assault weapons.  </P> <P> The Alabama ruling has no direct effect on another element of the government's  crackdown -- a moratorium on issuing additional permits for importing 29 types  of assault rifles until the Administration decides whether they are used for  legitimate sporting purposes.  </P> <P> But the strongly worded decision by U.S. District Judge William M. Acker Jr. in  Birmingham criticized even that provision of the ban, contending that it  interferes with the right of Congress to enact laws.  </P> <P> Because the weapons previously had been deemed suitable for importation, the  judge argued, the Administration cannot now refuse to grant new permits for  them unless Congress amends the nation's gun control laws.  </P> <P> The order was issued in response to a lawsuit by Gun South Inc., a Trussville,  Ala., weapons importer.  </P> <P> The company sought to win the release of 1,100 Austrian-made Steyr-Aug rifles  held up late last month at Birmingham airport by Customs Service agents acting  under orders from the Treasury Department.  </P> <P> Gun South had received permission to import the weapons earlier this year.  While the Steyr-Aug rifles were among the five types of assault guns named in  the March 14 moratorium on new imports, the company was told by federal  officials that the action would have no effect on weapons for which permits had  already been granted.  </P> <P> Gun South already had ordered some 1,100 guns from its Austrian-made  manufacturer and was awaiting their delivery. By the time the weapons arrived  in Alabama later in the month, however, the government had notified the company  of its decision to widen the ban by suspending the permits. On that basis, it  ordered the Customs Service to bar the shipment from entering the country.  </P> <P> The Alabama judge issued an injunction barring the government from interfering  with "routine delivery" of the 1,100 weapons, which have been stored in a  Birmingham warehouse. In a 28-page decision, he contended that the government  had no right to interdict weapons "purchased under permits validly issued and  valid when acted upon."  </P> <P> The decision apparently will permit Gun South to import another 3,500  Steyr-Augs that it ordered in mid-March before being informed of the  government's decision to widen the ban by suspending further imports.  </P> <P> The judge declined to rule on the broader question of whether the government  had the right to suspend the permits at all. He indicated that weapons ordered  by Gun South after it had learned of the government's decision would not be  affected by his ruling.  </P> <P> The ruling has no direct effect on the government's seizure of at least 3,000  other assault guns that the Customs Service has barred from entering the United  States under the temporary moratorium. But the weapons, which arrived in U.S.  ports around the country early this month, probably would be permitted to enter  the domestic market if other courts follow the precedent set by the Alabama  judge.  </P></p>

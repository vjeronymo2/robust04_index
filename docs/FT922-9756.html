			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: MPs' vote sidelines Tasmanian pulp project NORTH BROKEN Hill Peko, the Australian resources group, yesterday shelved plans for a major pulp mill in Tasmania after legislation guaranteeing access to timber was defeated in Parliament. Mr Peter Wade, managing director, said the mill would not proceed without acceptable resource security legislation and the strong and active support of both major political parties. 'In the apparent absence of these assurances, no expenditure will take place towards furthering the development of our project or associated activities,' he said. Mr Wade said the failure of the project would send a clear signal to the international investment community about the increasing difficulties faced by resource development companies in Australia. The proposed paper mill is the first casualty of the Labor government's failure to win sufficient opposition support in the federal senate for its controversial Forest Conservation and Development Bill. The Bill, which would have guaranteed conditional access to native growth forests for timber industry projects valued at a minimum of ADollars 100m, was strongly opposed by a coalition of environmental organisations. However, it was also heavily criticised by many timber companies for failing to provide guaranteed access to resources for smaller projects, which are responsible for the majority of timber industry activity. As a result, the Bill was opposed by the conservative Liberal/National Party coalition for offering insufficient assistance to industry, and by the environmentalist Australian Democrats for offering too much. The opposition parties combined to defeat the Bill after the failure of tortuous negotiations with Mr Alan Griffiths, the resources minister and chief government supporter of resource security. However, the defeat appeared not to concern Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, who is believed to have shared environmentalist concerns that the Bill would promote the destruction of old growth native forests. Mr Phillip Toyne, executive director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, said the defeat of the Bill would clear the way for the timber industry to be placed on an 'ecologically sustainable footing', which would mean concentrating on plantation timber rather than native forests.</p>

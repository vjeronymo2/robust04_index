One-third of the injuries and illnesses were  in manufacturing, which accounts for more than 20% of the work force.  </P> <P> One of every 11 workers will be seriously injured or killed at work, according  to the National Safe Workplace Institute.  </P> <P> A U.S. worker is injured every 16 seconds and one of every six workers will die  from occupation-related diseases, the institute said.  </P> <P> Disabilities  </P> <P> Permanent work-related disabilities rose from 60,000 to 70,000 from 1986 to  1987 -- nearly a 17% increase, the National Safety Council said.  </P> <P> However, the rate of disabling work injuries per 1 million exposure hours  dropped from 8.3 to 8.1 in the same period, the council noted.  </P> <P> Dangerous Industries  </P> <P> In 1987, ship building and repairing led the nation with 40.1 injuries and  illnesses per 100 full-time workers, the government said. Among other hazardous  industries were meatpacking and mobile homes construction.  </P> <P> U.S. vs. Others  </P> <P> The United States had the highest worker fatality rate compared with six other  industrialized nations, the workplace institute said. Figures compiled by the  International Labor Office showed the industrial accident death rate was 3.6  per 100,000 workers.  </P> <P> Japan was second-highest with 2.3 deaths, followed by Italy, 1.6; France, 1;  West Germany, 0.8; the United Kingdom, 0.4; Sweden, 0.1. (All figures 1986  except Italy, 1984).  </P> <P> Repetitive Trauma  </P> <P> Reported repetitive trauma disorder cases, including hearing loss, rose from  26,700 in 1983 to 72,940 in 1987, the government said.  </P> <P> Such cases accounted for 38% of occupational illnesses in 1987, contrasted with  28% in 1984, according to a Labor Department survey. Such ailments hit 4 of  every 100 poultry processing and meatpacking workers in 1987.  </P> <P> Meatpacking  </P> <P> More than a third of packinghouse workers will suffer a serious illness or  injury this year, translating into more than 52,000 workers annually or 200  daily, the United Food and Commercial Workers Union said.  </P> <P> Between 1981 and 1983, meatpacking production jumped by 52%, the union said,  while employment declined by almost 20%.  </P> <P> Poultry  </P> <P> Workers doing evisceration work handled 50 to 70 birds a minute in the '70s;  now they're processing up to 90 birds a minute, the Institute for Southern  Studies said.  </P> <P> Construction, Mining and Manufacturing  </P> <P> In construction, total lost workdays per 100 workers in 1987 came to 135.8,  contrasted with 69.9 for all private-sector industries, the government said.  The comparable statistic was 144 in mining and 95.5 in manufacturing.  </P> <P> Autos  </P> <P> Total injury rates in large plants in the motor vehicle industry reported to  the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 1987 were 2.5 times those reported in 1985,  according to congressional testimony by the United Autoworkers Union.  </P> <P> Costs  </P> <P> The workplace institute estimates that a worker fatality costs the economy $1.4  million, including lost income and taxes. Other estimates range from $900,000  to $1.9 million.  </P></p>

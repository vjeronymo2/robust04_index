			<p>BFN     [Text] National Assembly May 27 SAPA -- Admonitions on the  dangers of the ANC abusing its majority to stifle and swamp  smaller parties were grossly misplaced, President Nelson Mandela  said on Friday.    Wrapping up the historic debate on his opening speech to  South Africa's first democratically elected Parliament, Mr  Mandela paid tribute to the central role played by the people  and their many organisations in gaining democracy.    Quoting the Freedom Charter, Mr Mandela traced the struggle  for democracy. "Today, all the members of the house, no matter  which party you belong to, are here in the full knowledge that  you are the legitimate representative of the will of the  people," he said.    The ANC had resisted undemocratic attempts to shackle  majority rule. "The plan for a government of democratic unity  we put forward -- and which is now operative -- is inclusive and  democratic," he said.    The ANC had expanded its primary Cosatu [Congress of South  African Trade Unions]/SACP [South African Communist Party]  alliance to include the patriotic front, with its commitment to  inclusivity for the sake of nation-building finding its latest  expression in the government of national unity. "Admonitions  directed at our address about the dangers of a majority party  abusing its majority to stifle and swamp smaller parties are,  therefore, grossly misplaced. Our record in this regard should  certainly speak for itself."    "We are not expecting uncritical adulation and applause."    The people's confidence in the future should not however be  undermined by constant insinuations that the ANC was indifferent  to the concerns of political minorities when it had consistently  demonstrated how seriously those concerns were taken. "Our  objective is to continue operating in this balanced way, true to  the precept of the Freedom Charter that all national groups  shall have equal rights, the overriding obligation of course  being to meet the needs and improve the lives of the suffering  people."    He was encouraged that this was generally agreed to by all  parties.    He said there had been moving moments in the debate as  speakers responded to the exciting, inspirational and liberating  possibilities and realities of new-found South Africanness.  "Listening to our Afrikaner compatriots in this house hailing  the dawn of the new democratic South Africa as an event of  liberation for themselves rather than an experience of loss;  hearing the honourable leader of the Freedom Front (General  Constand Viljoen) publicly acknowledging and paying tribute to  the demonstrated desire of the majority party to create an  inclusive nation where there is place for all -- these were some  of the moments which captured the new spirit abroad in our land."    These responses had demonstrated an encouraging generosity  of  spirit, reciprocating the generosity abundantly displayed by the  oppressed and suffering people who had mandated their leaders to  negotiate a future of peace, forgiveness and inclusivity.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / A-Z of Personal Finance (17): Mainly for higher-rate taxpayers - PEPs PERSONAL EQUITY plans are a way for investors to buy shares in companies, and in unit and investment trusts, without paying tax on dividends or capital gains. Like all equity-based investments, they should be regarded as a long-term commitment. Private individuals who invest in shares usually face a big tax burden. They pay income tax at 25 or 40 per cent on dividends, and capital gains tax (also at up to 40 per cent) on any realised gains of over Pounds 5,500 in any single tax year. Peps were introduced by Nigel Lawson, then chancellor of the exchequer, at the beginning of 1987 as part of the drive towards popular capitalism, which also involved incentives for small investors to buy shares in privatised companies. They have slowly caught on, the value of funds in Peps having increased from Pounds 480m in 1987 to Pounds 1.6bn in the 1990-91 tax year. Peps appeal primarily to two sets of people: First, those looking for income. A high-yielding Pep can offer an attractive and growing tax-free income. M&amp;G Income, the investment trust launched last year, offered a 6.55 per cent yield, equivalent to 11 per cent gross for a higher-rate taxpayer. Second, wealthier investors who use up their annual Pounds 5,500 capital gains tax exemption. Putting a large sum into a Pep each year allows the investor to build up considerable tax-free gains. However, those looking for either income or capital gains will find that Pep charges mean that it can be several years before they make any real net savings in tax. At present, the tax advantages are marginal for most people. Although the income tax relief is worth, say, 2 per cent in extra dividend yield to a higher-rate taxpayer, Pep charges will cancel out at least half of this. Standard-rate payers probably do not benefit at all, compared with holding shares directly. Peps should be most attractive to higher-rate taxpayers who have already made full use of their CGT allowance of Pounds 5,500 per annum. If you already have a portfolio of shares, you cannot Pep them without first selling them and buying them back - an activity known as 'bed-and-breakfasting' shares. The limit on investments into a Pep in any one tax year is Pounds 6,000, although plans which invest only in unit trusts or investment trusts are normally limited to Pounds 3,000. An exception to the rules is new investment trust issues. A full Pounds 6,000 of a new issue can be placed in a Pep within 42 days of the day of dealing, a provision which has helped the investment trust industry. New trusts have been marketed on the basis of this allowance. There is now a fair range of Peps: Single-company Peps: Until January 1 this year, individuals could only hold one Pep. Now they can also hold a further Pounds 3,000 in a single-company Pep, so that a husband and wife can open Pounds 18,000-worth of Peps a year. The single-company Pep is most suitable for employees of the company. They are permitted a direct share transfer, provided the shares come from an Inland Revenue-approved all-employee share scheme. This saves the expense of bed-and-breakfasting the shares. A number of companies - including BP, ICI, Glaxo and BAT Industries - sponsor their own Peps, and charges for these are likely to be lower than those provided by outside plan mangers. Other investors attracted to single-company Peps will be those who already have a large diversified portfolio of shares, and thus can put Pounds 3,000 into the shares of one company without taking an excessive risk. Unit or investment trust Peps: The annual limit on investment in these is Pounds 3,000, unless it is a new investment trust issue, as mentioned above. You will achieve a much better spread through one of these funds than with other types of Pep, particularly if the amount you have to invest is limited. Many unit and investment trusts will Pep your savings (subject to a minimum) at little or no extra cost. For example, most investment trusts will Pep savings as low as Pounds 100 a month. Managed Peps are run by a manager who chooses the shares on your behalf. Some managed Peps mix unit or investment trusts with individual shares. Managed Peps are likely to have the highest charges, with an initial charge of anything from 1 to 6 per cent and an annual management charge of roughly 1-1.5 per cent. There are further charges for every share deal, which makes this sort of Pep uneconomical for the investor who pays basic-rate tax and is unlikely to use up his CGT allowance. Self-select Peps: Here you choose the shares yourself and decide when to buy and sell them. The Pep still has to be operated by an authorised plan manager. However, self-select Peps should be much cheaper than managed Peps, particularly if the shares that are Pepped are chosen on the basis of good long-term investments, minimising dealing charges. These Peps are particularly good for investors who already have a diversified portfolio of shares, though they will have to bed-and-breakfast existing shares in order to Pep them. Corporate Peps are the old version of single-company Peps, and a full Pounds 6,000 can be invested. Many companies see corporate Peps as a way of widening their shareholder base, and as a service to their small shareholders. Corporate Peps are also useful aids to profit-sharing and employee share-ownership schemes. You can have either a Pounds 6,000 corporate Pep or a general Pep, in addition to a Pounds 3,000 single-company Pep, but not all three.</p>

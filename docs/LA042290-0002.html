			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WAR STORIES FROM ECOLOGY'S ARCHDRUID;  </P> <P> FOR EARTH'S SAKE: THE LIFE AND TIMES OF DAVID BROWER BY DAVID BROWER (GIBBS  SMITH: $24.95; 527 PP., ILLUSTRATED)  </P> <P> Dave Brower is America's most charismatic conservationist. Some say -- I among  them -- that he has accomplished more through the force of one man's will than  any of his breed since John Muir. At age 77, he leads the pack for the title of  America's most arrogant, opinionated, pig-headed and autocratic conservationist  as well.  </P> <P> Brower is never dull. This man John McPhee so aptly dubbed nature's "Archdruid"  has been trying, by his own admission, to produce an autobiography for years.  "For Earth's Sake" is half the loaf, revved up to make the Earth Day  publication tie-in; Part II is scheduled for fall.  </P> <P> What Brower offers is mostly recycled essays from his years of editorializing  for the Sierra Club Bulletin and Friends of the Earth's Not Man Apart, spliced  with contemporary annotation and transition. Another environmental curmudgeon,  Edward Abbey, used the same recycling trick time after time and got away with  it for the same reason that Brower will in "For Earth's Sake": It's damned good  material. Pieces dating back more than 40 years will now find a larger audience  than Sierra Club historians.  </P> <P> Brower grew up in Berkeley, where his father taught at the university. The  unspoiled hills and streams behind campus were his introduction to nature, and  some of Berkeley's larger boulders his initiation into climbing. For all I  know, Brower's ascents of Founder's Rock may have marked the founding of that  city's renown for its mountaineers and rock climbers. He was an avid butterfly  collector, and made his acquaintance with scientific terminology, population  biology, and ecology in that way. By age 6, he was car-camping with his family  in the Sierra Nevada. Brower also loved fast cars: His claimed record of 3  hours 25 minutes from Yosemite to Berkeley in a 1934 Plymouth nearly matches my  own reckless time on modern wheels and freeways!  </P> <P> Brower failed in one area about which he is still sensitive: He dropped out of  UC Berkeley as a youth and never did graduate from college. That failure may  have catalyzed Brower's view of himself -- despite his fame -- as outsider, and  initiated his chronic distrust of experts, especially governmental ones.  </P> <P> It was the Sierra Club that focused Brower's unformed conservation and provided  his first and most important platform. He returned the favor by molding a local  nature and outdoor club into a sophisticated and powerful nationwide force for  conservation.  </P> <P> Dams loom large in Brower's legend, and they were the anvil on which Brower  hammered the club into a modern social force. Preceding Brower, the damming of  Yosemite's Hetch-Hetchy Valley had ripped the nascent Sierra Club apart. When  the wounds had healed, the legend of Hetch-Hetchy gave the club the courage to  oppose damming the Kings River, and gave us Kings Canyon National Park instead.  </P> <P> Imminent drowning of Dinosaur National Monument by the proposed Echo Park dam  and reservoir in 1954 fully brought out Brower's immense talent at writing,  speech making and playing politics. For the first time, he ruthlessly dragged  agencies such as the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corp of Engineers into  the public arena and damned them.  </P> <P> A few years later, in a bid to appear more conciliatory and in dire fear of  losing the Grand Canyon itself, the club and Brower traded away Glen Canyon  Dam. It was a terrible mistake, says Brower: "I asked Dave Brower why he just  sat, and have continued to ask him. He has no answer. . . . It was not that he  had not heard, from those who knew, how beautiful Glen Canyon was. It was not  that he thought Glen Canyon Dam was necessary, because he knew it was not. . .  . "  </P> <P> Those were heady years. By way of expiation, the Sierra Club published an  exhibit format book about Glen Canyon: "The Place No One Knew." Brower: " . . .  the moral is simple: Progress need not deny to the people their inalienable  right to be informed and to choose. In Glen Canyon the people never knew what  the choices were. Next time, in other stretches of the Colorado, on other  rivers that are still free, and wherever there is wildness that can be part of  our civilization instead of victim to it, the people need to know before a  bureau's elite decide to wipe out what no one can replace." Not blind  opposition to progress, but opposition to blind progress.  </P> <P> When flooding Grand Canyon became an issue again, Brower was ready with another  book, "Time and the River Flowing: Grand Canyon." Full-page ads in major  newspapers were the next weapon Brower tried. The ads brought waves of new  members to the Sierra Club, people who joined for conservation rather than  hiking company, and they cost the club its tax-exempt status.  </P> <P> By no means all who experienced the transition were grateful. In 1969,  revolution completed, the Sierra Club fired Brower as executive director and  premier -- an episode which Brower headlines "How the Sierra Club Misuses Power  and Talent, or How to Avoid the Four-Letter B-Word (BOLD)." The club is so  eager to appear reasonable that it goes soft, undercuts the strong grass-roots  efforts of chapters, groups and other organizations -- as if the new  professionalization and prioritization require rampant tenderization.  </P> <P> Undaunted, Brower created Friends of the Earth in his own radical image.  Scarcely a decade later, a mature and successful organization, FOE would  likewise toss out Brower. FOE could no longer function as his fief. Today,  Brower's mouthpiece is Earth Island Institute.  </P> <P> In his eighth decade, Brower is utterly unbowed. A few years back he was among  the first to back Interior Secretary Hodel's proposal to drain Hetch-Hetchy.  The conservation groups were late and weak in supporting it, not trusting Hodel  and his motives. "The city's total revenue from power from its Hetch-Hetchy  project's origin until now has far exceeded the cost of the facilities to  produce it," he writes, "and that excess has in effect been a free ride for San  Francisco at a substantial cost to the people who have been denied the  intangible benefits of Hetch- Hetchy Valley for all these years.  </P> <P> "We are not talking about just 'a campground,' as Mayor Feinstein is reported  to have described Hetch-Hetchy. We are talking about an integral part of a  national park that belongs not to San Francisco, not to California, not to the  United States but to the world as part of the World Heritage. San Francisco  owes us this one. It took Hetch- Hetchy under false pretenses in the first  place. The city claimed that no other site would do, and that was false. . . ."  </P> <P> Brower's whimsy and casual approach to facts, his assumption that agency  employees are Philistine can be maddening. At times, Brower is simply  inexplicable. For some perverse reason of his own, he credits improvements in  Yosemite Valley to the Curry Co., fabled in profit margin, rather than to his  much benighted National Park Service, which has fought Curry to reduce the  traffic and its impact.  </P> <P> Brower once lived in Yosemite Valley for three years, working for Yosemite Park  and Curry Co. He was fired by the company, yet is "impressed by its managers'  concern for the valley. Even more so now, as I marvel at the genius with which  the impact of 6 million human feet is kept to a minimum."  </P> <P> I don't know what we would have done without him.  </P></p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Channel 5 essential for regional network growth Sir, It is disappointing that once again the government is delaying a decision on the re-advertisement of Channel 5 ('Brooke delays Channel 5 further', May 10). The recent wave of takeovers against the ITV Channel 3 companies might well establish competitors with the 'skyscraper' potential to improve our position in the world markets. But, alas, this feeding frenzy has, as a by-product, accelerated the shift in programme making to London. It is worth noting that the holding companies of four out of the 'Big 5' ITV companies are headquartered in the capital. The consequence of this is that creative talent in the regions has suffered and will continue to suffer to the point of elimination. Channel 5, with its network of local city stations, will quickly restore the balance, providing creative and technical jobs in the regions - as well as extending consumer choice at no cost to the viewer or taxpayer and to the benefit of the Exchequer. If this government is genuine in its stated desire to encourage competition and to foster enterprise, it will release the appropriate frequencies to allow the ITC to readvertise Channel 5. William Lewisham, White Rose Television, 41 Park Square, Leeds, West Yorkshire LS1 2NS</p>

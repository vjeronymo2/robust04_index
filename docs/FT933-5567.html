			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: VNU climbs despite lower advert revenue VNU, the largest publishing group in the Netherlands, yesterday reported a 10 per cent rise in first-half net profit from Fl 54m to Fl 59.6m (Dollars 31.6m), on sales of Fl 1.05bn, and predicted a comparable rate of increase for earnings during the second half. The result, which has been adjusted to reflect the sale in April of its printing division, has been achieved in spite of a considerable decline in advertising revenue within its newspaper and trade press operations, a trend which is expected to worsen in the course of this year. However, other activities, including magazines and educational publishing, distribution, electronic media and commercial television, continue to generate healthy and growing profits, VNU said. 'Provided economic circumstances do not further deteriorate,' the company said, 'the percentage increase in 1993 net profit and net profit per share will be of the same order of magnitude as during the first half.' Net profit per share rose by 3 per cent to Fl 6.81. Among the group's most vigorously growing activities are electronic publishing in the US where VNU is a leading supplier of on-line consumer demographic information as well as financial analysis of bourse-listed companies.</p>

A person helping him was  killed in the explosion.    In the north, a person was caught in Tripoli and another was  caught in Funaydiq in 'Akkar. Both are suspected of blowing up  a shop in al-Zahriyah, Tripoli. The security agencies are  interrogating the apprehended persons, 30 in all, mostly  Lebanese and Palestinians.

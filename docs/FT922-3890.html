			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Fresh bid to resolve row over Argentine airline SPANISH and Argentine government officials are expected to hold talks this week in an attempt to break the deadlock between Argentina's transport department and Iberia, the majority shareholder in Aerolineas Argentinas, the privatised Argentine carrier. Tension between Iberia and the government began almost immediately after 85 per cent of Aerolineas was sold to an Iberia-led consortium in November 1990. However, the dispute took another turn last week when the Argentine government, which retains a 5 per cent stake in Aerolineas, rejected the company's draft 1991 accounts at the annual meeting. An Argentine government representative and a representative of the employees' stock participation scheme, which holds 10 per cent of the airline, angrily objected to an item reportedly stating the company's liabilities at about Dollars 670m, most of it due to some Dollars 390m in debts run up by the company's new owners. The owners have secured the debt with seven Aerolineas aircraft, even though the government claims this is forbidden under the sale contract. The government sold Aerolineas free of all liabilities, but now finds the company has incurred heavy debts, apparently taken on to pay for the deal. Aerolineas was sold for Dollars 260m and a further Dollars 2.01bn in a debt-for-equity swap. Neither the government, Aerolineas or their auditors Arthur Andersen were available yesterday for comment. The sale of Aerolineas, Argentina's second privatisation, was troubled from the start. A dispute among shareholders forced Iberia and other investors based in Spain to take a majority stake in the airline. A subsequent dispute with the Argentine government over the precise amount due in payment further increased tension.</p>

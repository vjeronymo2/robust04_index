			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Law Society to sue lord chancellor THE Law Society, the solicitor's governing body, is to sue the lord chancellor for the second time in a month over his controversial plans to cut legal aid eligibility. The society claims that Lord Mackay's proposals, due to come into effect on April 12, would potentially affect 12m to 14m people. Last month the society was granted leave to seek a judicial review of Lord Mackay's plans to introduce standard fees for criminal legal aid work in magistrates' courts.</p>

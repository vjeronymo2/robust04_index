			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Investors wary as Romanian 'pyramid' totters DOWN AT the Cluj sports hall, business is not what it was. Just a few months ago, thousands of eager investors queued to deposit their money at the banks of computer terminals inside, hoping for fantastic returns. Now they are counted in scores and the menacing-looking marshals stand outside with nothing to do. The scene by the sports hall is the most visible sign that trouble may be coming to this Transylvanian town - and to Romania as a whole. A 'pyramid' investment scheme in Cluj that has attracted hundreds of millions of dollars of deposits by promising a sevenfold return in three months appears to be wobbling. Since about 3m Romanians - one sixth of the adult population - have invested in the scheme, the result could be disastrous. For four days last week, the money-multiplying scheme, which is known as Caritas and has created thousands of lei millionaires in the ethnically-mixed western province of Transylvania, failed to pay out to investors for the first time in its 18 months of operation. Payments have since resumed, with Caritas's owner, Mr Ioan Stoica, blaming the problem on a computer fault: 'The Caritas money circuit is safe and sound and going strong,' he said last weekend. But investors in Cluj say confidence has been shaken, and fear Caritas will soon run out of cash. 'I hope I will be able to cash my 40m lei (Pounds 26,500) by December, but I fear the scheme will collapse before then,' said one taxi driver. An elderly man said: 'Maybe it will end soon but it's the only chance we have of paying our winter heating and food bills.' He had travelled 200km to sink cash into the scheme this week. Other locals are more inclined to count their blessings. 'God bless Mr Stoica,' said one. He spoke of the colour television, fridge and stereo that his family had bought with the profits they had made from the scheme. The scheme, the largest of many in post-communist Romania, has had a magnetic appeal in a country where real earnings have dropped by a third in the past three years and annual inflation is approaching 300 per cent. Caritas appears to work like a chain letter. New players deposit between Lei20,000 and Lei160,000. Three months later Caritas, while collecting from depositors and taking a 10 per cent commission, pays out eight times the investment. Little is known about Mr Stoica, except that he is a former bookkeeper from the Transylvanian town of Brasov, has an economics degree, and is believed to have worked abroad. He has made millions of dollars from the scheme, paying the equivalent of Dollars 30m in taxes between April and August of this year alone. Recently, he opened a grocery in Cluj and is talking of starting a chain of supermarkets and a bank. As for Cluj itself, Caritas has brought a boom. 'Whatever Stoica's secret, it's worked for us,' says one shopkeeper. Property prices have rocketed fivefold, making a studio apartment at least as costly as in the capital, Bucharest. According to local officials, there has also been a marked increase in crime and a falling-off in the desire to work. One reason for Caritas's success compared with other failed pyramid schemes is the backing of the mayor, Mr Gheorghe Funar, who is also leader of the country's largest nationalist party. He encourages Romanians to follow him in putting money into the scheme, saying it is 'a legal and clean affair'. Most in Cluj are happy not to question that judgment. If the truth turns out to be otherwise, however, the backlash will be fast and furious.</p>

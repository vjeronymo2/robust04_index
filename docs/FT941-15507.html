			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Berisford pays banks Pounds 56m for Magnet Berisford International yesterday announced it was buying Magnet, the kitchen cabinets and joinery manufacturer and distributor, for Pounds 56m from eight banks. The purchase marks Berisford's first step in its planned transformation from shell company to conglomerate. It also promised shareholders a dividend for the current year, the first since 1989. The deal brings together two of the casualties of the corporate excesses of the late 1980s. Berisford, then a property and commodities group, nearly failed under Pounds 1.4bn of debt but has since sold assets, including British Sugar, and now has net cash. Magnet was the subject of a Pounds 629m management buy-out in 1989 but succumbed to recession. The deal is being financed by a one-for-two rights issue at 120p to raise Pounds 58.7m net. Berisford shares were suspended before the announcement at 128p and will be relisted on February 1. Mr Alan Bowkett, chief executive of Berisford, said his aim was to build the company into a 'conglomerate based on real things, not the financial engineering of the 1980s'. Berisford was now a 'clean shell' while Magnet was being bought free from litigation born of its past problems. Berisford would be ready to look at a US acquisition by September 1995. He said Magnet fitted all Berisford's acquisition criteria: operating in a large market, with opportunities for savings and growth. It traded in a fragmented industry, one that both he and Mr Roy Hammond, Berisford's operations director, knew through previous roles at Boulton &amp; Paul. Magnet had net assets of Pounds 137.7m on September 25 1993 - it broke even in the previous six months on sales of Pounds 90.5m. It has Pounds 30m cash and Pounds 60m UK tax losses. Mr Bowkett said the combined group would have net assets of Pounds 220m before provisions, and Pounds 100m tax losses. It would pay only 10 per cent tax for the foreseeable future. Berisford came close to buying C&amp;J Clark, the shoe group, last May for Pounds 184m. After that deal failed, Mr Bowkett called Bankers Trust, the leading shareholder in Magnet, to reopen talks. By October the shareholders had agreed to deal exclusively with Berisford and after lengthy due diligence the purchase was largely agreed before Christmas. Magnet was bought by the eight banks after its parent company, Airedale Holdings, was put into receivership in December 1992. As well as Bankers Trust, the banks are Bank of America, Creditanstalt Bankverein, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, Standard Chartered, Bank of Scotland, Hill Samuel and Continental Bank. These eight were the senior lenders to the mbo. Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 24</p>

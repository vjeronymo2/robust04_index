			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Nuclear reaction WESTERN GOVERNMENTS are not yet taking seriously enough the threat of an accident at one of the 58 nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. The G7 summit in July failed to agree a Dollars 800m multilateral programme to pay for the most urgent safety work. The seven passed the problem on to the 24 OECD countries, whose nuclear experts and civil servants are in Brussels this week trying to patch together a coherent programme from the paltry Dollars 300m worth of bilateral aid announced so far. But the G24 meeting is not at a sufficiently senior level to take the decisive action required. Unfortunately, western leaders see nuclear safety as a technical issue which they can leave to their technical experts. It deserves much higher priority than that. Another Chernobyl-type accident would be an environmental catastrophe and would almost certainly deal a fatal blow to the nuclear industry worldwide. Apart from some EC-funded emergency work at Kozloduy in Bulgaria, little has been done yet to tackle even the most urgent safety problems. Nuclear officials in eastern Europe are understandably exasperated that interminable discussions with western experts have yielded such limited practical assistance. With energy in short supply, they have no option this winter but to continue running every available reactor, whatever its safety level. So the Ukraine will reluctantly restart two units at the crippled Chernobyl plant. The immediate priority is to end the bureaucratic delays that have held up even the very limited funds announced so far. Then western governments should launch a new political initiative to set up a multilateral nuclear aid programme to fill in the large gaps between the bilateral schemes. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank would play a central role in funding it. At the very least, the most dangerous reactors - 15 Chernobyl-type RBMKs and the 10 oldest VVER230s - require new hardware such as back-up generators, computerised control rooms and fire barriers. The Russians - inheritors of a proud but flawed tradition of nuclear engineering - are determined to keep their reactors running into the next century, whether or not they receive western help to make them safe. Another limited nuclear incident, such as the one last March near St Petersburg which aroused a temporary surge of western political concern about Soviet reactor safety, would bring the issue back to the prominence it deserves. A sense of urgency is required if something is to be done before there is another Chernobyl.</p>

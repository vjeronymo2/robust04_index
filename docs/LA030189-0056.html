Renee Laurents said.  </P> <P> Camilletti, a former New York bagel maker, pizza chef and bartender, faces up  to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine when he is sentenced March 14.  </P> <P> The charges stem from an incident last July in which Camilletti had a run-in  with free-lance photographers who were staking out Cher's home. Camilletti was  accused of trying to run photographer Peter Brandt down in a Ferrari and  damaging his camera equipment.  </P></p>

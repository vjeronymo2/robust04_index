			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BETTY WINCKLER DEAD AT 82;  </P> <P> SERVICES HELD FOR MUSEUM ORGANIZER  </P> <P> A memorial service was held Monday in Newport Beach for Betty Winckler, who led  a group of 13 female volunteers in 1961 to form what became the Newport Harbor  Art Museum. Mrs. Winckler died June 15 in Irvine after a long illness. She was  82.  </P> <P> Now an internationally known contemporary art museum, the Newport Harbor  started out as the Fine Arts Patrons Pavilion Gallery on the second floor of  the Balboa Pavilion. Mrs. Winckler served as its president until 1968, when the  gallery changed its name and hired a professional staff. She remained on the  board of trustees until 1981, subsequently becoming a trustee emeritus.  </P> <P> Born in 1906 in Long Beach, she attended Pomona College and UC Berkeley. After  working in pottery in the 1940s, she studied painting with Rex Brandt and Phil  Dike. Her late husband, Richard, owned Dick's Dock, a Newport Beach boatyard.  </P> <P> In "The Audacious Years," the museum's catalogue of its first decade, Mrs.  Winckler wrote: "In 1961 the movement (in Orange County) was under way for a  cultural center. There were already well-organized groups supporting music,  drama and dance, but an interest in the fine arts was not yet articulated.  </P> <P> "Some of us had been organizing and hanging shows in the (Newport Beach) City  Hall and were aware of the need for a sustained program of museum-caliber  exhibitions. . . . If we were to present exhibitions of museum quality, we  realized that we had to obtain expert advice from professional museum people. .  . . We did not want to be amateurs!"  </P> <P> Advised by prominent art professionals, the Fine Arts Patrons -- as Mrs.  Winckler's group was known -- originated such noteworthy exhibits as a  retrospective of American painter Morris Graves (1963), "California Hard-Edge  Painting" (1964) and work by Los Angeles painters Joe Goode and Ed Ruscha  (1968).  </P> <P> Mrs. Winckler is survived by two sisters, Marjorie Conley of Long Beach and  Frances Graham of Westminster, and two sons, Richard T. Winckler of Los Gatos  and David C. Winckler of Sacramento.  </P> <P> The family asks that donations be made to the museum's Betty Winckler Memorial  Fund, which will support educational programs in the new building the museum  will occupy in 1992 at MacArthur Boulevard and Coast Highway.  </P></p>

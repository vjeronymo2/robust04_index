			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: STYLISH 'AVENGERS' RETURNS ON A&amp;E;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE CABLE NETWORK TODAY BEGINS AIRING ALL 134 EPISODES OF THE '60S  CULT CLASSIC, A DRYLY WITTY BRITISH SERIES ABOUT A PAIR OF SOPHISTICATED CRIME  FIGHTERS.  </P> <P> "The Avengers," a British series that ran on ABC from 1966 to 1969, resurfaces  in all its suave and satirical grandeur today on cable's Arts &amp;  Entertainment network.  </P> <P> Not included, happily, is "The New Avengers," an inferior sequel from Britain  that CBS briefly tried as late-night programming in 1978.  </P> <P> Instead, A &amp; E will air all 134 of the episodes that paired Patrick Macnee  first with Honor Blackman, then with Diana Rigg and finally with Linda Thorson.  The black-and-white episodes -- encompassing all of Blackman's work and a  portion of Rigg's -- did not air on ABC, although the latter did have a run in  syndication.  </P> <P> The A &amp; E package is out of sequence, opening with Macnee-Rigg episodes,  followed by Macnee-Thorson and then Macnee-Blackman.  </P> <P> In a curious scheduling move that is bound to severely limit the show's  audience, A &amp; E is airing "The Avengers" on the West Coast at 3 p.m.  weekdays, with repeats the next day at 8 a.m. In addition, all 134 episodes  will be played in weekly installments on Saturdays at 3 p.m., beginning this  week.  </P> <P> "The Avengers" airs three hours later in the East. Not until 1992 will A &amp;  E have a second satellite transponder that will allow it to have separate feeds  for different time zones.  </P> <P> So until then . . . set those VCRs. This stylishly urbane, creatively written  series about two British undercover agents is treat time.  </P> <P> Actually, "The Avengers" has several distinct personalities, with Macnee being  the tie that binds them as the tough but charming John Steed, who lives among  antiques, drives vintage cars and wears a bowler and Edwardian-style clothes  that give him the look of a man astride two centuries.  </P> <P> The 1962-63 episodes with Blackman as Steed's partner -- the cool,  judo-efficient anthropologist Catherine Gale -- were shot on videotape, and  have an interesting, live-TV look that seems almost rudimentary compared with  American TV production from the same period. Moreover, many of these episodes  are pure adventure yarns with dated Cold War themes.  </P> <P> Flash forward now to the Thorson stint in 1969, when "The Avengers" was  definitely in decline and Thorson appeared totally lost and almost spacey as  Steed's new partner, Tara King.  </P> <P> Ah . . . but separating Blackman and Thorson was tall, lithe Diana Rigg (these  days the host of "Mystery" on PBS) as that wonderfully wry, very, very mod  widow Emma Peel. (Her long-lost husband was ultimately discovered only when  Rigg decided to leave the show and a device was needed to explain her absence.)  </P> <P> As Steed-Peel, Macnee-Rigg was arguably the best, freshest, most-appealing  evil-fighting pair ever to fill the small screen, their playfulness approaching  the blithely carefree and cheeky banter of William Powell and Myrna Loy as  Dashiell Hammett's Nick and Nora Charles.  </P> <P> Many have tried, but probably only Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd in  "Moonlighting" came as close to the Charleses as Macnee-Rigg did. Unlike the  Charleses and David and Maddy in "Moonlighting," however, Steed and Emma were  not romantically inclined, despite sharing infinite sly glances. No kisses. Not  even a pass. So platonic were these two, in fact, that Steed never once  addressed his partner as Emma, only as Mrs. Peel (just as he addressed  Blackman's character only as Mrs. Gale).  </P> <P> After Rigg joined Macnee, the series tilted toward quasi-science-fiction  themes, and many of the black-and-white episodes with Rigg have a strikingly  dark and mysterious hue.  </P> <P> Typical is one called "Two Many Christmas Trees." It's as good an hour of TV as  can be found anywhere, using frightening images from quirky angles to ominously  shroud a story about Steed being tormented by nightmares that merge with  reality. It seems that a telepathic spy ring is at work. That this is weekly  television is boggling, for it's brilliant.  </P> <P> The color episodes beginning today are more whimsical, with their comically  eccentric characters broadly played to the hilt by the usual store of fine  British character actors. Each episode begins with Steed showing up out of the  blue and handing his partner a small card saying: "Mrs. Peel, we're needed."  </P> <P> Their presence is needed in today's premiere to investigate the strange deaths  of members of the planet-watching British Venusian Society, whose bodies have  been bleached white by a speeding ball of light that no one can explain.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, grown men are mysteriously reduced to quivering, whimpering,  babbling infants, and Steed and Mrs. Peel want to know why. On Wednesday, a  fellow secret agent is found floating in the Thames with an ancient dagger in  his back and a 16th-Century bullet in his chest. It seems that Steed and Mrs.  Peel will have to do some time traveling.  </P> <P> What a bitingly black sense of humor this series exhibits in parodying British  convention and depicting an upper-class English realm that exists today  probably only in the fantasies of tourists. Meanwhile, the delightful Steed and  Mrs. Peel tackle life and each assignment with supreme bemusement while never  taking themselves very seriously.  </P> <P> If only more of American TV were like them -- still fun and contemporary after  all these years.  </P> <P> "The Avengers," you're needed.  </P></p>

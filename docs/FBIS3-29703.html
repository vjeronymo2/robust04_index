			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] A prominent Democrat yesterday criticised  Minister Wichit Sukmak for failing to liaise effectively with  military top brass to explain the Government's policy. The  party's secretary-general, Sanan Khachonprasat, said: "I don't  know how the Defense Minister has explained this policy to the  commanders for them not to have understood it and to have come  out with the statements that they have."    The Industry Minister was speaking in Chiang Rai, where he  was attending a gathering of office managers and executive  committee members of the party's Northern branch to brief them  on the political situation. Maj. Gen. [Major General] Sanan said  it was the duty of the Defense Minister to go back again and try  to explain the Government's requirement to the commanders.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, reaffirming the Government's  commitment to its arms-through-barter policy, said he was  confident the Defense Minister would be able to talk armed  forces commanders into accepting it. Mr. Chuan said the Defense  Minister had been asked to try once again to explain the  Government's policy to the top brass. "I believe the Defense  Minister can clear up any misunderstanding (the commanders) may  have," he said. [passage omitted]    Maj. Gen. Sanan said the Government had never asked the  armed  forces to renegotiate the deal because the armed forces could  not conduct the talks by themselves. "It is not Government  policy to allow the Armed Forces to engage in negotiations. We  only want talks so that Italy can be convinced to buy more Thai  goods," he said. He said the arms market was at present in the  hands of buyers because of a preponderance of manufacturers.    Waiting to allow responsible agencies to negotiate with the  Italian Government would not upset the armed forces procurement  process, and the Government was prepared to absorb any extra  cost that might be caused by the delay.    He denied that the Government was putting pressure on the  armed forces by tightening the procurement process. "We have to  look at the whole picture," he said. "Our farm products are  suffering. Everyone must help, particularly the armed forces.  Other government agencies are no exception."    Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak denied that  the  Government was interfering with the Armed Forces' procurement  process. "We want some delay only in order to press Italy to  give Thailand more favorable terms on the deal," Mr Suphachai  said. "We are about to spend thousands of millions of baht. We  should have some more in return for what we're going to spend."  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / 3i reports surge in investment VENTURE capital group 3i said yesterday that it made total new investments of more than Pounds 275m in the six months to March, an increase of 90 per cent on the same period a year before and well above its pre-recession level of investment. Mr Ewen Macpherson, chief executive, said the level of investment had been boosted partly by 'the encouraging number of management buy-outs' funded with investment capital.</p>

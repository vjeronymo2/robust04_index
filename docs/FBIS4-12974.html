			<p>BFN     [Text] Marrakesh, Morocco, April 15 (AFP)--Here is the full  text of the Marrakesh Declaration that is to be adopted by the  ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT) at around 1100 GMT Friday [15 April]:    Ministers salute the historic achievement represented by the  conclusion of the (Uruguay) Round, which they believe will  strengthen the world economy and lead to more trade, investment,  employment and income growth throughout the world. In  particular, they welcome:    -- the stronger and clearer legal framework they adopted for  the conduct of international trade, including a more effective  and reliable dispute settlement mechanism.    -- the global reduction by 40 percent of tariffs and wider  market-opening agreements on goods, and the increased  predictability and security represented by a major expansion in  the scope of tariff commitments, and    -- the establishment of a multilateral framework of  disciplines for trade in services and for the protection of  trade-related intellectual property rights, as well as the  reinforced multilateral trade provisions in agriculture and in  textiles and clothing.    Ministers affirm that the establishment of the World Trade  Organization (WTO) ushers in a new era of global economic  cooperation, reflecting the widespread desire to operate in a  fairer and more open multilateral trading system for the benefit  and welfare of their peoples.    Ministers express their determination to resist  protectionist  pressures of all kinds. They believe that the trade  liberalization and strengthened rules achieved in the Uruguay  Round will lead to a progressively more open world trading  environment.    Ministers undertake, with immediate effect, and until the  entry into force of the WTO, not to take any trade measures that  would undermine or adversely affect the results of the Uruguay  Round negotiations or their implementation.    Ministers confirm their resolution to strive for greater  coherence of policies in the fields of trade, money and finance,  including cooperation between the WTO, the International  Monetary Fund and the World Bank for that purpose.    Ministers welcome the fact that participation in the Uruguay  Round was considerably wider than in any previous multilateral  trade negotiation and, in particular, that developing countries  played a notably active role in it.    This has marked a historic step towards a more balanced and  integrated global trade partnership.    Ministers note that during the period these negotiations  were  underway, significant measures of economic reform and autonomous  trade liberalization were implemented in many developing  countries and formerly centrally planned economies.    Ministers recall that the results of the negotiations embody  provisions conferring differential and more favourable treatment  for developing economies, including special attention to the  particular situation of least-developed countries.    Ministers recognize the importance of the implementation of  these provisions for the least-developed countries and declare  their intention to continue to assist and facilitate the  expansion of their trade and investment opportunities.    They agree to keep under regular review by the Ministerial  Conference and the appropriate organs of the WTO the impact of  the results of the Round on the least-developed countries as  well as on the net food-importing developing countries, with a  view to fostering positive measures to enable them to achieve  their development objectives.    Ministers recognize the need for strengthening the  capability  of the GATT and the WTO to provide increased technical  assistance in their areas of competence, and in particular to  substantially expand its provision to the least-developed  countries.    Ministers declare that their signature of the "Final Act  Embodying the Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade  Negotiations" and their adoption of associated Ministerial  Decisions initiates the transition from the GATT to the WTO.    They have in particular established a Preparatory Committee  to lay the ground for the entry into force of the WTO Agreement  and commit themselves to see to complete all steps necessary to  ratify the WTO Agreement so that it can enter into force by  January 1, 1995, or as early as possible thereafter.    Ministers have furthermore adopted a Decision on Trade and  Environment.    Ministers express their sincere gratitude to H.M. King  Hassan  II for his personal contribution to the success of this  Ministerial Meeting and to his government and the people of  Morocco for their warm hospitality and the excellent  organization they have provided.    The fact that this final Ministerial Meeting of the Uruguay  Round has been held at Marrakesh is an additional manifestation  of Morocco's commitment to an open world trading system and to  its fullest integration into the global economy.    With the adoption and signature of the Final Act and the  opening for acceptance of the WTO Agreement, Ministers declare  the work of the Trade Negotiations Committee to be complete and  the Uruguay Round formally concluded.</p>

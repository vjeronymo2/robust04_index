			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad -- For every Afghan refugee leaving  Pakistan two are entering the country. Latest UNHCR (United  Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) statistics show that an  estimated 11,710 Afghans entered Pakistan between April 1 to  April 16, while a total of 4,992 Afghans repatriated.    Of the 11,710 crossing over to Pakistan, only 721 persons  entered with passports.    UNHCR says its border monitors observed 455 Afghan families  (comprising 2,836 persons), as well as 3,720 single persons,  arriving via Torkham on humanitarian grounds in first half of  the month.    According to UNHCR the total number of Afghans who entered  Pakistan in March was 21,178.    Officially entry to Pakistan for Afghans is still restricted  to those with valid documents, or to those allowed to cross over  on humanitarian grounds.</p>

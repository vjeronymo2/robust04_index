			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, minister of </F> planning and development, by Ahmad Birru in Sanaa; date not  given; from the "Today's Guest" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Yemen's  planning minister: Lakhdar Ibrahimi has been on a tour of  regional capitals and held talks with the constitutional  authorities in Sanaa and the Socialist Party leaders, who  declared secession, in al-Mukalla. Has this led to any change  in Sanaa's conditions for the dialogue and what are the  practical results of this tour so far?    [Al-Iryani] The conditions set by Sanaa to conduct a  political dialogue to end the crisis have not changed. Sanaa  insists that such a dialogue must be held under the canopy of  constitutional legitimacy and the Republic of Yemen's  Constitution, and based on recognizing the outcome of the 27  April [1993] elections, the unity of the Armed Forces, and  dismissing from the dialogue those against whom the public  prosecutor has issued arrest warrants.    [Birru] The Arab League secretary general has announced that  the Arab League's failure will lead to requesting the UN  Security Council to take deterrent measures against the party  that does not abide by the cease-fire.    [Al-Iryani] That statement, which was made by an Arab League  assistant secretary general and not the secretary general, came  as a shock to us in Sanaa. The Arab League is playing a role  that it is not accustomed to and is using language that we have  never heard before. But the statements were made by an  assistant secretary general. His words may have failed to  express what the Arab League means exactly. But the principle  in itself was strange. The Arab League has never addressed any  Arab issue through threats to seek help from the world community.    [Birru] What is the outcome of Sanaa's moves on the  international level to explain the Yemeni Government's views and  the tour by 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-Ghani in the capitals of the  super powers. Has that tour resulted in bringing about any  change in the positions of these states?    [Al-Iryani] Undoubtedly, the tour by Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al-Ghani, Presidential Council member, resulted first in  the drafting of the UN Security Council resolution. The initial  draft that was proposed by Prince Bandar [Bin-Sultan, Saudi  ambassador in Washington] referred to Yemen as the Arab Republic  of Yemen, and not the Republic of Yemen. It also included  several sentences which implied hidden intentions. The activity  of Brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani in this regard was  positive. He also met with officials in the United States,  France, and China. The main objective of that tour was to  stress Yemen's commitment to UN Security Council Resolution 924  and its categorical rejection of any new intervention in Yemeni  domestic affairs.    [Birru] The telephone call between President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al Nuhayyan, the United Arab  Emirates President: Was that the result of efforts by Lakhdar  Ibrahimi, and what was discussed in that phone call?    [Al-Iryani] The efforts of Lakhdar Ibrahimi are clear and  specified by the UN Security Council resolution. But contacts  between the brother president and His Highness Shaykh Zayid  have, in fact, never ceased. These contacts have continued over  these past weeks after the military situation was ignited by the  secessionists. This was not the first contact between the  president and Shaykh Zayid.    [Birru] What was the subject of the phone call?    [Al-Iryani] The subject was the topic of the hour; that is,  establishing the cease-fire, annulling the secession, ending the  conflict with the secessionists through peaceful means, and  expressing the desire that the United Arab Emirates play a role  in this regard.    [Birru] The multi-faceted dialogue: What happened to it,  and what are the topics under discussion now?    [Al-Iryani] In fact the dialogue is, practically, governed  by a UN resolution now. Lakhdar Ibrahimi stresses that his  report will mention the fact that Paragraph 4 of Resolution 924  can be implemented. Let us say that the warring parties now  accept the dialogue and we have stressed to Brother Lakhdar  Ibrahimi that we feel this dialogue should be held within the  framework of the three parties of the government coalition. The  Socialist Party is the direct party in this crisis, the party  that declare secession, and the party that led the rebellion.  We are prepared to hold dialogue with the Socialist Party  leadership according to the conditions I mentioned before.    [Birru] What about the joint committee, the presence of  observers, and Sanaa's approval of the presence of non-Yemeni  observers?    [Al-Iryani] The joint military committee was established  during the military tensions and before the military situation  exploded. It had representatives from Oman and Jordan, as well  as the U.S. and French military attaches. What Sanaa proposed  is to revive this committee to supervise the cease-fire and seek  help from the military commanders from both sides. We  understood from brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi that there is a desire  to include other states in this committee. We proposed that  Syria and Morocco should be included. This proposal was  conveyed by Brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi to the secessionists in  Jeddah and we are still expecting an answer.    [Birru] What is the status of the talks with the unionists  in the Socialist Party; with whom and where are these talks  being conducted?    [Al-Iryani] Such efforts were exerted before UN Security  Council Resolution 924 was issued. Now that the resolution has  been issued, I do not think there are any attempts to open new  channels for dialogue. It is not useful to open several  channels. Since there is a channel recommended by the UN  Security Council, this should be the only channel.    [Birru] Will you agree to let the Socialist Party resume the  same role it played and hold the same share of power it held  before secession?    [Al-Iryani] We have stressed to Brother Lakhdar Ibrahimi and  others, as well as to several states, that we adhere to the  outcome of the 27 April elections. This means that the  privileges, given to the Socialist Party in order to avoid the  situation we are in now, cannot be given to it again. As for  the size of its share in power in light of the outcome of these  elections, we will stick to that.    [Birru] What are the most significant reforms that will be  introduced after the end of the war, whether on the level of the  Army and the government institutions or the administrative  powers, such as centralism and other issues?    [Al-Iryani] The issue of the decentralized self rule, or the  so-called local government, was a principal point during the  dialogue. We thought that an agreement over this point would  also help us avoid the situation we are in today. However, this  issue will be more pressing than before the military battles.  This means that the financial and administrative  decentralization and the local government will become, in my  opinion, more important and urgent than they were before these  military battles.    [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, how do you see the  future: the future of the war, the future of unity, the future  of relations between Yemen and the Gulf states, and the future  of Yemen in general?    [Al-Iryani] First, we beseech God that the war will have no  future, and that those who seek war will fail. As regards the  relations between Yemen and its neighbors, I can stress that the  efforts exerted before this war broke out to improve the  relations between Yemeni and its neighbors were unprecedented in  more than 60 years. But regrettably, these efforts clashed with  the military explosion. I can stress that these efforts that  were exerted still survive and the hands will continue to be  extended. If we exerted unprecedented efforts in the history of  relations with the neighbors, then these efforts should continue  after this situation is over. As for the future of Yemen, I  think that you, as a journalist who can tour all parts of the  country, will not find any exaggerations in my statement when I  say that the future of the united Yemen is a historic  inevitability and that those who are seeking to challenge  history have to reconsider their position    [Birru] Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, thank you.    [Al-Iryani] Thank you.</p>

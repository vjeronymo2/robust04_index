			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Letter: Too early to see effect of Cadbury proposals Sir, A propos your article on the research published in the Corporate Register which covers the 'latest innovations of corporate governance', ('Governance changes 'not productive' ', April 22), we at the Institute of Leadership believe it is far too early to see results, commercial or otherwise, that could be the result of the recommendations of the Cadbury committee. Cadbury's report referred to 'the financial aspects of corporate governance', not competitiveness and profitability. The recommended enhancement of the role of non-executive directors was to do with their assistance in ensuring the probity of public companies, and nothing more. True, there has been debate, mainly concerning the large and listed companies, about the usefulness of proactive non-executive directors with regard to their contribution to strategic direction and the high performance of the company on whose board they sit. Up to now, however, it has been unfocused and barely touched the smaller and unlisted companies. We have just launched a UK-wide research programme in conjunction with the University of Paisley. Its purpose is to investigate the growing ambiguity of the position of non-executive directors and to answer such questions as: can they act equally as effective gamekeepers (probity) and poachers (profitability)? Can they be truly independent? How 'unitary' is the board? What selection, training and induction processes can be designed to help non-executives to balance these divergent duties? We would defer judgment on any financial or other indicators to measure the effectiveness of non-executive directors to some time in the future. Both the Cadbury committee's report and the Corporate Register's article only deal with listed companies. We believe that research must penetrate the smaller and medium enterprises (SME) as well, where the need for non-executive directors to assist in transforming their companies is even more urgent than in big companies. The SMEs have been in a much worse state during the recession than the large companies, and it is almost a truism to say that many SMEs have failed precisely for lack of direction from the board.

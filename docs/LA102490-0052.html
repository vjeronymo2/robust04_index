			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SLAPS GAG ORDER ON TRIAL OF 7 DEPUTIES  </P> <P> The federal judge in the money-skimming trial of seven Los Angeles County  sheriff's narcotics officers Tuesday clamped a gag order on participants after  a defense attorney persisted in linking the case to allegations that drug money  was used to fund Central Intelligence Agency operations.  </P> <P> Harland Braun, who represents Deputy Daniel M. Garner, had told reporters --  without providing evidence -- that the U.S. government was laundering drug  money for South American cartels and siphoning some of the cash for its own  clandestine operations abroad.  </P> <P> In contesting an attempt by prosecutors to restrain himself and others from  talking to the media, Braun has claimed in court papers that in 1986 his client  searched the Southern California home of a CIA agent who had ties to a major  drug- and money-laundering ring.  </P> <P> According to Braun, the unnamed suspect acknowledged that he was a CIA agent  and the narcotics officers discovered "numerous documents indicating that drug  money was being used to purchase military equipment for Central America." In  particular, he said, deputies found links to the funding of Contra rebels  fighting the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Shortly after deputies seized the documents and booked the material as  evidence, however, federal agents "swooped down" on the Sheriff's Department  headquarters and removed the recovered property, as well as other records of  the search and seizure, Braun said.  </P> <P> One officer who was at the search scene with Garner, but asked not to be  identified, told The Times that the suspect asked the deputies if he could make  a phone call to his CIA contact in Virginia. He purportedly was allowed to make  the call.  </P> <P> "It was strange, because here we are chasing this drug dealer and we end up  with this guy," said the officer, who added that the man was not arrested  because no drugs were found at his home.  </P> <P> Peter Earnest, a CIA spokesman in Washington, said the agency's policy was not  to comment on anything under litigation. However, without commenting  specifically on the allegations contained in Braun's affidavit, Earnest added:  "The CIA has not and has never been directly involved in laundering drug  money."  </P> <P> Undersheriff Robert Edmonds called the assertions "preposterous" and said  Tuesday he was unaware of either the 1986 case or Braun's version of events.  </P> <P> "I've got to tell you that I would be startled if federal agents swooped down  on one of our stations and I wasn't aware of it," Edmonds said. "I would be  rather astounded if this has any credibility in fact."  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie, who is presiding over the trial of Garner  and six other narcotics officers, chastised Braun for raising the matter in  opposing the gag order.  </P> <P> In seeking the restraining order, federal prosecutors claimed defense attorneys  were making prejudicial comments about the case in which the narcotics officers  are accused of skimming $1.4 million in drug money, evading taxes and various  other charges.  </P> <P> Prosecutors singled out Braun's comments about the alleged CIA connection with  laundered drug money and Nicaraguan Contra rebels as irrelevant to the case and  a subject that "will serve only to confuse the jury and waste time."  </P> <P> Rafeedie also suggested that the allegation was irrelevant and said he had been  uncertain whether to grant the gag order until he read Braun's legal brief,  which he described as a ruse to get the CIA story before the media.  </P> <P> "Even if everything you say in the document is true, it has nothing to do with  whether your client has filed a false income tax return or has (unexplained)  expenditures," Rafeedie said.  </P> <P> In his court document, Braun maintained that the CIA agent questioned by  deputies had ties to "the Blandon family which was importing narcotics from  Central America to the United States." He did not identify the family further.  </P> <P> In his court filing, Braun said that he had asked for -- and never received --  a letter from federal officials stating explicitly that no drug money was used  by the U.S. government or any government agency to purchase weapons for the  Contras or for weapons to be traded for hostages in Iran.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Thomas A. Hagemann, one of the prosecutors in the  deputies' trial, would not comment directly on the allegations. But in his own  court papers, Hagemann said prosecutors would seek to exclude court testimony  about "any alleged CIA plot."  </P> <P> "Such matters are entirely extraneous to this case and would be nothing more  than a 'smoke screen' to divert the jury's attention from the issues which are  properly before it," he wrote.  </P> <P> Garner and some of the other deputies on trial have said that, as part of their  job, they sometimes worked with federal agencies on money-laundering cases that  would actually send drug money back to the cartels as part of the undercover  operation.  </P> <P> After receiving tips from informants that large sums of money needed to be  laundered, federal agents would alert local undercover operatives such as  sheriff's narcotics deputies who would pose as money launderers and meet the  drug trafficker's representative, they said. After turning the money over to  federal officials -- who would actually launder it -- other deputies would  follow the trafficker in hopes of uncovering more of his drug operation.  </P> <P> Testifying Tuesday, Robert R. Sobel, a former sheriff's sergeant and the  prosecution's chief witness, said his deputies were told by federal agents  whether to follow a money courier, seize the cash or arrange for the money to  be laundered by federal agencies.  </P> <P> "And to keep up the credibility of the informant, they would launder money back  to the cartel?" Braun asked.  </P> <P> "That's right," Sobel replied.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson contributed to this story  </P></p>

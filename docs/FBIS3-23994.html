Experts estimate their total reserves at several dozen  tonnes. Thus, the company already owns 7 deposits in the region,  regarded as one of the most promising in gold. The prospected  reserves of 4 deposits, obtained earlier, amount to 300 tonnes,  and the Tokur ore deposit amounts to over 250 tonnes.    In order to develop these deposits the company, set up in  1992 as a closed joint-stock company, started to issue its  stocks, worth 7.7 billion rubles, in September 1993. Today the  stocks of "Tokur-Zoloto" are sold at a price approximately five  times higher than their nominal value of 1,000 rubles. However,  even under such conditions there will hardly be enough capital  generated from the conversion into a joint-stock company, for  fulll-scale development of a 250-260 tonne deposit -- half as  much is required for this.    In this case any company has two opportunities: either to  find a major investor, most likely foreign, who will agree to  participate in the project. Or engage in other operations which  would enable it to obtain considerable financial resources in a  short period of time.    "Tokur-Zoloto" is pursuing both alternatives. On the one  hand, talks are being conducted with Western mining companies on  their participation in mining Tokur gold; on the other,  "Tokur-Zoloto" can mine gold from its rather big tracer  deposits. The tracer deposits call for less expenses (compared  with ore deposits) and pay for themselves more quickly, the more  so as the company disposes of unnecessary equipment in the Amur  region. Last year "Tokur-Zoloto" mined about 500 kg of metal,  which is not much for such a company, but in 1994 it expects to  increase gold production, bringing it up to several tonnes.    It is also quite possible to further increase the authorized  capital and, consequently, new emission of stocks.    In trying to make its securities more attractive,  "Tokur-Zoloto" is preparing to hold a lottery in April-May 1994  among its share-holders, at which gold nuggets will be drawn.  This will be the second lottery; the results of the first were  revealed in January. Three winners -- a student of the Moscow  Institute of Physical Engineering, the Moscow branch of  "Metkombank," and the head of a construction firm from Samara --  won nuggets weighing 201, 147 and 99 grams respectively The  presentation took place in late January at the Russian Army  Theatre during the premiere of Peter Stein's "Orestea," which  "Tokur-Zoloto" assisted in preparing.    It must be pointed out that this was the first ever transfer  of gold nuggets to citizens in Russia.    The mounting confidence in the company may also be  facilitated by the policy of "Tokur-Zoloto" on the domestic gold  market, now taking shape.    Since the time it was founded, the company has been linked  with a number of Russian banks, having substantial shares of the  authorized capital in two of them and, in addition, cooperating  with several leading banks which may count on being granted the  right of conducting operations in gold.    Such a right will also spread to security operations with  metal (at present the government is preparing a resolution on  this issue) which will enable "Tokur-Zoloto" to draw additional  means on the security of gold at its disposal.</p>

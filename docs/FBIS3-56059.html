A consultative meeting  between Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Bill Clinton  took place at Borispol airport.    They discussed a wide range of issues connected with the  present state and prospects for the development of the  Ukrainian-American relations. In parallel, Ukrainian-American  talks were held in which Acting Prime Minister Yefim  Zvyagilskiy, Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and other  officials took part on the Ukrainian side.    At night, when the talks ended, the U.S. president flew to  Moscow.    Earlier the presidents held a press conference at the  airport. Answering questions from journalists Bill Clinton said,  inter alia, that Ukraine's decision to become a nuclear-free  state opens for it broad possibilities of getting economic aid  from different international organizations. The fact that  Ukraine understands the "Partnership for Peace" formula provides  it with a possibility of cooperation with U.S. and NATO armed  forces, something which will promote Ukraine's security, too.    During the meeting with journalists, the heads of two states  told them about various aspects of the talks that had taken  place. Kravchuk thanked Bill Clinton for his active assistance  in the cause of developing cooperation between the two states.    After the press conference Kravchuk announced that he was  prepared to give a television interview to national television  and CNN.</p>

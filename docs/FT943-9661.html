			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Regional BA cabin crews balloted Regional British Airways cabin crews were yesterday balloted over strike action in a pay dispute threatening local services. Flights from Manchester and Birmingham could be grounded next month if more than 600 crew members at the two airports vote for action, the TGWU general union said. The cabin crews claim they are treated unfairly compared with colleagues at Heathrow and that a loss of holiday supplements means that pay is halved when they are on leave.</p>

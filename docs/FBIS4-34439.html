			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] PAN [National Action Party] Mexican presidential  candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos commented briefly on  Manuel Camacho Solis' resignation from the post of commissioner  for peace and reconciliation in Chiapas. Fernandez de Cevallos  characterized the decision as very respectable, adding that the  text of the resignation is serious and dignified.    Meanwhile, the Party of the Democratic Revolution in the  Federal District said the resignation proves that there is a  crisis within the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party].    Deputy Rene Bejarano said Camacho's resignation proves that  he is in disagreement with those who want to reduce democratic  demands to the simplest expression. He warned that Camacho  Solis' resignation increases the likelihood of renewed  hostilities in Chiapas at any time.</p>

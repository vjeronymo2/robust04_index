This was  announced by Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak on Wednesday [5  January]. Thus, Austria is still right at the top of the list  of European states -- "quite in contrast to the assumptions of  the Greens and of other groups, which advocate unrestricted  immigration to Austria," the minister said.    A total of 10,879 asylum requests have been made since June  1992, of which 2,348 have not yet been decided, 528 have been  retracted, 6,505 have been decided negatively, and 1,497 have  been decided positively, Loeschnak said. In 1993, 4,743  applications for asylum were made. The main countries of origin  of the asylum-seekers were Bosnia-Herzegovina (1,259), Iraq  (541), the FRY (372), and Turkey (328). In 1993, the majority  of the still open asylum procedures were dealt with; a total of  15,885 requests were decided, Loeschnak stressed. Of the asylum  procedures that were decided positively in 1993, 543 affected  persons from Bosnia-Herzegovina; thus, the recognition rate is  42 percent.    At the end of 1993, 40,184 persons were included in the  support campaign for people driven out of Bosnia-Herzegovina by  the war; 13,527 were housed in large accommodations. The  average influx into the support campaign was about 1,000 persons  per month last year. From January to November 1993, 8,290  persons were deported by the immigration police and 4,956  persons were sent back after crossing the border illegally,  Loeschnak said. [passage omitted]</p>

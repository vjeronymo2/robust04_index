			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / UK Gilts: Oversupply fears as tap stock sits IF ONE matter worried the gilts market last week, it was the fear of oversupply. The Bank of England's Pounds 800m new tap stock was undersubscribed on Wednesday and, as if that was not enough, the market faces the prospect of an auction in just over a week. The gilts market has been directionless in recent days: Friday's news that the UK Retail Prices Index rose at an annual rate of 8.2 per cent in March, down from 8.9 per cent in February, was welcomed, but the half-point cut in the base rate had already been discounted. On Friday, gilts prices closed lower, ending half a point down on the day. The latest tranche of Treasury 9 per cent stock, 2008, offered on Wednesday, had a minimum price of 94 1/2 , but the existing stock was trading at about half a point below that. As one trader put it, only a fool would buy from the Bank of England when they could buy the same stock for less in the market. One of the largest market makers said it did no business in the tap stock. The Bank, however, pointed out that the last time a tender was thought too highly priced - which was in January when it offered Pounds 500m of 10 per cent conversion stock 1996 - the gilts market moved up and the whole tranche was taken up within two days at more than the minimum tender price. So the latest tap stock will sit awaiting buyers until either the market moves up and the price of the existing 9 per cent stock 2008 passes the 94 1/2 minimum tender price, or the Bank cuts the price. Many of those in the market have been asking themselves why the Bank set the price at 94 1/2 - and most have concluded that it may have misjudged the market trend. Furthermore, many are curious as to why the Bank chose to tap the longer end of the market. The Bank itself says there is strong demand for long-dated gilts, particularly from overseas investors. It is true that foreigners have been attracted to the gilts market in recent weeks, lured by yields at the short end of the market and the strength of sterling. Yet market makers point out that most foreign investors - except US investors who, like UK investors, are used to maturities of over a decade - feel more comfortable with medium-dated government bonds, that is bonds of a similar maturity to those in their domestic markets. Consequently, there has been much speculation on the subject. Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburg, says that issuing a 9 per cent gilt at the long end of the market makes the government's funding look rather expensive, especially if the government is forecasting a fall in headline inflation to 4 per cent by the end of the year. Assuming the government believes its own forecasts, it must be under considerable funding pressure and therefore does not have the luxury of simply concentrating on the short end of the market. With some economists forecasting that the government will have to borrow up to Pounds 12bn this year, it may be that gilts issues will have to take place across a range of maturities, even if the bias is towards the short and medium maturities. Another suggestion is that the Bank of England knows it has a lot of funding to do over the next few months and wants to discourage corporate borrowing at the long end of the market - hence its decision to issue at that end of the market early on. There is already a fairly good supply of corporate bonds at the long end of the market and many more companies may want to borrow there if base rates continue to fall. Tomorrow, the Bank will announce details of the gilt auction scheduled for April 24. So far, all that is known is that between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn of stock will be issued, and that the maturity will be of up to seven years. Mr Shepperd points out that yields at the short end of the market may have to increase if the market is to absorb such a large amount of stock.</p>

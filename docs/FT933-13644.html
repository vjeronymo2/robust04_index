			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Gardening: Blossom with the scents of romance - Robin Lane Fox finds philadelphus makes a splendid substitute for reluctant roses ALREADY this season, roses have excelled themselves and even non-gardeners have noticed them. Roses do not like my stony soil and I have been watching another great season instead, not on struggling Kathleen, Harrop or mottled Louise Odier but from sweet clouds of flower on shrubs which illumine an entire evening. I mean the orange blossoms of British gardens, still known as syringea among older gardeners but as philadelphus to the horticulturally correct. To me, they are orange blossom because the name does them justice. They are powerfully romantic, stirring the senses of sight and smell. The scent of a full-flowering philadelphus lifts me away to contradictory times and places: to late June evenings in London when the cocktails turn into a party; or early April in those stolen weeks of early blossom when true orange trees are flowering in the southern Mediterranean. You cannot be in two places at once, except in the imagination, but you can pay a tribute to the philadelphus during this weekend as the main season ends. If you want to tidy up the bush, cut back the wood which has flowered but leave the younger, emerging shoots alone. Orange blossom flowers next year on this year's young growth. The ignorant way to treat them is to go out into the garden where an old philadelphus Virginal is beginning to block the path, and set about it in the evening when the fancy takes you. Cut it only within the next two weeks and distinguish between the older, flowered wood and the unflowered, which must be left alone. There is a myth that philadelphuses are much the same and last for only one glorious fortnight. True, they are all white; but within this whiteness, they are not all sweet, and their shapes and markings vary as widely as their size and season. By now, I think I have tried most of them, although 40 varieties are listed in Britain, increasing yearly as other good ones emerge from America. Nobody, it seems, yet sells the earliest pair, with each of which I once co-habited in Germany. Shcrenkii begins to flower late in May, followed closely by the lovelier Magdalenae, which is a wild Chinese variety with grey leaves. Neither is especially scented, if I remember correctly, but could they not go on general UK release? Instead, my year begins early in June with Atlas, bought five years ago on 'spec' from Hopleys in Hertfordshire. Atlas is tall and unscented, but its wonderfully plain white flowers have peaked while the rest of you are starting to notice your conventional forms. At the other extreme, another three weeks of orange blossom still stretch before those of you who bother to hunt it out. Among the breeders' forms, the latest is Innocence, a sweet and rather thin bush distinguished by flecks of cream on its green leaves. The latest, however, are two wild forms: Incarnus, which is scented like a hawthorn, and Insignis, which is better because its leaves are glossy. People who want a longer season should hunt them out from their few suppliers. Those who want a quiet life should bless the French and continue to opt for their superb creation, Belle Etoile. After years of experiment, I have reached the same conclusion: the public favourite is the best. Its flowers have a pink-purple centre and pointed petals, and the scent is beyond compare. If you want a double-flowered form as well, the best two are Virginal and the much scarcer Minnesota Snowflake, which looks like a snowstorm when its flowers bend the branches to the ground. In Britain, Virginal is the common one, notorious for doing the opposite and becoming bare at the bottom beneath its dark green leaves. Virginal, therefore, is the one variety which needs to be pruned hard from its early youth. Is there something smaller, scented and special? Yes, both in shape and also in the size of flower. Among the lower-growing varieties, Sybille is much the best of the various small forms which are now sold in Britain, although it spreads to about 6ft with age. Among the small double forms, the best is Frosty Moon. Together, they answer people who complain that their town gardens are too small for a proper, scented orange blossom. Among those with small flowers, there is one for people who say their garden is too dry and shaded to be worth much trouble. Under tall trees, early in June, you should try the oldest and sweetest of the varieties long known in Europe: plain old Coronarius, which has the stamina to put up with neglected life in drab, forgotten corners of London beyond the Thames. The flowers give a heavenly scent. Years ago, at school, the sight of these shrubs in summer reminded me of other, unregulated worlds. Remove them and high summer will not be the same, not just in those hours of direct sunlight when even a white flower glares under the impact, but during those late hours of garden prowling when the moon is coming up all orange and only the sweetest, palest and brightest show up. One big bush of Virginal can match the moon by twilight: even in this year, there is life without roses, and I doubt if our philadelphus has ever made better use of it.</p>

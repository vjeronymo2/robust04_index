The visit by Mahmud Muhammad, Egyptian minister of economy  and foreign trade, is meant to reinforce trade and economic  relations between Jordan and Egypt and to increase commercial  exchanges between the two fraternal countries.    [Begin Muhammad recording] We are here to sign, God willing,  a protocol after an agreement has been reached on the list of  Egyptian and Jordanian commodities. As I told you, the aim is  to reinforce and give momentum to commercial exchanges between  our two countries.    I also want to take this opportunity to say that, God  willing, I will have the honor of meeting with some officials in  this fraternal country to exchange views with them, benefit from  their experience, and inform them of our views on the Egyptian  experiment.    As you know, Egypt went through very successful stages of  economic transition and reform. It became a model for economic  reform. We hope that this operation will serve the Egyptian  people and upgrade the level of economic performance in Egypt.  [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

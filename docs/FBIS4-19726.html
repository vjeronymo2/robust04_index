			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sonia Purnell report: "MoD Loses Tanks In German </F> Withdrawal"]    [Text] A large amount of plastic explosive, detonators,  sub-machine guns and even, it is feared, tanks have been lost by  the Ministry of Defence during the withdrawal of British troops  and equipment from Germany, the National Audit Office said  yesterday.    The restructuring of the British Army of the Rhine under  Options for Change -- Britain's largest movement of troops and  equipment in modern times -- had descended into "chaos and  pandemonium," an audit office spokeswoman said.    In some units there had been a virtual breakdown of control,  with large numbers of dangerous and expensive items of equipment  unaccounted for.    Only four out of the 116 units shut down in Germany could  account for all their equipment, and in just one small survey  the audit office found that several vehicles were missing, one  for nearly three years, as well as 60lb of plastic explosive and  110 detonators.    The audit office warned that the taxpayer would lose much of  the expected "peace dividend" through write-offs for missing  items and other organisational problems.    The Ministry of Defence now expects to save only 35 million  pounds a year in the early stages of the withdrawal 24 million  pounds less than originally expected.    The National Audit Office described the losses as "very  worrying indeed'' and pointed to the "very slow progress" made  by the MoD in improving controls.    Army commanders at all levels have now been reminded of the  need for correct accounting procedures and for prompt action to  resolve any discrepancies. Inquiries are to be extended to  ammunition stores.    The audit office acknowleged the enormity of the task facing  the Army, which is having to move 13 billion items from 38  locations in Germany to 48 sites in the United Kingdom. By  1995, there will be 27,000 fewer Service personnel in Germany,  2,900 fewer armoured vehicles and 18,000 fewer non-armoured  vehicles.    Much of the withdrawal has been conducted during a time of  "unparalleled upheaval" with military operations both in the  Gulf and the former Yugoslavia.    Last year more than 5 million pounds was raised from sales  of  surplus equipment. But the audit office wants more vehicle  sales to be made in Germany, where prices are higher, and for  saleable vehicles to be cannibalised for parts only when this is  essential and cost-effective.</p>

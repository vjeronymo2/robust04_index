			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: PaineWebber reports record profits PAINEWEBBER, the US securities house, yesterday reported 1992 earnings 41 per cent higher at a record Dollars 213.2m, despite a decline in fourth-quarter profits. The drop in earnings during the final quarter to Dollars 41.2m, down from Dollars 46.9m in the same period of the previous year, disappointed investors, who marked down PaineWebber's stock price Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 24 3/8 before the close in New York. Revenues from investment banking fell 13 per cent to Dollars 85.5m, while income from principal trading slipped almost 4 per cent to Dollars 165.5m, primarily a reflection of less favourable conditions in the financial markets. At the same time, employee compensation and related expenses rose Dollars 14.3m to Dollars 347.6m. Other areas of PaineWebber's business, however, posted strong gains in the final quarter, including brokerage commissions, which rose 8.3 per cent to Dollars 205.8m, and asset mangement revenues, which jumped 21 per cent to Dollars 70.9m as more investors entrusted their funds with the company's fund managers. The modest downturn in the final quarter could not take the shine off a year which PaineWebber's chairman, Mr Donald Marron, described as 'outstanding'. Like the rest of Wall Street, the company reaped the benefits of buoyant stock markets, low interest rates, heavy inflows of investor funds into stocks, and record levels of corporate debt and equity issuance.</p>

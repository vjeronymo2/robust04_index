			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / EC ready to adopt freedom of information policy EC heads of government are set to agree US-style freedom of information policy at their summit in Copenhagen on June 21-22, as a cornerstone of the Community's attempt to restore its credibility with Europe's citizens. The move will make most EC documents available to the public on demand, except where their circulation might damage privacy, national security, relations with non-EC states, commercial confidentiality or monetary stability. Foreign ministers of the 12, meeting in Luxembourg, have agreed most of the essentials of this freedom of information policy, which overturns the current practice which makes all EC documents secret unless a Community institution or member state decides to distribute them. The 'openness' drive should be further reinforced next Wednesday, when the European Commission publishes details of a new information policy, intended to make Brussels more open to the public. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the commissioner in charge of opening up the decision-making process, said there was now broad agreement among his colleagues on the way forward. A central plank of Mr Pinheiro's reform is to make it obligatory for the Commission's information directorate - in a new and closer collaboration with the rest of the Brussels bureaucracy - to research and respond to public inquiries about EC policy, including policy-in-the-making. Access to working documents, which reveal the thinking of the Commission, is one of the most controversial parts of the plan, and is unlikely to be taken up by the Council of Ministers, where the 12 negotiate and decide on Commission draft laws. The Council, with its veil of secrecy still intact despite letting in television cameras to some formal sessions since February, is coming under strong pressure to change its ways. A meeting in Luxembourg on Monday night between the Commission, Council and the European Parliament degenerated into a row over the difference between confidentiality and secrecy. Parliamentary officials reject 'confidential' as too loose and subjective, and Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, said Brussels would draft a definition of 'secrecy', in an attempt to forge a consensus. The ostensible spark for the row was the rules of operation for the EC Ombudsman set up by the Maastricht treaty to investigate public complaints about maladministration by the Community. But it disclosed a fundamental split about how far member states are prepared to go on openness and accountability at EC level. The Danes and the Dutch are at one end of the spectrum, arguing for a full panoply of freedom of information rules and procedures, while the UK, on Monday night strongly backed by Germany, is vociferous in defending a minimalist interpretation of 'openness'. One result is that broadly agreed procedures for 'subsidiarity' - limiting action by the Community to those instances where national or regional action would be inadequate - are being held up, in an attempt to moderate British and German obduracy.</p>

			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: ANTELOPE VALLEY MOVES ITS GAME FROM UNLV TO APPEASE NCAA  </P> <P> Because of National Collegiate Athletic Assn. concern over the potential  unauthorized contact between prospective student-athletes and supporters of  Nevada Las Vegas, Antelope Valley College's Feb. 3 game against College of the  Desert will not be played at UNLV's Thomas and Mack Arena.  </P> <P> The game originally was scheduled to be played at Antelope Valley, but the  school's gym was already booked.  </P> <P> Both the men's and women's games will now be played at Paraclete High in  Lancaster.  </P> <P> The NCAA had expressed its concerns about the potential for recruiting  violations to Brad Rothermel, UNLV's athletic director. Rothermel passed the  word to Newton Chelette, the Antelope Valley coach and a former UNLV assistant.  A decision was reached that the game -- which would have been played after a  nationally televised game between the fifth-ranked Rebels and North Carolina  State -- would be moved.  </P> <P> Howard Blackwell, a multitalented tailback for Hart High, has made an oral  commitment to attend Oregon next fall.  </P> <P> Blackwell rushed for 1,217 yards in 169 carries, caught 44 passes for 777 yards  and scored 32 touchdowns while leading the Indians to the Foothill League title  and to the second round of the Southern Section Division III playoffs.  </P> <P> Tony Veney, an assistant track and field coach at Cal State Northridge, has  been named women's sprints and relays coach for the West team at the U. S.  Olympic Festival, July 20-26 in Minneapolis. Veney, who graduated from UCLA in  1975, is entering his seventh season as the sprints, hurdles and horizontal  jumps coach at Northridge.  </P> <P> The Dwarf Athletic Assn. of America will hold regional competition in swimming,  table tennis, basketball, field events and power lifting Jan. 25-26 at Cal  State Northridge. The event is open to any eligible athlete who wishes to  compete.  </P> <P> Information: 818-352-0336.  </P></p>

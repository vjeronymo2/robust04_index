Section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether States have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing the State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will allow both States and Tribes to apply for and receive approval of a partial permit program. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibility provided by part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal Criteria will apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLFs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of North Dakota applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005 of RCRA. EPA reviewed North Dakota's MSWLF application and made a tentative determination that all portions of the State's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. The State has revised the remainder of its permit program to assure complete compliance with the revised Federal Criteria and gain full program approval. North Dakota's application for full program adequacy is available for public review and comment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of people express interest in participating in a hearing by writing the Region or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing on the date given in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it decides to hold the hearing.
